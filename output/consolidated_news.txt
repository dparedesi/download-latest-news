We all know the importance of incorporating fresh produce into our diets, but getting high-quality fruits and vegetables from the grocery store has become a struggle for many people over the past few years. Across social media, shoppers complain about lower-quality produce and higher prices from both smaller regional grocery chains and big corporations alike. It would be reasonable to wonder whether U.S. quality standards have changed in recent years, as grocery chains seemingly show more red flags in the produce department, like mold, odors, and shriveled produce skin. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has a grading system for fruits and vegetables to ensure quality produce distribution, but the grades vary by type, making it hard to know what you're really getting from a particular USDA grade. And while many stores and chains use the same distributors and vendors, self-described employees and store owners report that some stores are willing to pay for first pick at the produce, meaning that by the time produce gets to less expensive stores that are unwilling or unable to pay to play, the fruits and veggies have been picked over, leaving only lowest quality options available. Although issues such as old, bruised fruits that lack flavor and vegetables on the verge of expiring or rotting seem to be a problem just about everywhere, some stores are worse than others. The following five grocery store chains, in particular, have produce departments you should skip altogether. While you may not think of Walmart primarily as a grocery chain, gone are the days when the store focused on general retail merchandise. Today, the majority of Walmart stores in the U.S. are either large Supercenters, with a huge array of produce, groceries, and other merchandise, or Neighborhood Markets, which emphasize groceries and produce over other products. While smaller discount stores with a focus on general merchandise still exist, they make up only 352 of what the conglomerate calls its total 5,206 retail units. With such a focus on groceries and fresh food, you'd think that Walmart would be a great place for produce. According to customers, that's not the case. Sure, it may be less expensive than produce at other stores, or convenient to get everything in one trip, but entire Reddit threads are dedicated to the quality of Walmart's produce (or lack thereof). Redditors cite a multitude of possible causes, ranging from staffing issues in the produce department to Walmart opting to purchase lower-quality produce from its vendors. Produce delivery orders are not immune to issues, either. In one Facebook post about Walmart grocery deliveries, customers complained of rotten, moldy produce. One wrote, "...the other day all my peppers were mushy, my cucumbers had mold, my fruit [wasn't] close to ripe, and some overripe to the point of liquid..." Other customers agreed, suggesting folks avoid the store's grocery options altogether, delivery or otherwise. Much smaller than the nationwide Walmart mega-corporation, Ingles Markets is prevalent in much of the Southeastern United States, particularly in rural areas. The first store opened in Asheville, North Carolina, in 1963, and the chain's sole distribution center and warehouse is still located just outside Asheville, within 250 miles of each of its more than 200 stores across Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. While a single distribution center and a relatively small footprint might lead you to expect higher-quality fresh produce, its customers have found quite the opposite. Many customers in the Asheville area, where there are approximately 20 stores within 10 miles of the city, express frustration that Ingles is the most ubiquitous grocery store in the area, particularly given the low quality of items like produce it carries. On the r/Asheville subreddit, whole threads are dedicated to the chain's issues, with users noting, "The produce quality is absolutely awful," and that the store sells "fruits and vegetables that have visibly gone bad." Others share that although they have to shop there for many items due to the dearth of other stores, "definitely not for produce or anything else fresh." Perhaps the worst thing about the store's produce is that the price doesn't reflect the quality. One Reddit user summed it up concisely, "And for this, Ingles expects you to be okay with Whole Foods prices." If you can, go somewhere else. Like Walmart, Target has begun focusing on its grocery department in an attempt to become a one-stop shop for customers. Unfortunately, its produce in particular isn't worth the supposed convenience, with customers online complaining about spoiled fruit and vegetables. If you're looking for even more convenience by ordering your Target groceries through a third-party app like Shipt, just know that those shoppers don't have access to produce that's any better than what you'd find in the store. As one Shipt shopper shared on Reddit, "Target produce is always crappy." Other shoppers agreed, citing strawberries, apples, avocados, and salads as some of the worst offenders. According to a former Target employee, staffing in the produce department is the issue. They shared, "A lot of times the cold goods that just arrived [were] prioritized to stock and the pallets were massive, so the other duties like making sure all the produce was up to date and fresh and throwing out the expired goods could often be missed or rushed." Luckily, Target's return policy extends to fresh produce, as long as you have your receipt and didn't purchase it through a third-party delivery service like DoorDash or Uber Eats. Still, if you have to return the produce you bought as part of your convenience shopping trip, it isn't all that convenient. You might be better off grabbing your produce elsewhere in the first place. We know, this one stings. Aldi super fans may be hesitant or unwilling to admit it, but Reddit says that Aldi's produce is the worst. Not only does Aldi have a limited selection of produce compared to many chain grocery stores, but the fruits and veggies are often not in the best shape. While it's possible to get fresh, vibrant produce at Aldi, customers note it's very hit-or-miss. Some online share stories about moldy fruit (especially berries), citrus fruit that doesn't taste like anything, and vegetables that are mushy, smelly, and rotten. Even if you do manage to find good-looking produce, there's a decent chance it will spoil relatively quickly. Some customers have even shared stories of otherwise perfectly good produce spoiling overnight in the fridge. The problem, it seems, may be similar to the one facing Walmart. While the store sells its produce for cheaper than other stores, that comes with a different kind of cost for consumers. According to an alleged employee on r/Aldi, the store doesn't buy the highest-grade produce; otherwise, prices would be higher. They noted, however, "We throw produce (and meat) twice a day, so if you want the best quality, try going right at opening or between 12-2 p.m." Although ACME Markets is another small, regional chain with stores in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and its native Pennsylvania, it operates under the umbrella of Albertsons Companies, one of the biggest food companies in the United States, which also operates chains like Shaw's, Star Market, and Safeway. Customers' online opinions of the produce department range from calling it "unreliable" and "severely lacking" to "nasty," "horrible," and "overpriced." Given that ACME is also one of the most overpriced grocery chains in America, it just doesn't make sense to do your produce shopping there. In response to a Reddit post asking why anyone shops there, one person noted the close proximity of ACME Markets compared to other stores. They revealed, "The nearest supermarket is an Acme. The next nearest supermarket is an Acme. The next next nearest supermarket is an Acme." Given the ubiquity of the chain, some people don't even realize how bad the store's produce is until they move to another area with more variety. So we're telling you now, go somewhere else for your fresh fruits and veggies.

Title: The first year of Trump 2.0
URL: https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/portfolio/big-story/the-first-year-of-trump-20/article70515498.ece
Time Published: 2026-01-17T16:12:49Z
Full Content:
+ 187.64 + 28.75 + 1.00 -43.00 -61.00 + 187.64 + 28.75 + 28.75 + 1.00 + 1.00 -43.00 As the world has its fingers crossed waiting for the verdict on tariffs from the US Supreme Court, the US President Donald Trump would complete his first year in office on Tuesday. It was an eventful year to put it mildly — the kind that puts twist-laden thrillers to shame. The Oval Office kept buzzing with one executive order after another — on tariffs, immigration, DOGE, oil drilling, brokering peace and big-bang investments in AI — that kept the entire world on edge. At this juncture, we take stock of how the US economy and markets performed in the first year of Trump 2.0 and look at how US equities are placed for the rest of his tenure. GDP Under Trump, the US economy got off to a rocky start with real GDP contracting by 0.6 per cent in Q1-2025. This is the first time the economy had contracted since declining 1 per cent in Q1-2022. However, in Q2 and Q3, the economy grew 3.8 per cent and 4.3 per cent. These figures are quarter on quarter, seasonally-adjusted annualised growth rates. In the US, personal consumption expenditure or PCE accounts for roughly 70 per cent of the GDP. Though PCE pulled its weight in Q2 and Q3, the real kicker came from a sharp decline in imports and good growth in exports, particularly services. Readers can recall that Trump’s reciprocal tariffs kicked in from April 2025. Trade balance While discussing tariffs, let us also address balance of payments (difference between exports and imports). Data is available for 2025 up to October. Trade deficit (goods and services) between January and October widened by $56 billion year on year or about 8 per cent. In the same period in 2024, trade deficit grew about 13 per cent. This is probably because the US didn’t import as much after reciprocal tariffs came into effect, while exports continued to grow (6.3 per cent). Focusing just on goods, between January and October, imports grew 6.7 per cent year on year and trade balance widened 8 per cent. As can be seen from the chart, imports were front-loaded during January-March and barely grew/ declined in the months after. Based on 2024 data, the European Union (19 per cent), Mexico (16 per cent), China (13 per cent) and Canada (13 per cent) made up 61 per cent of total import of goods and are the top exporters to the US. Imports from China were hit the most with a 26 per cent decline. Imports from the EU and Mexico grew 7 per cent and 6 per cent, while those from Canada declined 5 per cent. PMI Domestic manufacturing wasn’t robust either, going by the ISM PMI (Institute of Supply Management’s Purchasing Managers’ Index). Barring January and February, the index never crossed the 50-mark (see chart). A reading of over 50 indicates an expansion and vice-versa. This is a hit rate of 17 per cent (two out of 12 months) versus 86 per cent in Trump 1.0 (2020 has been excluded due to Covid). Inflation Now, onto whether tariffed imports caused higher inflation. Here, we are going with the PCE index, which the Federal Reserve (Fed) targets to keep under 2 per cent. Prices had risen 2.7 per cent in December 2024. Since then, the index marked a low of 2.3 per cent in April 2025. In the months that followed, the index has been steadily up, marking a rise of 2.8 per cent in September. This is the latest reading on the index. However, going with CPI, that index, too, marked a low of 2.3 per cent (in recent times) in April. Prices steadily rose in the months after, to 3 per cent in September, but have since cooled to 2.7 per cent in November and December. These could probably be the months when the Americans consumed imported goods that were tariffed at negotiated lower rates, considering shipping time. It doesn’t appear that tariffs have caused prices to shoot up dramatically. It remains to be seen whether the PCE index, too, will replicate this trajectory and sustain below 2 per cent. Jobs The year 2025 has been a tough one for job-seeking Americans, with ‘Big Tech’ and other corporate layoffs. Unemployment rate, at 4.1 per cent in December 2024, crept upward to 4.5 per cent in November 2025 – such a rate was last recorded only in October 2021. It improved marginally in December to 4.4 per cent. Going with non-farm payroll additions, 49,000 jobs per month, on an average, were added in 2025, compared with a mean of 141,000 in the eight years between 2017 and 2024 (Trump 1.0 + Joe Biden’s term). This period is considered as it nullifies the job losses during the pandemic and the hiring spree that followed. June, August, October even saw a month-on-month decline in payroll. This is a phenomenon last observed only in December 2020. Macros in short: Consumption has done okay, although it needs to be noted that this is driven by a K-shaped economy. Imports have declined, jobs are in poor state and prices are uncertain to decline sustainably. S&P 500 in the first year of Presidents Before we move on to markets, here’s a fun stat. We compared how S&P 500 performed in the first year of Presidents — over 50 years, in the last 14 terms, starting from when Gerald Ford took over after Richard Nixon resigned (see Table 1). Trump 2.0 (2025) falls in the bottom half at the eighth position, with 2017 under Trump 1.0 the third best. With the mean of the sample at 11 per cent, 2025 is still above average. How asset classes fared US equities have given good returns. S&P 500, Dow Jones and the Nasdaq Composite have delivered 16 per cent, 14 per cent and 20 per cent, since January 20, 2025 (inauguration day) till date. While S&P 500 returned 16 per cent, its EPS grew just 12.5 per cent. Sector-wise performance of S&P 500 constituents has been given in Table 3. All sectors posted earnings growth, except for energy, while heavy-weight IT’s profit grew 26 per cent. The market cap of the Mag7 stocks expanded 20 per cent in aggregate, with their earnings growing 26 per cent (comparing 2024 earnings with estimated earnings for 2025, which is the sum of actual earnings up to Q3 2025 and consensus estimates for Q4 2025). Stocks excluding the Mag7 (S&P 493) have delivered 14 per cent returns for a 11 per cent rise in earnings. Within the Mag7, except Alphabet and Nvidia, the rest delivered modest returns between 1 per cent and 9 per cent. Alphabet and Nvidia returned 65 per cent and 34 per cent. Globally, equity indices have fared better than their US counterparts. Korean KOSPI and the Japanese Nikkei 225 indices stand out with returns of 92 per cent and 40 per cent, while Hong Kong-based Hang Seng rose 37 per cent. Indices in Europe — DAX, FTSE 100 and Euro Stoxx 50 delivered between 17 per cent and 20 per cent. This trend can also be observed in how currencies have moved in the comparable period. The dollar index (DXY) recorded one of its worst years in history (9th worst), falling 9.3 per cent. The Euro, GBP and Yuan gained 13 per cent, 10 per cent and 5 per cent respectively, while DXY fell 9 per cent. Tariffs-caused volatility, a falling dollar against the backdrop of a 20+ per cent correction in crude prices partly meant indices in Europe and China fared better. The falling dollar is also one reason why gold and silver gave stellar returns ($ terms) of 70 per cent and 197 per cent. On to the debt market now. Debt ETFs gave good returns. BlackRock’s iShares ETFs are presented in the table as representatives. Trump came to power when bond yields had spiked from the lows of September 2024, after the Fed started cutting rates, on fears that the rate cuts were premature. Through 2025, although yields have cooled, they have remained high and stubbornly above 4 per cent. What is noteworthy is that yields at the longer end of the curve have held up more (see chart). This could well be because of the lack of clarity as to whether inflation can be tamed and sustained under the Fed’s target range. If anyone was as excited about striking ‘deals’ after Trump, it should be the ‘tech bros’ of Silicon Valley, with their big-bang AI deals, often among themselves. The $500-billion Stargate project where OpenAI and Oracle are parties, Nvidia’s planned $100-billion investment in Open AI and the US government’s purchase of a 10-per cent stake in Intel for over $10 billion come to mind. The year also saw AI start-ups such as Anthropic, Perplexity and OpenAI raise millions of dollars at exorbitant valuations. With the economic use-cases for AI still only evolving, it appears as if the line between optimism and delusion have blurred on Wall Street. Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Oracle and Meta are estimated to invest about $1.1 trillion in capex over 2025 and 2026. Applying a fixed asset turnover ratio of 2x implies an expected incremental revenue of $2.2 trillion which is 1.3x the current revenue of these five giants ($1.6 trillion) - such a revenue growth is highly unlikely To be fair, market did get jittery about AI stocks late in the year. However, even after steep corrections, stocks such as Oracle have still given good returns over the year and are yet valued at a premium to their five-year mean earnings multiples (see Table 4). For some, current valuations are baking in very high earnings growth expectations, anywhere between 50-130 per cent, over the next 12 months. For Mag7 stocks such as Alphabet and Meta, the cash cow of ad revenue has to fire to support capital investments in AI – and such revenue is tied to sustainability of strong consumption, especially on a high base. The combined market cap of top AI stocks is now over 42 per cent of S&P 500’s full market cap, and the combined earnings are over 30 per cent of the combined earnings of all S&P 500 stocks. Clearly, a lot is riding on the AI wave. In 2026, either AI clicks or the stocks fold. The past year has been a strange one where all asset classes performed well — equities, real assets and debt. Such scenarios don’t last long, and the near future could prove investors in one or more asset classes wrong. For now, that asset class could be US equities. The S&P 500 trades at a P/E ratio of 28x, building in an estimated earnings growth of 16 per cent over the next 12 months. As can be seen from the chart, the index is now trading at valuations above sub-prime peak levels and at similar multiples as the dotcom bubble. While robust AI-led earnings growth is not a given at this stage, rerating in equities can be even challenging – with yields at the longer end not giving in. While the bullish views on the AI trade and consequently the US markets is now well known, it would be worth taking note of an interesting point brought out by long-term fund manager Dr John Hussman. He was prescient in his bearish calls, just ahead of the peak of the dotcom bubble and the 2007 housing bubble. While his bearish views over the last few years have not played out, he makes an interesting point for investors to ponder. He points out that corporate profits (surplus) have reached record levels and this has been made possible by the deficit/ debt of the other two sectors – namely, households and government. While household and government debt has grown to exorbitant levels, equities’ valuations are still factoring in record surpluses of corporates to sustain, ignoring events such as credit defaults. If such events unfold, equity bulls could be caught napping. Recent tremors in the US private credit market must not be ignored. In other words, sustained good returns in US equities would require continued increase in government deficit. His view: Even taking the sectoral deficit/surplus structure as durable, I expect we’ll see market losses, both in the S&P 500 and in the technology sector, on the order of -50 per cent to -70 per cent over the completion of this cycle. While Trump takes pride in record stock market levels, the real test will be in 2026, as brewing affordability crisis undermines macro-economic numbers, cracks emerge on the AI trade, tariff impacts deepen, showdown with the Fed heats up and geopolitics is at its toughest in decades. All this must be offset by an AI miracle to justify the current S&P 500 valuation. Published on January 17, 2026 Copyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Billionaire investor George Soros has opened hundreds of millions of dollars in new positions in mega-cap stocks, including Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN). A new 13F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) shows Soros Fund Management bought more than 1.843 million shares of Amazon worth $404.808 million in Q3 of 2025. The data also shows that the company holds $488.803 million worth of AMZN shares as of the third quarter of 2025, representing a 482% increase from the firm’s Q2 ownership. Soros Fund Management also accumulated 328,605 in Apple shares worth $84.718 million in Q3 of last year. The private investment firm now holds $89.053 million in AAPL, marking a staggering 1,954% rise on a quarter-over-quarter basis. And the firm snapped up 631,397 shares of Alphabet (GOOGL) valued at $155.297 million in Q3 2025.

Title: ICYMI: the week's 7 biggest tech stories like Apple losing to Google, and Meta giving up on VR

Here's your firmware update for January 16, 2026 When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. This week, Meta turned its back on VR, and Apple caved to Google in its hunt for an AI update for Siri. To catch up on these and the other seven biggest tech news stories of the week, scroll down to see our recaps of the big things that happened. When you're done, check out the seven new movies and TV shows to watch this weekend. It hasn’t been a great time for drone fans in the US, with the FCC recently banning the sale of new, foreign-made drones – and a separate proposal from the US Department of Commerce taking aim at all Chinese drone imports (including existing models that have already been launched). Well, fortunately, a U-turn from the latter has removed that particular restriction from the equation for now. That means that stock of previously approved drones like the DJI Mavic 3 Pro and the Antigravity A1 can still be legally imported into the US. Still, with the FCC effectively banning the sale of foreign-made drones that it hasn’t approved (in other words, all new models), the future still looks bleak for Stateside drone fans. We got our first look at Sophie Turner as filming on Amazon’s Tomb Raider TV show begins, and the recreation of the character’s iconic video game look is perfect, highlighting to fans of the games how seriously Amazon is taking this adaptation. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Obviously, this is just a still of Turner in her costume, but she is undeniably Lara Croft in it, and if similar care and attention has been paid to the rest of the cast (which includes Jason Isaacs, Sigourney Weaver, and Martin Bobb-Semple, among others) as well as the show’s story, we could be in for a real treat. No release date has been given yet, but we can’t rule out a mid- to late 2026 launch. Over the past few weeks, Spotify Premium subscribers have been encountering AI-generated music recommendations in their Discover Weekly and Release Radar playlists, prompting the music platform to introduce labels to identify AI-generated music in a monster Reddit thread. According to users who have experienced this, the issue with AI music on Spotify is only getting worse; the problem doesn’t lie with AI music itself, but with the deception on Spotify’s part, which is what’s getting under people’s skin. This has led many paying users to think it’s part of a wider, secret business plan and that Spotify is deliberately doing this to avoid paying artists further. In other news, Spotify has also raised subscription prices for US members, affecting all tiers. It marks the third price increase since 2023, which many people are attributing to the maintenance of Spotify Lossless. This week, Meta seemed to give up on VR as it slashed Reality Labs jobs, including closing down several VR game studios, and ending updates for the excellent VR fitness platform Supernatural. The news is a tragedy for fans of the Meta Quest system as it suggests Meta’s future support for its headsets will be at least a little lackluster, and Hamish Hector argued that, as things stand, he’s only interested in the Steam Frame. It’s no secret Reality Labs has been hemorrhaging funds for some time, but this major about-turn from Meta might lead some to wonder if you can trust the company not to change course again if its new AI glasses focus starts to go awry. Google has just dropped "Personal Intelligence" for Gemini, and it might be the most significant leap for AI assistants yet. This upgrade allows Gemini to securely tap into your personal Google ecosystem (Gmail, Photos, Search, and YouTube) to provide deep, individualized context for your queries. The capabilities are genuinely impressive: imagine Gemini diagnosing a car issue by checking your Gmail purchase history for the model, scanning your Photos for service records, and pulling DIY solutions from YouTube. It’s the "true" AI assistant we’ve been waiting for. Interestingly, given the newly announced Apple-Google AI partnership, this looks like a sneak peek at how the next-gen Siri might function in iOS 27. Apple got served a huge slice of humble pie this week, as it conceded Ai supremacy to Google announcing that Siri’ s next-gen version will be backed by Gemini. A lot of questions remain, but in a joint statement Apple and Google revealed “These [Gemini] models will help power future Apple Intelligence features, including a more personalized Siri coming this year.”Apple first unveiled its plans to launch an AI-upgraded Siri during WWDC 2024 but almost two years later we’re still waiting for the upgrade. The company has since promised a Spring 2026 launch, and with Google Gemini it might finally make that happen. Well, we have officially had the first major outage of 2026, and it was a massive, nearly 8-hour outage that took out Verizon's cell service for customers across the United States on January 14, 2026. You can see our full reporting in the live blog linked below, but it was a serious, hours-long event that saw folks with Verizon swap 5G and network bars for SOS with no access to voice, text, and data across much of the country. Down Detector reports swelled around 12:30 PM ET, with Verizon confirming the issue at 1 PM, but many folks did not see any signs of recovery until closer to 8 PM ET that evening. The carrier didn't have the best communication during the event, with only a few statements that came hours apart. The day after the outage, Verizon confirmed each account would receive a single $20 credit, which, simply put, many customers were not pleased with. The carrier also confirmed to TechRadar that it was a software issue tied to a cyber incident.

Title: Malachy Clerkin: The All-Ireland club finals are precious because they are unique
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/gaelic-games/2026/01/17/malachy-clerkin-the-all-ireland-club-finals-are-precious-because-they-are-unique/
Time Published: 2026-01-17T06:00:01Z
Full Content:
By far the best thing about the club finals is that they’re always unique. The mix always changes and the novelty always keeps the recipe fresh. Big clubs, small clubs, city clubs, parish clubs. Clubs that set out at the start of the year to win the All-Ireland, clubs that weren’t sure last summer if they had the beating of the hoors five miles out the road. On this weekend last year, Na Fianna supporters marched en masse from the closest club to Croke Park to take their seats for their day of days. The walk took no more than 15 minutes, assuming you didn’t get waylaid in Fagan’s halfway down. This time around, Dingle supporters have, if they’re lucky, a nine-hour round trip to make to HQ and back. With traffic, food and pit-stops, it’s probably closer to 11. Two more different clubs you couldn’t fathom. Club finals day makes kings of everyone, regardless. Dingle, from the farthest reaches of the Kerry coast. St Brigid’s from Kiltoom, a sort of sleeper parish on the Roscommon side of Athlone. Loughrea, from deep in Galway hurling country. Ballygunner, on the edge of Waterford city – or maybe that should be Waterford City on the edge of Ballygunner. That’s the foursome for 2025/26 and, like every foursome that has gone before it, it’s unique. This Sunday will see the 55th All-Ireland club hurling final followed by the 55th club football final and in all those years down through a half-century and more, never once has a line-up been duplicated. Plenty of clubs have made it back to Croke Park, some of them in alarmingly short order. But the same four teams have never shared a bill twice. Mostly, this is because repeat fixtures are so rare in either code. Ballyhale have played in more deciders than any other club in hurling or football. Yet in their 11 All-Ireland finals, they have met 11 different opponents. Same goes for Crossmaglen – seven football finals, seven different teams waiting on them when they got there. It does happen occasionally that clubs in the middle of a glorious run find their way back to meet each other. Nemo Rangers played Crossmolina in the 2001 and 2003 finals. In hurling, Birr and Dunloy ran into each other in the final twice in eight years, in 1995 and 2003. Close, but no cigar. Nemo also played two football finals against St Vincents, albeit they were a generation (or three) apart, in 2008 and 1973. And way back when, Blackrock of Cork and St Anne’s of Wexford faced off twice in three years for hurling finals in the early 1970s. But getting the two sides of the house to match up at the same time is all but impossible. There’s never been three clubs on the same bill twice, never mind four. The point is, there’s a recurrent magic to the club finals that is based solely on the fact that this day will almost certainly never happen again. The people of Dingle, Kiltoom, Ballygunner and Loughrea have never descended en masse to Croke Park before and the odds are minuscule that they ever will again. It all adds to the one-off feeling of it all. Down through the decades, 52 different hurling clubs have played in a final, while Dingle are the 54th football club to make it to the dance. In hurling, 28 clubs have been to one final in their history and have never made it back. In football, that number is 29. You better do it this weekend because it’s just so unlikely you’ll ever get the chance again. Little wonder, then, that Loughrea spent time and energy this week successfully appealing Cullen Killeen’s suspension. The Galway club knew two things. One, their only appearance in an All-Ireland final was 19 years ago. Two, Killeen is 19-years-old. This is literally a once-in-a-lifetime game so if there was a way to get him a place in it, they were duty-bound to try and find it. Denis Walsh: The GAA community has no stomach for strict enforcement of rules https://t.co/afv6wIo30s That’s the thing about the club finals. When they’re over, you slide all the way back to the bottom of the board. Neither of last year’s football finalists made it as far as their own county final this time around. Both hurling finalists won their county title but neither survived their first match in the provincial championships. So much has to fall into place for the journey to stay alive all the way to Croke Park. And so, each club lands into the club finals this weekend telling themselves stories that feel entirely their own but which are all really just versions of the same yarn. Here’s St Brigid’s, hellbent on avenging their last-kick defeat of 2024. Here’s Ballygunner, trying to replicate their last-puck win in their only final appearance in 2022. Here’s Loughrea, riding the wave of their first ever back-to-back Galway titles. Here’s Dingle, first-time winners of Munster, first-time All-Ireland finalists. Early on Friday, a clip did the rounds of a news report from 7News in Australia. It showed three of Mark O’Connor’s Geelong teammates pulling wheelie cases through Melbourne airport, on their way to Dublin to see if Dingle can win the All-Ireland club final. A trio of premiership Cats is jetting off to the other side of the globe to watch a teammate chase a lifelong dream. It's reignited calls for the return of the International Rules Series. @cleary_mitch @7AFL pic.twitter.com/WYmEaLbGb4 O’Connor’s just-one-more-boss journey through this club season has been such a glorious story, a poem to the power of love and roots and home. The unique pull of the club finals in action. A precious, precious thing.

Title: 25 ways to get off your screens: from analogue kits to freedom phones
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/life-style/people/2026/01/17/offline-activities-for-2026/
Time Published: 2026-01-17T06:00:00Z

Somewhat ironically, 2026 has been declared by online influencers as the year people will move their lives offline. Videos of people assembling “analogue bags” – essentially holdalls of entertainment to keep boredom at bay – have gone viral on Instagram and TikTok. People are swapping Spotify for radio, Kindles for books, and phone cameras for film. But behind the buzz is a widespread, real-world desire to return to a time before smartphones absorbed hours of every single day, before they were an extension of our bodies. There is a growing sentiment now that the way to thrive in our high-tech world is by living a low-tech life. Social media’s original promise was to enhance our lives and build community, to connect us with other people. Yet research shows the more time people spend on these platforms, the more likely they are to feel depressed and lonely. Australia’s recent ban on under-16s using social media platforms was a world-first policy designed to protect children from harm. It’s not only social media we are giving so much of our downtime to, but online shopping, gaming and random videos of random things. The internet is a never-ending supply of content, and more than 50 per cent of it is now AI generated. It can absorb so much of our attention that we can easily forget just how exciting life can be beyond our little screens. So lock away your phone, log out of Netflix and find inspiration in the ideas below to feed the mind, body and soul. Set yourself up by buying or borrowing a few items that will reduce the practical role of a smartphone in your life. Your lifestyle might require different things, but a good place to start is an alarm clock, so you can keep your phone out of your bedroom; a watch, so you can check the time without checking your phone; and a notebook, so you can jot things down to act on when you’re ready. Most things are a lot less urgent than they seem when the option to respond or act immediately isn’t there. The necessity of emails, maps and internet banking is enough to prevent many of us from making a permanent switch to a “dumb phone” that can’t connect to the internet. There are workarounds, such as removing all non-essential apps from your phone or installing controls to limit screen time. Another option is to procure an old phone, one that doesn’t have internet capabilities,. There are lots of options available for under €50, and you can get a pay-as-you-go SIM. Give the phone number to the people in your life who might need you in an emergency, or who you could call in one. Think of it as your freedom phone, the one in your pocket when you go hiking, or at the bottom of your bag when you go out with friends and just want to see where the day takes you, or when you’re cosied up at home and need a few hours or days of being entirely present with yourself and the people around you. [ No Instagram, Netflix or YouTube: Can I survive a four-week digital detox?Opens in new window ] Technology was supposed to streamline our lives, yet somehow it feels more complicated than ever. We stream music and movies, download books and save thousands of images in the cloud. But do we really own any of these things? If the internet went down, would you have anything to show for years of honing your tastes, curating and collecting? Is there a case for owning actual books, for printing out favourite photos, for finding an old Discman and listening to an album all the way through? The secret to getting back into reading is reading purely for pleasure. Page-turners, characters that stay with you, fiction or non-fiction that is so compelling you bring the book with you wherever you go. Conventionally seen as a solitary way to experience the world, reading can also be a social pursuit. “We have found that community and friendship flourish when phones are put away,” says Maeve O’Brien, co-founder of Silent Book Club Dublin, where people gather once a month in Mish Mash Café on Capel Street to read together. “While it can sometimes be difficult not to check your screen for an hour or two, we have found people start to crave it.” Taking photos with a dedicated camera rather than a phone camera might seem cumbersome, but it offers something different: a chance to slow down, look, engage and create. “Using a ‘real’ camera invites you into a more mindful, observational space where you’re not just capturing life but composing a story and creating art,” says Andrea Hunt, a photographer and tutor with the Dublin Photography School. “Many people are drawn to film photography out of curiosity or a sense of nostalgia. What often keeps them there, then, is the slower, more thoughtful way of working that it encourages. You begin to trust your eye, your understanding of light, and your own patience.” Ditch the notion that board games are only for the festive season, and instead embrace them as part of everyday life, as they have been for thousands of years, from ancient Egypt to ancient Rome. Nine Men’s Morris, a strategic board game, was so beloved by the 13th-century monks on retreat at Glendalough that it was found scratched into a flat piece of slate at the remote Temple-na-Skellig church, which is accessible only by boat. Today, charity shops are often a treasure trove for picking up a nostalgic family classic or discovering a new niche favourite. In an era where you can stream or rent almost any film instantly, going to see a movie on the silver screen retains a certain romantic quality. Cinema’s history in Ireland is storied; James Joyce first introduced cinema to Ireland in 1909 with the Volta Cinematograph Theatre on Dublin’s Mary Street. It was a short-lived venture for the writer, as Dubliners had a fairly muted reaction to his programme of European cinema. Alongside blockbuster cinemas, there are some beautiful independent options around the country with diverse programmes. Consider Dunamaise Arts Centre in Co Laois, The Dot Cinema, a tiny private cinema in Dublin 2, or Triskel Arts Centre in Cork. [ Top travel: the hottest destinations to visit in 2026Opens in new window ] Stitching, knitting, pottery throwing, printing – all manner of arts and crafts offer a chance to create rather than consume, to use your hands for flair and individuality. There is no need for perfection in the end product, but the very making and doing provides an antidote to the passive viewing of algorithmically curated content. “The tactile nature of embroidery makes it such a detox from scrolling,” says Alice Cummins, an embroiderer and tutor of the craft. “The repetitive motion of the needle and thread coming through the fabric. The “in-out-in-out” is almost like meditating. Obviously, you also get a beautiful piece of art out of it, too, but I think most people I know who stitch do it more for the process than the finished product.” One of the hooks that keeps many of us on social media is the promise of connection, with friends, strangers and potential work opportunities. Yet the number of hours spent scrolling in solitude versus the moments of actual fruitful connection does not work in our favour. Instead, try going to one in-person event a month – a talk, a lecture, a concert – and speaking to three people there. It’s fertile ground for real-world connections, based on shared experiences and interests. Learning a new language is arguably one of the most complex mental activities humans can do, but the rewards are great. It has been shown to boost memory, concentration and creativity, as well as improve communication skills and empathy. A recent study published in Nature Aging found that speaking multiple languages can slow brain ageing, the gradual decline in brain processing speed, attention and other cognitive functions. Immersion in the language is the way to maximise these benefits, so stay away from language apps on your phone. Try looking for an in-person class, or if you have a little Irish there’s likely a ciorcal comhrá, an Irish-language conversation group, in your area. As the saying goes, “Is fearr Gaeilge bhriste ná Béarla cliste”. [ Sí, oui, ja!

Fynn Cook, who owns the off-grid Sauna Shack in Co Tyrone, says he often hears phones pinging away in the changing space. “For once, those notifications don’t matter and can be ignored until later.” Without screens or distractions to take people out of the experience, saunas can become micro hubs of connection. “There is something about sharing conversations in a sauna that opens people up, allowing vulnerability and talking openly,” says Cook. [ Nude saunas in Ireland: ‘I realise I will soon be naked among these strangers’Opens in new window ] You don’t have to believe in a doomsday scenario to think it might be worthwhile to know how to look after yourself in the wild with no Google or ChatGPT to ask for help. There are overnight courses around Ireland where you can learn how to make fire from a spark using things such as birch bark, lichen or sap, how to sterilise stream water for drinking, and how to build a shelter. “It’s important for people to have these skills,” says Nathan Kingerlee, who runs Outdoors Ireland’s bushcraft and survival courses in Glengarriff, Co Cork. “Whether it’s for the simple enjoyment and therapeutic value of being able to head outdoors and sit beside your campfire listening to birdsong. Or the ability to survive off-grid for even a week, say in the event of a longer-term power cut or disaster, knowing you can also help and look after those around you.” Growing your own vegetables is a no-brainer if you have any space. It is cost-effective and fosters a deep appreciation of food and connection to the earth. “Any activity that forces you to be out in nature is going to have a positive impact on your mental health,” says Fergus Finlay, from Abercorn Farm in Greystones, Co Wicklow. Abercorn offers day-long courses on how to grow your own vegetables at home. “In a world of instant gratification, growing plants and vegetables is the complete opposite. It takes time, patience and care,” says Finlay. “It forces you to be fully focused on the now and what’s happening in front of you.” Go on a walk without a phone, a watch or music. Gen Z calls this absence of distraction “rawdogging”, and it’s seen as a test of endurance. It doesn’t need to be a punishment, though; it can be a time to connect to your natural surroundings. You could take note of the trees around you, see how many you can identify, and which ones mystify. Maybe learn a new one each day, so that nature is no longer one green and brown blur, but trees you know by name. Niall Mac Coitir’s book Ireland’s Trees: Myths, Legends and Folklore is the perfect accompaniment. Running as a sport is booming, with record numbers signing up for the 2026 Dublin and Cork city marathons. It’s cheap, accessible and delivers a boost of happy hormones as a reward for your efforts. Run alone or join one of the many run clubs around the country, like the Run for Palestine run club, which does a 5km loop every Sunday morning in Dublin. “The pace is very inclusive, enabling runners of all ages and abilities to come along,” says Ola Løkken Nordrum, who founded the group in 2024. “I’ve met so many brave, warm and inspirational people. It has become a space where people can come together and find strength in one another.” Somehow, cooking blogs have become part of the “enshittification” of the internet, the degradation of the online environment. Recipe websites are often so cluttered with ads and pop-ups that you’re constantly scrolling up and down. Cooking a recipe from a cookbook, on the other hand, can bring “comfort and relaxation”, says chef and bestselling author Cherie Denham. “A cookbook comes with heart and soul; a recipe from a Google search does not. I find they bring great comfort and relaxation, particularly at night-time. When I leaf through those pages, and gaze at those photos and read introductions to the recipes, it brings me to a happy place that a computer simply can’t.” [ ‘Stop saying yes’: Over 50 ways you can make your life easier in 2026Opens in new window ] There are just a few environments left in this world that are completely inhospitable to phones. Swimming pools are one of them. For child protection, phones, tablets and any device capable of photography are typically prohibited poolside. In the water, whether you’re floating, paddling or doing laps, there is total freedom from technology and from the outside world. Being in water is a chance to reset and recalibrate. Wild swimming has a similar appeal, a silky, salty release that is hard to find elsewhere. As Bonnie Tsui, the author of Why We Swim, observes, “You don’t have to be a great swimmer to appreciate the benefits of sensory solitude and the equilibrium the water can bring.” “Digital detox”, offgrid stays are on the rise, offering the opportunity for a real break and a real rest. In south Donegal, Lough Mardal Eco Lodge is one such tech and gadget-free zone. On entering, guests leave their devices in lockboxes in the lobby and “find themselves chatting to one another, rather than disappearing into their screens”, says Clare Tindal, who owns and runs Lough Mardal with her husband Marcus Tindal. “The natural environment draws us out of ourselves. You will feel your shoulders drop, your mind declutter and ultimately the immense relief to have separated yourself from your tech devices and their shallow stimulations.” Any practice where you give all of your attention to a single object or activity is a form of meditation. Research has shown that listening to live music during meditation may help focus an active mind, decrease heart rate, anxiety and pain, and guide you to a deeper relaxation. Taking all of this into account, musician Danny Forde created his piano meditation offering. He chooses cosy places in beautiful natural surroundings to play piano for groups, who can lie down and rest. “I like to call it ‘pure listening’, where you practice staying with each note as it’s played, without analysis or judgment,” Forde says. Improvised and beautiful, it is a soothing lullaby in a manic world and can be replicated at home with a CD or RTÉ’s LyricFM. The Artist’s Way is a cult book cum self-help course, passed between friends and creatives for three decades. Written by Julia Cameron, it has been credited by celebrities including Elizabeth Gilbert, Alicia Keys and Reese Witherspoon, alongside millions of others, for helping them rediscover and embrace their individual creative spark. Alongside different weekly exercises, Cameron asks that the first thing you do each morning on waking is write out three pages longhand. These are called Morning Pages. They are private, not to be shown to anyone. “There is no wrong way to do Morning Pages,” Cameron writes in The Artist’s Way, meaning you can write anything you like, nothing is too petty, too banal or too ambitious. It’s a way to start the day fresh, and although Cameron introduced the practice decades before the first smartphone, it can seamlessly replace the morning scroll. Music feeds our soul, and picking up a new instrument or rediscovering one long cast aside can be an entirely absorbing activity and open up many new doors. Rionach O’Callaghan, a retired teacher who took up the ukulele through a term of night classes in Blackrock Further Education in Dublin after the pandemic, says it lifts her spirits being able to play music in a group. “My youngest son played the ukulele when he was very small, and l always thought it sounded like a happy instrument. I played the piano in my youth, but l wanted to play an instrument that was portable and fun. Ukulele is both of these things. Playing it with a group lifts my spirits, and l try never to miss our weekly sessions or the parties.” Our time is the most valuable resource we have, so why not donate it and make a difference? The National Volunteering Database has thousands of varied opportunities across the country to get involved in, depending on your interests. There’s openings to plant native Irish trees with ReWild Wicklow, write letters to people in nursing homes, volunteer at Dublin Zoo, take part in a beach clean-up, become a court and forensic accompaniment volunteer, a driver for autism assistance dogs, or to join the Pachamama project to sew reusable period pads for girls in developing countries so they can stay in school or work. The pull of free-diving, where you dive in open water without oxygen, for many people is the opportunity for silence, to look inside yourself. It may sound extreme, but it’s building a following among swimmers and non-swimmers in Ireland. “It’s like you’re grounded and limitless at the same time,” says Julia Guziuk, who runs Freediving Aran off Inis Mór. “It’s meditation wrapped in adventure, a quiet space where the only ‘noise’ is your own mind and learning to soften that is very powerful.” Divers here can see cliff walls, kelp forests, soft corals, jellyfish and dolphins in this private slice of the Atlantic, which has depths of 20 to 30 metres for beginners to more experienced freedivers. There are more than 450 species of birds on Birdwatch Ireland’s list, and many are rare or unusual or migratory birds. Learning to identify even our most common garden birds deepens every experience of being outside. Hang a bird feeder in your garden or attach a suction feeder to your window and watch the birds come. If you want to level up your twitching, Birdwatch Ireland runs a citizen science survey open to everyone between December and February. By taking part, you can help provide information on how bird populations fare during the harsh winter months each year. One way to put pinging notifications into perspective is to look up, as far as the eye can see and farther still. Stars, planets and the mysteries of the cosmos can make the screens we spend so much time staring into seem dull. Ireland was once a leader in astronomical research, and for seven decades between 1845 and 1914, the observatory at Birr, Co Offaly, had the largest telescope in the world. Birr’s giant “Leviathan” telescope is no longer operational, but there are opportunities to stargaze through super-powerful telescopes at Ireland’s two other historical astronomical observatories at Dunsink Observatory, Dublin and Armagh Observatory, Armagh. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

I spotted this very colourful fly in a garden centre outside Gorey some time ago. Have you any idea what it is? Michael Wade, Co Wexford This is the noonday fly – Mesembrina meridiana – which is most often seen on cow dung, sunbathing on trees, fences and walls in bright sunlight, or visiting flowers to feed on nectar. Eggs are laid in cow dung; the female lays a single egg in up to five cow pats. When they hatch the larvae are carnivorous and feed on other fly larvae within the dung. The female lays up to five eggs in a lifetime, each one in a different pat, at two-day intervals. Ruby (5), Robin (3) and Rossa (1) spotted this unusual looking fungus on a tree in Slieve Gullion Forest while visiting to give Robin’s dodies to the fairies. Robin bravely left her dodies behind, but we were wondering, what is it called and is this a fungus? Ruby, Robin and Rossa Dunworth, Blackrock, Co Louth The fairies may indeed prefer the dodies to this fungus, which is now called jelly ear or wood ear, although the Latin name Auricularia auricula-judae, remains unchanged. The ear-like fruit bodies, up to 9cm across, are tough and gelatinous when young but hard and brittle when dry and old. Larger specimens may have vein-like wrinkles on their surface, making them even more ear-like. The fungus grows on decaying wood of deciduous trees and shrubs but is most usually found on elder trees. It is widespread and common. I got off my bike to take a photo of a cormorant drying off beside the canal at Robert Emmet Bridge, Harold’s Cross. The canal is not perfectly clean but there are regular group clean-ups which help with the water quality. Róisin Sheerin, Dublin It’s hard to take a photo while riding a bike right enough. The Grand Canal has visual litter such as plastics, etc, but the water quality is good. There is enough dissolved oxygen in the water for invertebrates to thrive. These in turn are food for the fish, which are a main part of this cormorant’s diet. It used to be thought that the cormorant was drying its wings when it adopted this pose – even though it might actually be raining at the time – and the cormorant promptly dived back into the water after a short period, getting wet all over again. It is now thought that holding out their wings like this helps them to digest their recently swallowed prey. Our late friend, Mary Shackleton, gave me a present of this tree, which I suspect is unusual. It is now five metres tall and slender stemmed. What is it, please? JC Colgan, Leixlip, Co Kildare It is a poplar, a species of deciduous tree characterised by having long-stalked leaves which tremble in the slightest breeze, thus giving rise to its Irish name – an Crann creathach. This is not the native species Populus tremula (the aspen), however, which has round-toothed leaves. The leaves look more like those of the Black Italian poplar. Only males of this species are known, so see what kind of catkins grow on the tree in due course. We found this bug on the roof of our garage. We wondered, is it a kind of ladybird or another beetle? Emily (12) and Zachary (9) Freedman, Dublin Bugs are listening devices, or germs that give you the flu (unless you are speaking American). This insect is a very young adult seven-spot ladybird just recently emerged from its pupal stage. It emerges yellow and without the spots, which will appear within half a day.

Title: ‘They’ve pickled each others’ brains’

Longtime entrepreneur and critic Anil Dash on where the tech industry has been and where it may be going 2:00 PM PST on January 14, 2026 Tech entrepreneur and writer Anil Dash. Photo: Anil Dash Advertisement opens in a new tab. These are tough times for tech workers. Half-a-million tech workers lost their jobs in 2025 as their companies continued to invest, insatiably, in AI and deploy products that have caused psychosis in their own investors, seamlessly produced and proliferated child sex abuse material, and encouraged teenagers to kill themselves. So-called “hard tech” is in: Jobs in defense and surveillance are the hottest roles on the market. Working 9-9-6 (that’s 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week) is the new answer to work-life balance. And for anyone still holding onto the progressive, pro-immigrant, “democratizing” dreams of the tech industry of the 2010s, Big Tech leaders (and some of their partners, including a distracting Lauren Sánchez) made their new political alignment clear as day just under a year ago, when they joined Donald Trump at his second inauguration. Anil Dash is not surprised by the dark turn the industry has taken. As a seasoned entrepreneur, prolific early blogger, and proponent for civil liberties in the digital world (he sits on the board of the Electronic Frontier Foundation), Dash has kept a close eye on tech leaders and chronicled the impacts on the workforce in his blog, including a recent post with the howling headline How the hell are you supposed to have a career in tech in 2026?. To usher our tech-minded (and anti-tech-minded) readers into 2026, Gazetteer SF got Dash on the phone for a chat about AI, labor, why the MAGA ethos has taken hold of the industry, and a grand VC conspiracy. The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity. You said this moment in tech is “grim” and “about as bad as you’ve seen.” What are the forces that have brought us to this moment? A great one, that is going somewhat underreported, is just the numbers. ChatGPT came out in late 2022, a little over three years ago, and since then there have been over half-a-million layoffs across the tech sector. Just that one signal — put all the other things aside — that’s decimation. That’s twice as much as the DOGE guys cut in the federal government. This would be devastating if it was the auto industry. It’s ten times as many people as work in the entirety of coal mining. It’s shocking to think about that many jobs gone. This industry’s been gutted. In any normal time, people would say, “Oh, this is a recession.” But because those same companies [who are doing layoffs] are doing this financial sleight-of-hand where they’re doing deals with each other — like, “We’ll buy machines from you and you buy AI from us,” — they make it look like the share prices are going up, so it doesn’t look like a recession. That’s part one. Part two is what we’re seeing at the top, which trickles down to tech workers and creates this really grim outlook. What I mean is we’re seeing this new technique of the leaders of these companies — the investors, owners, CEOs — are now able to make money even if the companies never make money. That’s new. It started a little over ten years ago, and I’ll give you Uber as an example. Before they went public, Uber had only ever lost money. Billions and billions of dollars. And yet, their investors were still able to make billions of billions of dollars in profit by making this thing public and recouping that money on IPO day. That is different than everything else in the prior history of the industry. What they figured out was if you tell a great story, and, importantly, if you get a legal monopoly, which Uber and Lyft basically did, you can print money kind of without regard to whether it ever makes sense as a business or not. So that’s been a pattern with everything that’s followed, whether it’s crypto or AI. This isn’t even venture capital anymore. Venture capital means you take a risk. High risk, high reward. If there’s no risk, that's not venture capital. This isn’t even venture capital anymore. Venture capital means you take a risk. High risk, high reward. If there’s no risk, that’s not venture capital. If you wouldn’t call this venture capitalism, what would you call it? It’s pure crony capitalism. Corruption capitalism. These days, when you go to raise, the VCs are explicit about how they’re all talking to each other about what your business is, what your economics are, what they think of your company, what they each think they might offer you. That is collusion. They’re not competitors. It is essentially one company with different divisions, openly sharing information against entrepreneurs. If you get to even a Series B, you will have to take money from either Andreessen Horowitz or Founders Fund or Ron Conway, and it’s straight-up Godfather shit. They’ll say, “You’re gonna need help some day, and we can help you. We know PR. If you get stuck, we know someone in the White House.” Let’s talk about the tech and White House. When we think of the tech industry of the 2010s, we think of progressive, optimistic ideals. Now, we’re seeing the hard tech era and tech leaders cutting DEI and supporting Trump. For those of us who weren’t there, was the tech industry of the 2010s just marketed differently, or did it really operate differently? For workers, it was genuinely really different. It was peak Obama optimism era, and it was 100 percent sincere. The creature comforts were really good, the benefits were great, the holiday parties were huge. And structurally, tech companies were genuinely providing upward mobility for people. They were genuine advocates for H-1B visas. People now are at this point where they're so beaten down they're kind of like, “Was it all a lie?” But I had enough visibility and access, like I’ve had dinner with Jeff Bezos, I’ve been in the room, and I can say they were different. They have changed, and been changed by intentional political actors like Peter Thiel and Curtis Yarvin. And now they’ve pickled each others’ brains. Do you think today’s founders have to move in this more libertarian direction to survive in this industry? They don’t even have to move. I talk to young founders these days and for them, there’s no other world than the Trump world. I ask them what inspired them to go into tech and they say they read Marc Andreessen’s manifesto, they read Peter Thiel’s books, and I think, “Oh, your brain’s cooked.” They come in pre-pickled. But everyone else who could have told an alternate narrative has been hounded out of the industry. In terms of the libertarian bent, those intentional political actors like Peter Thiel were very intentional about it. They created their own media ecosystem. They created Substack — they, meaning Andreessen Horowitz is a big investor — and paid to have content on there that would drive users to their own media. They took over culture. On the topic of VC media ecosystems, I saw the Thread you posted a few days ago about common things VCs believe. One was “Platforms need Nazis on them.” What do you mean by that? Well, it’s inciting. These guys like Thiel and [White House AI czar David] Sacks have been fixated for 30 years on trying to normalize and re-assert the public use of slurs. One of the examples they use [in their 1998 polemic The Diversity Myth] is the r-slur, which had just fallen out of favor in the early ‘90s. And they were explicitly saying not being able to use these slurs reflects growing political power from these groups, and that's why we need to bring them back. I have these notes that I’ve written, and I need to wait until I can like spend my entire waking hours defending the onslaught of shit I’ll get for writing it, but I really think the thing that they’ve been working towards for 10 years is to get Trump to be able to use the n-word in public. And I think we are less than a year away. I really think the thing that they’ve been working towards for 10 years is to get Trump to be able to use the n-word in public. And I think we are less than a year away. That is dark. I can’t even contain my reaction to that. That is scary. I want to be wrong. But, yeah, they want to make sure [marginalized groups] don’t have power, and that’s signified by having Nazis on a platform. On that note of power, with all the layoffs and the bleakness among the workforce, do you think we’re going to see any sort of labor power movement in the tech industry? I’m hopeful. There was a moment in 2018, 2019, 2020, early COVID, when I thought there was going to be a moment. That’s when you had Amazon workers unionize in Staten Island [in 2022] and the first Google union [in 2021]. And I don’t think it’s a coincidence that in the next 18 months after that they put $10 billion into teaching tools how to code. Like, ChatGPT comes at the end of 2022, right? It’s not entirely because of that, but it’s not not because of that. Also, like I said, [tech workers’] brains are pre-pickled. They don’t know the first thing about labor, and they’re trepidatious about learning because it’s coded “other.” Like, solidarity with the people serving meals in their workplaces is terrifying, because those people are completely disposable. None of those people have equity, none of those people have any job security. To somebody graduating college in 2026, would you recommend a career in tech? I think it’s hard. But compared to what? Compared to being a prison guard? Yes. But I do think tech is going to be the industry that is most changed by AI. Right now, ChatGPT can write a memo for you, write code for you. But the tools they’re building now, it’ll be more like one tool will replace an entire team of software engineers. For someone entering college in 2026, would you recommend studying computer science? It puts a pit in my stomach to say it, but no. I think [coding] should be part of people’s lives, for sure. But should you go into it as a career? I feel the same way about it when somebody says to me, “I’m going to learn an instrument for a living.” I’m like, “Well, hold on.” If you’re going to be the best in the world at that instrument, okay, go ahead. But if you’re not going to be the best in the world, it’s going to be a hard road for you. Last year, we heard so much about the AI bubble. Do you think we’ll see a crash in 2026? They’ve sort of economically engineered themselves out of crashing, and this is sort of similar to the de-risking of venture capital. When there's no risk, you don’t have crashes and you don’t have bailouts. And this is sort of, again, a feature of fascism versus capitalism. It was trendy in the last couple of years to call where we’re at “late-stage capitalism.” Would you call this fascism? Yeah, we’re there. Okay, the million dollar question: Do you still feel optimistic about the tech industry? Well, I have to believe. Part of the reason why is that I’ve seen it change people’s lives for the better. I think you can still build a thing that does connect the world and enables people to be part of the lives of people they love using technology. People can do it again. I think people are starting to understand the stakes. People understand that Elon Musk made a machine that makes child abuse material. I think it has to get pretty dire before people will make a change. But I think it can happen again. Do you see anybody leading that charge? There are some small projects, but I don’t want to blow anybody up yet. They’re fragile. Advertisement opens in a new tab.

XRP is in the center of crypto conversations, with social interest on X rising to levels that now rival Bitcoin. Recent data tracking the most searched cashtags on the platform shows XRP consistently appearing among the dominant assets drawing user attention. Interestingly, this surge in visibility is not happening in isolation but in tandem with a series of regulatory, institutional, and ecosystem developments within the XRP ecosystem. Data tracking the most-searched cashtags on the social media platform X shows XRP climbing alongside other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, a closer look at the data shows that XRP has received many more cashtags compared to other cryptocurrencies. This trend was revealed by Nikita Bier, head of product at X, who shared a visualization chart of recent search behavior on X. The chart data shows that XRP has consistently appeared among the most queried assets on X since December 2025. Throughout the period depicted, top cashtag traffic has been fluctuating with daily rhythm as X users scan the platform and post on X with cashtags. The share of searches attributable to $xrp slices into a larger portion of the total during days in early January 2026, which indicates extended interest. On some dates, XRP’s presence in the search mix rivals that of $btc and $eth, which are typically the dominant anchors of crypto attention on social media. The chart also shows how other tags wax and wane alongside XRP’s performance. Some days show greater fragmentation, where interest is spread across stocks such as $iren (IREN), $tesla (Tesla), $gme (GameStop), and $asts (AST SpaceMobile Inc.). Nonetheless, the trajectory for XRP in the first half of January shows a growing base of people actively getting involved in the cryptocurrency. Top Cashtags Searched On X Social interest on X is a mix of speculation and ecosystem developments, which XRP is currently sitting at the center of. Behind this spike in attention are tangible developments surrounding Ripple and the XRP ecosystem. One recent example is how Ripple secured regulatory approval from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, obtaining both an Electronic Money Institution license and cryptoasset registration. Ripple’s regulatory buildout is expanding across Europe, with additional approvals in Luxembourg as part of its push to operate on both sides of the continent. Interestingly, there are also indications of deeper engagement with Ripple’s ecosystem on the institutional side. Rumors and mentions on X indicate that BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has started to use Ripple’s USD-backed stablecoin (RLUSD) as collateral. However, this move is yet to be confirmed by BlackRock. These updates, combined with many others, help explain why social interest and cashtag searches for XRP have recently been on the rise on X and other social media platforms.

Former American president John F Kennedy remains a hugely iconic figure in the Irish imagination. Not just because of his Irish Catholic heritage, but also because he was the first sitting US president to visit Ireland in June 1963, a mere five months before he was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. For these reasons the newly discovered archive of signed letters, press photographs and an inscribed portrait of Kennedy, valued by De Búrca Rare Books at €45,000, should attract significant interest. “The material has remained intact and unseen on the open market until now, and is the biggest single archive of John K Kennedy we have put on the market,” says Will de Búrca. The privately owned collection – for sale now via the Blackrock seller of rare books – includes four typed letters. The letters, three of which have the John F Kennedy for President campaign letterhead, provide an insight into Kennedy’s campaign strategy as presidential contender. For example, two of the letters were sent to Charlotte Ward, who worked as a volunteer on Kennedy’s presidential campaign in 1960, thanking her for her support. “Kennedy’s personal tone reflects the campaign’s emphasis on grassroots, human-level engagement, a communications style that helped solidify the Kennedy image as charismatic, direct and youthful,” says Will de Búrca. Kennedy’s team relied heavily on enthusiastic local volunteers, especially the “Kennedy Girls”, a co-ordinated national programme designed to project glamour, energy and youth around the candidate. The archive also includes a black-and-white matte portrait of John F Kennedy, personally inscribed by him to Fionnula O’Sullivan. A complete set of six original 1964 photographs from United Press International, stamped with “For Personal Use Only/Not For Publication”, are also included. These press photographs documented Kennedy’s personal effects as they were being catalogued for transfer to the John F Kennedy Memorial Library. They include a photograph of the president’s desk, with the final day appointment calendar for Thursday, November 21st, with the last entry, Depart South Lawn for Texas. This was the trip during which he was assassinated on November 22nd, 1963. Another photograph shows JFK’s hi-fi set and his favourite Irish LPs. Another is of the handwritten doodles he was well known for making during meetings, while another is of his personal rocking chair, prescribed for his chronic back pain. “As a complement to the signed letters and inscribed photographs, these images deepen the emotional and narrative arc of the collection, moving from Kennedy during the 1960 campaign to his presidential persona to the physical remnants of his life gathered after his death,” says de Búrca. Collectors of Irish silver will have a couple of opportunities to seek out special pieces in the next week or so, with Hegarty Antiques selling the Part Two of a lifetime collection of Irish silver in their online auction on January 21st. Lisa Keane of Hegarty’s says that the Bandon auction house found 2025 to be a strong year for Irish silver – particularly provincial silver from Cork. “The majority of our buyers were from Ireland, but we did reach a worldwide market with buyers from Australia and the United States,” she says. Meanwhile, Irish silver expert Jimmy Weldon, of JW Weldon on Clarendon Street, Dublin, will be one of the stallholders at the first National Antique Fairs of 2026 at Limerick Racecourse on January 24th and 25th. Although a niche area for collectors, Irish silver with clear hallmarks made by historically significant Georgian silversmiths, still captures the attention of keen buyers. Silver made in Limerick, Waterford, Galway and Kinsale is also often of greater interest than Dublin-made silverware, because of its rarity. Weldon says prices are still very low for antique Irish silver. “It is very reasonable and underpriced,” says Weldon. His pièce de résistance at the Limerick fair will be an early 18th century Irish Queen Anne tankard for €17,500, made by David King. “King was one of the top three silver makers in Dublin and this is one of the best pieces of silver I ever bought,” says Weldon. “It would be a fine investment for someone.” Other pieces for sale will be an 18th-century silver tureen made by Dublin silver smith John Lloyd (€4,500), and an 18th-century Irish silver beer jug made by Dublin-based silversmith, Robert Calderwood (€17,500). Anyone clearing out period homes should consider bringing old hallmarked cutlery, coffee pots, candlesticks and silver trays to auctioneers for valuation, as you might be surprised by their value. For example, there is an Irish silver shell bowl soup ladle in Hegarty’s auction with an estimate of €350-€450, even though the maker’s mark is unclear. Weldon says he is always willing to value items – and even buy pieces – at antique fairs. “You never know what someone might bring along on the day,” he says. “But it must be silver. Anything that is silver-plated has little value.” hegartyantiques.com, deburcararebooks.com, weldons.ie Estimate €12,000 – €18,000 Hammer €15,000 Auction house Morgan O’Driscoll Estimate €50,000-€70,000 Hammer €44,000 Auction house Morgan O’Driscoll Estimate €1,500- €2,500 Hammer €4,200 Auction house Adam’s Estimate €500-€700 Hammer €1,900 Auction house Mullens Laurel Park © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Toward the beginning of the new year, Ubisoft announced its second round of terminations amid an organizational restructuring that could affect an estimated 55 positions across its Swedish studios, including Ubisoft Stockholm and Massive Entertainment. This follows a call for a voluntary leave program in the fall of 2025. Ubisoft informed its employees about these changes on January 13 and explained that they came after the completion of the voluntary program, concluding a long-term roadmap and evaluating the structure required to operate effectively. In a statement to IGN, Ubisoft said, “Earlier today, we informed all employees in our Swedish studios (Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft Stockholm) about a proposed organizational restructuring that may affect approximately 55 roles across Malmö and Stockholm.” The company further explained: This restructure follows the completion of the Voluntary Leave Program launched during the fall of 2025, a finalized long-term roadmap, and a completed staffing and appointment process, which together have provided clear visibility into the structure and capacity required to support the two studios’ work and sustainability over time. Ubisoft stressed that these layoffs were not tied to individual employee performance or recent game releases, but to structural requirements. One of the affected studios, Massive Entertainment, has been known for its work on The Division series, Star Wars Outlaws, and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. It has been one of Ubisoft’s key contributors since the studio’s acquisition in 2008. Ubisoft Stockholm, on the other hand, had opened recently, collaborated on the Avatar project, and was reported to be working on an unannounced project. Ubisoft reassured the studios that these restructuring shifts would not affect their long-term roadmaps and that projects currently in development, such as The Division 3, would not be affected. To put things in perspective, this is the second wave of job cuts under Ubisoft's helm in 2026. Earlier, on January 6, Ubisoft announced the shuttering of its Halifax studio, resulting in the termination of 71 employees. Strangely, this shutdown happened right after the studio voted in favor of unionization. However, Ubisoft insists that this decision was made in tandem with the company’s efforts to streamline operations, improve efficiency, and cut costs. The Halifax team has worked on mobile titles like Assassin’s Creed Rebellion. Buy Assassin's Creed Shadows on Amazon here IGN

[transcript] Congressional Trading Report 2025 Unusual Whales, the website that tracks congressional trading, just released their full report on Congress trading in 2025. And essentially like every single year, especially since 2020, there are plenty of congressional members who way outperform the S&P 500, with multiple members of Congress even returning well over 50%. Now, while this report is for the full year 2025, we’ve already seen a couple of interesting trades as we head into 2026. So, in this video, we’re going to be looking at two stocks that members of Congress have been recently buying. To analyze these two stocks, we’re going to be using forecaster.biz, which you can check out at the link in the description. It’s a tool that I’ve started using more, and I like that you can easily overlay things like sales, net income, price to earnings, and dividends over the share price, so you can see correlation. But, let’s go ahead and dive in. Stock Analysis: Broadcom (AVGO) The first stock that members of Congress have been buying is Broadcom, stock ticker AVGO. Now, this is a stock that’s already a large position in Nancy Pelosi’s portfolio. It’s currently the second largest position. And as you might already know, Broadcom’s performance over the last 5 years has just been exceptional, up 673%. If we look at the last 3 years, they’re up about 500%, and in the last year alone, up 53.76%, making it one of the best performing stocks in the S&P 500. Now, of course, what’s interesting about this is if we overlay what’s gone on with the sales for this company in the last 5 years, you can see that the share price has essentially followed the sales growth of the business. And on top of this, they’ve continued to grow dividends at a very high rate. In fact, if we scroll down, we can see back just in 2017, they were paying out about 10 cents per share in dividends. And look, now it’s more than 6x at about 65 cents per share. Congressional Trading Insights Now, let’s talk about congressional trading for a moment. If we jump over to the political tab here on Forecaster, one of the things we will notice is there is already significant congressional buying in Q1 and Q2 of 2025. I mean, we’re talking about millions of dollars in some cases, but don’t point out Q3 and Q4. There is still significant congressional buying, especially more buying than selling. Now, when it comes to stocks like Broadcom, I see a lot of mixed reviews. Obviously, the stock has done unbelievably well in the last one, three, and five years. But look at what’s been going on with the PE multiple. The PE multiple has climbed extraordinarily high, especially in the last couple of years. In fact, if we look at the fundamentals tab, Forecaster’s listing the trailing 12 months PE multiple is about 70.37. There are very few stocks in the market with that high of a PE multiple. But it’s really important that we note a stock’s PE multiple by itself tells you absolutely nothing about the company without accounting for future growth rate projections. So for example, if we jump over to the raw data, look at revenue charted out over the past few years. Again, the stock price has followed the revenue growth. It’s followed the fundamental growth, and we can see based on the trailing 12 months, this growth is continuing into 2026. Now to be fair as it relates to Broadcom, it’s important we understand where this topline growth is actually coming from because it certainly hasn’t all been organic. This company has actually pursued a lot of acquisitions over the years, and most recently they acquired VMware, and that was just a couple of years ago when revenue was sitting at about 35.8 billion. So around right here is when they made that acquisition, and obviously since then revenue has jumped quite a bit. Growth Strategy and Financials So what we can see right now is they’re pretty much pursuing growth at all costs. Let me show you an example of what I mean. If we scroll down all the way to the bottom of the income statement, look at what’s happened to average shares outstanding. We can see they’ve actually issued more shares outstanding over the past decade. Why is that the case? Typically, in most instances, that’s not something we want to see. But the reality is at certain time periods, it can actually be a good thing. If a company can issue new shares when they’re trading at an undervaluation, yes, it still dilutes shareholders, but with the capital that they raise, if they can get a very good return on investment from that capital, it can still actually be beneficial to shareholders. So, yes, they’ve been issuing new shares. On top of this, look at what’s been going on on the balance sheet. If we scroll down and look at net debt again, what do you notice? Net debt has actually grown quite a bit for this company in the last few years. They are aggressively pursuing growth. And so the ultimate measure of whether or not this is actually paying off is by looking at what’s actually going on with free cash flow. Remember, a company has five options with free cash flow. They can reinvest back into the business, pay down debt, attempt mergers and acquisitions, buy back shares, and pay out dividends. And like we saw, Broadcom has rapidly grown dividends over the last few years. So free cash flow has grown at a very high rate. We can see in 2024 they were sitting at about 19.4. Looks like trailing 12 months. They’re already sitting at 26.9. And growth, whether you’re looking at earnings or free cash flow, is expected to continue for Broadcom, especially at a high rate. Take a look at this. If we look at Broadcom and look at the average expected earnings growth over the next few years, 2026 EPS growth should be at about 50%, 2027 nearly 40%, and 2028 around 25%. This is some of the fastest earnings growth that you’ll see out of any company in the S&P 500. Valuation Considerations And so all that to say, yes, the PE multiple like we’ve seen on Forecaster looks extremely high at 70.37, but when you start to look at forward-looking PE multiples and account for that future earnings growth, it doesn’t look nearly as bad as you would think. This is why in a lot of instances, we actually want to look at the price to earnings growth multiple. Now, we’ll come back and talk about valuation in just a moment, but make sure you understand that Broadcom is not just another semiconductor company. Yes, Semiconductor Solutions is about 61% of revenue, and this is what a lot of people focus on because their products are used by companies like Google, Meta, and Anthropic. And the company already has a $73 billion backlog. That’s right, $73 billion in backlog. So essentially, if we go back and look at topline revenue, we can see in 2024, it was 51.57 billion. Their management has stated they already have 73 billion in backlog for the next 18 months. So these earnings and revenue growth projections we’ve been talking about aren’t something that analysts are pulling out of thin air. These are projections that are based on the reality of the orders that are coming in for Broadcom. That should give you more confidence in the stock. But then the other sector of the business is infrastructure software, and this is where they have made some acquisitions. But the good news is this portion of the business has extremely high margins and recurring revenue characteristics. So is it too late to buy Broadcom, or is there still potential opportunity? Well, here’s where things get interesting. Let’s assume for this stock that the PE multiple gets reduced drastically in the coming years. Maybe it falls all the way down to about 35. So essentially, the PE multiple is going to get cut in half. Let’s also assume they’re able to meet earnings growth projections and that by the year 2028, estimated EPS will be sitting at about $17.60, meaning that earnings would have to grow at a rate of around 37.5% through the year 2028. Well, here’s what we can see. All of a sudden, if EPS by 2028 is about $17.54, which is actually slightly below the average analyst estimate, you’d still be looking at a compounded annual return of 15.41%, not including the dividends. And the dividend yield is low; it’s only sitting at about 0.7%, but again, dividend growth has been exceptional. So that gives you a return of around 77%, again not including dividends, likely closer to 80% when you include dividends. So this is a great example. We have to reframe the way we think about valuation because yes, this PE multiple looks absurd at first glance, but when you consider the earnings growth projections that are actually being determined by the company’s backlog, all of a sudden the valuation doesn’t look as extreme as it would seem. And again, I think this is one of the many reasons that we’re seeing congressional members continuing to add Broadcom to their portfolio even though it performed so well in the last year after they already loaded up. Verizon Communications Stock Analysis And the second stock on our list is an interesting one. Not one you would typically expect to see on this type of list, but that’s Verizon Communications, the high-yielding dividend stock. And this stock has actually been on the list of Congress buys before, but it’s been bought even more so recently. So, look at the political buying. What do you notice? There wasn’t much activity for the last few years, but in Q4 of 2025, buying activity surged for this stock. In fact, we saw the most buying activity for Verizon that we’ve seen in the last 5 years in Q4 of 2025. Now, this is interesting because really, if we look at the share price over the last 5 years, it’s down by about 29%. If we look at it in the last 10 years, it’s not much better, down by about 9.81%. Now, total returns obviously tell a different story because the stock is a high yielder. It’s yielding about 6.7% as of right now. So, what do we make of Verizon stock right now? What’s the issue? Why is the share price not climbing? Or is it still potentially a good dividend play? Well, again, we have to remember over the long term, share price is going to follow the fundamental growth. And if we look at the sales growth over the last 5ish years, it’s really been relatively stagnant. We can see this; it hasn’t gone really anywhere. So, let’s dive into this a little bit more. If we jump back over to the fundamentals and look at the raw data, let’s take a look at revenue growth. This is what it looks like over the past decade. No wonder the share price really hasn’t moved. Revenue has not grown at a very high rate. Really, it’s been somewhat in line with inflation over the past decade. Even if we come down here and overlay the one-year revenue growth rates, we can see it’s typically in the low single-digit range. Every now and then, they’ll actually have a year of negative revenue growth. Now, if we pull up the most recent earnings report, one of the things we will notice is we can see right here, total operating revenue in the third quarter was up 1.5% year-over-year. So, slight growth in that area. If we scroll down and look at things like total Verizon consumer revenue, that saw growth of about 2.9% year-over-year. And if we look at total Verizon business revenue, that was a decrease of 2.8% year-over-year. So again, even in the most recent quarter, we’re talking about very small changes in what revenue growth has actually looked like. But that being said, with the outlook that they’re currently giving, they’re stating that they expect revenue growth to be in the range of 2 to 2.8% and adjusted EPS growth of about 1 to 3%. So they expect fundamentals to continue to grow, but it’s quite slow growth. So the reality is people who are interested in Verizon, they’re buying the stock primarily for one reason. One, they either think it’s undervalued at current prices or two, they’re buying it for the dividend. So really, let’s assess the sustainability of those dividends. Now, if we look at the dividend history for this stock, they have a history of growing those dividends even though free cash flow has not been growing at a high rate. In fact, if we jump back over to this slide, we can see they have 19 consecutive years of growing that dividend. So certainly a dividend growth stock, but the dividend growth is quite slow. And we have to remember anytime a stock is growing dividends at a rate below the rate of inflation, that’s technically not dividend growth. That’s something to keep in mind that doesn’t get discussed very often. Now, if we jump back over to their consolidated cash flow summary from their recent earnings presentation, again, we can assess the sustainability of those dividend payments. Dividends are paid out of free cash flow. And if we look at the 9 months of 2024, free cash flow is 14.5 while dividends paid out was 8.4 billion. So that’s a very sustainable dividend. And if we look at the 9 months of 2025, we can see yes, dividends are higher. They’ve grown their dividend payouts, but free cash flow is higher as well. So it continues to look like an actually very healthy around 7% starting dividend yield with relatively low leverage. It’s at least in their target range. So what we can see is yes, that starting dividend yield looks sustainable at about 6.7%. But what about the valuation at its current prices? Well, to start, we can see they trade at an extremely low PE multiple, just 8.65. Essentially the opposite of what we just saw for Broadcom. A PE multiple far below the average of the S&P 500. But again, that doesn’t tell us how the stock is actually being valued because we have to account for future growth. And as we’ve already seen, growth is very slow for Verizon Communications. Now, with that being said, we can still use a dividend discount model to value Verizon Communications. If they’re growing revenues, earnings, and free cash flow at a rate of about 2 to 3% moving forward, then dividend growth of 2.25% is sustainable moving forward. And if they can achieve that dividend growth rate, that would give them a fair value of about $44.54, implying 10% upside from their current prices. So absolutely this is by no means a high growth stock, not even a medium growth stock. It’s a very mature company that’s a very capital-intensive business with a lot of debt on the balance sheet. But with that being said, it does look manageable. The dividend looks sustainable and based on just a 2 to 2.5% dividend growth rate, the stock actually does look slightly undervalued. So we may see this share price revert back to its intrinsic value. But don’t expect a lot of growth past that other than the starting dividend yield that you’ll be receiving close to 6.67%. So there you go. Those are two stocks that members of Congress have been recently adding to their portfolio. Very interesting! Broadcom now going at $351. per share I guess my Megalomaniac ambitions will remain on the distant back burner for the time being. By contrast, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is cheap, pays over 7 percent at this price. The expectation of lower interest rates may be the main reason for the interest by the Critters, but they may also be loaded up with inside information. 👍 It’s never too late to start. 😁 Look at the chart for VZ. It’s movement over years is bad. Buy some AVGO over the weekend, and sell it about noon on Monday. VZ seems to pay a reliable 7% dividend. This past week there has been a storm-the-battlements rally for certain tech companies; I suspect there will be some burnoff on them. Naturally, over time, well-run companies go up in value, but not on a straight line. 🤔 Free cash flow for VZ: https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/VZ/verizon/free-cash-flow I certainly wouldn’t buy VZ for capital appreciation, but it is rock solid for a 7% dividend—at a time when it is tough to get even 4% on a cd or bond (not to mention the likely hood that interest rates will drop further in the coming year). Capital appreciation due to falling interest rates isn’t unlikely, but would be a short-lived phenomenon. VZ could become a trap regardless, as direct-to-satellite builds out over the next few years. Fatter dividends are available elsewhere among various capital mgmt outfits, but they are interest rate sensitive and are not immune to economic fluctuations. Jim Cramer is an idiot. He gets on my nerves (typical NBC politics), but he’s no idiot. Is there an ETF that trades based on following insiders? You can’t simply buy a stock that insiders buy, because you would also have to track when they sell. They might not buy & hold. An ETF is probably the best way to ride the tech tsunami that’s been going on, assuming it has a track record of good performance. Years ago a financial journalist had a piece in one of the mags back then. He looked at the best performaing mutual funds (ETFs are kinda new to this old guy who types with my hands), then researched who the managers were, and found that the all best performing funds had been run by just a handful of the best managers. Even the middlin’ ones can keep track of a basket of stocks better than any one of us can. In “Beating the Street”, Peter Lynch suggested self-managed portfolios are probably best limited to just five stocks. Nanci Pelosi is the New Cathy Wood.

[transcript] Congressional Trading Report 2025 Unusual Whales, the website that tracks congressional trading, just released their full report on Congress trading in 2025. And essentially like every single year, especially since 2020, there are plenty of congressional members who way outperform the S&P 500, with multiple members of Congress even returning well over 50%. Now, while this report is for the full year 2025, we’ve already seen a couple of interesting trades as we head into 2026. So, in this video, we’re going to be looking at two stocks that members of Congress have been recently buying.

But, let’s go ahead and dive in. Stock Analysis: Broadcom (AVGO) The first stock that members of Congress have been buying is Broadcom, stock ticker AVGO. Now, this is a stock that’s already a large position in Nancy Pelosi’s portfolio. It’s currently the second largest position. And as you might already know, Broadcom’s performance over the last 5 years has just been exceptional, up 673%. If we look at the last 3 years, they’re up about 500%, and in the last year alone, up 53.76%, making it one of the best performing stocks in the S&P 500. Now, of course, what’s interesting about this is if we overlay what’s gone on with the sales for this company in the last 5 years, you can see that the share price has essentially followed the sales growth of the business. And on top of this, they’ve continued to grow dividends at a very high rate. In fact, if we scroll down, we can see back just in 2017, they were paying out about 10 cents per share in dividends. And look, now it’s more than 6x at about 65 cents per share. Congressional Trading Insights Now, let’s talk about congressional trading for a moment. If we jump over to the political tab here on Forecaster, one of the things we will notice is there is already significant congressional buying in Q1 and Q2 of 2025. I mean, we’re talking about millions of dollars in some cases, but don’t point out Q3 and Q4. There is still significant congressional buying, especially more buying than selling. Now, when it comes to stocks like Broadcom, I see a lot of mixed reviews. Obviously, the stock has done unbelievably well in the last one, three, and five years. But look at what’s been going on with the PE multiple. The PE multiple has climbed extraordinarily high, especially in the last couple of years. In fact, if we look at the fundamentals tab, Forecaster’s listing the trailing 12 months PE multiple is about 70.37. There are very few stocks in the market with that high of a PE multiple. But it’s really important that we note a stock’s PE multiple by itself tells you absolutely nothing about the company without accounting for future growth rate projections. So for example, if we jump over to the raw data, look at revenue charted out over the past few years. Again, the stock price has followed the revenue growth. It’s followed the fundamental growth, and we can see based on the trailing 12 months, this growth is continuing into 2026. Now to be fair as it relates to Broadcom, it’s important we understand where this topline growth is actually coming from because it certainly hasn’t all been organic. This company has actually pursued a lot of acquisitions over the years, and most recently they acquired VMware, and that was just a couple of years ago when revenue was sitting at about 35.8 billion. So around right here is when they made that acquisition, and obviously since then revenue has jumped quite a bit. Growth Strategy and Financials So what we can see right now is they’re pretty much pursuing growth at all costs. Let me show you an example of what I mean. If we scroll down all the way to the bottom of the income statement, look at what’s happened to average shares outstanding. We can see they’ve actually issued more shares outstanding over the past decade. Why is that the case? Typically, in most instances, that’s not something we want to see. But the reality is at certain time periods, it can actually be a good thing. If a company can issue new shares when they’re trading at an undervaluation, yes, it still dilutes shareholders, but with the capital that they raise, if they can get a very good return on investment from that capital, it can still actually be beneficial to shareholders. So, yes, they’ve been issuing new shares. On top of this, look at what’s been going on on the balance sheet. If we scroll down and look at net debt again, what do you notice? Net debt has actually grown quite a bit for this company in the last few years. They are aggressively pursuing growth. And so the ultimate measure of whether or not this is actually paying off is by looking at what’s actually going on with free cash flow. Remember, a company has five options with free cash flow. They can reinvest back into the business, pay down debt, attempt mergers and acquisitions, buy back shares, and pay out dividends. And like we saw, Broadcom has rapidly grown dividends over the last few years. So free cash flow has grown at a very high rate. We can see in 2024 they were sitting at about 19.4. Looks like trailing 12 months. They’re already sitting at 26.9. And growth, whether you’re looking at earnings or free cash flow, is expected to continue for Broadcom, especially at a high rate. Take a look at this. If we look at Broadcom and look at the average expected earnings growth over the next few years, 2026 EPS growth should be at about 50%, 2027 nearly 40%, and 2028 around 25%. This is some of the fastest earnings growth that you’ll see out of any company in the S&P 500. Valuation Considerations And so all that to say, yes, the PE multiple like we’ve seen on Forecaster looks extremely high at 70.37, but when you start to look at forward-looking PE multiples and account for that future earnings growth, it doesn’t look nearly as bad as you would think. This is why in a lot of instances, we actually want to look at the price to earnings growth multiple. Now, we’ll come back and talk about valuation in just a moment, but make sure you understand that Broadcom is not just another semiconductor company. Yes, Semiconductor Solutions is about 61% of revenue, and this is what a lot of people focus on because their products are used by companies like Google, Meta, and Anthropic. And the company already has a $73 billion backlog. That’s right, $73 billion in backlog. So essentially, if we go back and look at topline revenue, we can see in 2024, it was 51.57 billion. Their management has stated they already have 73 billion in backlog for the next 18 months. So these earnings and revenue growth projections we’ve been talking about aren’t something that analysts are pulling out of thin air. These are projections that are based on the reality of the orders that are coming in for Broadcom. That should give you more confidence in the stock. But then the other sector of the business is infrastructure software, and this is where they have made some acquisitions. But the good news is this portion of the business has extremely high margins and recurring revenue characteristics. So is it too late to buy Broadcom, or is there still potential opportunity? Well, here’s where things get interesting. Let’s assume for this stock that the PE multiple gets reduced drastically in the coming years. Maybe it falls all the way down to about 35. So essentially, the PE multiple is going to get cut in half. Let’s also assume they’re able to meet earnings growth projections and that by the year 2028, estimated EPS will be sitting at about $17.60, meaning that earnings would have to grow at a rate of around 37.5% through the year 2028. Well, here’s what we can see. All of a sudden, if EPS by 2028 is about $17.54, which is actually slightly below the average analyst estimate, you’d still be looking at a compounded annual return of 15.41%, not including the dividends. And the dividend yield is low; it’s only sitting at about 0.7%, but again, dividend growth has been exceptional. So that gives you a return of around 77%, again not including dividends, likely closer to 80% when you include dividends. So this is a great example. We have to reframe the way we think about valuation because yes, this PE multiple looks absurd at first glance, but when you consider the earnings growth projections that are actually being determined by the company’s backlog, all of a sudden the valuation doesn’t look as extreme as it would seem. And again, I think this is one of the many reasons that we’re seeing congressional members continuing to add Broadcom to their portfolio even though it performed so well in the last year after they already loaded up. Verizon Communications Stock Analysis And the second stock on our list is an interesting one. Not one you would typically expect to see on this type of list, but that’s Verizon Communications, the high-yielding dividend stock. And this stock has actually been on the list of Congress buys before, but it’s been bought even more so recently. So, look at the political buying. What do you notice? There wasn’t much activity for the last few years, but in Q4 of 2025, buying activity surged for this stock. In fact, we saw the most buying activity for Verizon that we’ve seen in the last 5 years in Q4 of 2025. Now, this is interesting because really, if we look at the share price over the last 5 years, it’s down by about 29%. If we look at it in the last 10 years, it’s not much better, down by about 9.81%. Now, total returns obviously tell a different story because the stock is a high yielder. It’s yielding about 6.7% as of right now. So, what do we make of Verizon stock right now? What’s the issue? Why is the share price not climbing? Or is it still potentially a good dividend play? Well, again, we have to remember over the long term, share price is going to follow the fundamental growth. And if we look at the sales growth over the last 5ish years, it’s really been relatively stagnant. We can see this; it hasn’t gone really anywhere. So, let’s dive into this a little bit more. If we jump back over to the fundamentals and look at the raw data, let’s take a look at revenue growth. This is what it looks like over the past decade. No wonder the share price really hasn’t moved. Revenue has not grown at a very high rate. Really, it’s been somewhat in line with inflation over the past decade. Even if we come down here and overlay the one-year revenue growth rates, we can see it’s typically in the low single-digit range. Every now and then, they’ll actually have a year of negative revenue growth. Now, if we pull up the most recent earnings report, one of the things we will notice is we can see right here, total operating revenue in the third quarter was up 1.5% year-over-year. So, slight growth in that area. If we scroll down and look at things like total Verizon consumer revenue, that saw growth of about 2.9% year-over-year. And if we look at total Verizon business revenue, that was a decrease of 2.8% year-over-year. So again, even in the most recent quarter, we’re talking about very small changes in what revenue growth has actually looked like. But that being said, with the outlook that they’re currently giving, they’re stating that they expect revenue growth to be in the range of 2 to 2.8% and adjusted EPS growth of about 1 to 3%. So they expect fundamentals to continue to grow, but it’s quite slow growth. So the reality is people who are interested in Verizon, they’re buying the stock primarily for one reason. One, they either think it’s undervalued at current prices or two, they’re buying it for the dividend. So really, let’s assess the sustainability of those dividends. Now, if we look at the dividend history for this stock, they have a history of growing those dividends even though free cash flow has not been growing at a high rate. In fact, if we jump back over to this slide, we can see they have 19 consecutive years of growing that dividend. So certainly a dividend growth stock, but the dividend growth is quite slow. And we have to remember anytime a stock is growing dividends at a rate below the rate of inflation, that’s technically not dividend growth. That’s something to keep in mind that doesn’t get discussed very often. Now, if we jump back over to their consolidated cash flow summary from their recent earnings presentation, again, we can assess the sustainability of those dividend payments. Dividends are paid out of free cash flow. And if we look at the 9 months of 2024, free cash flow is 14.5 while dividends paid out was 8.4 billion. So that’s a very sustainable dividend. And if we look at the 9 months of 2025, we can see yes, dividends are higher. They’ve grown their dividend payouts, but free cash flow is higher as well. So it continues to look like an actually very healthy around 7% starting dividend yield with relatively low leverage. It’s at least in their target range. So what we can see is yes, that starting dividend yield looks sustainable at about 6.7%. But what about the valuation at its current prices? Well, to start, we can see they trade at an extremely low PE multiple, just 8.65. Essentially the opposite of what we just saw for Broadcom. A PE multiple far below the average of the S&P 500. But again, that doesn’t tell us how the stock is actually being valued because we have to account for future growth. And as we’ve already seen, growth is very slow for Verizon Communications. Now, with that being said, we can still use a dividend discount model to value Verizon Communications. If they’re growing revenues, earnings, and free cash flow at a rate of about 2 to 3% moving forward, then dividend growth of 2.25% is sustainable moving forward. And if they can achieve that dividend growth rate, that would give them a fair value of about $44.54, implying 10% upside from their current prices. So absolutely this is by no means a high growth stock, not even a medium growth stock. It’s a very mature company that’s a very capital-intensive business with a lot of debt on the balance sheet. But with that being said, it does look manageable. The dividend looks sustainable and based on just a 2 to 2.5% dividend growth rate, the stock actually does look slightly undervalued. So we may see this share price revert back to its intrinsic value. But don’t expect a lot of growth past that other than the starting dividend yield that you’ll be receiving close to 6.67%. So there you go. Those are two stocks that members of Congress have been recently adding to their portfolio. Very interesting! Broadcom now going at $351. per share I guess my Megalomaniac ambitions will remain on the distant back burner for the time being. By contrast, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is cheap, pays over 7 percent at this price. The expectation of lower interest rates may be the main reason for the interest by the Critters, but they may also be loaded up with inside information. 👍 It’s never too late to start. 😁 Look at the chart for VZ. It’s movement over years is bad. Buy some AVGO over the weekend, and sell it about noon on Monday. VZ seems to pay a reliable 7% dividend. This past week there has been a storm-the-battlements rally for certain tech companies; I suspect there will be some burnoff on them. Naturally, over time, well-run companies go up in value, but not on a straight line. 🤔 Free cash flow for VZ: https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/VZ/verizon/free-cash-flow I certainly wouldn’t buy VZ for capital appreciation, but it is rock solid for a 7% dividend—at a time when it is tough to get even 4% on a cd or bond (not to mention the likely hood that interest rates will drop further in the coming year). Capital appreciation due to falling interest rates isn’t unlikely, but would be a short-lived phenomenon. VZ could become a trap regardless, as direct-to-satellite builds out over the next few years. Fatter dividends are available elsewhere among various capital mgmt outfits, but they are interest rate sensitive and are not immune to economic fluctuations. Jim Cramer is an idiot. He gets on my nerves (typical NBC politics), but he’s no idiot. Is there an ETF that trades based on following insiders? You can’t simply buy a stock that insiders buy, because you would also have to track when they sell. They might not buy & hold. An ETF is probably the best way to ride the tech tsunami that’s been going on, assuming it has a track record of good performance. Years ago a financial journalist had a piece in one of the mags back then. He looked at the best performaing mutual funds (ETFs are kinda new to this old guy who types with my hands), then researched who the managers were, and found that the all best performing funds had been run by just a handful of the best managers. Even the middlin’ ones can keep track of a basket of stocks better than any one of us can. In “Beating the Street”, Peter Lynch suggested self-managed portfolios are probably best limited to just five stocks. Nanci Pelosi is the New Cathy Wood.

Title: Database maker ClickHouse raises $400M, acquires AI observability startup Langfuse

Time Published: 2026-01-16T21:49:01Z

UPDATED 16:49 EST / JANUARY 16 2026 by Maria Deutscher Open-source database maker ClickHouse Inc. today announced that it has closed a $400 million late-stage funding round at a $15 billion valuation. The Series D investment, which comes about six months after the company’s previous raise, was led by Dragoneer. It was joined by GIC, Index Ventures, Khosla Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, T. Rowe Price and WCM Investment Management. The round follows a year in which ClickHouse’s annualized recurring revenue rose by more than 250%. “Major platform shifts ultimately reward the infrastructure companies that sit closest to production,” said Dragoneer partner Christian Jensen. “As models become more capable, the bottleneck moves to data infrastructure.” A storage device is divided into segments called sectors. Usually, each sector holds a few hundred or thousand bytes. ClickHouse’s namesake database places columns in sectors that are immediately adjacent to one another. That approach enables it to perform data analysis tasks such as averaging product prices faster than many competing platforms. ClickHouse also speeds up queries in other ways. When a user searches a large dataset for a specific piece of information, the system avoids looking through sections of the database that don’t contain the relevant record. It takes a similar approach to speeding up data modification queries. ClickHouse only updates the specific records that a user wishes to change instead of the entire dataset. The company monetizes the open-source version of its database with a paid cloud version. ClickHouse Cloud, as the service is called, removes the need for customers to manage the underlying hardware or manually install updates. The administrative tasks that it doesn’t perform on users’ behalf can be automated through integrations with third-party management tools. The company disclosed that its cloud service has over 3,000 customers. Its installed base includes Meta Platforms Inc., Sony Corp., Lyft Inc. and other major tech firms. The company also divulged that it’s acquiring Langfuse GmbH, a startup with an open-source tool for monitoring large language models. Companies use Langfuse’s software to track the latency and infrastructure usage of their LLM-powered applications. Additionally, it collects data on the workflow through which a model generates prompt responses. Developers can use that data to identify the root cause of hallucinations and find a fix. Langfuse uses ClickHouse’s database to store the LLM telemetry it collects. Following the acquisition, the latter company will enhance the integration between the two products. ClickHouse says the goal is to make its database a more competitive choice for developers building AI applications. Some AI applications run on not one but two databases. One is used to process complex analytics queries while the other supports simpler, frequent data management tasks such as updating customer records. Systems geared toward the latter use case are known as transactional databases. ClickHouse plans to roll out the enhanced Langfuse integration alongside a managed transactional database based on PostgreSQL. Like Langfuse, the service will be integrated with the company’s namesake columnar store. AI applications can use ClickHouse to power analytics queries and the managed PostgreSQL service to perform transactional database tasks.

President Trump told Reuters on Wednesday that the "two Kevins," National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett and former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh, were his leading choices to replace Jerome Powell as Fed chairman. He may have narrowed it down to one Kevin. At a White House event Friday, Trump said he wants to keep Hassett, who regularly defends Trump's economic policies in TV appearances, in his current role, the Wall Street Journal reports. "I see Kevin's in the audience, and I just want to thank you. You were fantastic on television today. I actually want to keep you where you are, if you want ‌to know the truth," Trump said. Trump then turned to chief of staff Susie Wiles and said, "We don't want to lose him, Susie. We'll see how it all works out." Friday's remarks immediately boosted betting-market odds that Warsh will get the nod, the Journal reports. Interest-rate futures also shifted, with traders slightly dialing back expectations for a June rate cut, which would come at the first Fed meeting overseen by a new chair if one is seated right after Powell's term expires in May. Other names in circulation include Fed governor Christopher Waller and BlackRock executive Rick Rieder, with Trump saying this week he could decide within weeks. The search unfolds against the backdrop of a criminal probe into Powell, tied to whether he misled Congress about Fed building renovations. Two Republican senators say they will block any nominee until the widely criticized investigation is resolved, and Powell has called the probe part of wider efforts to pressure the Fed to cut rates. Trump has already vowed not to choose anyone who disagrees with him on lowering rates, raising concerns among lawmakers and on Wall Street that the next Fed chair could appear too closely aligned with the president. Some financial industry figures have argued Hassett is already perceived as too close to Trump to reassure bond markets, while allies of Warsh have been quietly lobbying for him. One Trump adviser tells the Journal that the favorite "sort of depends on the day." In the Reuters interview, Trump said he doesn't have any immediate plans to fire Powell because they're in a "little bit of a holding pattern with him." Asked about criticism of the investigation by senators who could block his choice for Powell's successor, he said: "I don't care. They should be loyal. That's what I say."

Title: Developers seek permission to replace Foxrock house with 10 new homes in €12m scheme

Developers are seeking permission for a €12.42 million scheme to transform a site in Foxrock that currently has a single home into a 10-house development, according to newly filed planning documents. Helnwin Ltd has applied to Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council for planning permission for the scheme that would see the seven-bed, six-bath Ashley on Hainault Road in Foxrock be demolished. It is proposed that the 430 sq m property would be replaced by 10 three-storey, detached houses. The housing will be comprised of two four-bed houses and eight three-bedroom homes. Each home would have two car parking spaces alongside electric vehicle charging points and visitors bicycle spaces. The 0.245 hectare site will have a density of 41 units per hectare, according to planning consultants John Spain Associates, with the homes being part-two, part-three storeys in height to “respond to the nature of the site and the surrounding residential dwellings”. The homes would be built in two rows leading away from the road, a site layout that the developer said was chosen to “avoid negative impacts” on neighbouring properties. The application referenced a precedent set by the approval of a similar planning application, which saw the lavish home of the late Liam Maye, Weaver’s Hall demolished and replaced by a block containing 50 apartments and a single bungalow. The house, called Ashley, sold for in the region of €2 million in February 2024, but the sale was delayed as the occupiers were seeking alternative housing following the deal. The property had been advertised as having “excellent potential” for further development in a “deservedly popular residential location”. Stephen Day of Lisney Sotheby’s International Realty in Blackrock said the property had been sold to a housing developer “with a very good track record of developing properties in South Dublin”. The sale price is included in a costing for the development attached to the planning application. The document details a total cost for the 10-home development of €12.42 million, including VAT, noting the per-unit cost of €1.24 million. Helnwin Ltd is a partnership between developer Myles Crofton and fellow property developer Bernard Doyle. Mr Crofton is the owner of the Renesca mansion on Cross Avenue, which he previously sought to demolish and replace with a series of homes. Mr Crofton built the Renesca home on the grounds of Chesterfield on Cross Avenue in Blackrock. He paid €47 million for the property in 2004, at the time making it the second most expensive Dublin home ever sold, second only to Walford, on Shrewsbury Road, which was sold for €58 million in 2005. Karin Crofton and Fionnuala Sherry are also listed as directors of the company in their filings to the Companies Registration Office (CRO). Ms Sherry is a former Eurovision winner, with the violinist winning the competition for Norway in 1995, and the wife of Mr Doyle. The developers had engaged in pre-application consultation with the council and amended the application in light of feedback from the local authority. Among the issues raised by the council was the lack of open space in the scheme. John Spain Associates noted in a report included in the application that “it is not feasible to provide good quality, accessible and usable public open space” in such a small site and suggested a contribution be paid to the council in lieu.

Title: Bitcoin sees $1.68B in weekly buys – Is BTC supply drying up?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/?p=562149
Time Published: 2026-01-16T18:00:18Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin’s structure favors continuation as institutions tighten supply and momentum stabilizes. Institutional accumulation continues to tighten Bitcoin’s available supply. BlackRock clients recently purchased $319.7 million worth of BTC. At the same time, 635 BTC, valued at $60.53 million, moved from Coinbase to an unknown wallet. This transfer reduced exchange-side liquidity directly. Additionally, spot Bitcoin ETFs accumulated approximately 17,700 BTC, equivalent to $1.68 billion, within a single week. That level of demand absorbed a meaningful share of the circulating supply. However, the price did not react impulsively. Instead, Bitcoin consolidated above key levels. Therefore, large players appear focused on positioning rather than short-term distribution. Consequently, sell-side pressure continues to weaken structurally, supporting price stability during consolidation. At press time, Bitcoin [BTC] was trading above the accumulation range between roughly $84,600 and $94,000, a zone where buyers absorbed repeated sell-offs through December. Price rebounded sharply from the lower boundary near $84,600, confirming strong demand. Since then, Bitcoin reclaimed the $94,000 level, which now acts as immediate support. This reclaim matters because it marks a shift from absorption to expansion. Meanwhile, RSI climbed from sub-40 readings to around 63, reflecting a decisive momentum recovery without entering extreme territory. At the same time, Parabolic SAR flipped below the price near $91,800, signaling a trend shift in favor of buyers. With price pressing above $95,500 and eyeing resistance near $106,600, structure favors continuation rather than a return into consolidation. Source: TradingView At press time, the MVRV ratio stood at 1.6909, after slipping 1.23%. This reading confirms that holders remain comfortably in profit. However, it does not reflect extreme unrealized gains. Historically, heightened distribution risk emerges at much higher MVRV levels. Instead, the recent decline shows mild profit compression rather than aggressive selling. Long-term holders continue absorbing volatility. Therefore, supply pressure remains contained. Moreover, the absence of sharp MVRV spikes suggests greed has not taken control. This balance allows Bitcoin to consolidate while maintaining a constructive structure. Consequently, profitability supports stability rather than signaling exhaustion. Source: CryptoQuant At the time of writing, Funding Rates flipped decisively positive, surging by 1,047.79% to 0.002875. This rebound reflects renewed long-term confidence after prior deleveraging. However, funding remains moderate in absolute terms. Traders avoid excessive leverage. This restraint reduces liquidation risk during pullbacks. Moreover, funding adjusts quickly alongside price fluctuations. That behavior indicates disciplined positioning rather than speculative excess. At the same time, leverage rebuilds gradually, not aggressively. Therefore, derivatives activity supports continuation instead of fragility. This environment contrasts sharply with overheated rallies. It favors persistence and controlled upside. Source: CryptoQuant Binance top trader data showed 57.11% of accounts were holding long positions, while 42.89% remained short, producing a Long/Short Ratio of 1.33 at press time. This positioning reflects a clear bullish bias without crowding. Importantly, longs dominate without reaching extreme concentrations. Shorts remain active, limiting one-sided risk. However, their presence also reduces downside acceleration. Therefore, positioning stays balanced. Traders express confidence while maintaining caution. This alignment supports structural stability and lowers forced liquidation risk. Consequently, Bitcoin maintains flexibility as the price explores higher levels. Source: CoinGlass Conclusively, Bitcoin’s market structure signals strength built on control rather than speculation. Institutional accumulation continues to reduce available supply, while the price holds above key accumulation levels. Momentum indicators support upside without overheating, and leverage rebuilds in a disciplined manner. Meanwhile, top trader positioning remains constructive without crowding. If these dynamics remain intact, Bitcoin is more likely to extend its advance than revisit lower accumulation zones.

Title: Trump Says He Doesn't Want to Lose Hassett to The Fed

President Donald Trump on Friday said he wants to keep Kevin Hassett as his economic adviser, a remark that many interpreted as indicating he is less likely to be nominated to head the Federal Reserve. “I see Kevin is in the audience and I just want to thank you. You were fantastic on television today,” Trump said, referring to Hassett’s appearance on the Fox Business Network earlier on Friday. “I actually want to keep you where you are, if you want to know the truth.” Hassett is currently the National Economic Director, the top White House economics position. He has been considered one of the top contenders to be appointed to head the Fed when chairman Jerome Powell’s term expires this spring. The other leading contender is Kevin Warsh, a former Fed official, leading to people to speculate that Trump is likely to choose between what the president has called “the two Kevins.” The Trump administration has also interviewed Rick Rieder, the chief bond investment manager at Blackrock, and Trump-appoointed Fed governor Christopher Waller for the position. Both are considered dark horses because of their lack of a close relationship with the president. “Kevin Hassett is so good, I’m saying, ‘Wait a minute. These Fed guys, certainly the ones we have now, they don’t talk much. I would lose you. It’s a serious concern for me,” Trump said. “We don’t want to lose him Susie. So we’ll see how it all works out, okay?” Susie Wiles, Trump’s chief of staff, was also in the audience. Although Trump’s remarks elicited laughter in the room, they sent the odds of Warsh getting the nomination soaring on Polymarket. Hassetts odds fell sharply, putting him not far above Waller.

Former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh soared ahead of National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett on prediction markets betting on the next Fed chair after President Trump on Friday hinted that Hassett might be out of the running. Trump did not reveal his final choice to replace Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, but said he would like to keep Hassett in his current role. “I see Kevin’s in the audience, and I just want to thank you. You were fantastic on television today,” the president said during remarks at the White House on Friday. “I actually want to keep you where you are, if you want to know the truth.” The odds of Warsh clinching the nomination jumped to 60% on Polymarket as of Friday afternoon, while traders placed just a 17% chance that Hassett would land the job – following weeks in which markets placed better odds on Hassett. Current Fed Governor Christopher Waller, who has been considered a long shot, came in at 15%. Traders saw just a 6% chance that BlackRock exec Rick Rieder could win the role. Warsh also jumped to 59% odds on Kalshi, another prediction market. Hassett and Waller got 18% and 14% odds, respectively. Trump has not set a specific date to name his pick for the next chairman. Powell’s term at the helm expires in May, though he could choose to stay on the board through 2028. He has so far declined to comment on whether he will remain a Fed governor. On Sunday, Powell publicly shared that he’s under criminal investigation for allegedly lying during congressional testimony last summer — a stunning development that came after years of Trump blasting the chair for failing to lower interest rates quickly enough. For weeks, the president has signaled he is looking at either Warsh or Hassett to replace Powell, adding that he has ruled out Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent “because he wants to stay where he is.” Rieder and Waller have also been interviewed for the role.

While Trump said he’d like to keep Hassett in his current job, it’s not impossible for him to win the nomination. After Fed Governor Adriana Kugler unexpectedly resigned last summer, Trump tapped Stephen Miran, then a top White House economic adviser. Miran refused to fully resign from his White House role, instead taking an unpaid leave of absence. Addressing White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles on Friday, Trump said, “We don’t want to lose him [Hassett], Susie, but we’ll see how it all works out.”

Title: Trump’s Open War With Jerome Powell Risks Damaging Commercial Real Estate

Time Published: 2026-01-16T17:08:52Z

© 2026 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy President Donald J. Trump’s war with the central bank of the United States, and Jerome Powell in particular, ratcheted up several DEFCONs this week. On Sunday night, Jan. 11, the Federal Reserve chairman released an extraordinary video, in which he recounted how Trump’s Department of Justice served him grand jury subpoenas and threatened a “criminal indictment” over his handling of a multibillion-dollar renovation to the Fed’s Eccles Building headquarters in Washington, D.C. Powell did not mince words or back down, and pointed the finger directly at Trump, implying the accusations surrounding the ongoing building renovations were a cover for the president’s frustrations that the Federal Reserve has not responded to Trump’s repeated desires that the benchmark Federal Funds Rate be lowered quicker from the 22-year high of the 5.25 to 5.5 percent target it reached in mid-2023. “The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president,” said Powell. Today, the benchmark short-term interest rate stands between 3.5 percent and 3.75 percent after Powell lowered it three times in 2025 — yet clearly not low enough for Trump’s liking. And, while many voices within the world of finance have avoided wading into political flights, the action set off immediate alarm bells. “I think this is all about Trump not wanting to lose the midterms,” said Chad Carpenter, founder and CEO of Reven Capital. “What does he have to do to not lose the midterms? He needs to keep GDP up, keep employment and the stock market up, and bring costs down, and, right now, short-term interest rates are still relatively high.” But the perception that the independence of the Federal Reserve is being meddled with poses a much greater risk than an isolated political spat between a central banker and the executive branch. “An independent Fed is operating off a dual mandate set forward by Congress of price stability and full employment, and on this front, the executive branch is trying to come in and exert more influence over monetary policy,” explained Brian Bailey, who spent 14 years at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and is now a senior researcher at commercial real estate loan servicer Trimont. “From that standpoint, you don’t want undue political interference creating additional factors that influence their decisions.” The negative reactions against Trump’s interference in Fed operations have been swift. Several top Republican senators and Trump allies have voiced their displeasure; numerous former Fed chairs and Treasury secretaries over the past 30 years signed a statement criticizing the move; and the right-leaning Wall Street Journal editorial board wrote, “In the annals of political lawfare there’s dumb, and then there’s the criminal subpoena federal prosecutors delivered to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.” However, across the commercial real estate spectrum, Trump does have his defenders. “Everyone knows what’s been going on: Trump has wanted an easing of monetary policy, and, frankly, that’s good for commercial real estate,” said Glen Kunofsky, founder and CEO of Surmount, an investment firm. “On the political and criminal indictment side, my view is that anything that puts pressure on the Fed to lower rates is a good thing.” Others in the industry criticized Powell’s record as Fed chair, which ironically began in 2018, when he was nominated by Trump during his first term, and continued through the 2020s after President Joe Biden kept him on to oversee the central bank coming out of the COVID pandemic. “Did Powell do such a good job? Eleven interest rate hikes in 12 months doesn’t sound rational to me,” said Adelaide Polsinelli, a vice chair at Compass. “Look at the repercussions of Federal Reserve policies: They’ve devastated the housing market and gutted real estate. How can you argue the actions of someone in his position were intelligent, or were consistent with historical analysis?” Under Powell’s watch, the Fed initiated the swiftest interest rate climb in 40 years, administered the painful medicine of quantitative tightening (whereby it reduced its $9 trillion balance sheet to less than $7 trillion, by selling short- and long-term U.S. bonds), and stood idly by as the 30-year rate on home mortgages shot up to its highest levels in two decades, mainly because of QT. Powell follows all his immediate predecessors who held the big chair in taking the blame for periodic nosedives in the economy: Janet Yellen kept interest rates too low for too long in the late 2010s; Ben Bernanke arguably responded too late to the housing bust in 2007-2008; and Alan Greenspan had the dot.com bubble explode on his watch in the early 2000s. “The Fed has a checkered history, but through it all the 10-Year [Treasury] figures out how to price itself,” said Alexander Goldfarb, senior research analyst at investment bank Piper Sandler, who noted the 10-Year Treasury has hung in the 4 percent range for much of the last year, as well as this week. “It goes up, it goes down a little, but credit spreads have been incredibly tight, debt is increasingly available across CRE capital markets,” he added. “So, yes, there’s drama at the Fed, and it provides great fodder for newspapers, but, ultimately, the market is speaking as far as access to capital.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average is actually up 0.63 percent since the Sunday night announcement of Trump’s investigation into Powell; the S&P 500 is up 0.67 percent — although this might be more due to the swift reaction from congressional Republicans in tamping down the feud before it got out of hand. Market strength aside, others in CRE argued against the move to hold a criminal indictment over Powell’s head. Carpenter defined it as “really wrong,” “baloney,” and “too strong a hand to play,” while Jon McAvoy, chief investment officer at PRP Real Assets, emphasized that Federal Reserve independence is “imperative to our nation.” “I really believe we have a mismatch in this country between short-term political appointees and elections with the need for the nation to have long-term financial stability,” he added. “And that’s what the Fed is supposed to help us with.” Historical precedent The complexities inherent in anything affecting leadership at the Federal Reserve are due to its intricate relationship between U.S. fiscal policy and monetary policy. The big fear, particularly among market watchers, is that by threatening Powell with criminal charges, Trump is setting a new precedent for how a president can act toward a Fed chair — in turn creating a situation where a nominally independent central bank can be browbeaten into action by the sitting president, particularly one presiding over nearly $40 trillion in public debt. “If there’s political pressure on the central bank without a change in the mandate, that’s problematic because it’s coming from the government having a fiscal need from the central bank,” said Juan Flores Zendejas, a professor of economics and history at the University of Geneva. “And that’s always bad news because this political pressure means you can damage the actual credibility, and even the capacity, of the central bank to succeed in doing what it’s supposed to do,” he added. Roughly $9 trillion in U.S. government debt — T-bills, T-notes, T-bonds, ranging from short-term to long-term — is scheduled to mature in 2026. But, as short-term interest rates remain higher than they were for much of the past 15 years, it becomes more expensive to refinance long-term maturing debt that was issued under the historically low interest rate regime that reigned from 2010 to 2022. For example, refinancing a portion of the national debt this year at a 2.6 percent interest rate, rather than a 3.6 percent, could potentially save the federal government hundreds of billions of dollars a year in interest payments going forward. “What [Treasury Secretary] Scott Bessent and Trump are trying to do is roll a majority of Treasury bills into short-term maturities, because they know they can control short-term, but not the long-term, interest rates,” explained Carpenter. “And the only way they can control the short-term rate is if the Fed lowers it — it’s a pure political move to apply pressure on Jerome Powell to lower rates.” The fear, of course, is that by cutting interest rates too quickly, the money supply could increase to a dangerous level, running the economy too hot and pushing consumer prices higher. “In a sense, you can artificially push rates down below the rate that the economy functions best at, and, from that standpoint, you could create inflationary pressures down the road,” said Bailey. To some economists, this play is straight out of the ancient history books, and one being initiated by Trump and Bessent by design to lower the threat of the $38 trillion national debt. “Every student of monetary policy history knows that governments want to monetize debt, and the politically easy thing to do is to inflate your way out of a debt problem,” said Christopher Thornberg, founding partner at Beacon Economics. “This has been done going back to Rome and the great inflation of the 3rd century CE. There’s nothing here that we haven’t seen before.” And then there’s the separate argument of the precedent concerning Fed independence altogether. Political pressure has been deployed in the past, and has largely been effective (although certainly not threats of imprisonment). Richard Nixon infamously pressured his friend and former White House economic adviser, Arthur Burns, after appointing him Fed chairman, even joking at Burns’s January 1970 swearing-in ceremony, “I respect his independence, however I hope that — independently — he will conclude that my views are the ones that should be followed.” Burns’s diaries, as well as the infamous recorded tapes of White House meetings, revealed that Nixon repeatedly implored Burns to “keep the money supply up!” and prioritize the president’s re-election goals over the broader economy. Lyndon B. Johnson also coerced Fed Chair William McChesney Martin in the 1960s, going so far as to shove him into a wall at his Texas Ranch. Long before there was a Federal Reserve, in the 1830s President Andrew Jackson waged (and won) an honest-to-god legal and political battle against Nicholas Biddle, president of the Second Bank of the United States, the 19th-century forerunner to the Fed, over allegations of favoritism toward wealth merchants and speculators. “We can start with there was precedence for this — Nixon, Johnson, Reagan, they all challenged and pressured their Fed chairs,” said Polsinelli. “This is not a new thing.” Others questioned the perceived need for the Fed to be an independent body to begin with. “I don’t think the Fed should be independent. I think the Fed should be hand-in-hand with the president,” said Greg Kraut, co-founder and CEO of KPG Funds. “I’ve never agreed the Fed should be an independent body. The whole idea of the Fed being independent is complete nonsense.” Polsinelli added that even if Powell and the Fed are seen as independent, it shouldn’t protect them from the consequences of poor policies. “It doesn’t mean that independence should shield Powell from review over mistakes or choices he’s made that have done harm to the economy,” she said. “Without questioning him, you have the opposite effect.” But Zendejas countered that any idea that the Fed is not democratically accountable to its dual mandate of price stability and full employment — one legally passed by Congress in 1977 — is both misconstrued and misguided. “This argument can be contested to the extent that this dual mandate is given by a government which is democratically elected, so in that regard it doesn’t mean the mandate can’t change,” he said. “But governments have given these mandates.” And no less an eminence than Jamie Dimon, chairman of J.P. Morgan Chase, said earlier this week that, “Everyone believes in Fed independence. … Anything that chips away at that is probably not a great idea, and in my view will have reverse consequences.” Uncertain times These reverse consequences that Dimon hints at have been carefully noted by financial analysts and seen in the failure of other countries. Francesco Pesole, a foreign exchange strategist at ING, the Dutch multinational banking firm, wrote a memo following news of the Powell investigation, calling the development “explosive,” and adding that any perceptions of the loss of Federal Reserve independence would fuel a “major depreciation” of the U.S. dollar. “The downside risks for the dollar from any indications of further determination to interfere with the Fed’s independence are substantial,” Pesole wrote. “A sharp steepening of the [bond] curve could take the dollar on a fall.” Aside from its impact on the dollar, higher long-term bond yields are one of the main symptoms of inflation, the horrible phenomenon of increased prices on just about everything, and these yields are unfortunately tied not just to investor sentiment toward the safety of U.S. Treasurys, but also to the fiscal responsibility of U.S. politicians to manage the nation’s annual budget deficits. Since 2020, the U.S. government, under both Trump and Biden, has averaged an increase in the budget deficit of $2.5 trillion per year. Just 17 years ago, in 2009, the entire federal debt was only $12.3 trillion. “We’re right on the edge of diving into a fiscal crisis,” said Thornberg. “It can get very ugly very quickly, and it will have massive ramifications for the global economy and for financial markets.” Even the idea of lower short-term interest rates has been criticized by some market players, especially after the emergency cuts initiated by Powell in 2020 and 2021 set the stage for price increases across the economy. Reven Capital’s Carpenter noted that “the lower the interest rate, the higher the inflation, and the perfect example of that was in 2021.” That year, interest rates were below 1 percent, and asset values shot through the roof as investors poured into hard assets like CRE to find yield that wasn’t there in fixed-income bonds, all while the economy ran hot against a dimly perceived supply-chain bottleneck. “Dropping rates inflates asset values and allows people to refinance at higher valuations (i.e. cap rates), so they’re borrowing more than normal, and it puts companies at financial leverage risk,” he said. “But, long term, you don’t want the rates super low -— you want fixed-income to make money on government debt, and you want realistic cap rates on commercial real estate.” Others in the market aren’t quite as concerned about the long-term threat of another bout of inflation stemming from artificially lower rates. “I think inflation is complete hogwash, and I think the idea of 2 percent inflation is B.S. — the standard rate should be 3 percent,” said Kraut, who said COVID and supply chains caused price spikes. “I don’t see any indication that if you lower interest rates it will lead to inflation. Lower interest rates will spur economic growth.” Kraut added that if the Federal Reserve doesn’t cut interest rates by at least 150 basis points this year, then he believes the U.S. will fall into “a major recession, almost a depression.” Even so, PRP’s McAvoy emphasized that “political manipulation of the Fed is a real concern,” and that while a risk premium for volatility is already priced into the bond market, “the question is whether this next moment [with Powell] will cause a need for that premium to have a future increase.” The more important point is the reason Fed watchers like McAvoy, Thornberg, Carpenter and even Dimon are so concerned about political manipulation of the Fed, and its impact on the strength of the dollar and bond market, is due to what has happened in other countries. In July, Rebecca Patterson, an economist who has held senior positions at J.P. Morgan Chase and Bridgewater Associates, wrote a New York Times op-ed once the first real rumblings of Trump encroaching on Powell’s independence could be heard. Patterson listed how Victor Orban in Hungary stacked the deck against his country’s central bank by adding handpicked council members to the monetary policy committee and passing laws in 2011 to strengthen his direct control over the bank. Since then, credit ratings agencies have downgraded the country’s debt to junk status, in turn raising borrowing costs across Hungary and causing its currency to weaken against the Euro. She also documented how Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan issued a decree in 2018 to assume total control across the country’s central bank, and has since hired and fired numerous monetary policymakers. The results speak for themselves: The Turkish lira has lost 88 percent of its value against the dollar since 2018, and inflation in Turkey rose from 15 percent to 88 percent within seven years, while the country’s 10-year government bond yields reached as high as 30 percent. Zendejas said the most pertinent parallel to Trump’s actions with Powell come out of Argentina, where then-President Cristina Fernandez fired Martín Redrado, president of the Central Bank, in January 2010 after he rejected her public demands that he resign for refusing to use the country’s foreign currency reserves to pay down the national debt. Zendejas said the messy fight between this chief executive and her central banker immediately led to a depreciation of the peso and an increase in inflation, which was already relatively high in Argentina. “It was a mess, and had a long-term effect on both the credibility of the central bank and its capacity to manage inflation and interest rates, and the capacity for Argentina to avert capital flight and stabilize its economy,” he said. Next steps Even without opening a criminal investigation, Trump won’t have to wait long to have a new leader at the Fed: Powell’s term expires in May, and the president will get to select a successor one way or another. For now, Senate Republicans like Thom Tillis and Lisa Murkowski have expressed their willingness to block Trump’s next Federal Reserve nominee until his actions against Powell are resolved, but at some point this year the Senate will need to take up a nominee brought forward by a president who demands lower interest rates and isn’t afraid to trample over institutional norms. “Are there bulwarks? If you asked the question 15 months ago, a lot of people would’ve been quick to answer a certain way,” said McAvoy. “Right now, enough folks are questioning the norms, and the strength of the norms, that no one would want to answer that affirmatively at this moment.” The list of potential successors to Powell is relatively short, and include former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, current Fed Governor Christopher Waller, BlackRock executive Rick Rieder and current Fed Governor Stephen Miran. But the name that stands out among them is current White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett, a man widely believed to be a Trump loyalist who has been close to the president since his first term in office. Just hours after Powell released his video to push back at Trump, Hassett made a television appearance in which he stated he “would expect that the markets would be happy to see that there’s more transparency at the Fed.” “This guy? Come on, this is Mr. Dow 36,000,” scoffed Thornberg, referring to the title of Hassett’s 1999 book that predicted a Dow Jones Industrial Average of 36,000 by 2002 or 2004 — which didn’t happen for more than 20 years after publication. “I think most economists view this guy with something between contempt and disrespect. You put him in, and see what the markets think of him. But I’ve been amazed at how benign the markets have been to all this chaos.” McAvoy also pegged Hassett as the favorite, pointing to his longtime allegiance to Trump. “Some would argue there’s a benefit to him because he seems to have been able to get Trump’s ear in understanding larger economic issues,” said McAvoy. “I don’t know whether or not he will be independent, but I’m sure during the confirmation process that will be the central issue.” Regardless of who succeeds Powell, and what comes next for the U.S. economy, there’s no doubt that by opening a criminal investigation into the existing Federal Reserve chairman, Trump has forever changed the relationship that body has had with the White House. “Trump’s challenging the narrative and calling out the inconsistencies, and that’s something people should want,” said Polsinelli. “The Fed chairman is not supposed to be in an ivory tower making decisions that affect you and me and our families without challenge.” But as Thornberg noted, Trump made his fortune in the 1980s by playing fast and loose with easy money policies and the junk bond market — and he eventually catapulted into personal bankruptcy that left his many creditors holding the bag for his own fiscal mismanagement. “Trump is the original ‘pump and dump’ guy, and has been since the dawn of time,” said Thornberg. “He has no interest in the long run, or even a decade from now. All he wants is wins right now, and he’s willing to sacrifice the future to get those instantaneous wins. “I think this is a terrible precedent,” he added.

Title: Trump Officials Vow to Keep All US Coal Plants Running

Trump administration officials vowed to keep US coal power plants operating, casting it as an imperative to meet surging electricity demand and drive a revival of the nation’s industrial base. “The goal is 100% open,” said Interior Secretary Doug Burgum. “That’s the standard we’re operating against.” Burgum’s comment came during the first meeting of Trump’s newly reconstituted National Coal Council, an advisory panel that Joe Biden let lapse during his presidency. President Donald Trump, by contrast, has sought to engineer a coal resurgence in his second term, including byrequiring some power plants to keep burning the fuel. The bullish Trump administration predictions for America’s coal — and the power plants that rely on it — contrast with a more skeptical view from analysts who point to generation from natural gas and renewables. The message comes as the Trump administration addresses concerns about rising electricity prices and consumer costs, an issue that weighs heavily on Republicans’ bid to keep control of the House and Senate in November’s elections. Focusing on the existing coal fleet works better as a short-term strategy, according to Andy Blumenfeld, director of data analytics at McCloskey by Opis. While they’re generating power now, many of the plants are old and will require significant maintenance if the administration expects them to remain in service for a while. And in the meantime, utilities will be able to turn to gas and nuclear capacity that will likely become more widely available over the next several years. “We need the power, and the coal units are there now,” said Blumenfeld. “But in the long term, they’re up against an aging coal fleet.” In a move aimed at addressing some of these issues, the Energy Department is putting aside as much as $525 million to upgrade or build coal-fired power plants, a move criticized by environmental groups. Trump has moved quickly to dial back regulations and subsidies that have encouraged emissions-free renewable power. Under Trump, the Energy Department also has issued emergency orders requiring some coal plants to keep running, and the Environmental Protection Agency recently rejected a bid by Colorado to force the closing of one of its coal plants in the central part of the state. Meanwhile, the Interior Department has also moved to open more federal land for coal leasing in North Dakota, Montana and Wyoming. “Seventeen gigawatts of coal generation are open today that would not have been open,” said Energy Secretary Chris Wright, attributing some of that shift to the short-termemergency ordersforcing plants to operate. “You will not see those coal plants close during this administration.” Wright said utilities are now calling the Energy Department in a bid to keep plants running, despite some states pushing to shutter the facilities. Burgum, who leads Trump’s National Energy Dominance Council, went even further, predicting new coal plant construction — though many analysts have foreclosed the possibility. The National Coal Council meeting on Thursday included discussion of options for maintaining and growing the nation’s fleet of coal plants, as well as opportunities to expand exports of the fossil fuel. The roughly 60-member panel includes executives from some of the nation’s top coal producers, such as Peabody Energy, Warrior Met Coal Inc., Hallador Energy Co. and Nacco Industries Inc.,as well as power utilities and co-operatives such as FirstEnergy Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp. Joe Craft, chief executive officer of Alliance Resource Partners, a Trump donor, is a member; Jim Grech, CEO of Peabody Energy is chairing the group; and Jimmy Brock, CEO of Core Natural Resources Inc., is vice-chair. US coal consumption has declined for years as utilities increasingly shift toward cheaper natural gas and renewables. Coal once accounted for more than half of the country’s electricity generation, but that share fell to about 17% in 2025 and is expected to slip to 15% this year. A boom in US electricity demand, however, has provided a near-term tailwind for coal producers. Utilities have delayed retirement of coal-fired power plants, while federal orders keep others running, supporting demand and contributing to a modest rebound in 2025. Electric generation from coal climbed 13% last year, driven largely by higher gas prices. The downward trajectory is expected to resume in 2026, according to government forecasts. During Thursday’s meeting, coal and utility executives warned about overdependence on natural gas as a US power source. Some urged doing more to protect America’s mines, others emphasized the need to keep rising electricity prices in check. Wright linked coal power to a thriving manufacturing sector, and Burgum said it’s intertwined with US efforts to win the artificial intelligence competition with China — both Trump administration goals. The immediate focus now is ensuring there’s enough electricity, especially for the data centers that are key to developing AI capabilities, said Randall Atkins, CEO of coal supplier Ramaco Resources Inc. and a member of the council who attended the meeting Thursday. “The objective is the data centers, and how we’re going to figure out how to power them,” Atkins said in an interview. Separately, Wright warned that if courts compel some of the world’s largest asset managers to divest coal-related assets, it could undermine efforts to buttress coal mining and electricity generation. That’s the potential outcome of a lawsuit alleging that BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc. and the asset management arm of State Street Corp. colluded to reduce coal output. Republican state attorneys general, led by Texas’ Ken Paxton, say the firms violated antitrust laws by using environmental, social and governance-related initiatives, including carbon-reduction alliances, to suppress production. Read More: BlackRock, State Street, Vanguard Must Face Antitrust Suit Fossil fuel advocates have criticized ESG initiatives as forcing capital away from oil, gas and coal. But former Trump Energy Secretary and Texas Governor Rick Perry has predicted that if successful, the lawsuit would take an estimated $18 billion in coal holdings off the asset managers’ books. He said that outcome would pose “a direct threat to coal companies’ ability to raise capital, finance infrastructure and support jobs.” Photo: The PacifiCorp Hunter coal-fired electrical generation plant in Castle Dale, Utah.

Davos braces for Trump's return. Weeks after attacking Venezuela, capturing its controversial leader, and reviving Greenland ambitions, the US president's presence is expected to raise the stakes at WEF's annual meeting. The Swiss Alpine town of Davos is once again welcoming the cream of the political, economic and cultural world for the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF). The event is taking place at a time US President Donald Trump is seeking to dismantle the international order: From upending established trade rules and mass withdrawal from international organizations, including the UN climate treaty, to capturing Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro following an attack on the capital Caracas and threatening to annex Greenland from close ally Denmark. Just days before the start of the WEF meeting, Trump threatened to impose tariffs on eight NATO allies, including Germany, France and the UK, if they don't support his quest to take control of the Arctic island, eliciting a forceful rebuke from the European allies. Trump's assault on the international rules that have largely been in place since World War II, and its impact on the global peace, politics and the economy is expected to be among the key topics during the five-day event beginning January 19 under the theme A Spirit of Dialogue. "Dialogue is not a luxury in times of uncertainty; it is an urgent necessity," said Borge Brende, WEF President and CEO. "At a critical juncture for international cooperation — marked by profound geoeconomic and technological transformation — this year's annual meeting will be one of our most consequential." Donald Trump will be joined by more than 60 heads of state and government, including German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Argentinian President Javier Milei, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, China's Vice Premier He Lifeng, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Syrian leader Ahmad al-Sharaa. Trump is leading the largest US delegation ever to Davos, comprising five cabinet secretaries and other senior officials. The delegation includes Secretary of State Marco Rubio, special envoy Steve ​Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, setting the stage for high-profile discussions on Ukraine, Venezuela, Gaza and Iran, where eyewitnesses have reported a brutal crackdown on anti-government protests. Trump is expected to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Kyiv's G7 allies — including leaders from Germany, Italy, France, the UK, Canada and the European Commission president — on the sidelines of the main event to seek US backing for security guarantees for Ukraine after a possible peace agreement with Russia. The strong US presence would be complemented by the first-ever "USA House" — a venue housed in a small church on the town's main Promenade street, where US officials will host events and network with investors. While geopolitical upheavals and the ensuing uncertainty are expected to dominate discussions, policymakers and business leaders would be keen to discuss ways to deal with other challenges confronting the global economy. The global economy has been relatively resilient despite heightened trade tensions and policy uncertainty, thanks in part to massive investments related to artificial intelligence (AI) in the US, which have propped up the world's biggest economy. But the projected global growth of 3.1% in 2026 is still not ideal, especially at a time when global debt has climbed to levels not seen since World War II. The debt situation in several African countries is especially concerning, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Global trade remains under pressure as countries adopt increasingly protectionist policies, such as imposing unilateral tariffs, increasing restrictions on foreign investment and tightening supply on critical minerals. Economic confrontation between nations and its consequences topped the WEF's annual Global Risks Report released on Wednesday. Artificial intelligence is another focus this year, with several events and talks dedicated to the frontier technology, much like at recent WEF annual meetings. Top tech leaders such as Microsoft's Satya Nadella, Nvidia's Jensen Huang and Google's AI chief Demis Hassabis will be at the event. AI is already showing a lot of promise in fields such as medicine and education and has seen trillions of dollars worth of investments made or promised over the past few years, even though many companies are currently struggling to find real-world use cases for the technology that offer good value. There are concerns about the technology's impact on jobs, many of which are feared to become redundant in the next few years. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, among this year's attendees, says that AI could eliminate half of all entry-level white-collar jobs in the next one to five years, underscoring a need for massive investment in reskilling. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video AI risks worsening the existing digital divide, with poorer countries failing to capitalize on the opportunities. There are also concerns about AI models perpetuating existing biases, spreading misinformation, and generating deepfakes. Misinformation and disinformation and cybersecurity are among the top global risks, according to the WEF risks survey, underscoring the need for effective regulations. This year's meeting would be the first without WEF founder Klaus Schwab at the helm. The German-born economist resigned in April 2025, amid allegations that he and his wife used WEF funds for personal use. An independent inquiry, however, found no criminal misconduct, only minor irregularities. Schwab has been succeeded by interim co-chairs Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, and Andre Hoffmann, vice chair of Swiss pharmaceuticals company Roche Holdings. This year's strong line-up of attendees comes as a boost for the organization after a tumultuous year. The organization that's been around since 1971 to foster dialogue now faces headwinds as multilateralism wanes and free trade comes under fire. Edited by: Uwe Hessler Editor's note: The piece, originally published on January 16, has been updated to reflect Donald Trump's tariff threats against eight countries for not supporting his plans to annex Greenland.

Title: Bitcoin’s “quantum” death sentence is causing a Wall Street rift, but the fix is already hidden in the code

The quantum computing threat challenges Bitcoin's status as "digital gold," prompting strategic shifts. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The consensus that Bitcoin has matured into “digital gold” faces a new fracture line on Wall Street, one that has little to do with daily price volatility and everything to do with the distant future of computing. Two prominent strategists named Wood are currently offering diametrically opposed roadmaps to global allocators for the world’s largest crypto asset. On Jan. 16, Christopher Wood of Jefferies eliminated his firm’s long-standing Bitcoin exposure, citing the existential threat posed by quantum computing. On the other hand, Cathie Wood of ARK Invest is urging investors to look past technical anxieties and focus on the asset’s distinct lack of correlation with traditional markets. This divergence highlights a critical evolution in how institutional capital is underwriting crypto assets in 2026. The debate is no longer merely about whether Bitcoin is a speculative token or a store of value. It has shifted toward a more complex calculation regarding survivability, governance, and the specific type of hedge investors believe they are buying. Christopher Wood, the global head of equity strategy at Jefferies, built a reputation for navigating market sentiment with his “Greed & Fear” newsletter. His latest move cuts against the grain of two years of institutional accumulation by removing a 10% Bitcoin allocation from his model portfolio entirely. In the reallocation, Jefferies shifted the 10% Bitcoin sleeve into assets with older narratives: 5% into physical gold and 5% into gold-mining stocks. A $4.6T wealth machine is turning “execution only” into real advice, and it starts with a tiny-sounding sleeve. The rationale is rooted in tail risk rather than immediate market dynamics. Wood argued that advances in quantum computing could eventually undermine the cryptography that secures the Bitcoin network. While most investors still file quantum threats under “science projects,” Jefferies is treating the possibility as a disqualifying factor for pension-style, long-horizon capital. This anxiety is finding validation among technical experts who argue the timeline for a threat is compressing faster than markets realize. Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole, argued that a quantum computer could break Bitcoin in just 2 to 9 years without an upgrade, with a high probability in the 4- to 5-year range. Edwards describes the market as having entered a “Quantum Event Horizon,” a critical threshold at which the frontier risk of a hack is roughly equal to the time required to reach upgrade consensus and execute a rollout. In the Jefferies framing, the uncomfortable reality is that a quantum computer will someday be able to crack Bitcoin because its security assumptions rest on cryptographic primitives that are vulnerable to those powerful future machines. The specific threat involves adversaries “harvesting” exposed public keys now to store them and decrypt the private keys later when hardware matures. Estimates suggest more than 4 million BTC are held in vulnerable addresses due to reuse or older formats. This leaves a “harvest now, decrypt later” attack vector that could compromise a massive share of the total supply. Grayscale, one of the largest digital-asset managers, has sought to ground the 2026 market conversation by labeling quantum vulnerability a “red herring” for this year. Its analysis suggests that, while the threat is real, it is unlikely to drive prices in the near term. Considering this, Grayscale argued that in the longer run, most blockchains and much of the broader economy will need post-quantum upgrades anyway. This view aligns with developments within the crypto sector. Bitcoin’s 2028 doomsday clock: How ‘Quantum-Proof’ marketing manufactures FUD. Andre Dragosch, Bitwise Europe's Head of Research, has also countered the “immediate doom” narrative by emphasizing the sheer computational gulf between current technology and a viable attack. While Dragosch validated concerns about older wallets, he argues that the network itself remains extraordinarily robust. He wrote: “Bitcoin now runs at 1 zeta hash per second, equivalent to more than one million El Capitan-class supercomputers. That’s orders of magnitude beyond the reach of today’s quantum machines – and even beyond those expected in the foreseeable future.” Considering the above, ARK Invest is doubling down on the argument that Bitcoin belongs in modern portfolios precisely because it behaves unlike anything else. In a 2026 outlook note, ARK’s Cathie Wood leaned on correlations rather than ideology. Her argument is clinical: Bitcoin’s return stream has remained weakly linked to major asset classes since 2020, therefore offering a way to improve portfolio efficiency. ARK supported this view with a correlation matrix using weekly returns from January 2020 through January 2026. The data shows Bitcoin’s correlation with gold at 0.14 and with bonds at 0.06. Data shows there is no definitive top or bottom correlation between Bitcoin, gold, the S&P 500, and U.S. property. Perhaps most strikingly, the table shows that the S&P 500’s correlation with bonds is higher than Bitcoin’s correlation with gold. Wood uses this data to argue that Bitcoin should be viewed as a valuable diversifier for asset allocators seeking higher returns per unit of risk in the years ahead. This represents a subtle but important shift in messaging. ARK is reframing Bitcoin from “a newer version of gold” into “an uncorrelated return stream with asymmetric upside.” For investors watching the split between two of the market’s high-profile strategists, the immediate takeaway is not that Bitcoin is broken. It is that the institutional narrative is maturing into something more demanding. Jefferies is effectively saying that a hedge that might require a contentious protocol-level migration is not the same as physical gold, even if both assets can rally in the same macro regime. This is because gold does not require coordination, upgrades, or governance to remain a valid asset. On the other hand, Bitcoin is a hedge that ultimately depends on its ability to adapt. Conversely, there is a counterargument that traditional finance faces greater near-term peril from quantum computing than Bitcoin does. Dragosch said: “Banks depend heavily on long-lived RSA/ECC keys across authentication and interbank communications. Once quantum machines can break these, systemic attacks become possible – far earlier than any realistic threat to Bitcoin’s decentralized architecture.” With this in mind, ARK is effectively saying that the benefits of portfolio diversification can justify a BTC position, even if the asset is still evolving.

Title: THE SCARCITY DOCTRINE: 5 Assets Securing the 2026 Material Cycle

January 16, 2026 11:18 ET | Source: Equity Insider Equity Insider VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Jan. 16, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Equity Insider Market Intelligence Brief – The 2026 economy has hit the wall of physical limits. After a decade of rewarding "potential," the market has pivoted to demanding proof. Speculation is dying; tangible assets are repricing. The market has run out of patience for 'maybe.' Investors are trading speculative PowerPoint slides for real-world assets you can touch, mine, and measure. They are allocating to the Choke Points, wading through the physical and digital bottlenecks that control modern civilization. From the silver in your smartphone to the energy powering the AI grid, the era of 'cheap and easy' is over, signaling that the race for physical essentials has begun. The companies profiled below share one trait: They own the inventory. They are the load-bearing walls of the 2026 economy. This isn't a rotation. It is a scramble for the essentials. THE DIAGNOSTIC HUB Ventripoint Diagnostics (TSXV: VPT) (OTCQB: VPTDF) is erasing the geographic blind spot in cardiac care through its landmark partnership with the Nisg̱a'a Valley Health Authority to deploy AI-driven 3D heart mapping. In 2026, the most acute bottleneck in healthcare is visibility. For many, a heart diagnosis requires a long-distance flight or a months-long wait… That's the type of delay that can turn a treatable condition into a tragedy. Ventripoint is essentially putting the power of a multi-million dollar MRI room into a portable ultrasound. It’s a tech bridge that brings world-class heart diagnostics to rural communities that have been waiting years for a "clear picture". This is not a pilot project; it is a blueprint for sovereign healthcare infrastructure. By bringing hospital-grade diagnostics to the point of care, Ventripoint is proving that you don't need to move the patient to see the problem. The equipment is already in the clinic; Ventripoint provides the AI 'brain' that turns a standard ultrasound into a life-saving diagnostic tool.

While the macro argument for gold has been won, the execution argument is just beginning. Lake Victoria Gold isn't just looking for gold; they’re building the 'factory' to extract it. They are setting up shop right next door to one of the most productive gold mines (Barrick's) on the planet, turning historical data into a modern production engine. Recent drilling didn't just find gold; it proved the deposit goes far deeper than anyone expected, potentially rewriting the scale of the entire project. This is the Scarcity Doctrine in action: LVG is not just hunting for a discovery; it is manufacturing a mine. By combining a near-term production profile with the bonanza-grade discovery leverage at Tembo, the company is securing its position as a major gold factory in one of the world's most productive belts.

It's about owning the daily ritual of the modern professional. People are ditching sugar-heavy drinks and the stigma of vaping for a discreet, focused boost that fits right in their pocket. On January 12, the company accelerated this roadmap by engaging McKinney Regulatory Science Advisors to navigate the complex scientific and regulatory path for its oral pouch pipeline. This is a high-execution pivot. In late 2024, Doseology secured a critical manufacturing agreement via its U.S. subsidiary, positioning the company for commercial production of caffeine, nicotine, and functional ingredient pouches. The strategic importance of this move is underscored by the involvement of retail legend Joseph Mimran, who joined as a Strategic Advisor following the acquisition of Feed That Brain™. Mimran's expertise in building category-defining brands like Joe Fresh is being applied to Doseology's mission: providing a clean, functional alternative to energy drinks and tobacco. By owning the delivery method, Doseology is aiming to become the 'daily ritual' for a generation that demands performance without the crash.

(TSXV: AMCO) (OTCQB: AMCOF) is moving aggressively to unlock the next major silver district in Nevada, having just commenced its 2026 field program at the Trinity Silver Project in Pershing County. On January 12, the company deployed advanced drone-borne magnetometry to map a system interpreted to be structurally similar to the world-class silver deposits of Bolivia. They aren't guessing where the silver is; they are using advanced tech to restart a district with a proven history of multi-million-ounce production. The data is already surfacing. Recent grab samples on newly consolidated ground have returned bonanza grades of up to 1,690 g/t silver and 4.33 g/t gold. Think of silver as the 'digital glue' of 2026. Without it, the AI revolution stops. Americore is hunting for this essential tech-metal in Nevada, one of the safest and most proven mining jurisdictions on the map. Americore is ground-truthing a historical giant in the safest mining jurisdiction on Earth. Holding high-grade silver inventory in a Tier-1 jurisdiction like Nevada is the ultimate strategic play. Read this and more news for Americore Resources news at: https://americoreresources.com/news THE IMMUNO-ENGAGER GT Biopharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: GTBP) has officially unlocked the door to the $362 billion solid tumor market, announcing the IND submission for GTB-5550 to the U.S. FDA. While the immuno-oncology sector is crowded, the "Choke Point" remains the same: getting the immune system to effectively attack solid masses. GT Biopharma's proprietary TriKE® platform solves this by engineering a molecular bridge. GTB-5550 is a dual-nanobody "Tri-Specific Killer Engager" (TriKE) that tethers a patient's Natural Killer (NK) cells directly to B7-H3 expressing tumors, driving proliferation and killing power simultaneously. This is a decisive expansion. While the company is already enrolling patients for myeloid blood cancers, this new IND opens the aperture to a market orders of magnitude larger—including prostate, breast, and lung cancers. With a cash runway extending into Q3 2026 and a patient-friendly subcutaneous dosing profile, GT Biopharma is moving from "Science Project" to "Clinical Scale," positioning itself as the primary "delivery system" for the next generation of solid tumor immunotherapy.

Title: New World Finds its Destiny Revealed – A Shut Down Date of January 31, 2027

Full Content:
We knew the end was coming. We have known it was going to happen since late October when Amazon announced that they were purging their gaming studios, preferring to pursue a future built on an AI driven Snoop Dogg path than anything approximating a world. Dreams of Middle-earth crumbled and when it came to New World… well, this is what I wrote at the time. Then there is New World. That title is a dead man walking if ever there was one. We all know it. It is just a question of how much longer it will last. I won’t claim to be a clairvoyant in having predicted the obvious. As it turns out, I wasn’t even pessimistic enough. In my new year’s predictions I allowed that Amazon would announce the game’s closure, but that it might last through the end of 2026. In a surprise, especially to myself, I may have hit that one on the nose. Welcome to a New World… please exit through the gift shop Yesterday Amazon made an announcement that New World would shut down on January 31, 2027. The text of the announcement, since the support site will go away as soon as the game is gone, reads as follows: A few months ago we shared with you, our valued community, that no additional content would come to New World: Aeternum after the Nighthaven seasonal update. We also said more details on what’s happening next, alongside other essential information, would soon follow. Today, we’re here to share updates and provide transparency on where the game goes from here. New World: Aeternum will officially be taken offline from all platforms on January 31, 2027. On January 15, 2026, the title will be delisted and no longer available for purchase. Players will still be able to play New World: Aeternum on their purchased platform, and we are extending the Nighthaven season until the servers are taken offline on January 31, 2027. We want to thank the players for your dedication and passion. We are grateful for the time spent crafting the world of Aeternum with you. Together we built something special. While we are saddened to say goodbye, we’re honored that we were able to share so much with the community. It has been our pleasure to work on New World: Aeternum and evolve this unforgettable adventure with you all. We look forward to one more year together, and giving this fantastic adventure a sendoff worthy of a legendary hero. From the bottom of all our hearts, thank you for sharing this world with us. I am a bit surprised Amazon kept their promise. Back in October they said they would give at least six months notice on the fate of New World. I would not have been at all surprised if they had decided to ignore that and plead special circumstances requiring an early shuttering of the game. So if you still want to play some more of New World, you have time. If you have never played it… well, the opportunity has passed for you. As noted in the quoted section above, the game was delisted and made unavailable for purchase yesterday. There was also a short FAQ appended to the announcement, which reiterates some of the points. So it will be around and they’ll keep it running. You can finish out your completionist needs, but there won’t be anything new. As for the history of the game as we enter into its final chapter… well, it was a strange ride. Amazon announced a business model of “buy the box” with a cosmetic cash shop, which was enough to move a million units pretty quickly when it launched at the end of September 2021. In the first week Steam showed it putting up big numbers, beating out the perennial favorites of the time, CS:GO and Dota 2. SteamDB numbers at 19:04 UTC on Sunday Oct 3rd That led to some amazing server queues. Server queues on Tuesday of launch week 25,001 queued up for a server… that is a hell of a queue for a server that was set to hold something like 2,000 players back at launch. But Amazon had a plan for that! They had their special sauce server technology that let them spin up new servers. There were issues, but no less than Bezos himself was talking to the press about having a hit game on his hands. And then it started going wrong. Not enough planning? Too much success? There was the launch in late September and by early December Josh Strife Hayes has a whole what went wrong video chronicling the problems and missteps of the team. By May of 2022 it was the subject of a Death of a Game video, another run through the litany of mistakes. But it didn’t go away. The team worked on the problems, released updates, and kept on going. Nothing could get that day one mojo back however. The Steam numbers declined and never bounced back anywhere close to their peak. Our group kept at it until February, then jumped over to Lost Ark. I kept an eye on the game, but every time I went back to poke my nose in, my old server had gone MIA and I had to pick a new one. But the team was still able to get a rise out of their audience… but not in a good way when they tried to rename, rebrand, re-genre the whole thing for the console launch. Old World, New Name They were clearly trying to distance themselves from the PC title and the initial announcement made people wonder if this was a new game, something different that what was out there, something only for consoles that would leave PC players behind. It was confusing in the moment. I summed up my reaction in meme form. Re-enactment of my moment of discovery… On Steam, the core remaining audience felt betrayed and the review bombing commenced. That had to sting… The team had to go into damage control mode, having realized that they had screwed up badly. Not for the first time. So the PC players felt alienated and the console customers were not enough to make up the difference. The team kept on working, but there was nothing for it. The reputation had been set. It was yesterday’s new with nothing splashy and new enough to revive its fortune. From the right angle one might be surprised that it lasted as long as it did. And who knows how the financials looked. Amazon is big enough that they can hide anything in their quarterly results. But the ongoing downturn in the industry post-Covid did for it in the end. Amazon didn’t just dump New World, it bailed on anything like deep or serious titles when the layoffs came. I will likely put together a more detailed timeline of my own views and involvement with the game when the end comes. I have a year to dwell on that. Our group dug into it for a while, and it did have its charms. It remains in my top ten most played titles on Steam, ahead of Lost Ark, if that is any consolation. We shall see how things play out over the next 12 months. Maybe somebody will buy it. Related: Never played it, but I remember around its launch hoping it was something decent. Of course also around that time I still had some faith in Amazon as a company overall. How quickly all these things change. LikeLike It definitely had things going for it and could have survived on a vibe of being sufficiently different from WoW. But the team also ignored many of the lessons of the past 20 years of online games and ended up making so many mistakes. They didn’t even have a test server until months later, so would just push patches to prod, breaking things in ways that players spotted within minutes. Had nearly a million concurrent players, and blew it. We’ve heard that story before. LikeLike I didn’t buy it and now I’m a tad regretful about that, because it might be fun to join as a tourist during the final year. The console experiment is especially sad because one recurring lesson in this space is: never give up your core audience. Whatever market you have identified to replace them almost never materializes – at a minimum it is a risk in the “foolhardy” range. Looking at you, Star Wars: Galaxies… LikeLike Yes, I am always irate when people suggest that a game could get a bazillion new players if only they would completely betray and abandon their current users to suit the tastes of that one individual. Changing horses mid-stream is complicated and has an extremely low success rate. I can think of a couple, but they mostly prove that the original idea was wrong. LikeLike I was going to do a post on it but you’ve covered everything. I’ll probably do one at some point before it closes for good but there’s no rush now. A year’s notice is plenty of time to get anything done that’s still left to do, I guess. It would be great if Amazon would sell it but they won’t, of course. It would make an excellent purchase for a smaller company with a focus on running online games, even if they only ran it in maintenance mode like Gamigo runs Rift. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn’t need the kind of small change a company like that would be willing to pay. Or indeed any amount of money from anyone. Maybe someone will put an emulator together. A year is a good length of time to gather all the data they’d need. LikeLike I am a bit surprised they won’t let anyone buy in this far out. I have the impression that the window is usually closer to a few months than a year, but I have zero data points to back that up and really don’t care to research it right now for a random comment, so I may be mistaken. I hope that the Rust developer (a) is serious and (b) Amazong goes for it. It seems like 25 million would be better than 0 million, but there may be a tax write off or something else behind the scense they feel is worth more. LikeLike Δ Email Address: Email Posts to Me!

Increasing Prevalence of Infectious and Zoonotic Diseases Strengthens Vaccine Demand: The rising incidence of contagious canine diseases such as rabies, parvovirus, and distemper continues to pose health risks to pets and, in some cases, humans. Concerns around zoonotic disease transmission have encouraged governments and veterinary bodies to strengthen routine vaccination programs. Advances in vaccine formulations, including combination vaccines, enable broader disease protection with fewer doses, improving compliance among pet owners. As awareness of disease prevention increases, both public and private initiatives are expected to further support global demand for canine vaccines. Segmentation Analysis: By Type of Vaccine Core Vaccines led with 42.3% share due to their essential role in preventing major canine diseases, such as distemper, parvovirus, and rabies. Combination Vaccines is the fastest-growing segment with CAGR of 9.1% as they offer multiple protections in a single dose, reducing stress for pets and lowering treatment costs for owners. By Disease Targeted Rabies led with 38.7% share due to regulatory mandates in most countries, high mortality risk of the disease, and widespread awareness among pet owners. Lyme Disease is the fastest-growing segment with CAGR of 9.4% due to rising awareness of tick-borne diseases in dogs and increasing pet outdoor activities. By Distribution Channel Veterinary Hospitals & Clinics led with 44.1% share as they provide professional guidance, proper vaccine storage, and administration, ensuring safety and compliance. Online Pharmacies is the fastest-growing segment with CAGR of 10.2% as digital adoption increases among pet owners seeking convenience and cost savings. By End-User Pet Owners led with 46.5% share due to the rising pet adoption, increasing disposable income, and growing awareness of preventive care drive consistent demand.

Title: Germans should work more – Merz

Time Published: 2026-01-16T14:44:21Z

Germans should put in more work to revive the country’s moribund economy, Chancellor Friedrich Merz has stated. Merz, who once chaired the supervisory board of BlackRock in Germany, has also acknowledged the country’s “strategic mistake” of abandoning nuclear power and cutting itself off from cheap Russian oil and gas, which have forced up energy prices and sent the economy into a two-year recession. In a speech on Wednesday, the chancellor lamented that “labor costs in our country are simply too high,” while the “productivity of our economy is not high enough.” He urged Germans to commit to “greater economic output… through more work.” “With work-life balance and a four-day week, the prosperity our country enjoys today cannot be maintained in the future - and that’s why we have to work more,” Merz insisted. Last August, the chancellor stated that the “welfare state as we have it today can no longer be financed with what we can economically afford.” He noted that welfare spending hit a record €47 billion ($55 billion) in 2024, and continued to rise. That same month, Merz acknowledged that the German economy had slid into a “structural crisis,” with large sectors “no longer truly competitive.” In spite of these adverse economic trends, Merz prioritized the militarization of the country, citing a perceived Russia threat. Moscow has repeatedly dismissed claims that it harbors aggressive intentions toward its Western neighbors as “nonsense.” In May, the chancellor pledged to transform the German military into the “strongest conventional army in Europe.”To this end, the German government has changed its budget rules to permit long-term defense spending beyond the €100-billion fund. Last October, Politico, citing internal government documents, claimed that Berlin was planning to shell out some €377 billion ($440 billion) for a comprehensive rearmament program, which is expected to stretch beyond the 2026 budget.

Today’s top news: A surprising new investment juxtaposes the face of Ethereum with the face of all content. 📌 What Happened BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) announced a $200M investment into the financial platform initiative led by YouTube creator MrBeast. BitMine is backing the platform’s broader vision to offer on-chain financial products, including DeFi integrations tied to BitMine’s Ethereum treasury and MrBeast’s massive user base (200M+ subscribers). Key data points: The investment news coincided with broader momentum for BitMine’s public narrative in 2026, fueled by ETH’s +12% start to the year. 🗣️ What They’re Saying Jeff Housenbold, CEO of Beast Industries, said the firm would explore ways to “incorporate DeFi into our upcoming financial services platform” 🧠 Why It Matters This investment is notable for a few reasons. First, this is the first time we’ve seen a crypto DAT use its capital for a meaningful investment outside of crypto tokens. Most DATs simply raise capital and buy their respective token (i.e. BMNR and ETH), and if holders are lucky, the team will squeak out some additional ROI via yield. Tom and team are going a different route by using growth capital to make “moonshot” bets. And that makes BMNR a much more interesting bet than some other DATs out there (you get the ETH upside + the moonshot upside). This is also meaningful for potential mainstream adoption. MrBeast’s platform is huge and his new finance-focused app is a perfect opportunity to get crypto finance into retail. Overall this feels like a major statement from Tom Lee—BMNR is going on offense, not just playing defense in 2026.

Title: Rust Exec Reacts To Amazon Killing New World: ‘Games Should Never Die’

Time Published: 2026-01-16T13:55:28Z

Amazon Game StudiosNew WorldRust New World was once the crown jewel in Amazon’s rising gaming ambitions. Developed in-house, the MMO initially exploded in popularity on Steam and seemed to have decent legs in the notoriously competitive genre. Less than five years later, it’s officially being killed. Servers will go offline in January 2027. The news has prompted a reaction from many who are tired of big games vanishing so quickly after launch, including an executive at Rust maker Facepunch Studios. “25m, final offer Amazon Games,” the London-based company’s COO, Alistair McFarlane, wrote in response to the news on X. “Games should never die,” he added, before going on to juxtapose Amazon’s approach to online games with Facepunch’s. “As with everything we do at Facepunch, empower the community.” when someone asked what the Rust maker buying New World would look like. “Give them control, make servers publicly hostable. A game will live forever in the hands of a dedicated community.” The writing for New World has been on the wall since last fall. Despite recently releasing new updates and seasonal content changes appearing to come and go as planned, Amazon announced in late October that the game would be going on life support with no meaningful additions planned in the future. The servers would remain open and operating âthrough 2026â to allow the community âtime to continue their adventures in Aeternum.â Games should never die. — Alistair McFarlane (@Alistair_McF) January 15, 2026 While Amazon is technically holding up that end of the bargain, remaining fans probably weren’t expecting the tech giant to kick the new year off with a full-blown death sentence. “We want to thank the players for your dedication and passion. We are grateful for the time spent crafting the world of Aeternum with you,” an unattributed blog post that went up on the game’s website this week reads. “Together we built something special. While we are saddened to say goodbye, weâre honored that we were able to share so much with the community.” New World is no longer for sale but anyone who already owns it can still re-download the game and play until January 31, 2027. Will there be any refunds? Of course not. Can you still buy premium in-game currency for real money? Strangely, yes. “Beginning July 20, 2026, players will no longer be able to purchase Marks of Fortune or anything else in game,” reads the new FAQ. Why not unlock everything and make all cash transactions in the game free? No idea. All of this stems from Amazon’s wider pivot away from internal game development, with mass layoffs last fall that included not only the end of New World but seeming cuts to other projects including a Lord of the Rings MMO. The company hasn’t confirmed if that project is dead or still being shopped around to other outside development partners. Amazon is also set to publish the upcoming Tomb Raider games, including this year’s Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis, a remake of the original game. Donât miss the latest reviews, news and tips.

Title: BlackRock vs. Blackstone: What every would-be homebuyer needs to know
URL: https://nypost.com/2026/01/16/business/blackrock-vs-blackstone-what-every-would-be-homebuyer-needs-to-know/
Time Published: 2026-01-16T13:51:56Z
Full Content:
BlackRock, Blackstone – what’s the difference? It’s a question that a lot of folks – journalists included – don’t seem to be crystal clear about after President Trump made a bombshell pledge last week to crack down on big private equity firms who have bought up huge chunks of the US residential real estate market. That’s why BlackRock – the world’s biggest money manager run by Larry Fink with some $14 trillion in assets — has built a “rapid response” crisis team to, among other things, distinguish itself from Blackstone, the world’s largest private equity firm run by Steve Schwarzman, On The Money has learned. The big message: BlackRock is not the firm that’s hoovering up all the houses and allegedly creating a nationwide affordability crisis. You’re probably thinking of that other firm. On Wall Street, mind you, there’s zero confusion about who is who. BlackRock, whose voluble CEO Fink is a fixture on financial TV, is the asset-managing giant that seems to own a massive slug of just about every public company you can think of. But it’s Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman – who was often photographed alongside the president during Trump’s first administration – who is now in the crosshairs of the White House over his habit of scooping up single-family homes. The problem, BlackRock officials tell On The Money, is that they’ve been getting inundated with social media accusing the money manager of profiting on the backs of average Americans. And it’s not just a bunch of dudes in their mom’s basement slinging mud at the firm. Celebrities and influencers – right-wingers among them – have joined the confused BlackRock bashing, spurred by Trump’s recent calls to address the affordability crisis by ending the buying of single family homes, they tell On The Money. “You wouldn’t believe how much of our day is consumed by this bullshit,” said one executive at the big money manager. The official cited, for example, an X post from September by comedian Rob Schneider which stated “The administration must stop the single home buying hoarding monopoly and GIVE A TARIFF or TAX on the companies that are SPECULATING and turning YOUNG PEOPLE into FOREVER RENTERS; BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street.” To set things straight, BlackRock’s new crisis team has set up a social media account @BlackrockFact. Following the news from Trump, the team swung into action posting that “Other US Investment firms are buying single-family real estate – BlackRock is not one of them. We do not buy individual houses.” Yes, the trolling reached new heights last week after the president posted on his social media site, Truth Social, that he is “immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes, and I will be calling on Congress to codify it. People live in homes, not corporations.” Those steps have yet to materialize and, people at Blackstone tell me, they won’t make a dent in the home affordability problem — even if Trump gets congressional buy-in to do it. That’s because the buying, I am told, is taking place in markets like the Sunbelt where lack of housing stock isn’t a huge issue.

Never miss a story. Truth be told, there are good reasons why the two companies get confused. In fact, their names are similar because they were once the same company. Fink, after leaving his job as a trader at a big Wall Street bank, started BlackRock as an asset-management subsidiary of Schwarzman’s PE firm back in the late 1980s. A few years later in 1994, while BlackRock was growing, Fink decided to buy himself out. The rest is history. Schwarzman has often lamented this given the size of the business Fink ultimately created. The two have maintained a somewhat interesting rivalry, although Schwarzman clearly isn’t hurting, with a net worth of $48 billion, according to Forbes. Still, it might be time to understand the difference between a rock and a stone. Advertisement

You can no longer buy it, as of this week Amazon’s colonial fantasy MMO New World (latterly rebranded New World: Aeternum) is no longer available for purchase as of yesterday, and will be taken offline for good from 31st January 2027, the publishers have announced. The news follows the release of the game’s final major update back in October, amid mass layoffs at Amazon. Alongside the similarly ill-fated Crucible and Breakaway, New World was once a key plank of Amazon’s push to become a big mover in the games industry - amplifying its existing success as a provider of software and web services, and luring yet more innocent souls into the toxic swamp of the Amazon Prime subscription business. Announced in 2016, it underwent several delays amid reports of corporate dysfunction in Amazon's embryonic studio empire, eventually launching out of beta in 2021, with a storyline conclusion landing in 2022. Alice Bee (RPS in peace) was mildly enthused by New World at launch, calling the game “a fresh, swashbuckling MMO that's still very grindy early on”. Ed Thorn (also RPS in peace) liked the emphasis on crafting. It had over 700,000 players on Steam on release day. But then it proceeded to lose over 90% of its players in a matter of months. I never played New World myself, mostly because I try to avoid anything associated with Amazon, but it never struck me as particularly fascinating from afar – familiar combat and quest mechanics with some convoluted magic settler politics. Still, I’m sorry for any New World developers who’ve lost their jobs as a result of this latest “sunsetting”. In general, I'll take a lacklustre MMO over Jeff Bezos's desire to move humans into giant, Amazon-run space stations. The game’s live service will continue to operate before the servers are pulled, with recurring world bosses and bonus weeks. The devs will also keep an eye out for bugs and performance issues. But there will be no more content additions or server merges. You’ll be able to buy in-game currencies such as Marks of Fortune until July 20, 2026 – beware that Amazon are not offering refunds for such purchases. “We want to thank the players for your dedication and passion,” the devs write on their official site. “We are grateful for the time spent crafting the world of Aeternum with you. Together we built something special. While we are saddened to say goodbye, we’re honored that we were able to share so much with the community." Any New World veterans reading? I’d like to read some reminiscing. Rock Paper Shotgun is better when you sign in Sign in and join us on our journey to discover strange and compelling PC games.

Title: The Venezuela Technocracy Connection

In the early morning hours of January 3, 2026, the United States military launched military strikes on Venezuela and captured President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores. Maduro and Flores have since been transported to the New York City to face charges relating to gun crimes and cocaine trafficking. The move has divided the MAGA base—and the American public more generally—with a large portion of President Donald Trump’s base viewing it as a betrayal of the principles he claimed to champion. Specifically, Trump has claimed for years he would not start new wars of aggression. While Trump has stated that taking out Maduro is not about launching new wars but instead a calculated attack to take out a man he blames for America’s fentanyl crisis, the facts tell another story. In May 2025, the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) released its 2025 National Drug Threat Assessment (NDTA). This report mentions Venezuela trafficking fentanyl to the US a total of zero times. Instead, it blames Mexican cartels for the manufacturing and trafficking of fentanyl. This should come as no surprise to anyone paying attention, as these facts are common knowledge among the US government and drug-trafficking researchers. A second key point is that although Trump and neocon Secretary of State Marco Rubio have repeatedly sought to tie Maduro to drug cartels, there remains scant evidence for the claim. The US government previously claimed Maduro was the head of the drug-trafficking group Cartel de los Soles (also known as the Cartel of the Suns). However, many skeptics have claimed the group doesn’t actually exist. During Trump’s first term, Maduro was indicted as the alleged leader of this cartel. In 2025, during his second term, Cartel de los Soles was officially designated a foreign terrorist organization. However, when Maduro was brought to NYC and officially charged, the US Department of Justice dropped the allegations from their indictment. The lack of charges relating to Cartel de los Soles is a signal that the US government does not believe it has strong enough evidence to convict Maduro in court. Instead, they have changed their tune and are now claiming Maduro was involved in cocaine trafficking. Hours after the raid and capture of Maduro, Trump held a press conference in which he made it perfectly clear that, despite official claims of targeting drug traffickers, the US government’s interest lies in gaining control over Venezuela’s oil industry. Make No Mistake – Venezuela is About Oil and Empire During a Saturday morning press conference, US President Donald Trump made it perfectly clear that despite claims of going after drug traffickers, the US government is interested in taking over the Venezuelan oil industry. pic.twitter.com/AJiyrh83j9 “We’re going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country,” Trump stated. In 2007, Venezuela nationalized oil projects, seizing assets from companies such as ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips after they refused to accept terms that would give the state-owned Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA) majority control. In contrast, companies like Total, Chevron, Statoil (now Equinor), and BP agreed to the restructuring and retained minority stakes in their Venezuelan projects. Trump has claimed that these actions were a theft of American oil and that part of the US presence in Venezuela will be to take this oil. “In addition, Venezuela unilaterally seized and sold American oil, American assets, and American platforms costing us billions and billions of dollars. This constituted one of the largest thefts of American property in the history of our country. Considered the largest theft of property in the history of our country,” Trump said at the Saturday morning press conference. When pressed by journalists about his comments regarding the US “running” Venezuela, Trump responded by claiming that the oil companies would cover the costs of improvements to Venezuelan oil infrastructure. “Well, we’re gonna be running it with a group and we’re gonna make sure it’s run properly. We’re gonna rebuild the oil infrastructure, which will cost billions of dollars. It’ll be paid for by the oil companies directly.” However, Trump also appeared to suggest that US taxpayers would subsidize oil companies to rebuild the infrastructure. “They will be reimbursed for what they’re doing, but, that’s gonna be paid. And we’re gonna get the oil flowing the way it should be,” Trump claimed. In an interview with NBC News on Monday, Trump made a similar statement. “I think we can do it in less time than that, but it’ll be a lot of money,” he said. “A tremendous amount of money will have to be spent and the oil companies will spend it, and then they’ll get reimbursed by us or through revenue.” With Trump admitting that a major motivation for taking out Maduro was to benefit oil companies, it’s important to ask which companies are involved and who holds shares in them. Chevron, ExxonMobil, and ConocoPhillips were involved in Venezuela’s oil sector before the nationalization under Hugo Chávez and during the subsequent US sanctions era. BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street are the majority institutional shareholders of all three companies, typically controlling around 20-25% of the shares in each (with Vanguard and BlackRock often holding the largest stakes among institutions). Larry Fink is the co-founder, chairman, and CEO of BlackRock. He’s also the current Interim Co-Chair of the World Economic Forum. Fink also maintains a close relationship with Donald Trump, having known him for over 40 years due to both men having been involved in the Manhattan financial scene. In fact, in March 2025 it was announced that Larry Fink had consulted with Trump before he secured the purchase of two ports in the Panama Canal for BlackRock. Given Trump’s close relationship with Larry Fink, combined with BlackRock’s significant investments in major U.S. oil companies such as Chevron, ExxonMobil, and ConocoPhillips, these are more than likely influencing factors in the U.S. policy toward Venezuela’s oil sector. Fink is not the only billionaire benefiting handsomely from the capture of Maduro and the US occupation of the Venezuelan oil industry. Among the billionaires celebrating the US aggression is Paul Singer, a billionaire hedge fund manager whose firm, Elliot Investment Management, has long sought to acquire CITGO Petroleum, the US-based subsidiary of Venezuela’s state-owned oil company PDVSA. In November 2025, a U.S. judge approved a $5.9 billion bid by an Elliott affiliate (Amber Energy) to purchase shares in CITGO’s parent company (PDV Holding) through a court-organized auction aimed at satisfying creditors’ claims against Venezuela. The sale still requires final approval from the U.S. Treasury Department and other regulators. CITGO’s assets include three major oil refineries (in Louisiana, Texas, and Illinois), pipelines, terminals, and more than 4,000 CITGO-branded gas stations across the United States. With Trump relaxing sanctions on Venezuelan oil following the removal of Maduro, Singer stands to benefit to the tune of billions if the CITGO sale is eventually approved. Coincidentally, Singer was a major donor to Trump’s presidential campaigns, as well as to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). US Representative Thomas Massie has also claimed that Singer has already spent more than $1 million in an attempt to defeat him in his upcoming reelection bid. According to Grok, Paul Singer, globalist Republican mega-donor who’s already spent $1,000,000 to defeat me in the next election, stands to make billions of dollars on his distressed CITGO investment, now that this administration has taken over Venezuela.https://t.co/hq1STlEyAq It’s quite obvious that oil is one of the major drivers behind the US kidnapping of Maduro, but drugs and oil alone do not fully explain why Trump is desperate to have control over this region. In the early 20th century, a movement emerged around a political theory known as Technocracy—a system in which government and society would be managed by technical experts, often involving technology-focused solutions. Early proponents claimed that Technocracy would lead to better management of resources and the protection of the planet. However, this system of governance by technological experts and their technology would also involve a loss of privacy, as well as centralization of power and the management of all human behavior. One of the most influential proponents of Technocracy was a man named Howard Scott, a writer and engineer who founded the Technical Alliance in New York City in 1919. Scott believed that business owners lacked the necessary skills and data to reform their industries, and thus control should be handed over to engineers and scientists. In 1932, Scott and fellow technocrat Walter Rautenstrauch established the “Committee on Technocracy” at Columbia University. The group would eventually splinter, with Scott leading Technocracy Incorporated, while technocrat Harold Loeb headed the rival Continental Committee on Technocracy. In 1938, Technocracy Incorporated released a publication that outlined its vision for a Technocracy and their plan for merging North America and parts of central America into a single continental unit which they called a “Technate”: Technocracy is the science of social engineering, the scientific operation of the entire social mechanism to produce and distribute goods and services to the entire population of this continent. For the first time in human history it will be done as a scientific, technical, engineering problem. There will be no place for Politics or Politicians, Finance or Financiers, Rackets or Racketeers. Technocracy states that price and abundance are incompatible; the greater the abundance the smaller the price. In a real abundance there can be no price at all. Only by abandoning the interfering price control and substituting a scientific method of production and distribution can an abundance be achieved. Technocracy will distribute by means of a certificate of distribution available to every citizen from birth to death. The Technate will encompass the entire American Continent from Panama to the North Pole because the natural resources and the natural boundary of this area make it an independent, self- sustaining geographical unit. [emphasis added] A 1940 map from Technocracy Inc. clearly shows this vision included Canada, the United States, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central American countries—including Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Guatemala, and others. The fact that Panama was envisioned as part of the Technate should not be forgotten in light of Larry Fink’s efforts to purchase ports in the Panama Canal. The Technocrats also imagined controlling parts of Venezuela and even Colombia. The 1940 map shows portions of northern Venezuela and eastern Colombia absorbed by the Technate. Colombia’s place in the proposed Technate adds important context to Trump’s recent threats of military action in the nation. The Technocrats were not only focused on incorporating Central and South American nations into the Technate. They aimed to spread their techno-tyranny as far north as Greenland. In a July 1940 issue of Technocracy magazine, Howard Scott and Technocracy Inc. explicitly advocated for acquisition of Greenland: “The government of the United States should take immediate action to acquire these territories and others, such as Greenland and the Galapagos Islands. The acquisition of these territories should be a mandatory part of the program of Continental defense for immediate achievement—either by purchase, negotiation, or the force of arms. The original Technocrats’ plans for taking control over Greenland has repeatedly been echoed by Trump since taking office in 2025. Following the kidnapping of Maduro, Trump and allies have renewed their calls for taking the island. On Monday, Trump’s top adviser and deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller claimed that Greenland belonged to the United States and that the US military could seize the semiautonomous Danish territory. “Nobody’s going to fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland,” Miller told Jake Tapper on CNN. “We live in a world, in the real world, Jake, that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power. These are the iron laws of the world since the beginning of time.” On Tuesday, the Trump White House reiterated the potential for military action against Greenland, telling Reuters: “The president and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilizing the U.S. military is always an option at the commander-in-chief’s disposal.” By Thursday, Trump was floating a plan to pay Greenlanders between $10,000 to $100,000 per person to convince them to secede from Denmark and join the United States. On January 3rd, Katie Miller—the wife of Stephen Miller—posted a meme of Greenland overlaid in American flag colors with the single word “SOON.” Notably, Katie Miller was an adviser and spokesperson for Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and then an employee of him directly before leaving to start a podcast. Katie Miller, the wife of psycho Stephen Miller, calling for taking Greenland.Trump is the perfect puppet for the Technocrats and helping fulfil the original Technocrats plan of the North American Technate which just so happens to include Greenland and Venezeula. https://t.co/L4hHT110L3 The fact that both Stephen and Katie Miller are publicly advocating for the US takeover of Greenland—given their proximity to Musk—is significant. Elon Musk’s grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was a research director for Technocracy Incorporated of Canada and national chairman of the Social Credit Party. Musk is simply following in his grandfather’s footsteps as he and the numerous Technocrats surrounding Trump work to bring about the original vision of the American Technate. As The Last American Vagabond has been reporting for years, it has become increasing clear that we are witnessing the MAGA movement—which largely believes it is the “resistance” to the “globalist elite”—capitulate and make excuses as Trump stacks his administration with Technocrats, including members and attendees of the secretive Bilderberg Group, the World Economic Forum, and the WEF’s Young Global Leaders program. I outlined these connections in numerous articles in 2025, including Meet The Peter Thiel Acolytes in Donald Trump’s 2nd Administration, Meet the Man Whose Philosophy Has Influenced Peter Thiel and the Technocrats, and Welcome to the Palantir World Order. I highlighted the fact that under Donald Trump, two members of the steering committee of the Bilderberg Group—Peter Thiel and Alex Karp—are running Palantir and securing an increasing number of military-industrial complex contracts. This is yet another clear sign that Trump is not fighting the “deep state.” One prime example of this Technocratic deep state nexus is Michael Kratsios. Kratsios is one of dozens of Peter Thiel acolytes in the second Trump administration. He was appointed by Trump to serve as Science Adviser to the President and Director of the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy. Kratsios previously served in a similar role during the first Trump administration, as well as Acting Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, and policy specialist on artificial intelligence, drones, quantum computing, and cybersecurity. He also worked for two of Peter Thiel’s funds, Thiel Capital and Clarium Capital. In June 2025, Kratsios attended the Bilderberg meeting in Stockholm, Sweden. Why is @MichaelKratsios, Trump's Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology, attending Bilderberg? Remember, this is the same guy I reported has worked for two of Peter Thiel’s funds, Thiel Capital and Clarium Capital: https://t.co/toIOJG35LA pic.twitter.com/I2dEMGC7LU Kratsios is also part of Trump’s efforts to limit how states can regulate Artificial Intelligence. Speaking at the 2026 Consumer Electronics Show, he said the White House was preparing a legislative proposal to establish a national AI framework and prevent what he described as market fragmentation caused by inconsistent state rules. There is simply no denying that Donald Trump is helping usher in the Technocratic State backed by the likes of Palantir goons Peter Thiel and Alex Karp, Zionists, and modern-day Technocrats such as Elon Musk, David Sacks, and Howard Lutnick. What we are witnessing with Venezuela and Greenland is one more step in the completion of the American Technate and one step closer to the vision of a global government.

Title: Rust Director Just Offered Amazon $25 Million to Get New World and Keep It Alive

It didn't take long for Amazon to decide when New World would be taken offline. As you might remember, the gaming division of the giant corporation announced that no more content would be made for the game just three months ago, while also quietly canceling the in-development The Lord of the Rings MMO project. Yesterday, Amazon revealed that New World had been delisted from stores, making it unavailable for new purchases, and clarified the date the servers will go offline forever: January 31, 2027. While that's over a year away, having a definitive shutdown date is a particularly sad occurrence for any MMO. Unlike regular games, MMOs are actual virtual worlds inhabited by thousands of players on each server, creating permanent communities and social structures such as guilds. For some players, losing access is a bit like losing connection to places and people you've come to appreciate. That's why communities often fight to keep them alive one way or another. That sentiment is indeed very strong for New World, which was doing better with the latest updates released by the developers and was actually trending upward in player counts - just not as much as Amazon desired. The game's community has discussed ways to keep the game alive; there's precedent for it, chiefly with City of Heroes, the superhero-themed MMORPG created by Cryptic Studios and later acquired by NCSoft. When NCSoft shut down the game in 2012, fans spun up a private server, and the server code leak in April 2019 led to multiple private servers. One in particular, called Homecoming, eventually emerged above all others, and NCSoft granted Homecoming an official license to host the game in 2024. That was about the best outcome New World fans could hope for. However, in a veritable twist, Alistair McFarlane, COO and Company Director at Facepunch (the British developer behind Rust and Garry's Mod), tweeted a $25 million 'offer' to purchase the game from Amazon, adding that 'games should never die'. Needless to say, having an actual professional game studio pick up the game would be far better. Amazon also demonstrated they are not actually averse to the idea; as part of their mass gaming layoffs, they sold the upcoming MOBA, March of Giants, to Ubisoft. The difference is that in that case, they sold the game alongside the development team based in Montréal, Canada, whereas most of the New World team is likely already gone. This would make it hard for a game like New World to sustain itself over time. Unlike sandbox games like Rust or Garry's Mod, the MMO is mostly themepark-based, meaning it sustains itself on developer-made content rather than user-generated content. Even if it acquired the license, Facepunch would still have to build a small team to keep it going and add new content every once in a while. We've reached out to Facepunch to ask whether McFarlane's offer was genuine in the first place and will update this story if and when they respond.

In a July 1940 issue of Technocracy magazine, Howard Scott and Technocracy Inc. explicitly advocated for acquisition of Greenland: “The government of the United States should take immediate action to acquire these territories and others, such as Greenland and the Galapagos Islands. The acquisition of these territories should be a mandatory part of the program of Continental defense for immediate achievement—either by purchase, negotiation, or the force of arms. The original Technocrats’ plans for taking control over Greenland has repeatedly been echoed by Trump since taking office in 2025. Following the kidnapping of Maduro, Trump and allies have renewed their calls for taking the island. On Monday, Trump’s top adviser and deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller claimed that Greenland belonged to the United States and that the US military could seize the semiautonomous Danish territory. “Nobody’s going to fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland,” Miller told Jake Tapper on CNN. “We live in a world, in the real world, Jake, that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power. These are the iron laws of the world since the beginning of time.” On Tuesday, the Trump White House reiterated the potential for military action against Greenland, telling Reuters: “The president and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilizing the U.S. military is always an option at the commander-in-chief’s disposal.” By Thursday, Trump was floating a plan to pay Greenlanders between $10,000 to $100,000 per person to convince them to secede from Denmark and join the United States. On January 3rd, Katie Miller—the wife of Stephen Miller—posted a meme of Greenland overlaid in American flag colors with the single word “SOON.” Notably, Katie Miller was an adviser and spokesperson for Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and then an employee of him directly before leaving to start a podcast. Katie Miller, the wife of psycho Stephen Miller, calling for taking Greenland.Trump is the perfect puppet for the Technocrats and helping fulfil the original Technocrats plan of the North American Technate which just so happens to include Greenland and Venezeula. https://t.co/L4hHT110L3 The fact that both Stephen and Katie Miller are publicly advocating for the US takeover of Greenland—given their proximity to Musk—is significant. Elon Musk’s grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was a research director for Technocracy Incorporated of Canada and national chairman of the Social Credit Party. Musk is simply following in his grandfather’s footsteps as he and the numerous Technocrats surrounding Trump work to bring about the original vision of the American Technate. As The Last American Vagabond has been reporting for years, it has become increasing clear that we are witnessing the MAGA movement—which largely believes it is the “resistance” to the “globalist elite”—capitulate and make excuses as Trump stacks his administration with Technocrats, including members and attendees of the secretive Bilderberg Group, the World Economic Forum, and the WEF’s Young Global Leaders program. I outlined these connections in numerous articles in 2025, including Meet The Peter Thiel Acolytes in Donald Trump’s 2nd Administration, Meet the Man Whose Philosophy Has Influenced Peter Thiel and the Technocrats, and Welcome to the Palantir World Order. I highlighted the fact that under Donald Trump, two members of the steering committee of the Bilderberg Group—Peter Thiel and Alex Karp—are running Palantir and securing an increasing number of military-industrial complex contracts. This is yet another clear sign that Trump is not fighting the “deep state.” One prime example of this Technocratic deep state nexus is Michael Kratsios. Kratsios is one of dozens of Peter Thiel acolytes in the second Trump administration. He was appointed by Trump to serve as Science Adviser to the President and Director of the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy. Kratsios previously served in a similar role during the first Trump administration, as well as Acting Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, and policy specialist on artificial intelligence, drones, quantum computing, and cybersecurity. He also worked for two of Peter Thiel’s funds, Thiel Capital and Clarium Capital. In June 2025, Kratsios attended the Bilderberg meeting in Stockholm, Sweden. Why is @MichaelKratsios, Trump's Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology, attending Bilderberg? Remember, this is the same guy I reported has worked for two of Peter Thiel’s funds, Thiel Capital and Clarium Capital: https://t.co/toIOJG35LA pic.twitter.com/I2dEMGC7LU Kratsios is also part of Trump’s efforts to limit how states can regulate Artificial Intelligence. Speaking at the 2026 Consumer Electronics Show, he said the White House was preparing a legislative proposal to establish a national AI framework and prevent what he described as market fragmentation caused by inconsistent state rules. There is simply no denying that Donald Trump is helping usher in the Technocratic State backed by the likes of Palantir goons Peter Thiel and Alex Karp, Zionists, and modern-day Technocrats such as Elon Musk, David Sacks, and Howard Lutnick. What we are witnessing with Venezuela and Greenland is one more step in the completion of the American Technate and one step closer to the vision of a global government.

Daily Tech News 16 January 2026 Top Story The best graphics cards for gaming in 2026. (Tom's Hardware) At #2 is Nvidia's 5070 Ti, and at #5 is the 5060 Ti, both of which have ceased to exist. The best options for building a new PC with DDR4 RAM you already have. (Tom's Hardware) Both systems include the 5060 Ti, which as we have just noticed, has gone to the great parts bin in the sky. Nvidia has rebutted claims that the 5070 Ti and 5060 Ti are "end-of-life", insisting that all cards are still shipping and are just shagged out after a long render. (PC Magazine) The fact that you can't actually buy them is clearly a skill issue. Git gud, scrub. Hardware Unboxed - an Aussie hardware review channel - was planning a market roundup of currently available 5070 Ti models, and reached out to their industry contacts for review cards. There were no review cards to be had anywhere. (YouTube) Their contacts in the Australian retail market confirmed that there was no stock of the 5070 Ti at distributors at all, echoing recent reports from Germany and Japan. And Asus told them, and subsequently confirmed, that the 5070 Ti was "end-of-life", had ceased production, and would not be restocked. Then Nvidia... Clarified... That all RTX 5000 series cards are still in production, and Asus walked back earlier comments and agreed that the 5070 Ti is still in production. Hardware Unboxed requested - again - a review sample. There has been no response as yet. AMD meanwhile is working with its board partners to prevent GPU price hikes. (Notebook Check) Good luck with that. The 8GB 9060 XT seems to have bounced back up from its recent low price - it was briefly selling below MSRP - but it and the three 16GB cards (9060 XT, 9070, and 9070 XT) are all in stock. As is the 32GB 9700, though that model is quite expensive. Tech News TSMC plans to spend $56 billion on new production facilities and equipment this year. (WCCFTech) That's equal to three Nanyas. Reprompt is - or was, it's just been patched - a Copilot exploit that, once you clicked on the link, kept stealing your data even after you closed Copilot. (Hot Hardware) It worked like most so-called "Prompt Injection" vulnerabilities: It asked the AI for your data, and the AI helpfully handed it over because it has less self-interest than the average mycoplasma. This particular instance has been patched, but it was active in the wild for four months before Microsoft took action. This is why even people who use AI tools are up in arms about Microsoft integrating it directly into their operating system. If you use AI through your browser, it stops the moment you close the tab. Copilot never stops until you kill it with fire. Hot Hardware has a detailed article on removing it that involves running unsigned code directly out of GitHub because that may actually be safer than leaving Windows untouched. US senators are demanding answers from X (Twitter), Meta (Facebook), and Alphabet (Google) on sexualised deepfakes. (Tech Crunch) Answers to questions like "How do I do it?", "Does it have pictures of Sydney Sweeney?", and "You're not recording this are you? Stop recording right now!" Italy's privacy watchdog is under investigation for corruption and embezzlement. (Reuters) I am shocked, shocked, to see corruption and embezzlement going on in here! The Minisforum N5 Air is a $499 5-bay NAS. (Liliputing) It's a cheaper version of the N5 with a plastic rather than metal case, but otherwise almost identical. Apart from five 3.5" drive bays, it has room for three M.2 SSDs (with two running only at PCIe 4.0 x1 speed and one at x2), and includes a Ryzen 255 CPU, room for two DDR5 SODIMM modules (none as standard, so beware of that), and a whole lot of ports: OCuLink, two USB4 ports, 10Gb and 5Gb Ethernet, three USB3 10Gb ports, and HDMI. One of those USB3 ports is inside the system to host a boot device so that you can dedicate all the drives to data. The best office mini-PCs review by Notebookcheck. (Notebookcheck) Top spot goes to the Apple Mac Mini M4 Pro. With 64GB of RAM and 1TB of SSD, though, it costs more than three times as much as the same configuration for the Minisforum AI X1 at #5. (They list the 32GB model, but I bought the 64GB model.) The FDA has announced a recall of chocolate bars from Spring & Mulberry. (Southern Living) Then we have number four: Crunchy Frog. We use only the finest baby frogs, dew-picked and flown from Iraq, cleansed in the finest quality spring water, lightly killed, and sealed in a succulent, Swiss, quintuple-smooth, treble-milk chocolate envelope, and lovingly frosted with glucose. And what is this one: Spring Surprise? Ah, that's one of our specialities. Covered in dark, velvety chocolate, when you pop it into your mouth, stainless steel bolts spring out and plunge straight through both cheeks. Everything I ordered during my definitely not drunken New Years Eve shopping spree has now shipped. The SSDs doubled in price and the memory tripled the next day. I do need to pick up an AM4 CPU to use it all - the motherboard is on its way - but those are cheap and readily available.

Posted by: CrotchetyOldJarhead at January 16, 2026 05:42 AM (3Ope8) 41 Mary Poppins PPP I hope you are here today Last time you were here you mentioned that you felt numb and can't feel God. That's not unusual for all people of faith at some time or another. Here are some thoughts on that from a Christian perspective: https://tinyurl.com/yuz5arh4 I am praying for you. Posted by: FenelonSpoke at January 16, 2026 05:48 AM (Nx5jP) 42 Yeah, I'm not believing a word from Nvidia on that 5070 Ti/5060 Ti walkback. They said the same thing about the availablility of their cards this time last year and it all turned out to be B.S., and that was before memory prices skyrocketed. Once they finally got their cards into the supply stream the prices were well above MSRP and still are for the higher VRAM cards, especially the 5080 and 5090 which have never come close to MSRP. So maybe they'll keep selling 5070 Ti and 5060 Ti but you probably aren't going to enjoy paying $1000 for what's supposed to be a $750 card, or $650 for what's supposed to be a $430 card. AMD can make some real headway here in the midrange GPU market if they don't shoot themselves in the foot.

Shares are trading mixed in Asia after Wall Street broke a two-day losing streak, edging back toward record levels BANGKOK -- Asian shares were mixed Friday after Wall Street broke a two-day losing streak and edged back toward record levels, helped by advances for Big Tech companies like Nvidia. U.S. futures advanced and oil prices slipped. Tech shares regained momentum after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., a major supplier to the industry, reported strong profits and investment plans. TSMC gained 3% early Friday and Taiwan's benchmark Taiex was up 1.9%. The frenzy around AI has sent Nvidia and other superstar stocks to dizzying heights, stirring criticism that their prices had shot too high. Nvidia rose 2.1% on Thursday after TSMC’s Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang said it’s seeing “continued strong demand” in an encouraging signal for the entire AI industry. TSMC’s stock that trades in the United States rose 4.4% on Thursday. The gains also followed the signing of a U.S.-Taiwan trade deal involving $250 billion in new investments by Taiwan’s semiconductor and tech companies in the U.S. In exchange, the Trump administration will cut tariffs on Taiwanese goods. The deal aims to establish a strategic economic partnership and upgrade U.S. industrial infrastructure. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 shed 0.3% to 53,936.17, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng gave up 0.6% to 26,770.56. The Shanghai Composite index lost 0.3% to 4,101.91. China is due to report its economic growth data for 2025 on Monday. Forecasts are for the economy to have expanded at about a 4.5% annual pace, slowing from earlier in the year. Elsewhere in Asia, South Korea's Kospi rose 0.9% to a record 4,840.74. The benchmark has been trading at record highs for weeks, helped by a recovery in confidence in AI-related shares. Samsung Electronics gained 3.5%. In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.5% to 8,903.90. India's Sensex rose 0.4%. Wall Street steadied on Thursday as stocks related to artificial-intelligence bounced back. The S&P 500 rose 0.3% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.6%. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.2% to 23,530.02. Easing oil prices also helped to calm investors' jitters. Early Friday, a barrel of benchmark U.S. crude cost $59.21, up 14 cents from a day earlier. It sank 4.6% on Thursday after Trump said he had heard “on good authority” that plans for executions in Iran had stopped amid widespread protests against the country’s leadership. Brent crude, the international standard, added 10 cents to $63.86 per barrel. It dropped 4.1% on Thursday. Financial markets took Trump's comments about Iran as a signal that tensions flaring above some of the world’s largest oil deposits could ease, which in turn could lower the possibility of disruptions to oil supplies. Earnings reporting season for big U.S. companies continued to pick up pace, meanwhile, with several more big financial companies delivering their results for the last three months of 2025. “As we dive into the heart of earnings season in the coming weeks, tech results will be scrutinized in far greater detail.,” Ipek Ozkardeskaya of Swissquote said in a commentary. “Concerns around circular AI deals, leverage and delayed returns on investment remain front of mind for investors. These are compounded by rising electricity and metals costs, higher memory-chip prices, and the risk of supply disruptions,” she said. BlackRock, the giant that’s now overseeing more than $14 trillion in investments, rose 5.9% after reporting stronger profit and revenue than analysts expected. Encouraging reports on the U.S. economy contributed to the upbeat mood. One said fewer workers applied for unemployment benefits last week in an indication layoffs may be slowing. Other reports said manufacturing was significantly stronger in the mid-Atlantic region and in New York state than economists had forecast. The stronger-than-expected data on the U.S. economy helped stocks of smaller companies to lead the market. Their profits can be tied more closely to the strength of the U.S. economy than their bigger, multinational rivals, and the Russell 2000 index rose 0.9%. In other dealings early Friday, the U.S. dollar fell to 158.19 Japanese yen from 158.63 yen. The euro rose to $1.1614 from $1.1609. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Elaine Kurtenbach Associated Press Published: January 16, 2026 at 12:57 AM Updated: January 16, 2026 at 4:46 PM Recommended Videos Elaine Kurtenbach Associated Press Copyright 2026 The Associated Press. All rights reserved Former New York Knicks John Starks, center, joined by other Knicks Alumni, gavels trading closed at the New York Stock Exchange, Friday, Jan. 16, 2026. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) BANGKOK – Stocks edged a bit lower on Wall Street Friday as the first week of corporate earnings season ended with markets trading near record levels. The wobbly day for stocks closed out a week of similar movements for major indexes amid profit reports from banks and updates on inflation. Recommended Videos The S&P 500 fell 4.46 points, or 0.1%, to 6,940.01. It is sitting just below its record, which was set on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 83.11 points, or 0.2%, to 49,359.33. The Nasdaq composite fell 14.63 points, or 0.1%, to 23,515.39. Each index notched weekly losses. Smaller company stocks fared better. The Russell 2000 eked out a 0.1%, while also notching a 2% gain for the week. Technology stocks were the strongest forces behind the market's moves throughout most of the day. Several big technology stocks made strong gains and helped offset losses elsewhere. Broadcom rose 2.5% and Micron Technology rose 7.8%. The semiconductor companies are among several Big Tech companies with outsized valuations that often push the market higher or lower. A handful of regional U.S. banks reported their earnings following mixed reports from their larger peers. Pittsburgh’s PNC jumped 3.8% after it beat Wall Street’s fourth-quarter targets, but Regions Financial fell 2.6% after reporting results that missed forecasts. Outside of the banking sector, transport company J.B. Hunt Transport Services fell 1% after reporting mixed quarterly financial results. The latest round of earnings updates from companies could help give Wall Street a better sense of how consumers are spending their money and how businesses are operating amid economic concerns brought on by inflation and tariffs. Results from the technology sector are being scrutinized by investors trying to figure out whether the high stock prices fueled by the craze around artificial intelligence are justified. “Despite the strong start to 2026, we would not be surprised if markets experience volatility in the coming weeks as fourth quarter earnings progress and the threat of escalating geopolitical tensions remains,” wrote Doug Beath, global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, in a note to investors. Wall Street will have a broader mix of earnings to review next week, coming from airlines, industrial companies, and technology companies. United Airlines, 3M, and Intel are all scheduled to release their quarterly earnings results next week. Crude oil prices rose after dropping sharply on Thursday. The price of U.S. crude oil rose 0.4% to $59.44 and the price of Brent crude, the international standard, rose 0.6% to $64.13. Oil prices have been volatile amid widespread protests in Iran against that country’s leadership and President Donald Trump's warnings that the U.S. “will come to their rescue.” Gold prices, which have also been volatile this week, fell. Prices for the precious metal, often viewed as a safe haven amid economic and geopolitical uncertainty, fell 0.6%, but are still up more than 5% so far in January. Treasury yields moved higher in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.23% from 4.17% late Thursday. The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks expectations for what the Federal Reserve will do, rose to 3.60% from 3.57% late Thursday. The Fed's next policy meeting on interest rates is in two weeks, and Wall Street is betting that it will maintain its current benchmark interest rate. The central bank is trying to balance a slowing jobs market with stubbornly high inflation. Updates on inflation this week showed that prices remain above the Fed's 2% goal. The U.S. central bank will get one more update on inflation next week when the government releases the personal consumption expenditures price index, or PCE. It is the Fed's preferred measure for inflation. European markets fell, and markets in Asia were mixed. Taiwan's benchmark index rose 1.9% after its government signed a trade deal with the U.S. China, which claims the self-governed island as its own territory, protested the agreement. The deal with Taiwan comes amid an ongoing trade war between the U.S. and much of the world. Uncertainty over tariffs have raised concerns about inflation and economic damage because of higher costs for businesses and consumers. Canada is the latest to shift its partnerships because of the uncertainty. It has agreed to cut its 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars in return for lower tariffs on Canadian farm products as part of a break with the U.S. Tesla fell 0.2% and Rivian fell 2.3%.

Title: State Street rolls out new crypto tokenization tools

State Street said its new crypto platform would help clients build tokenized money market funds, exchange-traded funds, and products such as tokenized deposits and stablecoins. Cointelegraph in your social feed Multinational banking giant State Street has launched an institutional digital asset platform, aimed at helping businesses navigate the sector and launch a range of crypto products. State Street said on Thursday its platform aims to bridge traditional assets to crypto via tokenization and will support the creation of tokenized money market funds, exchange-traded funds, as well as products such as tokenized deposits and stablecoins. The platform will provide institutions with tokenization services, digital asset custody and access to a range of digital assets. “By pairing blockchain connectivity with robust controls and global servicing expertise, we’re enabling institutions to confidently embrace tokenization as part of their core strategy,” said Joerg Ambrosius, State Street’s president of investment services. Like other bank-led tokenization initiatives, the platform is initially targeted at institutional clients and remains subject to jurisdictional regulatory approvals Tokenization has become a key focus for traditional finance companies as they push to experiment with blockchain, which proponents say can improve liquidity. Related: BNY launches tokenized deposits amid TradFi rush into blockchain and crypto Crypto banking group Sygnum has tipped tokenization to hit the mainstream in 2026 on the back of clear regulations rolling out in the US. State Street has $5.4 trillion worth of assets under management. The firm has been dipping its toes into the digital asset space for the past couple of years, with momentum growing significantly in 2025. In December, the firm teamed up with Galaxy Asset Management and Ondo Finance for a tokenized fund on Solana. The aim of the fund is to push cash sweep balance on blockchains to enable a 24/7 source of liquidity. Other finance managers, such as Fidelity, Franklin Templeton and JPMorgan, have also launched tokenized money-market funds, with many more traditional firms, including BlackRock, having also launched crypto-tied ETFs.

Title: BlackRock strengthens Bitcoin position after scooping up 6.6K BTC – Details

BlackRock’s ETF activity suggests demand is building even when the market looks quiet. BlackRock has made a major move in crypto, but not the kind most headlines suggest. When BlackRock’s IBIT ETF records a large single-day Bitcoin [BTC] purchase, many frame it as a bold corporate bet. However, in reality, BlackRock isn’t speculating with its own balance sheet. Instead, it is acting as an intermediary, pulling Bitcoin off the open market on behalf of pension funds, asset managers, and long-term institutional investors. In mid-January 2026, investor demand surged sharply. To meet that demand, BlackRock purchased nearly 6647 Bitcoin in one session. This steady accumulation has pushed BlackRock’s total Bitcoin holdings to roughly 781,000 BTC – Close to 4% of all Bitcoin currently in circulation. At this scale, BlackRock now ranks among the largest long-term holders in the world. Thus, as custodians move more of this Bitcoin into secure, offline storage, those coins have effectively exited the liquid market. Hence, fewer coins now remain available for active trading. This move is not just with Bitcoin, but also with Ethereum though. BlackRock recently added tens of thousands of Ethereum [ETH], while other large investors locked up Ethereum through staking. Staked ETH cannot move easily, further reducing supply on exchanges. Together, ETF accumulation and staking continue to tighten available supply and dampen short-term selling pressure. Despite this aggressive absorption, however, prices have not exploded upwards. In fact, at the time of writing, the altcoin was valued at close to $3,335 pn the price charts. Still, these price levels are much better than ones below $90,000 – Levels seen by BTC back in Q4 2025. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s IBIT and ETHA recorded inflows worth $648.4 million and $81.6 million, respectively. The latest surge came on the heels of another major accumulation spree by BlackRock. Over a short window, the firm quietly pulled close to $1 billion worth of cryptos off the open market. It moved 9,619 Bitcoin, valued at roughly $878 million, along with 46,851 Ethereum worth about $149 million, directly into custodial storage. All these moves, together, show that the crypto markets no longer revolve around short-term hype. Therefore, as 2026 unfolds, the real question isn’t whether institutions are involved. It’s whether enough liquid Bitcoin and Ethereum will remain on exchanges to meet their growing demand.

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Manufacturing activity in New Zealand is now the highest in four years, according to the BNZ-BusinessNZ Performance of Manufacturing Index. Photo / Dean Purcell Ebos Group and Fletcher Building both had strong bounces as the New Zealand sharemarket closed the week with a solid gain of nearly 0.5%. The S&P/NZX 50 Index climbed steadily all day and closed at 13,718.1, up 58.31 points or 0.43% – with a mid-afternoon intraday high of 13,749.47. The index has risen 1.3% year to date in 2026. There were 94 gainers and 40 decliners on the main board with 43.9 million shares worth $171.9 million changing hands. ‘Weakness and wariness’ Manufacturing activity in New Zealand is now the highest in four years, according to the BNZ-BusinessNZ Performance of Manufacturing Index (PMI). The index reached 56.1 in December, up from 51.4 in November – its best reading since December 2021 and well above the long-term survey of 52.5. Shane Solly, portfolio manager with Harbour Asset Management, said the better-than-expected PMI update is another sign the economy is recovering, though some are seeing weakness in the number of business closures. He said the increased activity is benefiting companies like Fletcher Building and Mainfreight. Fletcher was still cautious in its trading update, but there is a better tone towards economic activity. Fletcher rose 12c or 3.18% to $3.89, and Mainfreight was up 49c to $68.99. Ebos Group increased 28c to $26.46. Solly said, “We’ve seen very heavy selling in Ebos from offshore, but we might be getting through to the other side of it.” Infratil, which traded at $12.67 in early November, was up 7c to $11.26 on the back of a recovery in overseas tech stocks. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, a major supplier to the industry, reported stronger quarterly profit than analysts expected and said it could boost its equipment investment to US$56 billion ($97.2b) to take advantage of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Nvidia was up 2.1% to US$186.99. Solly said the continued demand for chips is positive for datacentres, and this benefits Infratil. There had been quite a debate about the capital expenditure for AI. He said there was also a bounce-back in New Zealand tech stocks. “We’ve been seeing some weakness and wariness in that sector over the use of vibe coding, one of the AI tools, and replacing existing software applications.” Other stocks Vista Group increased 5c or 2.27% to $2.25; Gentrack was up 19c or 2.3% to $8.46; Blackpearl Group added 5c or 5.26% to $1; and Eroad gained 3c or 2.36% to $1.30. Fintech stock PaySauce, down 0.005c or 1.79% to 27.5c, earlier reported record annual recurring revenue of $9.4m for the December quarter, including an 11% increase in year-on-year processing fees to $1.8m. This offset a 25% reduction in interest revenue. The dual-listed banking groups had a good day, with Westpac rising $1.24, or 2.79%, to $45.73, and ANZ up 42c to $43.41. The financial institutions had a better day in the United States. BlackRock increased by 5.93% to US$1156.65, and Goldman Sachs rose 4.63% to US$975.86 after reporting improved quarterly profits. Back home, Santana Minerals increased 4c or 3.27% to $1.26, and 2 Cheap Cars was up 2c or 3.17% to 65c after its positive quarterly update. Heavily traded Ryman Healthcare was down 8c or 2.69% to $2.89, with 4.33 million shares worth $12.6m changing hands a day after reporting steady quarterly sales. Fellow retirement village stock Summerset, which provides an update next week, gained 22c or 1.81% to $12.40. There was heavy trading in energy stocks on the quarterly rebalancing of the S&P Global Clean Energy Index. Contact was up 10c to $9.36 on trade worth $27.11m; Meridian gained 7c to $5.59; and Mercury also added 3c to $6.48 on trade worth $11.7m. Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. The S&P/NZX 50 Index closed at 13,659.79, down 97.92 points or 0.71%.

Title: Future of Marketing Briefing: X claims an ad comeback, reality proves out a different thesis

This Future of Marketing Briefing covers the latest in marketing for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Friday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → A claim from X has has taken on a life of its own after I featured it in a story I wrote earlier this month. X’s ads boss said that nearly all of the platform’s top 100 advertisers were “back” without a breakout of who those advertisers were, no context around what “back” meant and no disclosure of how much money they were actually spending. I asked. There were no numbers forthcoming. “We are more focused on advertising than ever before,” said X’s global head of advertising Monique Pintarelli. “We have a number of brands that are not just back, they’re spending at or higher than pre-acquisition levels,” she added, without specific figures. Skepticism was warranted. On its own, the comments were thin. But in the churn of hot takes and screenshots, the remark quickly became shorthand for something much bigger — the idea that X’s advertising business was effectively healed. The article itself did not make that leap. It went out of its way not to. So consider this week’s briefing a reset. Not a redemption arc. Just a closer look at where X’s ad business actually sits right now. Short version: the comeback narrative has gotten ahead of the reality. The numbers — what little of them there are — support that. The original piece cited Sensor Tower data showing that while more than six in 10 of the biggest advertisers on X in 2022 are still spending on the platform, they are doing so at a fraction of their prior levels. Additional data only reinforces that. Digiday requested data from Ebiquity, which shared insights from clients, primarily of large multinational brand advertisers, that it provides digital governance and auditing services to. Clients work for over 75 of the top 100 global advertisers based on their advertising spend worldwide. Ad spend on X hasn’t recovered from its 2023 spend level based on Ebiquity’s data, staying roughly flat. The number of clients in Ebiquity’s database spending on X has gone down year-on-year: 40 in 2022, 25 in 2023, 11 in 2024 and seven in 2025, with the latest figure still subject to change as filings are finalized. Taken together, the data adds context to Pintarell’s comments. It is likely true that most of the platform’s top 100 advertisers have resumed some level of spending after pulling back in 2022 amid concerns over Elon Musk’s ownership. In some respects, it would be more surprising if they had not. What has followed since Musk’s takeover has hardly been a courtship. He has publicly ridiculed the advertising, undermined some parts of it and threatened legal action against others. In response, it would appear many advertisers returned to X with the bare minimum — enough to ease those tensions, not enough to signal confidence. Yes, there are outliers. But the idea that ad dollars have meaningfully returned — or that X’s ad business is anything close to “back” — is tenuous at best. Take GYK Antler, for example. The agency’s head of media Adam Telian said that none of the brands he works with have resumed spending on X, and the platform hasn’t been a part of the conversation for several years. Similarly, Brave Bison’s director of paid media Mark Byrne said that X has fallen down client wishlists and is rarely pushed proactively in media plans. An ensuing scandal will have only sharpened those concerns. In recent weeks, X’s AI tool Grok has been used to generate manipulated images of real people, including women and minors, in sexually explicit ways, often by removing their clothes. Users began documenting and reporting these examples in late December and into the new year. Though on Wednesday, X announced that the team has “implemented technological measures to prevent the Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis. This restriction applies to all users, including paid subscribers.” And while it’s a step in the right direction, it isn’t a total U-turn that prevents users from using Grok to create any other type of inappropriate content. For brand advertisers, this is not a footnote. It is the environment, one far removed from anything that resembles a stable or normalized marketplace. “There doesn’t seem to be a good handle on content safety such as what other platforms like Meta and TikTok have, which further leads me to believe that X isn’t the best option for many advertisers,” said paid social media expert Shamsul Chowdhury. It’s a perspective shared by Byrne, who noted that this recent issue has heightened sensitivity around where budgets end up. “For some advertisers, it extends beyond brand safety in the traditional sense into whether they want to be seen supporting certain environments at all,” he said. “That makes controls, exclusions and transparency more important than ever.” Which calls into question why any brand would ever want to fund a platform like X? Aside from the threat of being named, shamed and sued by Musk, the upside is hard to see. What remains may be less a vote of confidence than a form of inadvertent participation. Turns out, marketers could be buying ads on X without realizing. The platform makes a meaningful portion of its ads available via programmatic auctions, and in doing so makes it easier for marketers to end up there without ever making an affirmative decision to do so. Here’s how: when a marketer buys ads on Google Ads there’s a chance they will buy ads on X, which is available at cheap ad prices there following a deal struck in 2023. Moreover, because of those prices, Google’s buying algorithms may optimize spend toward those places. The only way to avoid this, is if marketers instruct those algorithms not to buy from X. “When I have been auditing brands’ Google Ads activity over the last year or so, X makes an appearance in placement reporting for the ones that are not critically reviewing where their ads are serving, which has caught out the majority of brands as to why that is happening in the first place,” said ad tech consultant Jonathan D’Souza Rauto. It’s a timely reminder to be more deliberate about what’s being bought. Chowdhury pointed out that advertisers, especially those who are price sensitive, likely aren’t looking under the hood to evaluate where they’re showing up. But it does still add to Pintarelli’s point that more advertisers are genuinely back on X. But as Byrne put it, there’s a difference between a genuine return to X as a planned, strategic platform and X appearing in delivery as a by-product of automation. All told, X remains an anomaly in the media space: influential without being dependable, unavoidable without being trustworthy and still large enough to matter even as it drifts further from what most of the market would recognize as a functional advertising platform. 1.6%: Forecasted percent increase for U.K. 2026 ad spend, according to IPA’s Q4 2025 Bellwether report 64%: Percentage of marketers which predict their customers will use traditional search engines less often in the coming 2-3 years 28%: Percentage of retail commerce media decision makers in North America and Europe which still review and approve creatives manually 80%: Percentage of advertisers who believe Gen Z and millennial consumers feel positively about AI-generated ads, however only 45% of these consumers actually feel that way ‘More focused on advertising than ever before’: Nearly all of X’s top 100 advertisers returned, ads boss claims The story which started it all off and became the building block for this briefing. Also in this story is the fact that X has big plans for the Super Bowl next month, from its Super Bowl portal, to a new Grok-powered BrandRanx tool for advertisers and users. ‘Intentionally being cautious’: Why the ad industry isn’t ready to let AI agents spend ad dollars While planning, buying and optimization autonomously by LLM-powered agents are always framed as just over the horizon, advertisers are clear on one thing: they want to use it to automate workflows, not automate buying decisions. Digiday’s extensive guide to what’s in and out for creators in 2026 As we start the year, our new creator economy senior reporter Alyssa Mercante has pulled together a list of what she thinks matters (or not) for content creators in 2026. ‘We don’t care if you don’t use our UX anymore’: Yahoo recasts its DSP as a data backbone for the agentic world Yahoo is intentionally making its demand-sider platform (DSP) less sticky. The platform is recasting its DSP less as a place marketers go, and more as infrastructure their systems can plug into. Why ByteDance’s stock should rise after TikTok deal closes ByteDance putting a close to the ongoing fight over TikTok in the U.S., could mean that the path is clear for the tech giant to finally go public, according to The Information. Dubai continues its creator-wooing efforts with a splashy Amazon partnership Dubai is still on a mission to attract creators and the latest part of that strategy is a new Amazon partnership, called the Amazon Creators Foundry, according to TubeFilter Elon Musk denies Grok generates illegal content Despite the global outrage over Grok’s latest scandal, Elon Musk has still denied that Grok has created any illegal content, saying it’s users who are responsible, not the technology, according to Politico. Big Tech spared strict rules in EU digital regulations overhaul, sources say Google, Meta, Netflix, Microsoft and Amazon won’t face heavy regulations in Europe’s overhauled Digital Network’s Act and will only be subject to a voluntary framework rather than binding rules, according to Reuters. Today, people generally seek balance when pursuing their personalized wellness goals in a new year. As the hype around AI thins into something closer to reality, the ad industry is quietly drawing a line around what LLMs can do — and what they will not be trusted to touch.

Title: You Don’t Own Enough Emerging Markets

Time Published: 2026-01-15T23:00:10Z
Full Content:
By Adam Sharp PostedJanuary 15, 2026 Over the past 5 years, the S&P 500 is up an impressive 83%. Meanwhile the Vanguard Emerging Markets ETF (VWO) has only risen 6.8% over that period. Once you factor in inflation, emerging markets (EMs) are basically flat in real terms over the past 5 years. And this trend of U.S. stocks outperforming has been going on for more than a decade. The chart below covers 1990 to July 2025. The red line is the S&P 500, and blue is the MSCI emerging markets index. Source: Curvo.eu As you can see, from 1990 to around 2013, emerging markets and the S&P 500 produced around the same level of returns. Then, American stocks raced ahead and have absolutely stomped EMs since. The combination of a strong dollar, QE, and the rise of big U.S. tech explains the difference. As a result, the 2010s were an unusually bad period for EM returns. The following chart, via Morgan Stanley, shows EM performance going back to 1930 by decade. As you can see, EMs have historically generated strong returns. Except for the 2010s. And look at the 1970s and 1980s! Over the 1970s, emerging markets returned approximately 400% in dollar terms. And then in the 1980s, they did it again. The 1970s is especially relevant to today, as I believe we are set to have a similar inflationary experience. And when the dollar’s weak, EMs fly. This extended period of underperformance in EMs is a gift for contrarian investors. In the past year, things have finally begun looking up for emerging markets. The Vanguard EM ETF (VWO) is up an impressive 40%, outperforming the S&P significantly. I believe this is only the beginning of emerging market outperformance, and it will last for the next decade or so. EMs have a LOT of catching up to do. And guess what? Investment banking giant Goldman Sachs agrees. From Goldman’s 2026 outlook: Source: GS 2026 10-Year Forecast Analysts at Goldman Sachs expect U.S. stocks to return an average of 6.5% over the next decade. They expect emerging markets to return a far stronger 10.9%. I would be surprised if American stocks manage to return 6.5% in real terms (inflation-adjusted) over the next 10 years, due to their ridiculous valuations. But let’s put that aside for now. U.S. stocks have been so dominant for such a long time that many investors have zero exposure to foreign markets. So these developing markets have gotten cheap. Dirt cheap, in some cases. Looking at the Vanguard EM ETF (VWO), the average P/E ratio is 16. That’s about half the valuation of the S&P 500 today. And the dividend yield on VWO is 2.67%, 2.6x higher than the S&P 500’s pitifully low 1%. If you want very broad exposure to EM, VWO is a good choice. It holds more than 6,000 EM stocks from around the world. But it’s tilted towards China, so if you want to avoid that, best to pick something else. For those seeking high yield EM stocks, I like the Cambria Emerging Shareholder Yield ETF (EYLD). This fund picks EM stocks based on their dividend and buyback yields. I’ve owned this one for 8 years, reinvesting the dividends, and it’s done very well despite poor EM performance. Regular readers know I love Brazilian stocks. They’ve been so hated, for so long, that they’ve hit rock bottom valuations. The iShares Brazil ETF (EWZ) trades at an average P/E ratio of just 11. That’s… real cheap. With a trailing dividend yield of over 5%, this is very attractive. However, there is a sizable expense ratio of 0.6%. A cheaper option is the Franklin Latin America ETF (FLLA), with more reasonable 0.19% annual expenses. FLLA is mostly Brazil, but with a touch of Chile, Mexico, and other Latam exposure. Besides cheap valuations, another reason I’m so invested in Brazil is because it’s a natural resource powerhouse. Iron, gold, copper, silver, oil, and much more. Returns and yields will rise strongly if commodities boom, as we expect them to. In terms of individual names, I own oil firm Petrobras (PBR.A), industrial metal miner Vale (VALE), and online bank Nubank (NU). (Each of those links will take you to our coverage of that stock.) EWZ, Vale, and Nubank have done very well since we covered them. Petrobras is the laggard, basically flat since, but this oil giant is our favorite way to play energy going forward. Brazil offers juicy dividend yields and cheap valuations. Sure, there’s political and currency risk, but that’s the case everywhere these days. EMs are set to generate big returns over the next decade and beyond. Over the past year I’ve been shifting into them heavily, and will continue to. And when I set up my 16-year old son’s Roth IRA, the vast majority went into EM investments. If you’ve been exclusively in U.S. stocks for the past 15 years, congratulations. You’ve done incredibly well. Now it’s time to start looking to EM for alpha. America is entering a turbulent time, not unlike the 1940s or 1970s. The only guarantee is that vast sums of money will be printed. EMs have their own issues to deal with, but considering the price we’re paying, my money is on emerging markets going forward.

Friday, 16 Jan 2026 NEW YORK, Jan. 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks ended higher on Thursday, snapping a two-day losing streak as a surge in semiconductor and financial shares bolstered investor confidence. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6 percent to 49,442.44. The S&P 500 added 0.26 percent to 6,944.47. The Nasdaq Composite Index increased by 0.25 percent to 23,530.02. Seven of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors ended higher, with utilities and industrials leading the gainers by going up 1.04 percent and 0.93 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, energy and health led the laggards by losing 0.91 percent and 0.58 percent, respectively. The rally was primarily spearheaded by the technology sector following a record-breaking quarterly report from TSMC, which announced plans to increase its 2026 capital expenditure to between 52 billion and 56 billion U.S. dollars, a move seen as a strong vote of confidence in the sustained global demand for AI infrastructure. TSMC shares climbed 4.44 percent. The optimism spread across the semiconductor industry with the VanEck Semiconductor ETF rising 2.08 percent, while industry leaders Nvidia and Micron Technology gained 2.13 percent and 0.98 percent, respectively. The financial sector also provided significant upward momentum as investors processed the latest wave of fourth-quarter earnings. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley both reported surging profits, driven by a year-end resurgence in global dealmaking. Meanwhile, asset management giant BlackRock saw its shares jump 5.93 percent after ending 2025 with a record 14 trillion dollars in assets under management and exceeding quarterly earnings estimates. On the economic front, data from the U.S. Department of Labor indicated continued resilience in the U.S. job market. Initial requests for unemployment benefits for the week ending Jan. 10 fell to 198,000, significantly lower than the 215,000 claims projected by economists. Further supporting the market was a notable decline in energy costs. Global oil prices retreated, with both Brent crude and West Texas Intermediate futures sliding more than 4 percent during the session. Thank you for your report!

Title: Scrutinizing the Retail Sector, Feel-good Mood Prevails at NRF Big Show

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily After a holiday season of decent gains, retailers expect more of the same in 2026 with most facets of the economy seen holding up. Considering the world is in turmoil, economic uncertainties persist, and Saks Global has gone bankrupt, this week’s NRF Big Show at Manhattan’s Javits Center was a surprisingly reassuring place to be. Resilient consumer spending, the rise of AI, waning fear over tariffs, and expectations for retail gains in the year ahead following a decent 2025 holiday season set a promising tone at the convention/trade show, considered the industry’s biggest. Adding to the upbeat atmosphere were the keynoters recounting personal and professional success stories and the record turnout — 40,000-plus retailers, vendors, suppliers, media, industry analysts and consultants — creating crowds at the doughnut and coffee stands and competition for seats close to the speaker stages. Related Articles Shoe Industry News Vans, Timberland and The North Face Leaders on What It Takes to Reignite Brand Energy Beauty Features Ulta Beauty's Kecia Steelman on AI, Cultural Relevance, International and More Still, concerns were not in short supply. They centered on inflation persisting; lower-income families struggling to get by amid high grocery, housing and health costs, and the potential impact of AI on the labor force. You May Also Like “It was a good holiday season overall, up 4.7 percent from October through December. It looked to us that people shopped early, were picky and selective. The wealth effect is a huge part of the story, kind of masking the weakness in lower incomes,” said David Tinsley, senior economist at Bank of America Institute, during a economic outlook session. “You can have a relatively weak lower-income consumer but still have a robust outcome. There’s a tenuous relationship between consumer sentiment and what people actually do. I suspect you have pretty depressed consumers along with pretty robust consumption.” For 2026, “It’s not all pessimism for the lower-income consumer,” Tinsley said. “The One Big Beautiful Bill could be quite significant, with an increase in tax refunds between $60 billion and $80 billion. We could see quite large increases in spending on discretionary goods, travel and leisure, but it’s hard to know how it falls out in terms of who will benefit. There is some hope this K-shape economy narrows a bit. One area that gives me concern is the housing market. You need housing transactions to generate demand for all sorts of goods and services.” Michael Pearce, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said, “The stock market was a powerful stimulus in the back half of the year. The overall economy is growing strongly. We forecast that to continue this year.” Though he’s concerned about slow job growth, on the positive side, “The impact of tariffs will be fading in 2026 in terms of change. There’s support coming from fiscal policy, interest rate cuts, lowering mortgage rates, and add in tailwinds from AI,” for productivity gains. He also said the bigger tax cuts will be going to higher income households, but with that, he sees wage growth and inflation falling back. “it’s the worst labor market in over a decade, layoffs remain low and that should continue this year,” said Pearce. “If you are employed you are still seeing wage gains and the risk of a layoff is relatively low. But young people of all ages are struggling in this slow labor market. If you are out of the labor market, it’s difficult to get back in.” On AI, Pearce said, “We are still in the relative early stages of this AI boom. The adoption rate across the economy continues to pick up. It’s mostly being financed out of earnings rather than using debt.” “What my father started 60 years ago was a brand based on his own philosophy of design — that products were created and designed with an idea of timelessness, things that get better with age,” said David Lauren, who focused on Ask Ralph, the virtual shopping and styling assistant on the Ralph Lauren app. Lauren, the son of Ralph Lauren and the company’s chief branding and innovation officer, said, “Technology has been the most incredible tool for us to take that philosophy and make it relevant for a new generation. The idea that clothes could be worn and passed down from generation to generation has to be shared with the new generation in a way that comes in their language.” Lauren said that Ralph Lauren was the first luxury fashion brand to sell on the internet. “No one had ever sold a $500 cashmere sweater online. No one had ever sold a suit online. We just thought this would be an interesting way to tell our story.” The company turned to Microsoft to bring the experience of the Ralph Lauren flagship on 72nd Street to the internet. Microsoft staffers spent three hours immersing themselves in the store to understand the culture, to create Ask Ralph. “Nobody needs a tie. Nobody needs a flannel shirt. Nobody needs another pair of jeans,” he said. But that can change when customers are “enveloped in the magic of Ralph Lauren. We feel that the technology helps us to fulfill that.” Shelley Bransten, corporate vice president, worldwide industry solutions for Microsoft, said that the Ask Ralph technology is “like having Ralph Lauren in your pocket advising you.” Lauren agreed, adding: “When a customer starts to feel confident about putting a look together, that’s a win.” Although the tool is only available for the Polo brand right now, Lauren said he expects it will be expanded to the company’s other offerings in the future. “As we expand it globally and bring our other brands to it, I think we’re going to get a much richer read on it.” In a “future proofing retail in 2028” session, Ashley Kechter, global president of athletic apparel brand Vuori, said “Integration between retail and digital is imperative” and stressed the importance of the customer experience. Vuori’s Regent Street store in London, which opened last year, is different from its L.A. store, Kechter said, because the company evaluates what’s right for the local customer and builds an experience unique to that store site. Dayna Quanbeck, president of shoe brand Rothy’s, stressed “the balance of both and how you build that model” of digital and physical stores is where the focus should be. Another focus for Rothy’s is on “testing and learning” to spot trends and determine “green shoots” for growth. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Rothy’s launched bags and men’s shoes, but ultimately decided to keep its focus on innovating in women’s footwear. She said the company saw a huge opportunity in bags and men’s shoes, but it wasn’t the right time. For Rothy’s, the non-negotiable is sustainability — last fall the brand innovated a more sustainable way to manufacture velvet — while the biggest challenge is intellectual property. “We have a roster of patents that are often knocked off,” she said. Erin Chaney, senior vice president of e-commerce, Adidas NA, and Peter Larsen, vice president of multichannel commerce and fulfillment at Amazon, discussed their collaboration and how it’s setting new fulfillment standards for the footwear industry. “We’re getting faster every single year,” Larsen said of the marketplace platform’s delivery improvements. The collaboration with Adidas meant Amazon had to think differently about the supply chain because “Adidas has many products that turn over frequently,” Larsen said. Chaney said one challenge involved supply and how the two had to “synchronize” their respective inventory feeds. Some early marketplace orders saw cancellations because the German athletic brand wasn’t as fast on their end with inventory information and what was available for shipment. Once that was figured out, Adidas began seeing the revenue uplift it had expected and higher conversion rates. Chaney also said a pain point was callers to customer service asking where packages were and when they would be delivered. But with the collaboration, Amazon Prime-enabled deliveries are now within two to three days. The reduction of those service calls were a “big win” for Adidas, Chaney said. For LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, incorporating AI isn’t about removing the human touch in luxury — from handcrafted handbags and hand-sewn couture to white-glove customer service. It’s about heightening personal experiences and helping the company deliver on its “human values,” namely creativity and innovation, excellence and entrepreneurship. That message came from Gonzague de Pirey, chief omnichannel and data officer at LVMH, who said, “Human is a core value of luxury, and if we want to successfully develop technology, it needs to be everywhere, but visible nowhere.” He said the company calls this concept “quiet tech.” Many companies use AI as a means toward efficiency, but for LVMH, the goal was primarily business development and supporting the group’s values. After piloting and scaling a few use cases over the last couple years, LVMH embarked on a group-wide AI transformation plan. Recognizing that each of its more than 75 houses is unique, the conglomerate is enabling each business unit to develop its own plan that fits its DNA. Although brand specific, these strategies address a few common priorities: commerce, marketing and operations. Within Louis Vuitton, AI investments are focused on four key areas: enhancing creativity, reaching the right clients, elevating the customer experience and operational efficiencies, such as demand planning. “It’s a way to dream boldly, execute, invest on the topics and initiatives that really prove we can move the needle impacting our business and our client experience,” said Soumia Hadjali, Louis Vuitton’s global senior vice president, client development and digital. Using AI for creative purposes comes with risks, so LVMH is testing the combination of AI and creativity at some houses. For instance, at Louis Vuitton, AI is being used to help designers visualize materials and colors faster, providing more time to focus on craftsmanship and the narrative behind the products. AI is also being leveraged to generate e-commerce assets. In customer engagement, the use of AI is about “augmentation, not automation,” providing client advisers with consumer insights to support engagement, explained Hadjali. “AI really opened the capabilities, and the signature remains really human and distinctive,” she said. Louis Vuitton’s use of agentic commerce goes beyond the transactional. Hadjali described it as “orchestrating that entire ecosystem around one client,” creating a personalized experience and journey based on insights about the customer. With millions of clients, AI is about delivering experience and relevance at the right time, at scale. “It’s mainly about anticipating, understanding, integrating, responding to our clients’ intents, and building at the same time, trust, legitimacy,” she said. Two years into the future of AI at LVMH, de Pirey said a marker of success would be to involve everyone in the company with a culture very open to AI. “That would translate into, of course, greater business, greater market share, greater performance, greater financial performance. If we are able to, thanks to AI, increase the desire for our brands, that would be the absolute key for success.” Emma Grede, cofounder of the Good American and Skims brand, and Ben Francis, CEO and founder of Gymshark, outlined what made their companies successful and how agentic AI is part of it. Grede said that because customers are already exploring AI, it behooved her businesses to do the same. “We’re in the midst of a really seismic change,” she said. “To be where our customer is, we have no other choice than to be in it.” She views AI as a “second executive brain” that can take on tasks done by staffers. “We built these incredible businesses based on what the data is telling us, by being obsessed with our customer and obsessed with the product. But there’s a whole other side of what we do — market research and obsessing over the competition that, quite frankly, AI can do at a speed no human would ever find manageable. So for me, it’s not about taking anything human out of what we do, it’s actually leaving ourselves the time to do the stuff only we can do.” Francis said that when he founded Gymshark in 2012, it was strictly online. Gymshark has since opened stores, though digital still represents the bulk of the business. But his goal remains the same: “to build the greatest gym apparel brand in the world, in a market that is so saturated by sports, athleisure and fashion.” Although tempted, he’s resisted expanding the offering beyond his core product to boost sales, and it’s paid off. “We found that as we narrowed our product base, we’ve narrowed our focus…And the business has grown far more quickly than when we were trying to appeal to everyone,” he said. Gymshark has built a $1 billion business with just eight physical stores and a big online business. With brick-and-mortar, “It’s so easy to over-expand and alienate that core customer, but the second [you] do that, it’s very difficult to recover.” When Good American launched a decade ago, it offered product up to size 15, breaking the conventional rules of fashion. But because she was an “outsider,” Grede said she didn’t feel compelled to follow the rules. “You can no sooner launch a cosmetics brand with 10 shades of foundation than you can launch a clothing brand with this very narrow idea of what size people’s butts should be.” She followed the same playbook with Skims, which also paid dividends. “For me, it was just about taking out all of the preconceived notions…We’re not very referential. I think that’s our superpower. We don’t forecast trend, we create trend.” Stefani Fleurant, executive vice president of lifestyle marketing at Authentic Brands Group, said among the brand management and entertainment platform’s biggest hits have been Lucky Brand’s back-to-school campaign with Addison Rae, Aeropostale’s collaboration with Demetra Dias, and Reebok’s deal with WNBA star Angel Reece. These breakthrough consumer moments are part of Authentic’s mission to “acquire, protect and grow” its 50-plus brands through a “digital-first strategy.” Fleurant said the company early on worked with creatives to get its message out. But in recent years, consumers have gotten more selective. “Product has to earn its place,” she said. Creators have to “drive credibility,” she said, and help develop storytelling for each brand. Fleurant said Aeropostale actually brought Diaz on board as an intern last summer, where she co-created her collection with the company. When it dropped, Aeropostale skyrocketed to number three on the shopping section of the app store for that weekend. While JD Sports Fashion plc is an early adopter of agentic commerce evolution, it’s not losing sight of a fundamental point of retail: delivering on promises across channels. “As a retailer, the main goal is to serve your clients in the best way in every single place they want to be served,” said Olivier Nachba, deputy chief technology officer at JD Sports, in a conversation with Fluent Commerce’s chief strategy officer Nicola Kinsella. Around 20 percent of JD Group’s sales come from online channels; 80 percent is stores. Roughly 50 percent of its customer base is young, including teenagers who are early tech adopters. Nachba sees agentic commerce as another channel and opportunity for JD Sports to reach customers. Preparing for agentic commerce, JD Sports is getting its communications ready with generative engine optimization. Like search engine optimization before it, GEO is about sharing product data in a way that enables information to be gleaned by large language models such as ChatGPT or Gemini. Through GEO, JD Sports is gearing up for a global presence across every LLM. And to populate GEO, the company needs good data and content. “Our challenge is how we are going to be able to generate enough valid content targeted for our customer at scale level,” said Nachba. “We are leveraging a lot of AI to give superpower to our teams.” With agentic commerce, much like online searches linking to e-commerce sites, there is the risk that comes with being on the same platform as competitors. Nachba pointed to delivery as a competitive asset, and this is where order management systems come into play. “Order management system is a backbone of your operation (and) how you are going to serve your clients, and it’s a backbone of your delivery promise of your customer and your stock optimization,” said Nachba. “But what is really important is to understand how you are going to make people work around the order management system.” Without cross-organization alignment, Nachba explained a company’s brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce department could have competing priorities for order fulfillment, since they each want to move inventory out of their channel to protect their bottom lines. Order management systems like Fluent Commerce start with what the consumer wants to order and use rules — such as choosing the fulfillment method with the least emissions or the option that provides the best margins — to determine how to get the customer their desired product. The OMS also allows retailers to show customers expected delivery timelines. Given the significant portion of company sales that are via brick-and-mortar locations, Nachba said the in-store experience needs to provide the “best service.” This includes arming associates with training and tools so they can get product to the customer even if it is not in stock at that particular door. JD Group has linked up with CommerceTools and Stripe, becoming the first retailer to use their agentic commerce suite. This will enable it to sell on platforms like ChatGPT and Microsoft CoPilot in the U.S., a market that accounts for roughly 40 percent of the group’s $15 billion global business. “You need to have a clean house,” he said. “You can’t build something if the ground floor is not solid, so we are doing the job with all the team to have a structured data, an exposition of our data, the…source of truth of every single aspect of our business, to be sure that we will be able to leverage it.” Marco Benasedo, chief information officer at Boggi, the Milan menswear brand that hosted a breakfast at its store on Columbus Circle with tech partner Hekanize, cautioned that while Boggi is open to using AI, it is not at the expense of humans. He stressed that any action centered around creativity is still being performed by people since the human touch cannot be underestimated. By embracing technology, cumbersome tasks previously handled by headquarters and store staff can be reallocated, including inventory control and connecting frontline workers with back-office details needed to do jobs effectively. Brooklinen CEO Billy May and Steve Madden direct-to-consumer president Josh Krepon hammered down on today’s retail realities. Krepon acknowledged the impact AI is having on the world but he believes the retail industry will move a bit slower to adopt the technology. “I don’t have a lot of concern for jobs on the brand side,” Krepon said. “We’re still on the augment phase, and I do think AI will actually create new jobs over the next 10 to 20 years.” May concurred, saying, “If it’s a rote process that can certainly be automated, then that individual can move elsewhere in the company. Is there going to be mass layoffs? No. Will it be a redistribution of talent, 100 percent. And I think that organizations or functions that aren’t thinking about how to incorporate AI right now are the ones that are going to end up being most affected. The only way to predict the future is to be a part of it. You’ve got to be actively engaged and adopting and thinking about how to integrate AI into your organization, out of opportunity, as opposed to out of fear.” – With contributions from Sarah Jones, Vicki M.

Title: Pundit Warns XRP Is On The Verge Of Being Sold Out, What’s Going On?
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/pundit-warns-xrp-sold-out/
Time Published: 2026-01-15T22:00:31Z

Is XRP running out? A recent debate between market analyst Jake Claver and other industry commentators has thrust the digital asset back into the spotlight, predicting a looming supply crunch. As structural limits meet rising demand, experts warn of a “sell-out” scenario that could fundamentally redefine the token’s market dynamics. The core of the “sell-out” claim lies in the technical architecture of the XRP Ledger’s escrow system. In a post on January 14, 2026, Claver explained that Ripple’s monthly supply releases are hard-coded into the protocol, meaning the company is unable to inject extra tokens into the market during a liquidity crisis. While this mechanism was designed to provide predictability and limit manipulation, it creates a double-edged outcome. In a high-demand environment, supply becomes effectively inelastic. This structure is more relevant when viewed against current supply figures. XRP has a hard maximum of 100 billion tokens. About 60.7 billion XRP are already in circulation, leaving roughly 39.3 billion outside active market supply. At a price near $2.10, circulating supply translate to a market capitalization above $127 billion, while the fully diluted valuation sits close to $210 billion. These figures show that nearly 40% of XRP’s total supply is effectively off the table and cannot be accessed to meet sudden demand. If a large institution attempted to buy $10 billion worth of XRP, Ripple could not unlock escrow early to provide liquidity because the ledger prohibits releases beyond the 1-billion-token monthly cap. Any abrupt surge in buying pressure therefore, cannot be met with new supply. This rigidity materially increases the risk of a severe supply shock, with price acting as the sole pressure valve under this structural bottleneck. The conversation escalated when a user known as RemiRelief responded to Claver, sounding an alarm that XRP is “on the verge of being sold out completely.” RemiRelief argued that there is very little liquid supply left on exchanges and predicted a “mind-boggling” scenario if investors began moving their holdings into private storage. The post specifically pointed to the potential entry of BlackRock as a catalyst that would drain the remaining “low-hanging fruit” from the market. The current performance of XRP ETFs supports this “constant buying” narrative. Since early 2026, XRP ETFs have seen massive, consistent net inflows—reaching over $1.37 billion in a single week. Every dollar flowing into an ETF represents XRP being sucked out of the public market and locked into institutional vaults. RemiRelief’s claim stems from this collision: institutional giants are buying up tokens at a record pace, while the “escrow trap” Claver described prevents any new supply from entering the market to balance it out. Beyond signalling a looming sellout, this debate emphasizes that the window for acquiring XRP at “low” prices is closing fast. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: 5 AI Chip Stocks Most Exposed to Trump’s New 25% Tariff

Investing Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) surged 8% on earnings as Trump announced 25% AI chip tariffs. TSMC manufactures 90% of advanced chips from Taiwan. NVIDIA (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) manufacture all AI chips through TSMC in Taiwan. Both face margin compression without pricing power for 25% cost increases. Qualcomm and Apple face lower exposure than pure AI chipmakers. Qualcomm makes mobile chips while Apple only consumes chips internally. Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. Trump’s 25% tariff on AI chips landed the same day Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) posted blowout earnings and dismissed AI bubble fears. TSMC’s stock surged 8% Thursday, pulling AMD up 12% and NVIDIA 3% in sympathy. Now investors face a critical question: which chip stocks are most exposed when the tariff hits? The policy targets AI chips specifically, with exemptions still being negotiated. What matters: manufacturing location, supply chain concentration, and revenue mix. Here are the five stocks ranked by tariff exposure, from most vulnerable to least. TSMC sits in the crosshairs. The company manufactures 90% of the world’s advanced chips from Taiwan, the geographic epicenter of tariff risk. With $3.63 trillion in trailing revenue and 59.4% gross margins, TSMC has enormous profitability to protect. A 25% tariff on Taiwan-manufactured chips hits TSMC’s customers (NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm, Apple) first, but the pain cascades back to the foundry. The company just raised 2026 capital expenditure guidance to $56 billion, signaling confidence in AI demand. CEO C.C. Wei told analysts that AI infrastructure spending would drive 30% revenue growth this year. That confidence now collides with tariff uncertainty. TSMC’s Arizona fabs won’t save it near-term. The Phoenix facilities are ramping 4nm production, but represent a fraction of total capacity. Most AI chips, NVIDIA’s H100s and H200s, AMD’s MI300 series, still come from Taiwan. If exemptions favor domestic manufacturing, TSMC faces a brutal choice: accelerate costly US expansion or watch customers shift orders to Samsung’s Korean fabs. The stock trades at 34x trailing earnings with a $1.70 trillion market cap. Institutional ownership sits at 16.3%, meaning any tariff-driven guidance cut triggers significant portfolio rebalancing. Thursday’s 8% rally on earnings looks precarious if tariff details disappoint. NVIDIA designs chips in California but manufactures them in Taiwan via TSMC. That makes every H100, H200, and upcoming Blackwell chip subject to tariff risk. The company generated $187 billion in trailing revenue with 70% gross margins—margins that can’t absorb a 25% cost increase without either raising prices (killing demand) or compressing profitability (tanking the stock). CEO Jensen Huang has emphasized that AI infrastructure buildout is a multi-trillion-dollar, multi-year cycle. Gartner forecast $2.5 trillion in AI spending for 2026, with 49% allocated to infrastructure. NVIDIA captures the lion’s share. But if tariffs force hyperscalers to delay purchases or negotiate price cuts, NVIDIA’s 63% operating margins become a target. The stock’s 2.3 beta means it amplifies macro shocks. Thursday’s 3% gain on TSMC’s earnings beat shows the market still believes in the AI story. But at 45x trailing earnings and $4.46 trillion market cap, there’s limited room for tariff-induced margin compression. Exemptions for AI infrastructure could save NVIDIA—if the company can prove its chips are critical to national competitiveness. AMD’s 12% Thursday rally reflects its position as NVIDIA’s closest competitor in AI chips. The MI300 series is gaining traction in data centers, with Q3 revenue up 36% year-over-year to $9.2 billion. But AMD faces the same TSMC dependency as NVIDIA. Its chips are manufactured in Taiwan. The difference: AMD has less pricing power. Where NVIDIA commands 80-85% gross margins on AI chips, AMD’s overall gross margin sits at 51.7%. A 25% tariff hits AMD harder because it can’t pass costs to customers as easily. The company is already fighting for market share against an entrenched competitor; tariff-induced price increases would make that battle steeper. AMD’s $364 billion market cap and 1.95 beta make it more volatile than NVIDIA. The stock trades at 117x trailing earnings but just 36x forward earnings, reflecting expectations for rapid profit growth. Tariffs threaten that narrative. If AMD can secure exemptions for its data center chips—arguing they’re essential to competing with NVIDIA—the stock could outperform. Otherwise, margin compression looms. Qualcomm’s exposure is more nuanced. The company designs mobile processors and 5G chips, not AI accelerators. That puts it outside the tariff’s primary target. But Qualcomm still manufactures chips via TSMC and Samsung, creating indirect exposure. The company generated $44.3 billion in trailing revenue with 26% operating margins, lower than NVIDIA or AMD. Mobile chip markets are more price-sensitive than data center AI, so Qualcomm has limited ability to pass tariff costs to smartphone makers. The stock dropped 11% over the past week, suggesting investors are already pricing in tariff risk. Qualcomm’s saving grace: its chips aren’t explicitly AI-focused. If exemptions target AI infrastructure, Qualcomm might avoid the worst impact. But if tariffs apply broadly to all Taiwan-manufactured semiconductors, the company faces cost headwinds without the pricing power to offset them. Apple is the least exposed. The company doesn’t manufacture AI chips for external sale. Its custom silicon (A-series, M-series) powers iPhones, iPads, and Macs. While those chips incorporate AI features, they’re not sold as standalone AI accelerators. Apple’s $3.84 trillion market cap and consumer electronics focus insulate it from AI chip tariffs. The company’s supply chain includes TSMC-manufactured processors, but tariffs would hit Apple as a cost of goods sold issue, not a revenue threat. With 47% gross margins and $416 billion in trailing revenue, Apple can absorb incremental costs better than pure-play chip manufacturers. The stock is down 5% year-to-date, underperforming the semiconductor rally. That divergence reflects Apple’s limited direct AI exposure. It’s not riding the AI infrastructure wave like NVIDIA or AMD. Tariffs reinforce that positioning. TSMC and NVIDIA face the most acute tariff risk. One manufactures in the tariff zone, the other depends entirely on that manufacturing. AMD follows closely, with less pricing power to offset costs. Qualcomm and Apple sit further down the exposure curve, either because their chips aren’t AI-focused (Qualcomm) or because they’re end consumers rather than chip sellers (Apple). Thursday’s rally on TSMC earnings shows investors still believe in AI demand. But tariff exemptions will determine whether that demand translates to profits.

AMD’s 12% Thursday rally reflects its position as NVIDIA’s closest competitor in AI chips. The MI300 series is gaining traction in data centers, with Q3 revenue up 36% year-over-year to $9.2 billion. But AMD faces the same TSMC dependency as NVIDIA. Its chips are manufactured in Taiwan. The difference: AMD has less pricing power. Where NVIDIA commands 80-85% gross margins on AI chips, AMD’s overall gross margin sits at 51.7%. A 25% tariff hits AMD harder because it can’t pass costs to customers as easily. The company is already fighting for market share against an entrenched competitor; tariff-induced price increases would make that battle steeper. AMD’s $364 billion market cap and 1.95 beta make it more volatile than NVIDIA. The stock trades at 117x trailing earnings but just 36x forward earnings, reflecting expectations for rapid profit growth. Tariffs threaten that narrative. If AMD can secure exemptions for its data center chips—arguing they’re essential to competing with NVIDIA—the stock could outperform. Otherwise, margin compression looms. Qualcomm’s exposure is more nuanced. The company designs mobile processors and 5G chips, not AI accelerators. That puts it outside the tariff’s primary target. But Qualcomm still manufactures chips via TSMC and Samsung, creating indirect exposure. The company generated $44.3 billion in trailing revenue with 26% operating margins, lower than NVIDIA or AMD. Mobile chip markets are more price-sensitive than data center AI, so Qualcomm has limited ability to pass tariff costs to smartphone makers. The stock dropped 11% over the past week, suggesting investors are already pricing in tariff risk. Qualcomm’s saving grace: its chips aren’t explicitly AI-focused. If exemptions target AI infrastructure, Qualcomm might avoid the worst impact. But if tariffs apply broadly to all Taiwan-manufactured semiconductors, the company faces cost headwinds without the pricing power to offset them. Apple is the least exposed. The company doesn’t manufacture AI chips for external sale. Its custom silicon (A-series, M-series) powers iPhones, iPads, and Macs. While those chips incorporate AI features, they’re not sold as standalone AI accelerators. Apple’s $3.84 trillion market cap and consumer electronics focus insulate it from AI chip tariffs. The company’s supply chain includes TSMC-manufactured processors, but tariffs would hit Apple as a cost of goods sold issue, not a revenue threat. With 47% gross margins and $416 billion in trailing revenue, Apple can absorb incremental costs better than pure-play chip manufacturers. The stock is down 5% year-to-date, underperforming the semiconductor rally. That divergence reflects Apple’s limited direct AI exposure. It’s not riding the AI infrastructure wave like NVIDIA or AMD. Tariffs reinforce that positioning. TSMC and NVIDIA face the most acute tariff risk. One manufactures in the tariff zone, the other depends entirely on that manufacturing. AMD follows closely, with less pricing power to offset costs. Qualcomm and Apple sit further down the exposure curve, either because their chips aren’t AI-focused (Qualcomm) or because they’re end consumers rather than chip sellers (Apple). Thursday’s rally on TSMC earnings shows investors still believe in AI demand. But tariff exemptions will determine whether that demand translates to profits. Watch for guidance cuts if exemptions disappoint, especially from TSMC and NVIDIA. Our top personal finance-related articles today. Your wallet will thank you later.

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/15/2026 1:46:22 PM PST by SoConPubbie SUPPORTING AMERICA’S SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY: Today, President Donald J. Trump signed a Proclamation invoking Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (Act) to address national security concerns with respect to imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and their derivative products.The President directed the U.S. Secretary of Commerce and U.S. Trade Representative to jointly negotiate agreements, or continue any current negotiations of agreements, to address the threatened impairment of the national security with respect to imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and their derivative products from any country.The President also imposed a 25% tariff on certain advanced computing chips, such as the NVIDIA H200 and AMD MI325X. This tariff will not apply to chips that are imported to support the buildout of the U.S. technology supply chain and the strengthening of domestic manufacturing capacity for derivatives of semiconductors.In the near future, President Trump may impose broader tariffs on imports of semiconductors and their derivative products, as well as an accompanying tariff offset program to incentivize domestic manufacturing as previously announced.ADDRESSING THE THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY: President Trump recognizes that restoring capacity for domestic production of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and their derivative products is critical for economic and national security.This action follows the Secretary of Commerce’s completion of a Section 232 investigation under the Act, which found that the present quantities and circumstances of the imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and their derivative products threaten to impair national security.The United States’ capacity to produce semiconductors, certain semiconductor manufacturing equipment such as advanced lithography and etching tools, and their derivative products is insufficient to meet domestic demand. This has led the United States to be dependent on foreign sources to meet domestic demand. Semiconductors are essential to the United States’ economic, industrial, and military strength, and a disruption of import-reliant supply chains could strain the nation’s industrial and military capabilities.Today’s action will address the threat to national security by, among other things, incentivizing domestic production of semiconductors and reducing our nation’s reliance on foreign sources and foreign supply chains.BUILDING ON A RECORD OF SECURING CRITICAL INDUSTRIES: This Proclamation builds upon previous actions taken by the Trump Administration to ensure U.S. trade and industrial policies put America first.On Day One, President Trump established his America First Trade Policy to make America’s economy great again.President Trump has repeatedly used Section 232 tariffs to protect against threats to our national security and to strengthen manufacturing sectors critical for our national and economic security, including steel, aluminum, copper, autos, and lumber.Throughout his first year back in office, President Trump has announced many historic international trade deals to defend domestic production while expanding market access with America’s partners.

Stocks steadied on Wall Street on Thursday. The S&P 500 rose 17.87 points, or 0.3%, to 6,944.47, breaking a two-day losing streak and edging back toward the all-time high it set on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 292.81 points, or 0.6%, to 49,442.44. The Nasdaq composite rose 58.27 points, or 0.2%, to 23,530.02. Nvidia and other formerly high-flying tech stocks helped lift the market after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., a major supplier to the industry, reported strong profits and investment plans, the AP reports. Also helping to calm the market were oil prices, which eased sharply on hopes for calming tensions in Iran. TSMC also said it could boost its investment in equipment to $56 billion this year to take advantage of the AI boom. Nvidia was one of the heaviest weights on the S&P 500 Wednesday after sinking 1.4%. But it rose 2.1% after TSMC Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang said it's seeing "continued strong demand" in an encouraging signal for the entire AI industry. TSMC is a crucial player as a major supplier for Nvidia and other giants and as a key customer for ASML and other providers. TSMC's stock that trades in the US rose 4.4%, while ASML's US-listed stock rallied 5.4%. Other chip-related companies helped lead the US stock market, including gains of 7.7% for KLA Corp. and 5.7% for Applied Materials.

A barrel of benchmark US crude sank 4.6% to $59.19, while Brent crude, the international standard, dropped 4.1% to settle at $63.76 per barrel. Analysts pointed to comments from President Trump, who said Wednesday afternoon that he heard "on good authority" that plans for executions in Iran have stopped amid widespread protests against the country's leadership. Financial markets took that as a signal that tensions flaring above some of the world's largest oil deposits could ease and lower the possibility of a disruption to the flow of oil. Gold's price edged back 0.3% in another signal of potentially calming nerves across financial markets.

Title: New World will join the graveyard of defunct MMOs when it goes offline in 2027

The MMO's last season will be extended until its final day. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. New World, the only Amazon game that stuck around long enough to find a steady amount of players, is now being ushered toward the graveyard with all the other games the ecommerce megacorp has shut down for good. And now we have the date for its final day: January 31, 2027. The game has now been delisted from Steam and every platform you could buy it on, and will only be playable by anyone who already owns it. Amazon says in a post about the news that the only way to refund the game is to contact the customer service of the platform you bought it on. There will be no refunds for Marks of Fortune, the MMO's premium currency. The MMO will remain playable for the next year until the servers shut down, but there won't be any future updates other than bug fixes and performance updates. While the game remains in stasis, its Nighthaven season will continue all the way until the end. "We want to thank the players for your dedication and passion," the post reads. "We are grateful for the time spent crafting the world of Aeternum with you. Together we built something special. While we are saddened to say goodbye, we're honored that we were able to share so much with the community." New World's end was preceded by a massive round of layoffs in October that slashed around 14,000 jobs at Amazon. It said they were part of "strategic changes" at the company and that it would halt "a significant amount" of first-party game development, particularly around MMOs. That same day, Amazon announced that it was "no longer sustainable to continue supporting [New World] with new content updates," and that its Nighthaven update would be its last. Developers on the game snuck a goodbye letter into the update, which was pointed out by one of the senior game designers after it dropped. It would be hard to call New World an explosive success, but it certainly wasn't a flop. Although the MMO never reached Final Fantasy 14 or World of Warcraft levels, it did bounce between 50,000 and 60,000 concurrent players on Steam after it was released. That's quite a lot for a newer MMO in an age where MMOs don't really catch on like it used to. Star Wars: The Old Republic hovers around 5,000 concurrent players on Steam, but whatever it's doing must be enough for EA to keep it around. I can only imagine Amazon had absurdly high expectations for it after watching it bring in more than a million players on release. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Even though New World still has a year of life left, I will be curious to see if anyone manages to find a way to spin up private servers of it. Earlier this week, EA's live service shooter Anthem shut down, and its project lead suggested that there's a version of the game out there that could be turned into a private server if someone were to get their hands on it. 2026 games: All the upcoming gamesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Tyler has covered videogames and PC hardware for 15 years.

Title: Why Wall Street refuses to sell Bitcoin – and actually bought way more – even while losing 25% of its value

Wall Street's increased Bitcoin ETF shares in Q4 2025 highlight strategic buying during price slides, hinting at a more complex market play. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Institutional investment managers increased their allocations to US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) during the fourth quarter of 2025, despite the asset suffering a sharp price correction that shaved nearly a quarter off its market value. The divergence between rising share counts and falling asset values presents a complex picture of institutional behavior during a period of extreme volatility. According to CryptoSlate's data, Bitcoin's price began the last three months of last year on a strong footing, reaching a new all-time high of more than $126,000 in October. However, that rally proved unsustainable and gave way to a tumultuous period sparked by a massive $20 billion deleveraging event. By the time the year concluded, Bitcoin was trading under $90,000. Massive sell-off causes over $7 billion in liquidations, exposing crypto's structural weaknesses during volatile trading. Despite this turbulent backdrop, early regulatory filings suggest that professional money managers viewed the pullback as a buying opportunity rather than a reason to exit the market. As of press time, BTC has since returned to an upward momentum this year and is eyeing a break above $100,000. An early analysis of 13F filings compiled by Bitcoin analyst Sani revealed that 121 institutions reported a net increase of 892,610 shares across various US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of 2025. Paradoxically, while the physical number of shares held by these firms increased, the aggregate dollar value of those holdings fell by approximately $19.2 million. To understand this dynamic, one must look at the raw totals reported by these firms. In the third quarter of 2025, the tracked institutions held a collective 5,252,364 shares valued at roughly $317.8 million. By the end of the fourth quarter, their holdings had swelled to 6,144,974 shares, yet the market value of that larger pile had shrunk to $298.6 million. This math reveals the extent of the drawdown. Based on these filings, the implied average value per ETF share held by these institutions dropped from approximately $60.50 in Q3 to roughly $48.60 in Q4. That marks a decline of roughly 19.7%. Despite this repricing, the total share count held by these managers rose by about 17%. The drop to $88,500 isn't random noise; historical data confirms that this specific year-end deviation exposes exactly how institutional risk budgets are tightening for 2025. The narrative emerging from the data is clear. These investors continued to buy units even as the mark-to-market value of their holdings evaporated, adding exposure directly into the teeth of a drawdown. For context, Dartmouth College’s $9 billion endowment fund revealed it had acquired around $15 million in shares of BlackRock's IBIT and Grayscale's Ethereum fund, despite the broader market situation. Notably, these positions are new and show how the crypto ETFs continue to attract institutional interest regardless of their performance. Nowhere is this disconnect between capital flows and asset performance more visible than in the books of the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). Last year, the fund achieved something incredibly rare in the asset management business as it attracted billions of dollars in fresh inflows while losing money for its clients. IBIT ended 2025 as the sixth-most popular ETF in the United States by net inflows, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data. It raised $25.4 billion in fresh cash, beating established giants like the Invesco QQQ Trust and the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD). This influx occurred despite IBIT posting a 10% loss. By contrast, gold rallied nearly 65% in 2025, buoyed by central bank purchases and geopolitical anxiety. Industry stakeholders noted that the fund's performance demonstrated the asset managers' conviction in Bitcoin. IBIT now generates more revenue for BlackRock than funds that have been operating for decades. Matt Hougan, the Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, pointed out that 99% of advisors who owned crypto in 2025 plan to increase or maintain their exposure this year. People have wondered what advisors would do if crypto hit a patch of volatility. We have our answer: They're planning to buy more. However, there is an interesting caveat to the “institutional adoption” narrative. Spot Bitcoin ETFs exist at the crossroads of long-term investment and short-term arbitrage. A rising share count in a 13F filing looks like bullish conviction, but it can often mask a market-neutral hedge. On the surface, the adoption story holds water. State Street research from December estimates the US Bitcoin ETF market at $103 billion, with institutions owning nearly a quarter of that float. Their data suggests that 60% of institutional investors prefer the regulatory safety of an ETF wrapper over holding physical coins. However, the “long ETF” positions reported in 13F filings do not tell the whole story. These forms require managers to disclose long positions in US equities but do not require disclosure of short positions. Notably, this effectively hides the other side of the trade. As the CME has noted, hedge funds frequently use spot ETFs to execute basis trades. They buy the ETF (which shows up in the filing) and simultaneously short Bitcoin futures (which does not). This allows them to capture the spread between the spot and futures price without taking any directional risk on Bitcoin itself. Bitcoin's tumultuous year saw regulatory embrace, miner crises, and Wall Street's long-awaited entry into the crypto realm. This distinction is critical for forecasting the market's next move. If the fourth quarter’s accumulation was driven by genuine allocators building “portfolio sleeves,” that capital is likely sticky. However, if it was driven by hedge fund capitalizing on spreads, that capital is mercenary. It could reverse quickly if volatility spikes or if the basis trade becomes less profitable. Regardless of the motive, the result is the same. In a quarter where Bitcoin lost nearly a quarter of its value, Wall Street ended up owning more of it. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Investing ASML (ASML) holds 100% of EUV lithography for advanced chips. Microsoft (MSFT) controls 80% of office productivity. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) captures 90% of search. Microsoft generates over $70B in annual free cash flow with 43% operating margins. ASML analysts forecast 25% annual earnings growth over five years. Alphabet revenue jumped from $400B in 2025 to projected $455B in 2026. Antitrust rulings confirmed its search monopoly but imposed mild remedies. Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. Monopolies, we’re told, are bad things. With excessive market power, they can raise prices, reduce innovation, lower product quality, and offer less consumer choice. This is why they often draw antitrust scrutiny and ethical concerns. Yet some companies achieve dominance through sheer innovation, scale, and technological barriers that competitors simply can’t breach. These natural leaders don’t rely on underhanded tactics; instead, they build moats so wide that they become indispensable to their industries. Regulators may occasionally poke at them, but their core strengths endure, making them some of the best bets for long-term growth. There are three such powerhouses that stand out for the benign power they wield that you should consider buying for your portfolio today: ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). These firms command virtual monopolies in their niches, offering investors stability and significant upside potential from secular trends like digital transformation and semiconductor demand. ASML Holding is a Dutch dynamo that essentially controls the production of the world’s most cutting-edge chips. ASML’s extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems are the only viable tools for fabricating most processors at 7nm and smaller nodes, powering everything from smartphones to AI supercomputers. Without ASML’s machines, industry titans like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and Samsung would likely grind to a halt, as no credible alternatives exist in this hyper-specialized field. This isn’t just dominance — it’s a stranglehold built on decades of R&D, intricate patents, and a supply chain that’s nearly impossible to replicate. ASML’s market position is bolstered by its better than 90% share in advanced deep ultraviolet (DUV) tools and complete control over EUV, where rivals like Nikon and Canon lag years behind. As AI and 5G drive insatiable chip demand, ASML benefits from surging orders, with projections for mid-teens revenue growth in 2026 despite short-term headwinds from China export curbs. Analysts forecast 25% earnings growth annually over the next five years, fueled by High-NA EUV ramps and logic/memory capex from clients like Taiwan Semiconductor, which just announced plans for $56 billion in 2026 spending. ASML’s monopoly insulates it from cyclical downturns, and with global chip fabs expanding, it’s poised for 20% or more growth through 2027. Wall Street rates it a Buy, with targets up to $1,550 per share, implying solid upside from current levels around $1,335 per share. For investors eyeing the AI boom, ASML is the ultimate enabler. Google parent Alphabet reigns supreme in the digital search arena, where its engine processes billions of queries daily and captures about 90% of the global market. This isn’t accidental dominance — it’s the result of network effects, vast data troves, and a superior algorithm that keeps users loyal and advertisers hooked. Bing and DuckDuckGo nibble at the edges, but they lack the scale to challenge Google’s ecosystem, which seamlessly integrates search with YouTube, Maps, and Android. In 2025, Alphabet’s revenue hit roughly $400 billion, with 2026 projections at $455 billion — a 14% jump — driven by ad recovery and cloud gains. Earnings per share are expected to rise 6% to $11.27, though some see mid-teens growth if AI integrations like Gemini continue accelerating. The company’s forward P/E of around 28 reflects its premium status, but with operating margins north of 30% and free cash flow gushing, it’s justified. Antitrust rulings in 2025 confirmed Google’s search monopoly but imposed mild remedies, preserving its core business while avoiding breakups. Alphabet’s appeal lies in its diversification: Beyond search, Google Cloud is growing 30%, and “Other Bets” like Waymo hint at future revenues. Analysts overwhelmingly rate it a Buy, with price targets averaging $318 and highs at $400 per share, suggesting 20% gains. In a data-driven economy, Alphabet’s monopoly ensures steady compounding. Microsoft has evolved from a software relic into a cloud and AI juggernaut, holding an 80% grip on office productivity tools through Microsoft 365 and a 20% to 30% share in cloud infrastructure through Azure. Its monopoly stems from an ecosystem lock-in: Businesses rely on integrated suites like Office, Teams, and Dynamics, where switching costs are prohibitively high. Competitors like Google Workspace exist, but Microsoft’s enterprise entrenchment and AI infusions through Copilot make it irreplaceable. Fiscal 2025 revenue soared 15% to $281.7 billion, with Azure up 34% and Q1 2026 hitting $77.7 billion (18% growth). Operating margins stand at 43%, generating over $70 billion in free cash flow annually. Analysts project 16% revenue growth in 2026, with EPS climbing similarly, propelled by AI adoption and cloud migration. Despite hefty capex for AI infrastructure, Microsoft’s AAA balance sheet supports dividends and buybacks. This stock is a buy for its defensive moat and offensive growth: Azure could snag the top cloud spot from AWS, and AI utilities promise recurring revenue. With 39 of 43 analysts rating it Buy and targets averaging $630 per share, implying 37% upside, Microsoft offers a portfolio both reliability and growth.

Δ The investment management firm and the tech giant joined forces in 2024 to fund data centers behind the AI boom and are now closer to their $30 billion goal, the report said. The partnership also includes Nvidia, xAi and United Arab Emirates-affiliated MGX investment group. The effort “continues to attract significant capital,” BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told analysts during the call, per the report. The partnership is aiming to pull in $30 billion of private equity capital and then mobilize up to $100 billion in investment potential, including debt financing for infrastructure projects, PYMNTS reported in September 2024. “We are committed to ensuring AI helps advance innovation and drives growth across every sector of the economy,” Microsoft Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella said at the time. “The Global AI Infrastructure Investment Partnership will help us deliver on this vision, as we bring together financial and industry leaders to build the infrastructure of the future and power it in a sustainable way.” The group made a $40 billion deal in October to acquire Aligned Data Centers from Macquarie Asset Management, which called it the largest data center acquisition in history. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue Meanwhile, new research suggests that AI may no longer need massive data centers to scale. A study from Switzerland-based tech university EPFL found that while frontier model training is still computationally intensive, many operational AI systems can be deployed without requiring centralized hyperscale facilities. Instead, these systems can distribute workloads across existing machines, regional servers or edge environments, cutting back on the reliance on large, centralized clusters. “The research highlights a growing mismatch between AI infrastructure and real-world enterprise use cases,” PYMNTS reported Friday (Jan. 9). “These systems often rely on smaller models, repeated inference and localized data rather than continuous access to massive, centralized models.” Nvidia found that small language models could carry out 70% to 80% of enterprise tasks, leaving the most complex reasoning to large-scale systems, a structure that is becoming the most cost-effective way to operationalize AI.

Record earnings from contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) sparked big stock gains Thursday, suggesting there's still gas in the tank to fuel the AI rally. TSMC on Thursday reported record quarterly profit of 505 billion new Taiwan dollars ($16 billion) on record revenue of more than NT$1 trillion ($33.1 billion). Both figures were well ahead of consensus estimates from Wall Street analysts. TSMC's U.S.-listed shares were up more than 5% in late-afternoon trading. Wall Street's response to TSMC's results underscored investors' appetite for evidence of AI-driven growth. Shares of chipmaking equipment providers Applied Materials (AMAT) and KLA Corp. (KLAC) soared 7% and 8%, respectively, pacing S&P 500 advancers, after TSMC forecast it would increase its spending on equipment and infrastructure by at least 25% this year. The AI trade stumbled in the finals months of 2025 as investors questioned the sustainability and wisdom of Silicon Valley's massive AI spending. Those concerns were on the back burner Thursday when TSMC's record results reinforced high expectations for companies with significant exposure to the AI data center buildout, including chip designers and data storage device makers. TSMC's earnings and spending plans also signaled healthy demand for AI chips, boosting the stocks of designers such as Nvidia (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Broadcom (AVGO). Wall Street's attitude toward AI has shifted over the past year. When once investors were happy to reward companies for their AI ambitions, Wall Street is increasingly looking for evidence that AI investments are delivering tangible financial benefits. “As the investment cycle continues to mature, markets are likely to exemplify greater emphasis on monetization and earnings in 2026,” wrote Wedbush analysts in a research note on Thursday. Wedbush expects the market will be led this year by companies that can demonstrate AI-related spending is improving cash flows or profit margins. That shift has produced a widening divide between the tech sector's haves and have-nots. The PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) is up 12% since the start of the year, propelled higher by stocks like Micron (MU) and Lam Research Corp (LRCX), whose top and bottom lines are being bolstered by AI demand. Shares of data storage device maker Sandisk (SNDK) have risen about 70% since the start of the year—more than double the return of the S&P 500’s next-best performing stock—amid insatiable demand for the storage and memory solutions required to operate the most powerful AI models. Meanwhile, concerns about AI monetization have weighed on shares of software giants Intuit (INTU), ServiceNow (NOW) and Adobe (ADBE), which some investors worry may struggle to fend off AI-native competition and adapt their pricing models to a new tech paradigm.

Title: Amazon Puts the Nail in the Coffin: New World Aeternum Delisted Today, Will Go Offline January 2027

After Amazon killed New World Aeternum by cancelling new content for it, just as players were starting to return to the game, it began putting the nails in New World's coffin today. First, by suddenly delisting the game as of today, January 15, 2026. Second, by announcing that the game will go offline on January 31, 2027. A blog post on the official New World website begins explaining the news by saying it wanted to "provide transparency on where the game goes from here." Which, essentially, is nowhere. "New World: Aeternum will officially be taken offline from all platforms on January 31, 2027," reads the next line. If you already have the game in your Steam library, then you'll still be able to play it for the remainder of this year, which Amazon previously promised would be the case. After December 31, 2026, though, you'll only have one more month to enjoy the MMORPG. If you don't have it in your library, then you've already missed your chance to grab it, as the purchase option has already been removed from the store page. New World: Aeternum will officially be taken offline from all platforms on January 31, 2027.Learn more: https://t.co/FK9O07Hm0F pic.twitter.com/UBXHaetLSz You can still purchase microtransactions, if you want, until July 20, 2026; however, Amazon Game Studios has made it clear that refunds will not be available for Marks of Fortune microtransaction purchases. Amazon Game Studios will also still monitor the servers and release bug fixes for the remainder of the game's life. New content for New World was shut down after Amazon Game Studios was hit with "significant" layoffs as part of Amazon's mass 14,000+ company-wide layoff last year. After the studio was clear that it wouldn't be making new content for New World, it was clear that the game would be shut down at some point, so this news isn't exactly surprising. It is, however, still disappointing. Amazon had succeeded where others failed by being a major company not previously involved in video games, which entered the industry and actually knocked it out of the park with a successful internally-built game. New World was putting up huge player numbers, and while it had previously fallen into a bit of a low period, just prior to the announcement that no more new content would be developed for it, players were starting to really return to the game. "We want to thank the players for your dedication and passion," the blog post from Amazon Game Studios reads. "We are grateful for the time spent crafting the world of Aeternum with you. Together we built something special. While we are saddened to say goodbye, we’re honored that we were able to share so much with the community." "It has been our pleasure to work on New World: Aeternum and evolve this unforgettable adventure with you all. We look forward to one more year together, and giving this fantastic adventure a sendoff worthy of a legendary hero. From the bottom of all our hearts, thank you for sharing this world with us."

Title: Bitcoin: Big money buys the uncertainty as BTC defends $96K
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/?p=561821
Time Published: 2026-01-15T20:00:11Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin’s breakout reflects structural strength as disbelief continues to fuel upside momentum. Bitcoin rebounds near $96k as BlackRock-linked buying tops $646.6M, while Santiment flags a ten-day peak in retail FUD globally. Institutional activity continues to diverge sharply from retail sentiment, creating a constructive backdrop. Whale Insider data confirmed that BlackRock clients accumulated $646.62 million in BTC, signaling conviction from long-term capital. Meanwhile, Santiment’s social metrics showed bearish commentary reaching a ten-day high, despite Bitcoin holding the $96,000–$97,000 zone. This contrast matters because institutions rarely chase momentum. Instead, they accumulate during uncertainty. As retail traders hesitate and question the rebound, large buyers absorb available supply. Pessimism reflects disbelief rather than distribution. Such belief gaps often appear during continuation phases, not market tops, reinforcing the underlying structure. Bitcoin [BTC] has broken out of the highlighted accumulation zone, confirming a transition from the prior mark-down phase into early mark-up. After the sharp selloff that defined the markdown, the price stabilized and consolidated between roughly $85,000 and $95,600, forming a clear accumulation base. Bitcoin has now pushed above the range high and established acceptance above $95,637, which previously acted as resistance and now functions as key support. Pullbacks toward this level continue to attract demand, reinforcing the role flip. Above support, price faces resistance near $105,000, followed by $116,147, both highlighted supply zones. However, the formation of higher lows beneath these levels suggests controlled expansion rather than exhaustion. Momentum confirms the shift, with RSI climbing into the upper 60s, reflecting strengthening upside participation without reaching overheated conditions, a typical trait of early mark-up phases. Source: TradingView Spot Taker CVD over the 90-day window has turned decisively positive, confirming aggressive buyers dominate execution. Rather than waiting passively, participants lift offers, signaling conviction behind the rebound. This shift matters because spot-led moves tend to hold better than leverage-driven spikes. Sustained positive CVD during consolidation reflects accumulation instead of emotional chasing. Additionally, buy-side dominance persists despite rising pessimism, reinforcing intent. Buyers commit capital while sentiment remains negative. Therefore, downside pressure weakens as genuine demand absorbs sell orders. This alignment supports structural continuation, tying price recovery to real flow rather than short-term speculative positioning. Source: CryptoQuant Liquidation data highlighted a leverage reset that favored stability. During the latest pullback, long liquidations reached roughly $17.99 million, while shorts accounted for only $1.47 million. This imbalance showed that long positions absorbed most forced closures. Importantly, Bitcoin held near $96,000 despite this flush, indicating strong spot demand underneath. When longs unwind without cascading selloffs, markets often stabilize rather than collapse. Moreover, leverage resets reduce fragility by clearing crowded positioning. Consequently, downside risk decreases instead of rising. This pattern supports continuation, as fewer overextended longs remain vulnerable to liquidation-driven declines. Source: CoinGlass The Binance BTC/USDT liquidation heatmap showed that the downside liquidity below $95,000 gradually clearing, while heavier clusters remained above the current price. Currently, as Bitcoin consolidates near $96,000, lower liquidation bands lose density, reducing downside pull. This shift matters because price often gravitates toward concentrated liquidity zones. With downside levels increasingly consumed, selling pressure weakens. Meanwhile, untested liquidity above the range continues to build, acting as a potential magnet if momentum strengthens. Therefore, the evolving heatmap structure favors upside exploration rather than renewed breakdowns. Source: CoinGlass To sum up, Bitcoin’s rebound reflects structural strength rather than speculative excess. Institutional accumulation, positive spot CVD, leverage resets, and thinning downside liquidity align with continuation. As long as buyers defend the $95,600 support zone, the broader setup favors expansion over failure, with disbelief-driven momentum still intact.

Your generous monthly contribution— or whatever you can give—will help secure our future. Matt Ott, Associated Press Matt Ott, Associated Press Leave your feedback WASHINGTON (AP) — Fewer Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week as U.S. layoffs remain low despite growing concern about a weakening job market. U.S. filings for jobless aid for the week ending Jan. 10 fell by 9,000 to 198,000, down from 207,000 the previous week, the Labor Department reported Thursday. The figure was significantly less than the 215,000 that analysts polled by the data firm FactSet were expecting. READ MORE: Sluggish hiring closes out a frustrating year for job seekers Applications for unemployment benefits are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. Last week, the government reported that hiring remained sluggish in December, capping a year of weak employment gains that have frustrated job seekers even though layoffs and unemployment remained low. Subscribe to Here’s the Deal, our politics newsletter for analysis you won’t find anywhere else. Thank you. Please check your inbox to confirm. Employers added just 50,000 jobs last month, nearly unchanged from a downwardly revised figure of 56,000 in November, the Labor Department said Friday. The unemployment rate slipped to 4.4%, its first decline since June, from 4.5% in November, a figure also revised lower. Also last week, the Labor Department reported that businesses posted far fewer jobs in November than the previous month, a sign that employers aren't yet ramping up hiring even as growth has picked up. Businesses and government agencies posted 7.1 million open jobs at the end of November, down from 7.4 million in October. Layoffs also dropped as companies seem to be retaining workers even as they are reluctant to add staff, a trend economists refer to as "low hire, low fire." READ MORE: The economy is giving mixed signals. Here's what experts say they mean Recent government data has revealed a labor market in which hiring has clearly lost momentum, hobbled by uncertainty raised by President Donald Trump's tariffs and the lingering effects of the high interest rates the Fed engineered in 2022 and 2023 to rein in a spike of pandemic-induced inflation. In an attempt to stabilize a softening labor market, the Federal Reserve last month trimmed its benchmark lending rate by a quarter-point, its third straight cut. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said members of the committee are increasingly concerned that the job market is even weaker than it appears. Powell suggested that recent job figures could be revised lower by as much as 60,000, which would mean employers have actually been shedding an average of about 25,000 jobs a month since the spring, when the Trump administration rolled out its sweeping import taxes. Companies that have recently announced job cuts include UPS, General Motors, Amazon and Verizon. Thursday's report from the Labor Department also said that the four-week average of jobless claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week volatility, fell by 6,500 to 205,000. The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the previous week ending Jan. 3 declined by 19,000 to 1.88 million, the government said. Support trusted journalism and civil dialogue.

Title: How to Gain Footing in AI as the Ground Keeps Shifting
URL: https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-developer-career-advice
Time Published: 2026-01-15T19:00:02Z
Full Content:
IEEE career guide offers tips on thriving amid ever-changing tech Willie Jones covers transportation for IEEE Spectrum and the history of technology for The Institute. The newly released Preparing for a Career as an AI Developer guide from the IEEE Computer Society argues that the most durable path to artificial intelligence jobs is not defined by mastering any single tool or model. Instead, it depends on cultivating a balanced mix of technical fundamentals and human-centered skills—capabilities that machines are unlikely to replace. AI is reshaping the job market faster than most academic programs and employers can keep up with, according to the guide. AI systems now can analyze cybercrime, predict equipment failures in manufacturing, and generate text, code, and images at scale, leading to mass layoffs across much of the technology sector. It has unsettled recent graduates about to enter the job market as well as early-career professionals. Yet the demand for AI expertise remains strong in the banking, health care, retail, and pharmaceutical industries, whose businesses are racing to deploy generative AI tools to improve productivity and decision-making—and keep up with the competition. The uneven landscape leaves many observers confused about how best to prepare for a career in a field that is redefining itself. Addressing that uncertainty is the focus of the guide, which was written by San Murugesan and Rodica Neamtu. Murugesan, an IEEE life senior member, is an adjunct professor at Western Sydney University, in Penrith, Australia. Neamtu, an IEEE member, is a professor of teaching and a data-mining researcher at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, in Massachusetts. The downloadable 24-page PDF outlines what aspiring AI professionals should focus on, which skills are most likely to remain valuable amid rapid automation, and why AI careers are increasingly less about building algorithms in isolation and more about applying them thoughtfully across domains. The guide emphasizes adaptability as the defining requirement for entering the field, rather than fluency in any particular programming language or framework. AI systems perform tasks that once required human intelligence. What distinguishes the current situation from when AI was introduced, the authors say, is not just improved performance but also expanded scope. Pattern recognition, reasoning, optimization, and machine learning are now used across nearly every sector of the economy. Although automation is expected to reduce the number of human roles in production, office support, customer service, and related fields, demand is rising for people who can design, guide, and integrate AI systems, Murugesan and Neamtu write. The guide cites surveys of executives about AI’s effect on their hiring and retention strategies, including those conducted by McKinsey & Co. The reports show staffing shortages in advanced IT and data analytics, as well as applicants’ insufficient critical thinking and creativity: skills that are difficult to automate. The authors frame the mismatch as an opportunity for graduates and early-career professionals to prepare strategically, focusing on capabilities that are likely to remain relevant as AI tools evolve. The strategic approach aligns with advice from Neil Thompson, director of FutureTech research at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, who was quoted in the guide. Thompson encourages workers to develop skills that complement AI rather than compete with it. “When we see rapid technological progress like this, workers should focus on skills and occupations that apply AI to adjacent domains,” he says. “Applying AI in science, in particular, has enormous potential right now and the capacity to unlock significant benefits for humanity.” Adaptability, the guide stresses, is not a substitute for technical rigor. A viable AI career still requires a strong foundation in data, machine learning, and computing infrastructure. Core knowledge areas include data structures, large-scale data handling, and tools for data manipulation and analysis, the authors say. Foundational machine-learning concepts, such as supervised and unsupervised learning, neural networks, and reinforcement learning, remain essential, they say. Because many AI systems depend on scalable computing, familiarity with cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure is important, according to the guide’s authors. Mathematics underpins all of it. Linear algebra, calculus, and probabilities form the basis of most AI algorithms. Python has emerged as the dominant language for building and experimenting with models. The authors highlight the value of hands-on experience with widely used development frameworks. PyTorch, developed by Meta AI, is commonly used for prototyping deep-learning models in academia and industry. Scikit-learn provides open-source tools for classification, regression, and clustering within the Python ecosystem. “When we see rapid technological progress like this, workers should focus on skills and occupations that apply AI to adjacent domains. —Neil Thompson, MIT TensorFlow, a software library for machine learning and AI created by Google, supports building and deploying machine-learning systems at multiple levels of abstraction. The authors emphasize that such tools matter less as résumé keywords than as vehicles for understanding how models behave within real-world constraints. Because AI projects often involve ambiguous problems and interdisciplinary teams, soft skills play an increasingly central role, according to the guide. Critical thinking and problem-solving are essential, but communication has become more important, the authors say. Many AI professionals must explain system behavior, limitations, and risks to nontechnical stakeholders. Neamtu describes communication and contextual thinking as timeless skills that grow more valuable as automation expands, particularly when paired with leadership, resilience, and a commitment to continuous learning. Murugesan says technical depth must be matched with the ability to collaborate and adapt. The guide recommends that students consider work on research projects in college, as well as paid internships, for exposure to real AI workflows and job roles with hands-on experience. Building an AI project portfolio is critical. Open-source repositories on platforms such as GitHub allow newcomers to demonstrate applied skills including work on AI security, bias mitigation, and deepfake detection. The guide recommends staying current by reading academic papers, taking courses, and attending conferences. Doing so can help students get a solid grounding in the basics and remain relevant in a fast-moving field after beginning their career. Common starting positions include AI research assistant, junior machine-learning engineer, and junior data analyst. The roles typically combine support tasks with opportunities to help develop models, preprocess data, and communicate results through reports and visualizations, according to the guide. Each starting point reinforces the guide’s central message: AI careers are built through collaboration and learning, not merely through isolated technical brilliance. Murugesan urges aspiring AI professionals to embrace continuous learning, seek mentors, and treat mistakes as part of the learning process. “Always be curious,” he says. “Learn from failure. Mistakes and setbacks are part of the journey. Embrace them and persist.” Neamtu echoes that perspective, noting that AI is likely to affect nearly every profession, making passion for one’s work and compatibility with organizational aims more important than chasing the latest technology trend. In a field where today’s tools can become obsolete in a year, the guide’s core argument is simple: The most future-proof AI career is built not on what you know now but on how well you continue learning when things change. Willie Jones is an associate editor at IEEE Spectrum. In addition to editing and planning daily coverage, he manages several of Spectrum's newsletters and contributes regularly to the monthly Big Picture section that appears in the print edition.

During the quarter, Loop executed a supply contract with Nike to serve as an anchor customer for the India facility. Solomita described the agreement as providing a fixed annual volume of “Twist,” Loop’s textile-to-textile polyester resin, at a fixed price for multiple years. He added that the contract includes a “take-or-pay” element, meaning Nike would still pay a percentage of the sales price if it does not take delivery of the material. On the call, management said it expects the India plant to have roughly five to six customers in total. Solomita said Loop currently has Tyrell Plus and Nike under contract and is in discussions with additional consumer packaged goods (CPG) and apparel companies to secure offtake commitments to fully contract the facility’s capacity. Textile-to-textile demand cited as a key growth driver Solomita emphasized growing demand for textile-to-textile recycling, pointing to regulatory changes in Europe that are intended to increase recycled content in clothing and push brands to address end-of-life textile waste. He said Loop’s technology is well suited for post-consumer textile waste because garments often combine materials (such as polyester with cotton or nylon) and include other components like buttons and zippers. According to Solomita, Loop’s approach relies on low-temperature depolymerization to break polyester down into DMT and MEG while leaving other materials intact so they can be filtered out afterward. He contrasted this with conventional recycling methods that rely on high pressure, high temperature processes or melting, which he said do not work well for mixed textile waste streams. He also highlighted the India project’s location near a free trade zone, which he said could enable importing waste clothing from Europe or other regions for processing. Solomita added that global polyester textiles represent a significant portion of PET and polyester production, which he said totals about 85 million tons per year, and framed the size of that market as a major opportunity for Loop. Engineering progress: Toyo engaged; modular approach discussed for Europe Loop said it hired Toyo, a Japanese engineering and construction company, to complete detailed engineering for the India facility. Solomita said detailed engineering began on November 1 and will run through the construction phase, adding that Toyo has a large presence in India and that Loop’s engineering team is “fully deployed” on the project. For Europe, Solomita discussed a modular build approach aimed at lowering capital costs. He said Loop’s design work in India is being adapted so modules can be built in a lower-cost country, shipped to Europe, and assembled on site. During the Q&A, he said the company has seen capital expenditure reductions “probably close to 50%” from modular construction compared with stick-built approaches. When asked whether capital costs in Europe would match India, Solomita said the European plant would likely be somewhat more expensive due to transportation and reassembly costs, but he said those costs could be offset if the selected site already has significant utilities in place. He described utilities as a major cost driver in chemical plants and said the lead German site under negotiation is a large chemical plant location with existing utility infrastructure. Europe licensing project: site selection nearing completion Loop also provided an update on its partnership with Reed Management and Société Générale Group, which holds a license to build one Loop plant in Europe. Solomita said the partner had evaluated roughly 20 sites and narrowed the list to three, with one lead site in Germany currently under negotiation. He said Loop expects the site decision to be finalized “very shortly,” likely by the end of January or early February. Once site selection is finalized, Solomita said Loop anticipates generating “meaningful revenue and profits” from providing engineering services for the project. He described engineering and milestone payments as occurring over the next three years and said the company believes those payments could cover Loop’s back-office expenses for several years. In response to a question, Solomita said the European plant is planned at the same scale as the India facility, with 70,000 tons of capacity. He said the European project is expected to be primarily packaging-focused, given textile supply chains are concentrated in Asia, though he noted that textiles could also be processed in Europe depending on customer needs. Financing and liquidity: debt syndication progressing; corporate expenses reduced Management said project financing efforts are continuing. Solomita stated that debt syndication for the India project is “moving well,” with several term sheets received from multilateral development banks, sovereign wealth funds, and commercial banks. He said terms were in line with expectations and that the company anticipates closing debt financing “in the coming months” in line with the project schedule. During the Q&A, Solomita said the India project’s debt package is $130 million, representing 70% of the project financing structure, and that Loop’s equity contribution is expected to be approximately $28 million. On the financial side, Solomita reported cash operating expenses of $2.2 million for the quarter, down $1.1 million year over year. Loop ended the quarter with total liquidity available of $7.7 million, and management said that figure is expected to decline in coming quarters. Solomita said Loop’s focus is raising the remaining financing needed for its equity contribution and operating expenses until the India facility starts up. He added that Loop is engaged with multiple parties regarding financing and expects anticipated engineering revenues from India and Europe to help fund ongoing operations until the first facility becomes operational. Loop also introduced Spencer Hart as its new chief financial officer. Hart said he brings more than 30 years of investment banking experience and intends to focus on supporting capital raising efforts. He also echoed management’s commentary on expense reductions, saying the company had managed expenses well in the quarter and identified opportunities to reduce spending further.About Loop Industries NASDAQ: LOOPLoop Industries NASDAQ: LOOP is a technology innovator in the sustainable plastics sector.

Investing RBC initiated Nvidia with a $240 target, citing $500B+ backlog and surging enterprise demand. Barclays upgraded Dell to overweight on AI server order strength and expanding enterprise opportunities. Rosenblatt initiated Quantum Computing with a buy rating, citing legitimate quantum assets across multiple domains. Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. Analysts at RBC just initiated coverage of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) with an outperform rating and a $240 price target. The firm cited NVDA’s $500 billion+ backlog, inferencing demand, and surging enterprise demand as reasons for further growth. In addition, analysts at Rothschild Redburn reiterated a buy rating on NVDA with a price target of $268. The firm believes NVDA will remain a positive outlier with regard to size, growth, and profitability. They also believe its moat will continue to become even stronger than expected. Technically, NVDA just broke above its 50-day moving average to the upside. From here, if it can break above resistance at around $193.63, it could retest $200. Analysts at Barclays just upgraded Dell (NYSE: DELL) to an overweight rating, citing strength in Dell’s AI server orders, stability of its AI operating markets, and expanding opportunities in enterprise server and storage. The firm maintained its price target of $148 a share. “We are more positive on DELL given the strength in AI server orders, stability of AI op margins, expanding opportunities in enterprise server and storage, and DELL’s consistent disciplined opex management,” they added, as quoted by CNBC. After finding strong double bottom support at $115, Dell is just starting to pivot higher. Last trading at $123.18, we’d like to see it initially retest $130 a share. Analysts at Rosenblatt just initiated a buy rating on Quantum Computing (NASDAQ: QUBT). The firm noted the company “has legitimate quantum assets across photonics, compute, security, and sensing as well as burgeoning thin film lithium niobate (TFLN) fabs that could supply both their and industry needs for integrated quantum photonics, nonlinear optics, and optical waveguides,” as quoted by CNBC. We also have to remember that this powerful technology is set to revolutionize industries from healthcare and finance to cybersecurity and energy — solving problems that today’s fastest supercomputers can’t touch.

Title: Carbon Credits Market Set to Transform with US$ 4,983.7 Billion Valuation by 2035 | Astute Analytica

January 15, 2026 12:23 ET | Source: AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. Chicago, Jan. 15, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- According to recent data from Astute Analytica, the global carbon credit market was valued at US$ 1,142.40 billion in 2024 and is projected to hit the market valuation of US$ 4,983.7 billion by 2035 at a CAGR of 18% during the forecast period 2025–2035. The carbon credit market is on the cusp of unprecedented growth, largely propelled by robust corporate demand. In 2023 alone, companies retired an impressive 161 million carbon credits, reflecting a strong and sustained commitment to climate action. This momentum is further bolstered by over 5,200 firms that have adopted Science Based Targets (SBTs), aligning their emissions reduction strategies with the latest climate science. These companies represent a diverse cross-section of industries, all actively driving demand for carbon credits as part of their sustainability commitments, making corporate action a primary engine behind the market’s rapid expansion. Request Sample Pages: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/request-sample/carbon-credit-market This surge in demand is creating a distinct bifurcation within the carbon credit market, separating credits by type, quality, and price. On one end of the spectrum, low-cost renewable energy credits are trading at modest prices, often as low as $1 to $2 per ton. These credits represent emissions reductions from renewable power projects and serve as accessible entry points for companies with basic offsetting needs. On the other end, premium nature-based credits—originating from projects like forest conservation and reforestation—command prices exceeding $12 per ton. These projects offer additional environmental and social co-benefits, contributing to their higher valuation. Elevating Carbon Credits: From Offsets to Financial Assets The carbon credit market is evolving far beyond its original role as a straightforward mechanism for offsetting emissions. Today, it is rapidly transforming into a sophisticated financial ecosystem where carbon credits are recognized as valuable financial assets. This formalization marks a pivotal trend that is reshaping the market’s growth trajectory. A cornerstone of this financial evolution is the emergence of exchange-traded futures contracts for carbon credits. Platforms such as CME’s N-GEO futures have introduced standardized contracts that allow investors to buy and sell carbon credits on regulated exchanges. These futures contracts provide a level of price discovery, risk management, and market transparency that was previously elusive in the carbon market. In parallel with futures trading, the launch of over 15 specialized carbon investment funds in 2023 signals a growing institutional appetite for carbon assets. These funds pool capital from institutional investors eager to gain exposure to the carbon market’s growth potential while supporting climate action. By offering professionally managed portfolios focused exclusively on carbon credits and related projects, these funds provide an efficient entry point into this emerging asset class. Investment Flows and Compliance Markets Strengthen Supply Foundations: Global Carbon Credit Supply The global carbon credit supply landscape is undergoing a significant transformation, fueled by targeted investment and the emergence of expansive compliance frameworks. Over the past decade, capital has increasingly gravitated towards regions that combine robust regulatory environments with abundant nature-based carbon sequestration potential. Between 2013 and 2023, nearly $42 billion was funneled into the development of carbon projects worldwide, underscoring the mounting financial commitment to climate solutions. The momentum in investment shows no signs of slowing. In fact, 2024 is poised to become a record-breaking year for carbon credit fundraising, with $14 billion already committed or raised by the third quarter alone. This surge reflects heightened investor confidence and expanding interest among institutional players, corporations, and governments eager to participate in the carbon market. Large-scale compliance markets are playing a pivotal role in reshaping the supply side of the carbon credit ecosystem. These regulatory frameworks establish mandatory emission reduction targets and create strong demand for verified carbon offsets, thereby incentivizing the development of high-quality projects. Regions with established compliance systems attract disproportionate investment and project activity, as market participants seek the certainty and legitimacy these frameworks provide. Tech-Based Carbon Credits: Rising to Market Prominence Technology-based carbon credits have rapidly ascended to a dominant position in the carbon credit market, capturing an impressive 46.9% share. This surge reflects a growing preference among buyers for solutions that provide permanent, reliable, and verifiable carbon removal. As climate goals become more ambitious and regulatory scrutiny intensifies, the demand for carbon credits backed by cutting-edge technologies has skyrocketed. A key driver behind the popularity of tech-based carbon credits is their ability to deliver permanent removal of CO2 from the atmosphere. Unlike nature-based solutions, which are susceptible to risks such as forest fires, disease, or land-use changes that can release stored carbon back into the environment, technologies like Direct Air Capture (DAC) and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) provide a more secure and lasting solution. Direct Air Capture (DAC) and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies stand at the forefront of the tech-based carbon credit market. DAC systems actively extract CO2 directly from ambient air, concentrating it for storage or utilization, while CCS captures emissions at their source and safely stores them underground. Both methods offer scalability and measurable results, making them attractive solutions as industries strive to offset hard-to-abate emissions. Carbon Removal Projects: The New Market Vanguard Carbon removal projects have surged to dominate the market, commanding a remarkable 75.3% share that reflects a profound shift in global climate strategy. The focus has evolved from merely preventing future emissions to actively extracting existing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This pivot underscores the urgency of addressing legacy carbon, which accumulates from decades of industrial activity. A significant portion of carbon removal projects leverages nature-based solutions, which utilize natural processes to capture and store carbon. A striking example from 2024 is an Amazon rainforest reforestation initiative that planted 10 million trees, with a projected CO2 removal potential of 2 million tonnes. These projects not only sequester carbon but also provide co-benefits such as biodiversity preservation, enhanced ecosystem resilience, and improved local livelihoods. Alongside nature-based efforts, technological carbon removal solutions are rapidly advancing, contributing to the market’s dominant share. These include direct air capture, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), and mineralization techniques designed to extract and securely store CO2. Technological removals offer the advantage of scalability and permanence, often complementing nature-based projects. Europe’s Commanding Lead in the Carbon Credit Market Europe firmly holds a dominant position in the global carbon credit market, commanding over 51.10% of the market share. This leadership is rooted in the region’s well-established and mature compliance frameworks, which provide a robust regulatory foundation that drives both mandatory and voluntary carbon offsetting activities. Europe’s pioneering approach to carbon management has set a global benchmark, particularly through its emphasis on high-permanence carbon removals that ensure long-term environmental impact. At the heart of Europe’s carbon credit market strength is the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), which remains the world’s largest and most advanced carbon pricing mechanism. In 2024, allowances within the ETS consistently traded above €70 per tonne of CO2, reflecting the region’s intense regulatory pressure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This high carbon price creates a compelling financial incentive for industries to lower their emissions and invest in offset projects, accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy. The stringent regulatory environment in Europe also fuels vibrant activity in the voluntary carbon credit market. In the past year alone, European companies retired over 52 million carbon credits, demonstrating a strong corporate commitment to carbon neutrality and sustainability goals. Leading energy giants such as Shell and Eni have spearheaded this movement, establishing significant offtake agreements that drive demand for high-quality carbon credits.

Life is Strange: Double Exposure developer Deck Nine Games will reveal the next Life is Strange game next week on January 20, 2026, in a live stream that will kick off at 10am PST / 1pm EST / 6pm GMT / 7pm CET. The news was revealed in a short teaser video posted to the official Life is Strange X (formerly Twitter) account, which seems to tease the return of series protagonists Max Caulfield and Chloe Price, who walk across the frame in the teaser. Separate the real from the rumor... Join us for the exclusive reveal of the next Life is Strange game: https://t.co/29yzDsGCb5January 20. 10am PST / 1pm EST / 6pm GMT / 7pm CET. pic.twitter.com/jYQphhU2e3 It's believed that the game revealed next week will be 'Life is Strange: Reunion,' a title that leaked from a PEGI ratings listing just last week. 2024's Double Exposure was the last game in the series, and one that carries its fair share of controversy with it among fans of the series. Not because it was an overall poor game - Wccftech gave it a 7.7/10 when we reviewed it when it launched - but because of the ways in which it impacts the storyline of the series, and how it makes players retcon the ending of the previous game right at the beginning. This next game could be a major turning point for the series and a major point for Deck Nine Games, which experienced two rounds of layoffs in 2024, the second coming after the release of Double Exposure. Hopefully, this new title will be a solution to Deck Nine's woes. We'll see how next week's reveal goes over with fans. In the meantime, if you're looking for more Life is Strange, Amazon has greenlit a TV series adaptation of the franchise led by Kaos writer Charlie Covell.

Investing Lyft has gained over 50% in the past two years while pursuing robotaxi partnerships targeting high-traffic areas like airports. Build-a-Bear Workshop surged 226% over two years and trades at 16.2x P/E while expanding internationally. Mid-cap stocks may benefit from falling interest rates and potential M&A activity as the rally broadens beyond mega-cap tech. Sending You to Google News in 3 © lyft (CC by 2.0) by stockcatalog The mid-cap stocks might finally be worth a second look now that interest rates are coming down. With more cuts expected in the new year and a potential wave of M&A activity that could see industry heavyweights scoop up the small- and mid-cap firms, perhaps considering a firm with a sub-$10 billion market cap could make sense with your next purchase. As always, the mid-cap stocks can be a choppier ride, but with greater volatility and risk could accompany a shot at decent rewards. In any case, let’s check in on two cheap-looking mid-cap names that I think are worth watching closely in an environment that might finally jolt the smaller firms that stand to benefit most as the stock market rally broadens beyond mega-cap tech. Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) is far more than just an app to check if you’re not happy with the ride prices over on Uber (NYSE:UBER). The $7.7 billion ride-hailing firm has been gaining ground in the past two years, rising by over 50%, as the firm held its ground against a tough rival in Uber. While there are still many, many miles of ground to make up if Lyft is to catch up to the likes of Uber, I do find the rise of autonomous vehicles to be an intriguing wild card that might actually work out in Lyft’s favor. Of course, Uber also has its own self-driving vehicle ambitions, but with Lyft going about robotaxis from a different angle, I do think that there’s potential to thrive in a specific corner of the robotaxi market. Notably, Lyft’s autonomous shuttle partnership could pay big dividends as the firm targets high-traffic areas like airports. Such a service is sure to be welcomed news by frequent flyers. Add regional robotaxi partnerships (think Waymo and lesser-known autonomous driving startups) into the equation, and Lyft seems to have a pretty solid growth runway as robotaxis continue to roll out. With Lyft also looking to hit the gas with its global expansion (especially in Europe), Lyft has a high growth ceiling, and if it can execute, I do think going with the ride-hailing underdog might prove more lucrative. Build-a-Bear Workshop (NYSE:BBW) might be a sub-$1 billion company, but the past two years’ worth of gains (up 226%) have put the name on the map of many retail investors, including those who aren’t interested in trading meme stocks. Though shares of the mall-based plushie retailer might have meme potential, I think the stock is an even better long-term hold, given its modest valuation multiple (shares go for 16.2 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) at the time of this writing) and improving fundamentals. As the company expands internationally while capitalizing on the “kidulting” trend with cherished, nostalgic brands (like Pokémon), it’s no mystery as to why Build-a-Bear might be the perfect growth stock to play the strengthening of the middle-income consumer in 2026. Indeed, it seems like the Build-a-Bear Workshops at the mall always seem to be packed these days. While tariffs and consumer spending shifts could make for a bumpy ride over the long haul, I do see ample room to run, especially given the mere $926 million market cap. Add lower rates into the equation, which tends to be a boon for smaller retailers, and Build-a-Bear Workshop stands out as one of the more compelling smaller-cap firms to follow closely. Who knows? Perhaps a toy giant might view the firm as a compelling takeover candidate, given its pristine balance sheet and impressive brand power. Our top personal finance-related articles today.

Title: Messari Research: Bitget’s UEX Model Scales with $18B in Tokenized Stock Volume and 82% Institutional Participation

January 15, 2026 09:47 ET | Source: Bitget Limited Bitget Limited Seychelles Seychelles VICTORIA, Seychelles, Jan. 15, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bitget, the world’s largest Universal Exchange (UEX), has been featured in a newly released Messari research report examining the platform’s evolving market structure and growth drivers. The report highlights the rapid scaling of Bitget’s UEX model, driven by the expansion of tokenized stocks and rising institutional participation. The report stated cumulative tokenized stock futures volume on Bitget reached approximately $18 billion by December 2025, while institutional traders accounted for 82% of spot trading volume, underscoring a structural shift toward professional and cross-asset participation on the platform. According to Messari’s analysis, tokenized stocks have emerged as one of the fastest-growing verticals within Bitget’s ecosystem since debuting in July 2025. Trading activity intensified sharply in recent months, with $13.6 billion of futures volume recorded in November alone. Bitget’s latest announcement also revealed close to 1 billion in spot trading volume during December, accounting for 89% of all Ondo's tokenized stocks volume in the same period. The concentration of activity points to rising global demand for on-chain access to traditional equities beyond the constraints of legacy market infrastructure. The report positions tokenized equities as a core pillar of Bitget’s UEX framework, which integrates centralized spot and derivatives trading, onchain asset access, and AI-assisted execution within a single platform. Tokenized stocks on Bitget trade on a 24/5 basis, allowing users across regions to respond to earnings announcements, macro events, and volatility outside traditional U.S. market hours. Messari notes that 39.6% of tokenized stock trading originates from East Asia, with growing participation from Latin America, Southeast Asia, and Europe, reinforcing the role of tokenization in redistributing global equity liquidity. “Tokenized equities are moving from experimentation to real market structure,” said Gracy Chen, CEO of Bitget. “What we’re seeing on Bitget reflects a structural shift in how global investors access traditional assets — continuous markets, on-chain settlement, and unified execution across asset classes are becoming baseline expectations rather than niche features.” Messari’s findings also highlight strong asset concentration among major U.S. equities. Tesla led activity with over $6.3 billion in cumulative volume, followed by Meta, MicroStrategy, Apple, and Google, which together generated more than $6.6 billion. The report attributes this demand to earnings-driven volatility, leveraged trading strategies, and increased appetite for AI- and macro-sensitive equities. Beyond tokenized stocks, the report underscores growth across Bitget’s broader UEX architecture. Since launching in April 2025, Bitget Onchain has generated over $2.4 billion in cumulative trading volume, enabling users to trade assets across Solana, BNB Chain, Ethereum, Base, and Morph using centralized exchange balances. “Bitget’s Universal Exchange model demonstrates how market structure is evolving toward consolidation rather than fragmentation,” said Shale Ferdana, Research Analyst at Messari and the author of the report. “The scale of tokenized stock activity, combined with rising institutional participation and onchain integration, suggests that unified platforms are becoming a preferred access point for both digital and traditional assets.” Institutional participation emerged as a key structural driver in the report. Institutional share of Bitget’s spot trading volume rose from 39.4% in January to 82% by December, while institutional market makers accounted for 60% of futures activity, coinciding with deeper liquidity and improved execution quality during periods of market volatility. The report concludes that Bitget’s UEX model reflects a broader shift toward consolidated trading infrastructure, where digital assets, tokenized real-world assets, and institutional liquidity converge within a single execution environment—reshaping how global capital accesses markets.

Title: ReelTime’s Reel Intelligence (“RI”) Becomes the First Multi-Modal AI Platform to Deliver Single-Image 2D-to-3D Models Ready for 3D Printing

January 15, 2026 09:20 ET | Source: ReelTime Media ReelTime Media Seattle, WA, Jan. 15, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ReelTime Media (OTCID:RLTR) today announced that its Reel Intelligence (“RI”) platform has reached a new milestone, becoming the first fully integrated, multi-modal artificial intelligence platform capable of converting a single 2D image into a rotatable 3D model that can be exported for 3D printing. RI Goes 3D Anyone can Try RI Now for free at www.tryrinow.com and experience it themselves. ReelTime stated that RI’s latest advancement enables users to take one image and automatically generate a three-dimensional model that can be viewed, rotated, refined, and exported in the industry-leading format GLB, which includes full color surpassing previous standards STL, and OBJ, making the output suitable for commercial and consumer 3D printing workflows. The Company emphasized that this capability is natively embedded within RI’s unified multi-modal platform, which already supports video, image, music, voice, research, and code generation. Unlike fragmented or experimental tools, RI’s 2D-to-3D functionality is designed for practical, real-world production use. Based on publicly available information, ReelTime noted that other widely known AI platforms do not currently offer a broadly accessible, single-image 2D-to-3D workflow designed for export and 3D printing, including: The Company further noted that Microsoft (MSFT) has introduced a limited image-to-3D feature through Copilot 3D, which is currently available only via Copilot Labs, requires specific account access, and, according to publicly available descriptions, is not broadly deployed as a fully integrated, print-focused solution. By comparison, ReelTime stated that RI’s solution is available standard within its production platform, does not require specialized labs programs or restricted access, and is designed to generate export-ready 3D models from a single image, a capability the Company believes places RI ahead of larger, centralized, hardware-dependent AI systems. “This milestone reinforces what we have said from the beginning, Reel Intelligence was built differently,” said Barry Henthorn, CEO of ReelTime Media. “RI is a unified, multi-modal intelligence platform, not a collection of disconnected tools. Delivering usable 3D models from a single image is now a real-world capability, and it highlights how RI continues to move ahead of legacy AI architectures.” ReelTime believes this advancement has potential applications across product design, manufacturing, rapid prototyping, media and entertainment, e-commerce visualization, education, and consumer creativity. The Company also emphasized that RI’s distributed, chip-agnostic architecture allows new capabilities to be introduced without reliance on centralized data centers, proprietary chipsets, or capital-intensive infrastructure, an approach that management believes supports long-term scalability and efficiency. As global demand for AI accelerates, Reel Intelligence is positioned for disproportionate long-term opportunity relative to capital-intensive AI incumbents. RI’s distributed, self-learning, multilingual, capital-light architecture aligns with global trends toward efficiency, decentralization, sustainability, and universal accessibility. About ReelTime Media: ReelTime Rentals, Inc. (OTCID:RLTR), doing business as ReelTime Media and ReelTime VR, is a Seattle area-based publicly traded company at the forefront of multimedia production and AI innovation.

Title: NVIDIA Has Rumoredly Cut Down GPU Supply To AICs By 15-20%; Also, No New GPUs This Year

90% Highly Likely Source 4/5 Corroboration 4/5 Technical 5/5 Timeline 5/5 Not just specific GPU models, but it appears that the entire RTX 50 series product lineup is seeing a noticeably reduced supply. [Update - 1/16/26] - NVIDIA has given us an official statement on the current rumors surrounding its RTX 50 series, stating that while demand of RTX GPUs remains strong and memory support is constrained, they continue to ship all GeForce SKUs and are working closely with their suppliers on memory availability. The full statement is as follows: Demand for GeForce RTX GPUs is strong, and memory supply is constrained. We continue to ship all GeForce SKUs and are working closely with our suppliers to maximize memory availability. NVIDIA to Wccftech If the reports of discontinuation of RTX 5070 Ti and other GPUs weren't bad enough, then you need to see this. Prominent hardware leaker @Zed__Wang has reported that NVIDIA has reduced its GPU supply to its board partners by around 15-20%. This is a significant reduction in the inventory, which will clearly impact the prices and availability in the coming days. The GPU prices have been steadily increasing for a few weeks now, but prepare for the worst. NVDA GPU supply to AIC has been cut down 15%-20%. The good news is that Nvidia still bundles a GPU with memory. The bad news is that there will be no new product in 2026. The leaker says that while the supply will be reduced, NVIDIA will still bundle the GPU with VRAM chips. Perhaps NVIDIA has decided not to discontinue supplying VRAM chips with the GPUs, as was reported previously. Anyways, it wouldn't have made sense to stop bundling VRAM chips when the GPU supply has already been reduced to such an extent. Since NVIDIA has reportedly ended the supply of GeForce RTX 5070 Ti GPU, and also a bunch of other GPUs due to DRAM shortages, it no longer has to worry a lot about not having enough VRAM chips. The bad news is that it might postpone the RTX 50 "SUPER" series, if not totally cancel it. Since Super series GPUs were expected to utilize 3 GB GDDR7 modules, it will be even harder for NVIDIA to source enough VRAM chips from the memory makers. The leaker's report is suggesting the same, and as per his information, we may not see any new GPUs this year. So, on top of reduced GPU supply, gamers won't have any refreshed series to be able to build or upgrade their PC builds. Similar problems exist with the Red Team as well. Radeon RX 9070 XT continues to see a surge in prices, and the RDNA 4 lineup doesn't have a lot of GPUs to start with. As for its RDNA 5/UDNA lineup, we aren't likely to see it before 2027.

(AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh) WASHINGTON (AP) — Fewer Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week as U.S. layoffs remain low despite growing concern about a weakening job market. U.S. filings for jobless aid for the week ending Jan. 10 fell by 9,000 to 198,000, down from 207,000 the previous week, the Labor Department reported Thursday. The figure was significantly less than the 215,000 that analysts polled by the data firm FactSet were expecting. Applications for unemployment benefits are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. Last week, the government reported that hiring remained sluggish in December, capping a year of weak employment gains that have frustrated job seekers even though layoffs and unemployment remained low. Employers added just 50,000 jobs last month, nearly unchanged from a downwardly revised figure of 56,000 in November, the Labor Department said Friday. The unemployment rate slipped to 4.4%, its first decline since June, from 4.5% in November, a figure also revised lower. Also last week, the Labor Department reported that businesses posted far fewer jobs in November than the previous month, a sign that employers aren’t yet ramping up hiring even as growth has picked up. Businesses and government agencies posted 7.1 million open jobs at the end of November, down from 7.4 million in October. Layoffs also dropped as companies seem to be retaining workers even as they are reluctant to add staff, a trend economists refer to as “low hire, low fire.” Recent government data has revealed a labor market in which hiring has clearly lost momentum, hobbled by uncertainty raised by President Donald Trump’s tariffs and the lingering effects of the high interest rates the Fed engineered in 2022 and 2023 to rein in a spike of pandemic-induced inflation. In an attempt to stabilize a softening labor market, the Federal Reserve last month trimmed its benchmark lending rate by a quarter-point, its third straight cut. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said members of the committee are increasingly concerned that the job market is even weaker than it appears. Powell suggested that recent job figures could be revised lower by as much as 60,000, which would mean employers have actually been shedding an average of about 25,000 jobs a month since the spring, when the Trump administration rolled out its sweeping import taxes. Companies that have recently announced job cuts include UPS, General Motors, Amazon and Verizon. Thursday’s report from the Labor Department also said that the four-week average of jobless claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week volatility, fell by 6,500 to 205,000. The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the previous week ending Jan. 3 declined by 19,000 to 1.88 million, the government said. Copyright 2026 The Associated Press.

Stock futures are pointing to a higher open Thursday amid a chip stock rally, while investors also digest a new slate of earnings from major banks; Oil futures are sliding as tensions around Iran's recent protests look to be easing; TSMC shares are surging after the chipmaking giant reported strong quarterly results; Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs results handily topped Wall Street expectations; and Nvidia is getting closer to selling H200 chips to China with White House approval. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are higher as chip stocks lead an early-morning rally following a strong earnings report from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM). Futures tied to the tech-heavy Nasdaq were up 0.9% recently, while S&P 500 futures added 0.4% and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures hovered near unchanged. The major indexes finished lower for a second straight day on Wednesday as bank stocks retreated following earnings from several major financial institutions. Crude oil futures have dropped below $60 per barrel as tensions with Iran that boosted the commodity in recent days look to have eased. Gold futures were down 0.3% at $4,620 an ounce, after hitting a record high on Wednesday. Bitcoin, which hit its highest level in two months yesterday, was down slightly from those levels, trading at $96,800. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on all sorts of loans, ticked up to 4.15%. Crude oil futures are tumbling Thursday morning after President Trump said that Iranian officials have told him the killing of protestors has stopped. Recent protests against the government in Iran have resulted in an estimated 2,500 or more deaths, creating uncertainty around the country's stability and therefore the stability of its oil industry. Trump had said previously that the U.S. military could get involved if the protests continued to be met with a violent response from the Iranian government. Crude oil futures surged to a three-month high on Wednesday, but WTI futures, the U.S. benchmark, were down 4% at $59.55 per barrel this morning. Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) are surging after the dominant chipmaker topped estimates in its latest quarterly report. For the fourth quarter, TSMC said it generated 1.05 trillion New Taiwan Dollars ($33.73 billion) in revenue, up 25% year-over-year, while profits surged 35% to $3.15 per American Depositary Receipt. Each metric came in higher than the analyst consensus, per estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. The contract manufacturer has been a major beneficiary of the AI boom, making advanced chips for many of the industry's heavyweights including Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). TSMC's U.S.-listed shares, which closed at a record high on Monday, were up 6% in recent premarket trading, while Nvidia and AMD added 1% and 2%, respectively. Shares of ASML (ASML), which makes equipment used by TSMC and other chipmakers to manufacture the semiconductors, were up more than 7% ahead of the opening bell. The heavy flow of earnings reports from major financial institutions continued this morning, with Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS) and asset management giant BlackRock (BLK) all releasing fourth-quarterly results. BlackRock reported first, with revenue, adjusted earnings per share, and total assets under management each coming in higher than analysts had forecast. Results from Goldman and Morgan Stanley also handily topped Wall Street expectations. Bank stocks have had a rough week. They sank Monday on a proposal from President Trump to cap credit card interest rates at 10%, and remained under pressure after a string of mixed reports from JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC). BlackRock shares were up about 2% in recent premarket trading, while Morgan Stanley fell slightly and Goldman dropped 2%. Nvidia moved a step closer to being able to sell its H200 chips to customers in China again this week, as the Department of Commerce updated its rules for semiconductor exports and Trump said his administration would support the sales. Last month, Trump said Nvidia would be allowed to sell the H200 chips, less advanced than Nvidia's Blackwell and new Vera Rubin chips, to China with the U.S. government receiving a 25% cut of the revenue. The Commerce Department said it would shift from rejecting exports of the chips to a case-by-case review. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said that demand has been strong from Chinese customers, but the Chinese government has previously told companies in the country not to buy less advanced Nvidia chips over concerns of the U.S. government's involvement in the process. Nvidia shares were up about 1% recently.

Stock futures are pointing to a higher open Thursday amid a chip stock rally, while investors also digest a new slate of earnings from major banks; Oil futures are sliding as tensions around Iran's recent protests look to be easing; TSMC shares are surging after the chipmaking giant reported strong quarterly results; Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs results handily topped Wall Street expectations; and Nvidia is getting closer to selling H200 chips to China with White House approval. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are higher as chip stocks lead an early-morning rally following a strong earnings report from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM). Futures tied to the tech-heavy Nasdaq were up 0.9% recently, while S&P 500 futures added 0.4% and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures hovered near unchanged. The major indexes finished lower for a second straight day on Wednesday as bank stocks retreated following earnings from several major financial institutions. Crude oil futures have dropped below $60 per barrel as tensions with Iran that boosted the commodity in recent days look to have eased. Gold futures were down 0.3% at $4,620 an ounce, after hitting a record high on Wednesday. Bitcoin, which hit its highest level in two months yesterday, was down slightly from those levels, trading at $96,800. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on all sorts of loans, ticked up to 4.15%. Crude oil futures are tumbling Thursday morning after President Trump said that Iranian officials have told him the killing of protestors has stopped. Recent protests against the government in Iran have resulted in an estimated 2,500 or more deaths, creating uncertainty around the country's stability and therefore the stability of its oil industry. Trump had said previously that the U.S. military could get involved if the protests continued to be met with a violent response from the Iranian government. Crude oil futures surged to a three-month high on Wednesday, but WTI futures, the U.S. benchmark, were down 4% at $59.55 per barrel this morning. Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) are surging after the dominant chipmaker topped estimates in its latest quarterly report. For the fourth quarter, TSMC said it generated 1.05 trillion New Taiwan Dollars ($33.73 billion) in revenue, up 25% year-over-year, while profits surged 35% to $3.15 per American Depositary Receipt. Each metric came in higher than the analyst consensus, per estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. The contract manufacturer has been a major beneficiary of the AI boom, making advanced chips for many of the industry's heavyweights including Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). TSMC's U.S.-listed shares, which closed at a record high on Monday, were up 6% in recent premarket trading, while Nvidia and AMD added 1% and 2%, respectively. Shares of ASML (ASML), which makes equipment used by TSMC and other chipmakers to manufacture the semiconductors, were up more than 7% ahead of the opening bell. The heavy flow of earnings reports from major financial institutions continued this morning, with Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS) and asset management giant BlackRock (BLK) all releasing fourth-quarterly results. BlackRock reported first, with revenue, adjusted earnings per share, and total assets under management each coming in higher than analysts had forecast. Results from Goldman and Morgan Stanley also handily topped Wall Street expectations. Bank stocks have had a rough week. They sank Monday on a proposal from President Trump to cap credit card interest rates at 10%, and remained under pressure after a string of mixed reports from JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC). BlackRock shares were up about 2% in recent premarket trading, while Morgan Stanley fell slightly and Goldman dropped 2%. Nvidia moved a step closer to being able to sell its H200 chips to customers in China again this week, as the Department of Commerce updated its rules for semiconductor exports and Trump said his administration would support the sales. Last month, Trump said Nvidia would be allowed to sell the H200 chips, less advanced than Nvidia's Blackwell and new Vera Rubin chips, to China with the U.S. government receiving a 25% cut of the revenue. The Commerce Department said it would shift from rejecting exports of the chips to a case-by-case review. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said that demand has been strong from Chinese customers, but the Chinese government has previously told companies in the country not to buy less advanced Nvidia chips over concerns of the U.S. government's involvement in the process. Nvidia shares were up about 1% recently.

Title: The Russell 2000 Is Crushing 2026: 4 Red-Hot High-Yield Dividend Stocks to Buy Now

Investing Small-cap stocks have been out of favor for years and might offer the best risk-reward after a huge three-year run for the major indices. With the Russell 2000 up almost 6% in 2026 in just two weeks, many across Wall Street see more gains for the index. With the prospect of an improving U.S. economy in 2026, that should provide a strong tailwind for small-cap and small-cap value stocks. Sending You to Google News in 3 © scyther5 / Getty Images In 2026, the seemingly forgotten Russell 2000 has emerged as the leading equity index, already up 5.6% compared with the S&P 500’s 1.2% gain. That’s because it is uniquely leveraged to a domestic-driven economic rebound, easing financial conditions, and renewed risk appetite for small-cap stocks. Valuation saturation and global exposure trap the large-cap benchmarks. Meanwhile, small-cap companies benefit disproportionately from falling interest rates, improved access to credit, and rising mergers-and-acquisitions activity. These all lower their cost of capital and unlock growth. The index is also more sensitive to U.S. fiscal policy, infrastructure spending, and reshoring trends, allowing earnings growth to accelerate faster than that of multinational mega-caps facing currency and geopolitical headwinds. After years of underperformance, relative valuations in the Russell 2000 entered 2026 at historically attractive levels, setting the stage for multiple expansion as investors rotate toward cyclical growth and away from overcrowded large-cap trades. We have to admit that the surge of the Russell 2000 in 2026 came as somewhat of a surprise to us here at 24/7 Wall St. Yet, the reality is that after three years of double-digit gains for the S&P 500, many of the top stocks, including most of the Magnificent 7, are starting to underperform the index. In fact, only two of the Magnificent 7 outperformed the S&P 500 in 2025: Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA). We screened our 24/7 Wall St. Russell 2000 research database for stocks with solid upside potential and dependable high-yield dividends. Four top small caps hit our screens, and they look like incredible buys for growth and income investors looking to establish small-cap positions with total return and huge passive income potential. Three of the four are Buy-rated at the top Wall Street firms we cover. The company specializes in providing financing solutions for the middle market and appears poised to reach new highs, garnering a Buy rating from 12 analysts and paying shareholders a 9.36% dividend.

The fund typically invests between $20 million and $200 million, with a maximum investment of $400 million, in companies with an EBITDA between $10 million and $250 million per year. It makes debt investments between $10 million and $100 million The fund invests through: The fund also selectively considers third-party-led senior and subordinated debt financings and opportunistically acquires stressed and discounted debt positions. Ares Capital prefers to be an agent and lead the transactions in which it invests. The fund also seeks board representation in its portfolio companies.

Takeaways from Matt Mentioned Links and Resources Timestamped Overview Katie Keith:Welcome to the relaunch episode of Do the Woo, the podcast where we’ll be talking all things WooCommerce. I’m Katie Keith, founder and CEO at Barn2. James Kemp:And I’m James Kemp, core product manager at WooCommerce. And as you can see, we were going to do a fancy reveal, but Matt is in the room already, so that our special guest today is Matt Mullenweg, and we’re going to be talking to him about his vision for the future of WooCommerce. Katie Keith:Yeah. So thank you, Matt, so much for coming on. I’m sure that everybody watching already knows who you are. So could you introduce yourself in the context of your work with WooCommerce, because people know you’re the CEO of the company that WooCommerce is now part of, but they don’t necessarily know the details of your involvement and the history of it. Matt Mullenweg:Sure. So, gosh, yes, as you said, I’m the CEO of Automattic, and WooCommerce is one of the products of Automatic. So I work really closely with Beau Lebens who leads. He’s the artistic director of the WooCommerce Maison. We have some funny titles inside of Automatic. The gosh, how it started was, you know, I always have thought about WordPress as an operating system. And so I want to study, like, previously successful operating systems. And so I read a lot of computer history books and of course, study the history of Microsoft. And I felt like WordPress was our Windows. You know, we had the platform, but we hadn’t yet found the killer app on top of it. The thing that both, you know, there’s a ton of demand for and also elevates the platform itself. So that was Microsoft Office for Windows. Right. Like, when Office came along, that sort of like, blew up Windows. And as I. So I just started like, really digging into the, you know, tens of thousands of plugins and themes that were out there and looking for trends and seeing what people were using and, like, listening to the community at work camps and things like that. And commerce as a category started to stand out. And within that category because there were a number of commerce solutions, WooCommerce really started to be like something, yeah, I’d known about. And Automatic I actually looked at before, but started to take pretty seriously. And I believe 2015, you know, we. We reached an agreement with the Woo founders to have them, you know, acquire them and have their team join. And there were 43 people at the time. The team was only a few Developers, though it was only like three developers and honestly some of the code wasn’t as performant or scalable or other things, but I was like, okay, well Automattic has some of the best engineers in the world, so we can definitely fix all the engineering stuff. Woo has nailed the community and the branding and the user experience and all this other stuff, which is actually kind of harder. And so let’s bring the best of what we’ve learned from building, like WordPress, WordPress.com, everything we’ve done at Automattic and start to apply it, apply that playbook to Woo. And that was 2015, so about a little over 10 years ago. And it’s been exciting. Right. I think, you know, we don’t talk about the Woo stat as much, but I think something like 8% of all websites in the world now run WooCommerce. Katie Keith:Wow. James Kemp:Yeah, I remember the 10 year anniversary, I guess it was last year now in 2025, and a surprising number of the people who came over with that acquisition was still thriving and working on WooCommerce and in other areas of Automattic as well, which was nice to see. Matt Mullenweg:Yeah. The team’s hundreds of people now, obviously, and the community has grown so, so, so much. It’s been very, very exciting to be a part of. And also it was humbling. Much in the same way I was humbled by Tumblr in Woo. I was like, oh, we’ve been doing CMS for a while. How hard could commerce be? But commerce has a multifactorial complexity, especially as you go international with payments and shipping and inventory and returns. And there’s so much because it really bridges for some stores, the physical and the digital world. James Kemp:Yeah, for sure. And there’s so many different combinations of apps and plugins and things that people are using different hosting software that there’s. I couldn’t imagine how many different variations of WooCommerce exist in the world. Matt Mullenweg:No two are alike. James Kemp:Exactly. Yeah. Well, yeah, thanks to everyone who has submitted questions beforehand on social media for Matt. We’re going to walk through a lot of them and see what, you know, Matt’s vision for the future of WooCommerce is. And also feel free to ask any additional questions as we’re talking that you would like us to put forward to Matt. Katie Keith:Yep. And before we get into the Q and A, do the Woo is essentially a new podcast. It’s part of the Open Channels network, which is now much wider than just Woo. So that’s why we’ve relaunched do the Woo as a dedicated WooCommerce podcast within open channels. So that means it has all of its own channels like the YouTube and Apple and Spotify and all of that. So wherever you watch these things, please subscribe there and wherever you’re watching now as well. James Kemp:Yeah, we received a ton of questions which we’re not going to be able to get to all of them today. But what we would like to do is put to map the most pressing questions that we felt, you know, his, his vision and input would be great to hear. And then Katie and I, and potentially someone else from WooCommerce will do a follow up episode in a few weeks to try and answer the remaining questions. Katie Keith:Yep. And we thought, let’s start with WooCommerce’s competitive advantage and the wider landscape that it sits in, because a lot of people are talking about that and the big competitors that are in the e commerce world both within and outside of WordPress. Now after that we’re going to talk about the use experience of WooCommerce, the community, its features and priorities and finally we’re going to ask Matt about his long term vision for it. So we’re going to try and slot the live questions into that structure. So first of all, we’ve got a question from Robin Peterson from Food Plugins, which is, what is WooCommerce’s biggest existential threat, internal or external? And what are you doing about it right now? Matt Mullenweg:Hmm, this is a good question. So with a product like at the scale of WooCommerce, they never actually killed by competitors. So I would say the biggest threat is internal. When products like that fail, it’s always because of execution. People think it’s competitors, but it’s not. So I would say the biggest risk is our ability to execute against what we’re hearing from the community and what we know that the software needs and the roadmap. Now the competitive landscape is interesting. Certainly it’s with a company like Shopify. And a product like Shopify forces us to really bring our best stuff because you know what, Shopify is really good. They’re quite impressive and they’re, you know, six, seven thousand people with a bajillion dollars. Now some people might look at that and say, oh wow, you know, WooCommerce has no chance. But actually this sort of David versus Goliath thing is exactly where WordPress was in like 2008, 2009. You know, if, if money was all you needed to create great software. Right. Like we’d all be using Windows on our phone. But you know, really like software built for love, not just money. And the community approach of something like WooCommerce can be very, very compelling. And then of course, in 2026, the first question you have to ask yourself when you’re choosing anything is, am I choosing software which increases my freedom or decreases my freedom? Which is fundamentally the question, am I choosing open source or not? So really, before you look at any features or anything else, I think you need to choose how you’d like your freedom scale to balance and what direction you want to go there. And open source, what differentiates WooCommerce from others in the market? Other great E commerce things out there, E commerce features on WIX or Squarespace or Shopify or whatever there is, is it increases your freedom. And especially in the age of AI, I think feature differentiations are going to start to fade a little bit, right? So Shopify has a feature that WooCommerce doesn’t have. Maybe before, you know, you’d have to wait for the Woo team to build it or someone to make a plugin or something like that. But now obviously that cost is going down. If you’re pretty good with cloud code, you could probably whip something up yourself. And by the way, there’s thousands of other developers out there using it. So like, I think we’re going to start to see sort of the feature differentiations between things start to fade a little bit. And so really what you’re choosing is a community, a platform and like I said that freedom stance. James Kemp:Awesome. Yeah, that’s a good answer. I think the AI angle is going to change a lot of things and it’s moving very quickly and I think those changes are just going to keep compiling over the coming years. So that’ll be cool to see. The next question we have is from Nick McLaughlin. Hopefully I said his surname right. He says, what are WooCommerce’s competitive advantages and how do they set Woo up for success in the next five years? And I think this touches on what you were just saying about open source. Matt Mullenweg:Just then, so I’m going to repeat it. Biggest competitive advantage is freedom. If you care about freedom, if you want more liberty, autonomy, if you want sovereign software, Woo is the best ecommerce platform in the world to provide that. And the second I would say is Woo’s open and infinitely extensible nature. So we’re in an interesting period right now where because you can kind of one shot generate software, you get kind of this. It’s an incredible rush. Like if you’ve done this with AI, and you tell it to make something or even like on telex, you tell it to make like a doom block or something like what just happened? I just created do from some words I typed in a box. And that is very, very exciting. However, I think while there’ll be like applications of that, I do feel like where we’ll see the plurality of usage and commerce and interaction is going to be with malleable software. And I apologize, this isn’t a term I came up with. I saw some designers say it, I’m forgetting their name. But this idea like malleable versus generated software. So where you take something that is already there, it’s been built by humans and has the craft and security and all the things that come from the decades of investments, tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands maybe at this point of person hours have been built into the engineering, the craft and the security and the platform of Woo. And then you create malleable software on top of that so you can customize it. This is of course what makes WordPress great and WooCommerce as well is that with the hooks and filters and actions and everything, you can modify pretty much everything for better and worse. Of course we know how this creates complexity and everything like that. But ultimately I feel like that freedom, that creativity which is enabled just allows for faster evolution. For Shopify to get better, Tobi has to have a good idea. I’m saying Tobi as a stand in for everyone at Shopify. Right? I can’t ship a new feature to Shopify. They have a platform as well. But it’s more limited right now for WooCommerce to get better. That could be the biggest idiot in the world. In fact I am. So the beauty is that not just the WooCommerce developers, but everyone in the community can make it better or just make it better for them. This needs to be better for everyone. And that sort of personalization I think is again the question was the advantages. So you know, again there’s reasons to own, to rent an apartment versus own a house. Sometimes it’s convenient and it’s nice to use something kind of off the rack and if you fit into it, you know, more power to you. Actually one of my great blessings in life is I am very much a men’s medium. So like I, I can walk into a store and pick up a suit. I had to the other day because I, I was going to a funeral so I didn’t have a black suit. So they would go in and get something off the rack and it, it Fit quite well. I have other friends who have different proportions. You know, if they don’t get something tailored, it looks ridiculous on them. So if you can get the off the rack, that’s pretty cool. And if you’re happy with that, great. So off the rack software can be fun, but at the moment that you need any personalization or you want it to be more better fit to you and tailored, that’s when I think open source really starts to shine and a platform like WooCommerce gets there. Now what do we need to get better at? And maybe this is an existential threat is education. I think one of the biggest opportunities for WordPress and WooCommerce is education. And that’s why I’m so excited about, like the WordPress education credits program. You know, what we’re. I’m calling 26 the year of the meetup, actually going to be doing a ton to enable meetups, to make meetups better, to get meetup organizers better, you know, material and support and everything like that. And of course, media ladder into Word camps, which as we know, are part of the magic of the whole WordPress community. But, but really what that fundamentally is, is like there’s this. I’m sorry, this is a long answer, but we’re probably hitting a few other questions as well that I read. When you think about it fundamentally, like how ideas spread or how innovation spreads, it’s usually like a see, do, teach, right? That’s kind of the three things that are exciting. You see something that’s exciting to you, it’s a store or someone making something or someone doing something, you’re like, oh, I could do that. This is how I got started blogging, right? There are all these blogs out there. I was like, oh, this is just a normal dude like me. Like, I could blog. I thought to have a website or to publish, you had to be like a journalist or like, you know, have certifications or an editor. And it turns out, no, I’m dating myself. But in like early 2000s, like, this was an innovative idea. Anyone could start a blog. And so having people see what they can do with WooCommerce is really, really important. That’s why things like the showcase and demos are great. Then you do it yourself, right? That’s the next level, which is very exciting. So you kind of learn from that, what you saw, and you do it yourself. And then the final, where you reach, like ultimate status is when you teach someone else to do it, right? When you pass it on. And when you think about it, like WordPress and WooCommerce even hasn’t grown because like our competitors, we spent billions of dollars on, you know, it’s grown because of that C2 teach, which is also kind of like word of mouth, you know, I’m sure many people listening here can imagine what their introduction to WordPress or WooCommerce was. And it might have been you just came across the website and figured it all out yourself. But for a lot of people, you probably had a friend or maybe an influencer online who said, hey, look at this, check this out. That was your entree into the community. Katie Keith:Yeah, well, you’ve talked about the open source side of things. So that leads us into a question that somebody else had, which is about the relationship between like WooCommerce and people choosing other WordPress plugins that also are obviously open source. So Rodolfo from Business Bloomer and Checkout Summit, I don’t know why I’ve written E Commerce there says, what can we learn from SureCart, FluentCart, EDD and the other E Commerce commerce plugins given? I suppose that they equally have that freedom of open source. Matt Mullenweg:Oh well, the beauty of that is, you know, what we can learn is they can also exchange code. They can use WooCommerce code and WooCommerce could use their code. So I think that, you know, being able to be inspired and share and, you know, between products is like part of what accelerates the cycle of innovation. So if there’s something specific, I don’t have anything specific to say about any of those particular products except that I’m really glad they exist. James Kemp:I wanted to touch on your point earlier about just the extensibility of WooCommerce and that being one of the main reasons that people would want to choose it is the kind of flexibility and the freedom you have to not only build on top of it, but contribute code to it. That’s something that we’re really focusing on at WooCommerce is making the platform, the underlying code of WooCommerce to be very. It should have all of the base features that you would expect and work in a consistent way that you can extend on top of. So if someone chooses one person’s bulk editor plugin, they could easily switch to another one and it would work in a similar way with the underlying logic being the same. So that kind of ability to choose to pick and choose which extensions you use on top of WooCommerce is something that we want to make very reliable for the people installing WordPress and using WordPress and WooCommerce. So, yeah, I just wanted to touch on that. But moving on to user experience, we have a question here from Ian, and I know he said online how to say his surname. And it’s not how I would say it. Katie Keith:It’s Meisner, not Meisner. James Kemp:Meisner lands on WooCommerce.com what is the ideal path for them to get started and what are the biggest obstacles? Matt Mullenweg:Oh, that’s a good question. Well, I guess kind of the first fork in the road there would be, you know, do it myself versus do it for me. So, you know, hopefully@woocommerce.com, they. They get excited about the possibilities of the platform and see examples of stores like them that are very successful or increase their business or increase their conversions by, you know, utilizing some of the things on there. And so either they go the direction of, like, going to one of the partner web hosts, which are not just automatic ones, by the way. We point to others and get signed up with WooCommerce configured and everything like that, and you can start to go through the Configuring WooCommerce process. I’ll be the first to admit that that’s a bit heavier than the WordPress process, and so someone will have to have some motivation. Now, I’ll also say that AI is raising people’s ability to make it through these things, right? Because they just put a ChatGPT window next to it and say, I’m stuck. What do I do? Or, gosh, even now we’re having the browsers that have these AI agents built in, which I talked about at WordCamp US and State of the Word. You can actually have the AI just kind of watch it, do stuff for you. You can say, build me this and it’ll start to, like, navigate WooCommerce and do and do it and you can see it do it, which is also kind of like, again, making that do it yourself path way more accessible. So pre AI, I would have said probably 95% of the time they go to a developer or consultants and, you know, we link to some great things there. We have agency partners. There’s great platforms like Codable and of course, the big ones like Upwork and everything. Like, it’s one of the great things about the WordPress and WooCommerce community is there’s so many people who are fluent in it. And so you can really find someone who’s a great match for you, whether that’s in your language or in your country or whatever it is that’s important to you or they have a portfolio that matches what you want to build. There’s a great ecosystem, that two sided marketplace. So that would be one possible path. That percentage is probably going to come down in terms of total numbers, but I think the total demand for third party developers is going to go up, right? So maybe let’s say AI makes it so only, you know, let’s just say half, so half of people can do it themselves versus hiring a developer. So you think, okay, if there were obviously a finite number of WU stores being created, that would mean less work for third party developers. But actually what’s going to happen is there’ll be more demand for stores being created in general. And so there might be some dips and valleys in there, but ultimately like if I go out 10 years, there’s going to be way more like Woo jobs than there are today. Katie Keith:Yeah, I totally agree that it’s a big benefit of Woo how many people are fluent in it. For example, we use easy digital Downloads on the Barn 2 site and it can be very difficult when we need to find an expert or hire somebody that’s already experienced in that. With Woo, it’s really, really easy. There are so many people that have all different skill levels, all different price ranges, so you can find an expert that easily. Which brings us onto the community section where we have another question from Ian, who asks, what does healthy collaboration look like between the platform and the community? Matt Mullenweg:Oh, I think it looks like what Woo has done for the past 10 years and before even the acquisition. You know, I always say, I usually say this for WordPress, but I think it applies to Woo equally well. Its success has been predicated on how closely has that collaboration with the community, what that looks like. And gosh, there’s so many examples of things like I talk about Wapu. I would have never approved Wapu and how amazing is like Wapu for the WordPress community? Like that. That is something that comes up from the community. The cool thing about Open source is that community happens whether you want it to or not, right people? Because people just publish plugins or fork the software, whatever happened, like, so you kind of get. One thing I love about Open source is that it kind of forces you, if you’re the steward of the software, it keeps you honest, you know, because it’s very natural market forces that, you know, if unless you’re like the most stubborn person in the world or blind, you’ll just like wake up one day and be like, okay, everyone’s using this plugin. We should Just build it in decor, whatever it is that that’s happening. Or every time I go to work camp, 10 people tell me this. So you know those sorts of things. So what that looks like in the future is, you know, if I had to say something I’d like to see more of this year in terms of collaboration is I’d love to see more talks at WordCamps around WooCommerce. I’d love to see more either dedicated WooCommerce meetups, which, you know, WooCommerce does have its own meetup.com thing, or like topics like how do we teach more broader WordPress developers how they can learn woo. And how that actually probably increases their economic value in the marketplace. Right. One nice thing about working in the e commerce world, like we said, there’s a store that’s making 5 million bucks a year. They’re making, let’s say they’re making 5 million bucks a year from their website. Like they’re going to want, you know, feel comfortable investing in that. So if you think of what their threshold is versus like you know, someone else building a website, a coffee shop. You build a website for the coffee shop. They’re making most of the money from people coming to the door. The website’s nice to have but you know, of their revenue, how much will they spend? It’s called half a percent, 1% on the website or like an e commerce store, both the revenue might be higher but also like the percent they’re willing to reinvest into their infrastructure and their website and development and customization and everything is probably much higher. Hosting, you know, they’ll want to pay for more performant hosting and invest in those things. So you know, we track 30 something billion of GMV happening through WooCommerce and actual numbers higher than that because we don’t, we’re not able to track everything. So when you imagine like the economic opportunity for doing things in the WordPress ecosystem, it’s pretty huge, I would say bigger than WordPress actually. James Kemp:Yeah, for sure. I think it touches on a point why I’ve always said, you know, I started as a WooCommerce plugin developer and I chose that route because the types of clients we were getting were the ones that had money to spend on this stuff because their store relied on, you know, transactions going through it. And that’s how I kind of fell into the, the E commerce side of things. So it’s definitely true that it’s a, it’s a profitable area of WordPress and of any like online business. I would say I’ll touch quickly on the healthy collaboration as well, because there’s. There’s a couple of projects where we have collaborate, collaborated. Last year, one being the accessibility project that we had for WooCommerce. We collaborated with Equalize Digital, and that was just a case of, you know, myself and Amber getting in touch and talking about what that might look like. And that’s, you know, came to fruition. WooCommerce is now fully accessible, which is awesome on the front end. And another example is we worked with Becker at Kestrel on scoping out what shipping fulfillments might look like in WooCommerce. And that is also a feature that Becker heavily helped to scope out. What they’ve been hearing from customers and clients around what people want. And that work is now also in WooCommerce Core behind a feature flag, but it’s there to be used and tested. So I’d love to see more stuff like that, just more collaboration of what people are seeing in the ecosystem and just putting that out there to someone like me or any other product person at WooCommerce so we can talk about it. GitHub is a great place to do that. The next question you actually touched on already was from Rodolfo, and he said, is there going to be any more WooCommerce or is there going to be more WooCommerce coverage at flagship WordCamps? It sounds like you think there should be. Matt Mullenweg:Oh, should is relative. So if people want it, there will be. So I’d say, like, you know, be the change you want to see in the world. If you want more WooCommerce at WordCamps, if you are listening to this podcast, you probably could be a speaker. So make the pitch. And if you’re helping to organize a word Camp, you know, understand your audience, obviously, like, look at who’s coming. And I do think that with, you know, almost a quarter of all WordPress websites using WooCommerce, like, you know, maybe something like a quarter of sessions at WordCamp should be about WooCommerce, WooCommerce more broadly. Like you said, there’s other solutions as well. I think that’s great. As long as things are open source, they’re welcome at WordCamps. Katie Keith:Yeah, well, that’s what I would have thought. The last few flagship WordCamps that I’ve been to, I have submitted a talk about e Commerce or WooCommerce. I’ve tried both. And a talk about myself, like, my story. And my story is always the one that’s been accepted like WordCamp I think Asia last year, but there’s been three or four and nobody accepts my e commerce talks, which I think are really interesting. So I’m a bit concerned about why that is because all the data you said is totally correct about how many sites use WooCommerce and E commerce. Generally that’s where the money is. And yet I am finding it really hard to spread the word about WooCommerce and e commerce at WordCamps and I don’t know why that is. Matt Mullenweg:Well, Katie, your story is really good. Katie Keith:But everyone’s heard it. I think e commerce is more interesting these days. Matt Mullenweg:Okay, well then don’t submit it and just submit the e commerce or submit it and do a little bait and switch when it’s like my story actually turned it into an e commerce talk. Katie Keith:Yeah, but yeah, I agree. That’s definitely needed. Whoever does the talks, there should be much more representation at WordCamps. Matt Mullenweg:Well, and I’ll keep that in mind. You know the WordCamp I’m most active in choosing the content for is WordCamp US. So as that comes around and I look at things, I’ll keep that in mind. Katie Keith:So the next group of questions are about the features and upcoming priorities of WooCommerce. So the first one there was from Ian. Again, WooCommerce has intentionally served merchants, product builders and agencies. Are their goals and targets aligned to those segments and how are they prioritized? Matt Mullenweg:Merchants, product builders and agencies? Yes, there are goals tied to each one of those. How are they prioritized off the dome? Not certain right now. James might be able to answer this better, but those are, I would say, some of the big Personas that as we build things in Woo, you try to. Well, often, sometimes when we build things, it addresses all of Them, but as we make it more usable or something like that, that benefits everyone. But yeah, there’s definitely been some, I would say some more specific outreach around like growing the agency program or other things like that. I also saw a feedback that there’s work camps might not want pitches for a specific product. I think I agree. And I would say that once a product also becomes a platform itself like WordPress and if you go to WordPress plugins directory, there’s hundreds or thousands of WooCommerce plugins, it’s okay, you know. You know, once it becomes not just about itself, but actually something that a lot of people could build on, that’s okay for a working app. James Kemp:Interesting. Yeah, yeah, that’s a fair point. You don’t want to promote a specific product, I guess. But Yeah, I mean WooCommerce is, is huge at this point, so it deserves. Matt Mullenweg:To be talked about and people want solutions, so. James Kemp:Yes, yes, exactly. Yeah. Matt Mullenweg:Yeah. James Kemp:I’ve always found that on Reddit actually they block a lot of comments when you provide a solution to the question because it looks like promotion, but actually it solves the issue that they were having but sidetracked. Katie Keith:Often a product does. Yeah. So we’ve got a couple of follow up comments of people watching live about the word count discussion. So let’s do that before we move on to more pre submitted questions. So Dave has said suggested next flagship a separate room for E Commerce. I would love to see that. That would make a lot of sense actually. James Kemp:That would be cool to see. Matt Mullenweg:Yeah. You know what, I’ll tease something as well, which is this could be an interesting year to have a dedicated woo event again. Katie Keith:Yeah, well, we got a couple of independent events popping up, which is interesting. So we’ve just had, well, it was kind of, I think WordCamp affiliated e commerce day for WordPress in Porto, which James and I both spoke at. And then we’ve got Checkout Summit in Sicily in April. So it’s interesting to see that community interest is growing in the E Commerce side of things. And Checkout Summit is specifically WooCommerce rather than E Commerce as well. So I am liking that direction. Matt Mullenweg:There hasn’t been a WooConf in a few years and I think this would be a cool year to see another one. Katie Keith:Yeah. And we got a comment from Brent. Matt Mullenweg:This is what I addressed earlier. This is the one I was responding to. If it’s a platform and there’s like hundreds of plugins in the directory on top of it, I think that sort of. It’s a Spectrum, but that’s where it makes it a little bit more okay, I would say, to talk about or a lot more okay to talk about a specific, you know, plugin or solution or things. James Kemp:Awesome. Was that all the questions that you had, Katie? Yeah, I think it’s worth touching on the prioritization point because I think I can speak to that a bit more. One of the focuses this year will be that every release should have something beneficial for each one of those target groups of people. And to more clearly put that out there in writing, this, this feature or this enhancement is specifically targeted at this group of people or group of users. So I think we’ll definitely see a lot more of that this year, which, which will be great to see. We have a question from Ian. Of course, our list of questions are all from Ian. If developer resources were not a constraint, what would you do? So what would unlock the biggest leap forward? So if you had unlimited developer resources, where would you put them? Matt Mullenweg:That is a really good question. And Ian, I’ll say that it’s very prescient with this idea of intelligence being on tap with AI agents we’re seeing. If you’re listening to this and you haven’t been clawed code pilled yet, take some time. Nothing else from this podcast. Take some time, go through some tutorials, install claw code. By the way, it’s not just for code. You can use it for any other files on your computer. You can use it with your notes, you can use it with so much. I saw some crazy stuff with it being hooked up to Playground and Beeper today. Like you can do some really, really neat things. And that kind of is an under unlimited developer resource in some ways that we haven’t seen. And it is the 1.0 version and the capabilities that are coming out this year as the new Nvidia chips come online, all the new data centers you heard about get built. You know, especially some of the Elon Musk stuff, which is moving very quickly, but also the investments from Google, Meta, everyone, like anthropic, like we’re going to see some. If you thought last year was exciting from an AI point of view, I think this will actually be the year that is a little more jaw dropping. So January 14th, Mark, mark my words. James Kemp:There to touch on the Claude code they just released in the Claude desktop app, something called Claude Coworkers, which is Claude code under the hood. You set it up, you choose a folder to run it in, and it runs in exactly the same way as Claude code. But it’s a lot Less technical. It’s not a CLI based interface which is very useful for non code based work where Claude code seemingly excels, which I don’t think was the expectation when they released it. So yeah, definitely worth checking out. Matt Mullenweg:It’s just going to get better. So yeah, this also, you know, back to the brilliance of Ian’s question is it’s almost like the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy thing. Like the answer, when you can have any answer, like what you ask and what you build is really important. And so, you know, I would pick, I mean honestly I would pick what WooCommerce’s roadmap is because that was kind of the, you know, it’s not that we have unlimited developer resources, but we do have, you know, pretty active process. Of the hundreds of people who work on WooCommerce and the investments that are happening into the scalability, you know, the sort of idea of the interface being more radically accessible and kind of unifying some of the things that are right now like sort of some classical WordPress interfaces, but could be like maybe like reduce people’s clicks, reduce kind of the friction they have when they’re running the store day to day. Earlier there was a mention of merchants. I would say very much the merchant experience is on my mind. And sort of like if you’re running a store every day, what do you do 10 times or 100 times? And how can we make that a little bit smoother? And again, every click you can remove, every sort of way you can sand the edges of that experience multiplies because people are doing it hundreds of times a day themselves and of course millions of times a day across the WooCommerce. WooCommerce system checkouts already getting a lot better. But of course anything in the checkout is a multiplier for the, for our ecosystem. It’s already there. There’s probably some things in stripe link or shop checkout that we don’t match yet. And for some stores or some geographies and so that could be improved for main ones like us stuff, I think it’s prepared now in terms of conversions, performance, you can always be faster, always be faster. There’s no one who says I would love this website to load slower. Yeah. Katie Keith:Well that brings us quite nicely to the next question, which is what are the top milestones WooCommerce will deliver in 2026? Which is from Robin James. Matt Mullenweg:I feel like we should point to a WooCommerce blog post or something here. Is there an official resource I don’t want to. James Kemp:Yeah, I mean, BO actually published, I believe it was late last year and I’m sure Brent in the comments will be able to drop a link in. But his vision for 2026 for WooCommerce, which is something that we’re really sticking to. And I think one of the. So the quality is high on the list, performance is high on the list, builder experience is high on the list, as well as merchant experience, which is always high on the list. And also I think, you know, evolving with the AI ecosystem as it moves and just adapting to that. Integrating things like the Stripe Agentic Commerce protocol and the new Google UCP protocol that they announced and just really working and refining those experiences are always top of mind. Hopefully Brent can drop in a link to the relevant blog post from Beau, but yeah, that should be sufficient, I would have thought. Katie Keith:Yeah, you mentioned the builder experience. We’ve got a live comment from Jerry who says, is there any roadmap for the block editor on the single product? James Kemp:There has been a lot of. So I guess the block. There’s two ways you could understand this question. One is kind of using the new interface, what we call data forms, as the interface for the product editor, which is one experience and that replaces the whole experience of the product editor. And the other one is the. The block editor existing as a way to update the product description, which the way I read that question is more in line with that. Katie Keith:Yeah, I think so. Like creating multi column layouts with blocks and things like that for the product page instead of just the template based layout we’re used to. James Kemp:Yeah, and I would say there’s no official roadmap, but it’s something that for me is high priority to. To dig into. Like that experience of using the editor to customize your product pages is just awesome. It’s much more flexible and impressive than a standard text editor. Matt, I don’t know if you had any thoughts on that. Matt Mullenweg:No, it sounds good. I apologize. I am not the biggest WooCommerce expert in the world, which is funny. Thank you for having me start your show. I think about it a lot more from the sort of like broader ecosystem and the strategy and those things I can speak to probably a little more, or the future of development and computing and those sorts of things. But for a specific question like that, I think James is a much better person to answer. Or Bo if he was here. Katie Keith:Yeah, agreed. There was quite a lot of questions that were really specific that when we went through them we thought actually we’ve got James, the core Product manager as a host we don’t need. Whereas for this interview we wanted to go high level and talk about the wider vision and the future bigger picture stuff. So that’s what we were expecting. Matt Mullenweg:And sorry about that for the audience but you know, either James or like other guests I think could do some more of those like super deep dives. So think of this as like the appetizer for do the Woo episodes to go much, much deeper. James Kemp:Yeah, I think it’s just really great to hear what you envision E Commerce or WooCommerce could be. So I think we’ve touched on that quite a lot, which is interesting. Matt Mullenweg:I did see a few questions coming about UCP, so I’ll speak to that and someone’s like, why weren’t you part of the announcement or whatever that is. Katie Keith:Yeah. Any update on UCP which just Google recently launched. How will WooCommerce move forwards with this? Matt Mullenweg:So I mean without speaking specifically to UCP, I will say that it is funny given how much bigger and more money they have, that Shopify is kind of scared of WooCommerce. So often they will negotiate to be sort of an exclusive day of launch announcement. And if you notice with like the Stripe stuff, I mean we were there on day one but it didn’t get announced a few days later or if they just negotiated for us to find out about when everyone else does, it’ll come really quickly, so don’t worry about that. It’ll all be supported. The second thing I’ll say though is that and there was an article in the information about this a few days ago is that these things are not being used at all. It’s very telling that almost a year after some of this stuff was first announced, there have been almost no, no one talking about how many transactions have gone through this. And it was like a headline feature like the Stripe conference and the Shopify thing and all this sort of stuff, the CEOs are there and it’s moving the stock prices and like, so it’s, it’s very interesting. This happens in software kind of frequently is occasionally there’s something that everyone’s like, oh, that is the best idea ever in the world. And it gets a ton of hype and a ton of everything and then once it kind of lands in the world, users are like, nope, doesn’t fit or there’s something missing. Now I’m not saying that agenda commerce 10 years from now won’t be like a double digit percentage of commerce or something like, you know, we’ll probably figure this out. But it might also be, you know, the Google Glass or one of these things that where you can put a bajillion dollars into and it seems like the coolest idea. But like when it meets the reality of real world, there’s something about it that just kind of like doesn’t make it gel. Katie Keith:Yeah, I agree there’s some barriers that are going to put people off things like buying in AI. Well, how about buying multiple things in order to get free shipping? Just having one product recommended isn’t that relevant. James and I discussed this in the Q and A at E Commerce Day that there’s a few things that need to really change about the nature of people shopping before it gets that widespread adoption. Matt Mullenweg:And in the Information article I found it very fascinating because with Woo, you know, some of this stuff is a little tricky to support because we don’t host every Woo store in the world. So providing like a universal catalog for every Woo product in the world is like kind of tricky. I mean there’s ways to do it certainly if they sync with Jetpack or if we build some sort of crawler or opt in thing, like we can centralize some stuff. But it turns out even Shopify, who I would assume this was much easier for, has huge data issues. And it’s because people run their stores in different ways. They might say something is in stock when it’s really not, or there might be different shipping variations or there might be, you know, there’s just different ways that people show product variations when they might not exist. Or you know, there’s all sorts of stuff out there that apparently even for Shopify, which host and has all the data, you know, it’s all on their servers, sort of normalizing it in a way that’s accessible to the users in a way that’s also useful and accurate and true. Inside the chat interface has been a bigger challenge than certainly I would have imagined. So that’s been something surprising to me as well. The information is like a paid site, but maybe someone can, like actually someone should. I’m surprised a WordPress news site hasn’t covered this yet. So maybe request for a blog post for someone to summarize some of the stuff from that information article. James Kemp:I think another point to consider is just how quickly AI is evolving. To kind of set a standard protocol now is challenging, but a worthy exploration for sure. But yeah, our teams are digging into both ACP and UCP and I’m sure if you keep an eye on the developer blog that we will have some information about that very soon. Matt Mullenweg:If I had to make a bet, well, I guess I will. A prediction. It’s the amount of commerce that’ll happen from people just in a chat interface versus the amount of commerce that will happen from AI agents driving browsers. And so using the normal website, the normal human interface. But some of that might be more like the autofill might be better with AI or finding the product or navigating the site like those sorts of things. Maybe even discovery of the product might be driven by the AI. That second part will be way, way, way bigger. James Kemp:Yeah, discovery is an interesting one because I always use AI now to recommend products to me, but it’s still not great. So I use Claude most of the time and it’s still not great at actually providing a link to the product on any specific store. So it will say like you want this product and it would just be the name of the product and then I then have to go and search for it. Matt Mullenweg:I would say Anthropic is the worst at that actually. Yes. AI Perplexity and Gemini Google have gotten really, really good at linking the sites. James Kemp:Yeah. And I think we’ll see that evolve over time. But yeah, part of that experience is like reading the reviews yourself and like Katie was saying, you know, comparing free shipping costs and getting discount codes and all that kind of stuff. So yeah, it’s definitely a challenge, but something I’m looking forward to seeing how that shapes up this year. And I think it’s going to shape up pretty quickly at the rate things are going. We have a question which I’m not sure if you’ll be able to answer from Tommy on X. He says are there any plans to bring back WOO Express? It was an easy way to onboard less technical clients that don’t know what hosting, et cetera are, but still want the flexibility of WOO and the scalability. Matt Mullenweg:Of WordPress.com oh, what I will say is that, you know, just like every other WordPress host in the world on WordPress.com we’re making a ton of investment into sort of making things easier and not that onboarding. One thing people don’t realize is now every paid plan on WordPress.com supports full plugins and themes. So even the four buck a month one, you get the full WordPress.com scalability, the platform of WP Cloud on every single paid plan. So there’s not the two tiers of paid plans anymore. Which kind of puts us in a similar category to every other web host in the world. Right. You pay for it you get full WordPress now that capability and our, you know, sort of the, the very, very deep technical investments we’ve made that done to make that scalable performance secure. Everything like WordPress.com sites basically never get hacked. You know, you don’t have to worry about security in the same way that you might on a host that does not invest as much in the security. Those sorts of things are available and were very much thinking about tailored experiences by the way, not just for WooCommerce but also other plugins. So other plugins that all the other E commerce plugins in the WordPress community, anything on WordPress.com I want it to be kind of one click easy and in fact just, you know how there’s blueprints for playgrounds where you can kind of like pre configure something. I think we’re going to start to see that become more common in preconfiguring a hosting setup as well. Yeah. Katie Keith:So you’re kind of saying it’s not really needed because things have moved on more generally with WordPress.com and the different options and so on. Matt Mullenweg:Well, and no, I think it’s something like it still might be needed. Katie Keith:I mean so it will express whether that’s needed. Matt Mullenweg:Oh yeah. Well, so to get the scalability and everything, you don’t need it anymore. Scalability, security upgrades, everything. The onboarding experience I think could definitely still be very much improved. So that’s something I still do think is needed. James Kemp:So yeah, and it was touched on in Porto. Having WooCommerce installed in WordPress is very much like you have a plugin installed. WordPress is the main site and you have this kind of E commerce section. And I think what something like Woo Express offered was a flip of that where you’ve got this, this E Commerce admin experience versus a WordPress with e commerce. So I do feel like that side of things is needed and I think that’ll be interesting to see. Matt Mullenweg:And when you put it like that, I almost feel like it should just be a setting in the plugin. James Kemp:Right, yeah, that’s been discussed. Matt Mullenweg:Woo is a minor thing for some things, some sites it’s the whole thing and in which case I know there’s. It is tricky because a lot of plugins fight for real estate in the sort of navigation, the sort of standard chrome of WordPress but I think with user control again, you know, it might be aggressive to do this by default or something. Yeah. In the plugin. But like you know, having it be like so people know what they’re doing. They can switch it on and off and like, you know, for a plugin with the sort of surface area of Woo, certainly putting things at top level navigation, I think is okay. You have a few things there. And two, you can imagine something where it does become a bit more primary. Now that said, I say, like, don’t, don’t completely hide the word presto. People still are going to have pages and blogs and everything like that and it’s nice to have the dashboard where they see the news and get involved with the community and all that sort of stuff. Yeah, cool. I think we’re coming up on time. So how would you like to wrap it up? Katie Keith:Let’s wrap it up with one more question about the future, which feels like a good ending. So let’s go to Robin’s question, which is long term, what does WooCommerce look like in three plus years? James Kemp:Oh. Matt Mullenweg:So things I’m certain of, it’ll be faster. Making a ton of investments in performance. Updates will be seamless. I deal with a lot of things in the world, so despite people’s perceptions of me, it actually takes a lot to get me truly riled up. But the one thing that will do that without fail is when an update breaks a site. To me, that is the worst thing you could ever do with software. It makes me furious. Totally unacceptable. And it needs to happen zero times. And it’s possible. It’s hard, but it’s possible. And I think not just Woo, but every WordPress plugin developer has a responsibility to really put in the work, to make updates as seamless as possible. Otherwise once you lose that trust in updates, it’s gone. So I’ll say that updates will be frequent and seamless and the interface will be much, much more, much, much more modern in the sense that it’ll feel a lot more like a sort of modern app. And by the way, WordPress is going to evolve alongside that. So we’re doing some fun stuff to sort of spruce up the WordPress admin a bit as well. And so Woo will both benefit from that and I think build on top of it as well. James Kemp:Awesome. The update point is very relevant. Do you feel like that’s something that needs to happen at the plugin level or at the WordPress hosting level as well? Matt Mullenweg:That’s a good question. I think there’s work at every level, sort of like a defense in depth. This is idea in security. Like you don’t just want one layer of security, you want multiple things because one of them’s probably going to fail inevitably. So then you have all these other layers in place that still makes sure the bad thing doesn’t happen, the fatal thing doesn’t happen. So I do really appreciate at the hosting level, you know, the investments people make into auto rollbacks or some even do it like with visual testing on the front end and stuff like that. And of course providing an ability for users to do that on demand. Is that sort of undo button beautiful? That’s very important as a last resort. I think the other important thing, and this is also getting easier with AI, is testing and sort of like having a great beta program, getting things out there in the world, doing automated testing on various, you know, since you can get to know, I’m sure you or feedback from your users and what the most common things they use WooCommerce with or your plugin with is like. How are you testing that? If you’re a developer, are you testing the beta versions of both WordPress and WooCommerce? So finding any changes that might either you need to update for or that maybe, you know, the core platform needs to be informed that they mess something up because they missed some edge case or some API you were using. So that it is. It’s going to take a village. But we’ve done it with WordPress, you know, now for, you know, knocking on wood. But, but for many the we’ve had many, many, many years of a very smooth update process and you know, for also hundreds of millions or billions of times now for plugins and themes as well. But of course Core has become, I think rightly so, very trusted for upgrades. Katie Keith:Yeah. Well, thank you so much for coming on and also thanks to everybody who submitted questions. Matt Mullenweg:I really appreciate it and congrats on this new format, new show, everything. I will definitely be a listener and watcher and can’t wait to see what you all do. James Kemp:Amazing.

Takeaways from Matt Mentioned Links and Resources Timestamped Overview Katie Keith:Welcome to the relaunch episode of Do the Woo, the podcast where we’ll be talking all things WooCommerce. I’m Katie Keith, founder and CEO at Barn2. James Kemp:And I’m James Kemp, core product manager at WooCommerce. And as you can see, we were going to do a fancy reveal, but Matt is in the room already, so that our special guest today is Matt Mullenweg, and we’re going to be talking to him about his vision for the future of WooCommerce. Katie Keith:Yeah. So thank you, Matt, so much for coming on. I’m sure that everybody watching already knows who you are. So could you introduce yourself in the context of your work with WooCommerce, because people know you’re the CEO of the company that WooCommerce is now part of, but they don’t necessarily know the details of your involvement and the history of it. Matt Mullenweg:Sure. So, gosh, yes, as you said, I’m the CEO of Automattic, and WooCommerce is one of the products of Automatic. So I work really closely with Beau Lebens who leads. He’s the artistic director of the WooCommerce Maison. We have some funny titles inside of Automatic. The gosh, how it started was, you know, I always have thought about WordPress as an operating system. And so I want to study, like, previously successful operating systems. And so I read a lot of computer history books and of course, study the history of Microsoft. And I felt like WordPress was our Windows. You know, we had the platform, but we hadn’t yet found the killer app on top of it. The thing that both, you know, there’s a ton of demand for and also elevates the platform itself. So that was Microsoft Office for Windows. Right. Like, when Office came along, that sort of like, blew up Windows. And as I. So I just started like, really digging into the, you know, tens of thousands of plugins and themes that were out there and looking for trends and seeing what people were using and, like, listening to the community at work camps and things like that. And commerce as a category started to stand out. And within that category because there were a number of commerce solutions, WooCommerce really started to be like something, yeah, I’d known about. And Automatic I actually looked at before, but started to take pretty seriously. And I believe 2015, you know, we. We reached an agreement with the Woo founders to have them, you know, acquire them and have their team join. And there were 43 people at the time. The team was only a few Developers, though it was only like three developers and honestly some of the code wasn’t as performant or scalable or other things, but I was like, okay, well Automattic has some of the best engineers in the world, so we can definitely fix all the engineering stuff. Woo has nailed the community and the branding and the user experience and all this other stuff, which is actually kind of harder. And so let’s bring the best of what we’ve learned from building, like WordPress, WordPress.com, everything we’ve done at Automattic and start to apply it, apply that playbook to Woo. And that was 2015, so about a little over 10 years ago. And it’s been exciting. Right. I think, you know, we don’t talk about the Woo stat as much, but I think something like 8% of all websites in the world now run WooCommerce. Katie Keith:Wow. James Kemp:Yeah, I remember the 10 year anniversary, I guess it was last year now in 2025, and a surprising number of the people who came over with that acquisition was still thriving and working on WooCommerce and in other areas of Automattic as well, which was nice to see. Matt Mullenweg:Yeah. The team’s hundreds of people now, obviously, and the community has grown so, so, so much. It’s been very, very exciting to be a part of. And also it was humbling. Much in the same way I was humbled by Tumblr in Woo. I was like, oh, we’ve been doing CMS for a while. How hard could commerce be? But commerce has a multifactorial complexity, especially as you go international with payments and shipping and inventory and returns. And there’s so much because it really bridges for some stores, the physical and the digital world. James Kemp:Yeah, for sure. And there’s so many different combinations of apps and plugins and things that people are using different hosting software that there’s. I couldn’t imagine how many different variations of WooCommerce exist in the world. Matt Mullenweg:No two are alike. James Kemp:Exactly. Yeah. Well, yeah, thanks to everyone who has submitted questions beforehand on social media for Matt. We’re going to walk through a lot of them and see what, you know, Matt’s vision for the future of WooCommerce is. And also feel free to ask any additional questions as we’re talking that you would like us to put forward to Matt. Katie Keith:Yep. And before we get into the Q and A, do the Woo is essentially a new podcast. It’s part of the Open Channels network, which is now much wider than just Woo. So that’s why we’ve relaunched do the Woo as a dedicated WooCommerce podcast within open channels. So that means it has all of its own channels like the YouTube and Apple and Spotify and all of that. So wherever you watch these things, please subscribe there and wherever you’re watching now as well. James Kemp:Yeah, we received a ton of questions which we’re not going to be able to get to all of them today. But what we would like to do is put to map the most pressing questions that we felt, you know, his, his vision and input would be great to hear. And then Katie and I, and potentially someone else from WooCommerce will do a follow up episode in a few weeks to try and answer the remaining questions. Katie Keith:Yep. And we thought, let’s start with WooCommerce’s competitive advantage and the wider landscape that it sits in, because a lot of people are talking about that and the big competitors that are in the e commerce world both within and outside of WordPress. Now after that we’re going to talk about the use experience of WooCommerce, the community, its features and priorities and finally we’re going to ask Matt about his long term vision for it. So we’re going to try and slot the live questions into that structure. So first of all, we’ve got a question from Robin Peterson from Food Plugins, which is, what is WooCommerce’s biggest existential threat, internal or external? And what are you doing about it right now? Matt Mullenweg:Hmm, this is a good question. So with a product like at the scale of WooCommerce, they never actually killed by competitors. So I would say the biggest threat is internal. When products like that fail, it’s always because of execution. People think it’s competitors, but it’s not. So I would say the biggest risk is our ability to execute against what we’re hearing from the community and what we know that the software needs and the roadmap. Now the competitive landscape is interesting. Certainly it’s with a company like Shopify. And a product like Shopify forces us to really bring our best stuff because you know what, Shopify is really good. They’re quite impressive and they’re, you know, six, seven thousand people with a bajillion dollars. Now some people might look at that and say, oh wow, you know, WooCommerce has no chance. But actually this sort of David versus Goliath thing is exactly where WordPress was in like 2008, 2009. You know, if, if money was all you needed to create great software. Right. Like we’d all be using Windows on our phone. But you know, really like software built for love, not just money. And the community approach of something like WooCommerce can be very, very compelling. And then of course, in 2026, the first question you have to ask yourself when you’re choosing anything is, am I choosing software which increases my freedom or decreases my freedom? Which is fundamentally the question, am I choosing open source or not? So really, before you look at any features or anything else, I think you need to choose how you’d like your freedom scale to balance and what direction you want to go there. And open source, what differentiates WooCommerce from others in the market? Other great E commerce things out there, E commerce features on WIX or Squarespace or Shopify or whatever there is, is it increases your freedom. And especially in the age of AI, I think feature differentiations are going to start to fade a little bit, right? So Shopify has a feature that WooCommerce doesn’t have. Maybe before, you know, you’d have to wait for the Woo team to build it or someone to make a plugin or something like that. But now obviously that cost is going down. If you’re pretty good with cloud code, you could probably whip something up yourself. And by the way, there’s thousands of other developers out there using it. So like, I think we’re going to start to see sort of the feature differentiations between things start to fade a little bit. And so really what you’re choosing is a community, a platform and like I said that freedom stance. James Kemp:Awesome. Yeah, that’s a good answer. I think the AI angle is going to change a lot of things and it’s moving very quickly and I think those changes are just going to keep compiling over the coming years. So that’ll be cool to see. The next question we have is from Nick McLaughlin. Hopefully I said his surname right. He says, what are WooCommerce’s competitive advantages and how do they set Woo up for success in the next five years? And I think this touches on what you were just saying about open source. Matt Mullenweg:Just then, so I’m going to repeat it. Biggest competitive advantage is freedom. If you care about freedom, if you want more liberty, autonomy, if you want sovereign software, Woo is the best ecommerce platform in the world to provide that. And the second I would say is Woo’s open and infinitely extensible nature. So we’re in an interesting period right now where because you can kind of one shot generate software, you get kind of this. It’s an incredible rush. Like if you’ve done this with AI, and you tell it to make something or even like on telex, you tell it to make like a doom block or something like what just happened? I just created do from some words I typed in a box. And that is very, very exciting. However, I think while there’ll be like applications of that, I do feel like where we’ll see the plurality of usage and commerce and interaction is going to be with malleable software. And I apologize, this isn’t a term I came up with. I saw some designers say it, I’m forgetting their name. But this idea like malleable versus generated software. So where you take something that is already there, it’s been built by humans and has the craft and security and all the things that come from the decades of investments, tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands maybe at this point of person hours have been built into the engineering, the craft and the security and the platform of Woo. And then you create malleable software on top of that so you can customize it. This is of course what makes WordPress great and WooCommerce as well is that with the hooks and filters and actions and everything, you can modify pretty much everything for better and worse. Of course we know how this creates complexity and everything like that. But ultimately I feel like that freedom, that creativity which is enabled just allows for faster evolution. For Shopify to get better, Tobi has to have a good idea. I’m saying Tobi as a stand in for everyone at Shopify. Right? I can’t ship a new feature to Shopify. They have a platform as well. But it’s more limited right now for WooCommerce to get better. That could be the biggest idiot in the world. In fact I am. So the beauty is that not just the WooCommerce developers, but everyone in the community can make it better or just make it better for them. This needs to be better for everyone. And that sort of personalization I think is again the question was the advantages. So you know, again there’s reasons to own, to rent an apartment versus own a house. Sometimes it’s convenient and it’s nice to use something kind of off the rack and if you fit into it, you know, more power to you. Actually one of my great blessings in life is I am very much a men’s medium. So like I, I can walk into a store and pick up a suit. I had to the other day because I, I was going to a funeral so I didn’t have a black suit. So they would go in and get something off the rack and it, it Fit quite well. I have other friends who have different proportions. You know, if they don’t get something tailored, it looks ridiculous on them. So if you can get the off the rack, that’s pretty cool. And if you’re happy with that, great. So off the rack software can be fun, but at the moment that you need any personalization or you want it to be more better fit to you and tailored, that’s when I think open source really starts to shine and a platform like WooCommerce gets there. Now what do we need to get better at? And maybe this is an existential threat is education. I think one of the biggest opportunities for WordPress and WooCommerce is education. And that’s why I’m so excited about, like the WordPress education credits program. You know, what we’re. I’m calling 26 the year of the meetup, actually going to be doing a ton to enable meetups, to make meetups better, to get meetup organizers better, you know, material and support and everything like that. And of course, media ladder into Word camps, which as we know, are part of the magic of the whole WordPress community. But, but really what that fundamentally is, is like there’s this. I’m sorry, this is a long answer, but we’re probably hitting a few other questions as well that I read. When you think about it fundamentally, like how ideas spread or how innovation spreads, it’s usually like a see, do, teach, right? That’s kind of the three things that are exciting. You see something that’s exciting to you, it’s a store or someone making something or someone doing something, you’re like, oh, I could do that. This is how I got started blogging, right? There are all these blogs out there. I was like, oh, this is just a normal dude like me. Like, I could blog. I thought to have a website or to publish, you had to be like a journalist or like, you know, have certifications or an editor. And it turns out, no, I’m dating myself. But in like early 2000s, like, this was an innovative idea. Anyone could start a blog. And so having people see what they can do with WooCommerce is really, really important. That’s why things like the showcase and demos are great. Then you do it yourself, right? That’s the next level, which is very exciting. So you kind of learn from that, what you saw, and you do it yourself. And then the final, where you reach, like ultimate status is when you teach someone else to do it, right? When you pass it on. And when you think about it, like WordPress and WooCommerce even hasn’t grown because like our competitors, we spent billions of dollars on, you know, it’s grown because of that C2 teach, which is also kind of like word of mouth, you know, I’m sure many people listening here can imagine what their introduction to WordPress or WooCommerce was. And it might have been you just came across the website and figured it all out yourself. But for a lot of people, you probably had a friend or maybe an influencer online who said, hey, look at this, check this out. That was your entree into the community. Katie Keith:Yeah, well, you’ve talked about the open source side of things. So that leads us into a question that somebody else had, which is about the relationship between like WooCommerce and people choosing other WordPress plugins that also are obviously open source. So Rodolfo from Business Bloomer and Checkout Summit, I don’t know why I’ve written E Commerce there says, what can we learn from SureCart, FluentCart, EDD and the other E Commerce commerce plugins given? I suppose that they equally have that freedom of open source. Matt Mullenweg:Oh well, the beauty of that is, you know, what we can learn is they can also exchange code. They can use WooCommerce code and WooCommerce could use their code. So I think that, you know, being able to be inspired and share and, you know, between products is like part of what accelerates the cycle of innovation. So if there’s something specific, I don’t have anything specific to say about any of those particular products except that I’m really glad they exist. James Kemp:I wanted to touch on your point earlier about just the extensibility of WooCommerce and that being one of the main reasons that people would want to choose it is the kind of flexibility and the freedom you have to not only build on top of it, but contribute code to it. That’s something that we’re really focusing on at WooCommerce is making the platform, the underlying code of WooCommerce to be very. It should have all of the base features that you would expect and work in a consistent way that you can extend on top of. So if someone chooses one person’s bulk editor plugin, they could easily switch to another one and it would work in a similar way with the underlying logic being the same. So that kind of ability to choose to pick and choose which extensions you use on top of WooCommerce is something that we want to make very reliable for the people installing WordPress and using WordPress and WooCommerce. So, yeah, I just wanted to touch on that. But moving on to user experience, we have a question here from Ian, and I know he said online how to say his surname. And it’s not how I would say it. Katie Keith:It’s Meisner, not Meisner. James Kemp:Meisner lands on WooCommerce.com what is the ideal path for them to get started and what are the biggest obstacles? Matt Mullenweg:Oh, that’s a good question. Well, I guess kind of the first fork in the road there would be, you know, do it myself versus do it for me. So, you know, hopefully@woocommerce.com, they. They get excited about the possibilities of the platform and see examples of stores like them that are very successful or increase their business or increase their conversions by, you know, utilizing some of the things on there. And so either they go the direction of, like, going to one of the partner web hosts, which are not just automatic ones, by the way. We point to others and get signed up with WooCommerce configured and everything like that, and you can start to go through the Configuring WooCommerce process. I’ll be the first to admit that that’s a bit heavier than the WordPress process, and so someone will have to have some motivation. Now, I’ll also say that AI is raising people’s ability to make it through these things, right? Because they just put a ChatGPT window next to it and say, I’m stuck. What do I do? Or, gosh, even now we’re having the browsers that have these AI agents built in, which I talked about at WordCamp US and State of the Word. You can actually have the AI just kind of watch it, do stuff for you. You can say, build me this and it’ll start to, like, navigate WooCommerce and do and do it and you can see it do it, which is also kind of like, again, making that do it yourself path way more accessible. So pre AI, I would have said probably 95% of the time they go to a developer or consultants and, you know, we link to some great things there. We have agency partners. There’s great platforms like Codable and of course, the big ones like Upwork and everything. Like, it’s one of the great things about the WordPress and WooCommerce community is there’s so many people who are fluent in it. And so you can really find someone who’s a great match for you, whether that’s in your language or in your country or whatever it is that’s important to you or they have a portfolio that matches what you want to build. There’s a great ecosystem, that two sided marketplace. So that would be one possible path. That percentage is probably going to come down in terms of total numbers, but I think the total demand for third party developers is going to go up, right? So maybe let’s say AI makes it so only, you know, let’s just say half, so half of people can do it themselves versus hiring a developer. So you think, okay, if there were obviously a finite number of WU stores being created, that would mean less work for third party developers. But actually what’s going to happen is there’ll be more demand for stores being created in general. And so there might be some dips and valleys in there, but ultimately like if I go out 10 years, there’s going to be way more like Woo jobs than there are today. Katie Keith:Yeah, I totally agree that it’s a big benefit of Woo how many people are fluent in it. For example, we use easy digital Downloads on the Barn 2 site and it can be very difficult when we need to find an expert or hire somebody that’s already experienced in that. With Woo, it’s really, really easy. There are so many people that have all different skill levels, all different price ranges, so you can find an expert that easily. Which brings us onto the community section where we have another question from Ian, who asks, what does healthy collaboration look like between the platform and the community? Matt Mullenweg:Oh, I think it looks like what Woo has done for the past 10 years and before even the acquisition. You know, I always say, I usually say this for WordPress, but I think it applies to Woo equally well. Its success has been predicated on how closely has that collaboration with the community, what that looks like. And gosh, there’s so many examples of things like I talk about Wapu. I would have never approved Wapu and how amazing is like Wapu for the WordPress community? Like that. That is something that comes up from the community. The cool thing about Open source is that community happens whether you want it to or not, right people? Because people just publish plugins or fork the software, whatever happened, like, so you kind of get. One thing I love about Open source is that it kind of forces you, if you’re the steward of the software, it keeps you honest, you know, because it’s very natural market forces that, you know, if unless you’re like the most stubborn person in the world or blind, you’ll just like wake up one day and be like, okay, everyone’s using this plugin. We should Just build it in decor, whatever it is that that’s happening. Or every time I go to work camp, 10 people tell me this. So you know those sorts of things. So what that looks like in the future is, you know, if I had to say something I’d like to see more of this year in terms of collaboration is I’d love to see more talks at WordCamps around WooCommerce. I’d love to see more either dedicated WooCommerce meetups, which, you know, WooCommerce does have its own meetup.com thing, or like topics like how do we teach more broader WordPress developers how they can learn woo. And how that actually probably increases their economic value in the marketplace. Right. One nice thing about working in the e commerce world, like we said, there’s a store that’s making 5 million bucks a year. They’re making, let’s say they’re making 5 million bucks a year from their website. Like they’re going to want, you know, feel comfortable investing in that. So if you think of what their threshold is versus like you know, someone else building a website, a coffee shop. You build a website for the coffee shop. They’re making most of the money from people coming to the door. The website’s nice to have but you know, of their revenue, how much will they spend? It’s called half a percent, 1% on the website or like an e commerce store, both the revenue might be higher but also like the percent they’re willing to reinvest into their infrastructure and their website and development and customization and everything is probably much higher. Hosting, you know, they’ll want to pay for more performant hosting and invest in those things. So you know, we track 30 something billion of GMV happening through WooCommerce and actual numbers higher than that because we don’t, we’re not able to track everything. So when you imagine like the economic opportunity for doing things in the WordPress ecosystem, it’s pretty huge, I would say bigger than WordPress actually. James Kemp:Yeah, for sure. I think it touches on a point why I’ve always said, you know, I started as a WooCommerce plugin developer and I chose that route because the types of clients we were getting were the ones that had money to spend on this stuff because their store relied on, you know, transactions going through it. And that’s how I kind of fell into the, the E commerce side of things. So it’s definitely true that it’s a, it’s a profitable area of WordPress and of any like online business. I would say I’ll touch quickly on the healthy collaboration as well, because there’s. There’s a couple of projects where we have collaborate, collaborated. Last year, one being the accessibility project that we had for WooCommerce. We collaborated with Equalize Digital, and that was just a case of, you know, myself and Amber getting in touch and talking about what that might look like. And that’s, you know, came to fruition. WooCommerce is now fully accessible, which is awesome on the front end. And another example is we worked with Becker at Kestrel on scoping out what shipping fulfillments might look like in WooCommerce. And that is also a feature that Becker heavily helped to scope out. What they’ve been hearing from customers and clients around what people want. And that work is now also in WooCommerce Core behind a feature flag, but it’s there to be used and tested. So I’d love to see more stuff like that, just more collaboration of what people are seeing in the ecosystem and just putting that out there to someone like me or any other product person at WooCommerce so we can talk about it. GitHub is a great place to do that. The next question you actually touched on already was from Rodolfo, and he said, is there going to be any more WooCommerce or is there going to be more WooCommerce coverage at flagship WordCamps? It sounds like you think there should be. Matt Mullenweg:Oh, should is relative. So if people want it, there will be. So I’d say, like, you know, be the change you want to see in the world. If you want more WooCommerce at WordCamps, if you are listening to this podcast, you probably could be a speaker. So make the pitch. And if you’re helping to organize a word Camp, you know, understand your audience, obviously, like, look at who’s coming. And I do think that with, you know, almost a quarter of all WordPress websites using WooCommerce, like, you know, maybe something like a quarter of sessions at WordCamp should be about WooCommerce, WooCommerce more broadly. Like you said, there’s other solutions as well. I think that’s great. As long as things are open source, they’re welcome at WordCamps. Katie Keith:Yeah, well, that’s what I would have thought. The last few flagship WordCamps that I’ve been to, I have submitted a talk about e Commerce or WooCommerce. I’ve tried both. And a talk about myself, like, my story. And my story is always the one that’s been accepted like WordCamp I think Asia last year, but there’s been three or four and nobody accepts my e commerce talks, which I think are really interesting. So I’m a bit concerned about why that is because all the data you said is totally correct about how many sites use WooCommerce and E commerce. Generally that’s where the money is. And yet I am finding it really hard to spread the word about WooCommerce and e commerce at WordCamps and I don’t know why that is. Matt Mullenweg:Well, Katie, your story is really good. Katie Keith:But everyone’s heard it. I think e commerce is more interesting these days. Matt Mullenweg:Okay, well then don’t submit it and just submit the e commerce or submit it and do a little bait and switch when it’s like my story actually turned it into an e commerce talk. Katie Keith:Yeah, but yeah, I agree. That’s definitely needed. Whoever does the talks, there should be much more representation at WordCamps. Matt Mullenweg:Well, and I’ll keep that in mind. You know the WordCamp I’m most active in choosing the content for is WordCamp US. So as that comes around and I look at things, I’ll keep that in mind. Katie Keith:So the next group of questions are about the features and upcoming priorities of WooCommerce. So the first one there was from Ian. Again, WooCommerce has intentionally served merchants, product builders and agencies. Are their goals and targets aligned to those segments and how are they prioritized? Matt Mullenweg:Merchants, product builders and agencies? Yes, there are goals tied to each one of those. How are they prioritized off the dome? Not certain right now. James might be able to answer this better, but those are, I would say, some of the big Personas that as we build things in Woo, you try to. Well, often, sometimes when we build things, it addresses all of Them, but as we make it more usable or something like that, that benefits everyone. But yeah, there’s definitely been some, I would say some more specific outreach around like growing the agency program or other things like that. I also saw a feedback that there’s work camps might not want pitches for a specific product. I think I agree. And I would say that once a product also becomes a platform itself like WordPress and if you go to WordPress plugins directory, there’s hundreds or thousands of WooCommerce plugins, it’s okay, you know. You know, once it becomes not just about itself, but actually something that a lot of people could build on, that’s okay for a working app. James Kemp:Interesting. Yeah, yeah, that’s a fair point. You don’t want to promote a specific product, I guess. But Yeah, I mean WooCommerce is, is huge at this point, so it deserves. Matt Mullenweg:To be talked about and people want solutions, so. James Kemp:Yes, yes, exactly. Yeah. Matt Mullenweg:Yeah. James Kemp:I’ve always found that on Reddit actually they block a lot of comments when you provide a solution to the question because it looks like promotion, but actually it solves the issue that they were having but sidetracked. Katie Keith:Often a product does. Yeah. So we’ve got a couple of follow up comments of people watching live about the word count discussion. So let’s do that before we move on to more pre submitted questions. So Dave has said suggested next flagship a separate room for E Commerce. I would love to see that. That would make a lot of sense actually. James Kemp:That would be cool to see. Matt Mullenweg:Yeah. You know what, I’ll tease something as well, which is this could be an interesting year to have a dedicated woo event again. Katie Keith:Yeah, well, we got a couple of independent events popping up, which is interesting. So we’ve just had, well, it was kind of, I think WordCamp affiliated e commerce day for WordPress in Porto, which James and I both spoke at. And then we’ve got Checkout Summit in Sicily in April. So it’s interesting to see that community interest is growing in the E Commerce side of things. And Checkout Summit is specifically WooCommerce rather than E Commerce as well. So I am liking that direction. Matt Mullenweg:There hasn’t been a WooConf in a few years and I think this would be a cool year to see another one. Katie Keith:Yeah. And we got a comment from Brent. Matt Mullenweg:This is what I addressed earlier. This is the one I was responding to. If it’s a platform and there’s like hundreds of plugins in the directory on top of it, I think that sort of. It’s a Spectrum, but that’s where it makes it a little bit more okay, I would say, to talk about or a lot more okay to talk about a specific, you know, plugin or solution or things. James Kemp:Awesome. Was that all the questions that you had, Katie? Yeah, I think it’s worth touching on the prioritization point because I think I can speak to that a bit more. One of the focuses this year will be that every release should have something beneficial for each one of those target groups of people. And to more clearly put that out there in writing, this, this feature or this enhancement is specifically targeted at this group of people or group of users. So I think we’ll definitely see a lot more of that this year, which, which will be great to see. We have a question from Ian. Of course, our list of questions are all from Ian. If developer resources were not a constraint, what would you do? So what would unlock the biggest leap forward? So if you had unlimited developer resources, where would you put them? Matt Mullenweg:That is a really good question. And Ian, I’ll say that it’s very prescient with this idea of intelligence being on tap with AI agents we’re seeing. If you’re listening to this and you haven’t been clawed code pilled yet, take some time. Nothing else from this podcast. Take some time, go through some tutorials, install claw code. By the way, it’s not just for code. You can use it for any other files on your computer. You can use it with your notes, you can use it with so much. I saw some crazy stuff with it being hooked up to Playground and Beeper today. Like you can do some really, really neat things. And that kind of is an under unlimited developer resource in some ways that we haven’t seen. And it is the 1.0 version and the capabilities that are coming out this year as the new Nvidia chips come online, all the new data centers you heard about get built. You know, especially some of the Elon Musk stuff, which is moving very quickly, but also the investments from Google, Meta, everyone, like anthropic, like we’re going to see some. If you thought last year was exciting from an AI point of view, I think this will actually be the year that is a little more jaw dropping. So January 14th, Mark, mark my words. James Kemp:There to touch on the Claude code they just released in the Claude desktop app, something called Claude Coworkers, which is Claude code under the hood. You set it up, you choose a folder to run it in, and it runs in exactly the same way as Claude code. But it’s a lot Less technical. It’s not a CLI based interface which is very useful for non code based work where Claude code seemingly excels, which I don’t think was the expectation when they released it. So yeah, definitely worth checking out. Matt Mullenweg:It’s just going to get better. So yeah, this also, you know, back to the brilliance of Ian’s question is it’s almost like the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy thing. Like the answer, when you can have any answer, like what you ask and what you build is really important. And so, you know, I would pick, I mean honestly I would pick what WooCommerce’s roadmap is because that was kind of the, you know, it’s not that we have unlimited developer resources, but we do have, you know, pretty active process. Of the hundreds of people who work on WooCommerce and the investments that are happening into the scalability, you know, the sort of idea of the interface being more radically accessible and kind of unifying some of the things that are right now like sort of some classical WordPress interfaces, but could be like maybe like reduce people’s clicks, reduce kind of the friction they have when they’re running the store day to day. Earlier there was a mention of merchants. I would say very much the merchant experience is on my mind. And sort of like if you’re running a store every day, what do you do 10 times or 100 times? And how can we make that a little bit smoother? And again, every click you can remove, every sort of way you can sand the edges of that experience multiplies because people are doing it hundreds of times a day themselves and of course millions of times a day across the WooCommerce. WooCommerce system checkouts already getting a lot better. But of course anything in the checkout is a multiplier for the, for our ecosystem. It’s already there. There’s probably some things in stripe link or shop checkout that we don’t match yet. And for some stores or some geographies and so that could be improved for main ones like us stuff, I think it’s prepared now in terms of conversions, performance, you can always be faster, always be faster. There’s no one who says I would love this website to load slower. Yeah. Katie Keith:Well that brings us quite nicely to the next question, which is what are the top milestones WooCommerce will deliver in 2026? Which is from Robin James. Matt Mullenweg:I feel like we should point to a WooCommerce blog post or something here. Is there an official resource I don’t want to. James Kemp:Yeah, I mean, BO actually published, I believe it was late last year and I’m sure Brent in the comments will be able to drop a link in. But his vision for 2026 for WooCommerce, which is something that we’re really sticking to. And I think one of the. So the quality is high on the list, performance is high on the list, builder experience is high on the list, as well as merchant experience, which is always high on the list. And also I think, you know, evolving with the AI ecosystem as it moves and just adapting to that. Integrating things like the Stripe Agentic Commerce protocol and the new Google UCP protocol that they announced and just really working and refining those experiences are always top of mind. Hopefully Brent can drop in a link to the relevant blog post from Beau, but yeah, that should be sufficient, I would have thought. Katie Keith:Yeah, you mentioned the builder experience. We’ve got a live comment from Jerry who says, is there any roadmap for the block editor on the single product? James Kemp:There has been a lot of. So I guess the block. There’s two ways you could understand this question. One is kind of using the new interface, what we call data forms, as the interface for the product editor, which is one experience and that replaces the whole experience of the product editor. And the other one is the. The block editor existing as a way to update the product description, which the way I read that question is more in line with that. Katie Keith:Yeah, I think so. Like creating multi column layouts with blocks and things like that for the product page instead of just the template based layout we’re used to. James Kemp:Yeah, and I would say there’s no official roadmap, but it’s something that for me is high priority to. To dig into. Like that experience of using the editor to customize your product pages is just awesome. It’s much more flexible and impressive than a standard text editor. Matt, I don’t know if you had any thoughts on that. Matt Mullenweg:No, it sounds good. I apologize. I am not the biggest WooCommerce expert in the world, which is funny. Thank you for having me start your show. I think about it a lot more from the sort of like broader ecosystem and the strategy and those things I can speak to probably a little more, or the future of development and computing and those sorts of things. But for a specific question like that, I think James is a much better person to answer. Or Bo if he was here. Katie Keith:Yeah, agreed. There was quite a lot of questions that were really specific that when we went through them we thought actually we’ve got James, the core Product manager as a host we don’t need. Whereas for this interview we wanted to go high level and talk about the wider vision and the future bigger picture stuff. So that’s what we were expecting. Matt Mullenweg:And sorry about that for the audience but you know, either James or like other guests I think could do some more of those like super deep dives. So think of this as like the appetizer for do the Woo episodes to go much, much deeper. James Kemp:Yeah, I think it’s just really great to hear what you envision E Commerce or WooCommerce could be. So I think we’ve touched on that quite a lot, which is interesting. Matt Mullenweg:I did see a few questions coming about UCP, so I’ll speak to that and someone’s like, why weren’t you part of the announcement or whatever that is. Katie Keith:Yeah. Any update on UCP which just Google recently launched. How will WooCommerce move forwards with this? Matt Mullenweg:So I mean without speaking specifically to UCP, I will say that it is funny given how much bigger and more money they have, that Shopify is kind of scared of WooCommerce. So often they will negotiate to be sort of an exclusive day of launch announcement. And if you notice with like the Stripe stuff, I mean we were there on day one but it didn’t get announced a few days later or if they just negotiated for us to find out about when everyone else does, it’ll come really quickly, so don’t worry about that. It’ll all be supported. The second thing I’ll say though is that and there was an article in the information about this a few days ago is that these things are not being used at all. It’s very telling that almost a year after some of this stuff was first announced, there have been almost no, no one talking about how many transactions have gone through this. And it was like a headline feature like the Stripe conference and the Shopify thing and all this sort of stuff, the CEOs are there and it’s moving the stock prices and like, so it’s, it’s very interesting. This happens in software kind of frequently is occasionally there’s something that everyone’s like, oh, that is the best idea ever in the world. And it gets a ton of hype and a ton of everything and then once it kind of lands in the world, users are like, nope, doesn’t fit or there’s something missing. Now I’m not saying that agenda commerce 10 years from now won’t be like a double digit percentage of commerce or something like, you know, we’ll probably figure this out. But it might also be, you know, the Google Glass or one of these things that where you can put a bajillion dollars into and it seems like the coolest idea. But like when it meets the reality of real world, there’s something about it that just kind of like doesn’t make it gel. Katie Keith:Yeah, I agree there’s some barriers that are going to put people off things like buying in AI. Well, how about buying multiple things in order to get free shipping? Just having one product recommended isn’t that relevant. James and I discussed this in the Q and A at E Commerce Day that there’s a few things that need to really change about the nature of people shopping before it gets that widespread adoption. Matt Mullenweg:And in the Information article I found it very fascinating because with Woo, you know, some of this stuff is a little tricky to support because we don’t host every Woo store in the world. So providing like a universal catalog for every Woo product in the world is like kind of tricky. I mean there’s ways to do it certainly if they sync with Jetpack or if we build some sort of crawler or opt in thing, like we can centralize some stuff. But it turns out even Shopify, who I would assume this was much easier for, has huge data issues. And it’s because people run their stores in different ways. They might say something is in stock when it’s really not, or there might be different shipping variations or there might be, you know, there’s just different ways that people show product variations when they might not exist. Or you know, there’s all sorts of stuff out there that apparently even for Shopify, which host and has all the data, you know, it’s all on their servers, sort of normalizing it in a way that’s accessible to the users in a way that’s also useful and accurate and true. Inside the chat interface has been a bigger challenge than certainly I would have imagined. So that’s been something surprising to me as well. The information is like a paid site, but maybe someone can, like actually someone should. I’m surprised a WordPress news site hasn’t covered this yet. So maybe request for a blog post for someone to summarize some of the stuff from that information article. James Kemp:I think another point to consider is just how quickly AI is evolving. To kind of set a standard protocol now is challenging, but a worthy exploration for sure. But yeah, our teams are digging into both ACP and UCP and I’m sure if you keep an eye on the developer blog that we will have some information about that very soon. Matt Mullenweg:If I had to make a bet, well, I guess I will. A prediction. It’s the amount of commerce that’ll happen from people just in a chat interface versus the amount of commerce that will happen from AI agents driving browsers. And so using the normal website, the normal human interface. But some of that might be more like the autofill might be better with AI or finding the product or navigating the site like those sorts of things. Maybe even discovery of the product might be driven by the AI. That second part will be way, way, way bigger. James Kemp:Yeah, discovery is an interesting one because I always use AI now to recommend products to me, but it’s still not great. So I use Claude most of the time and it’s still not great at actually providing a link to the product on any specific store. So it will say like you want this product and it would just be the name of the product and then I then have to go and search for it. Matt Mullenweg:I would say Anthropic is the worst at that actually. Yes. AI Perplexity and Gemini Google have gotten really, really good at linking the sites. James Kemp:Yeah. And I think we’ll see that evolve over time. But yeah, part of that experience is like reading the reviews yourself and like Katie was saying, you know, comparing free shipping costs and getting discount codes and all that kind of stuff. So yeah, it’s definitely a challenge, but something I’m looking forward to seeing how that shapes up this year. And I think it’s going to shape up pretty quickly at the rate things are going. We have a question which I’m not sure if you’ll be able to answer from Tommy on X. He says are there any plans to bring back WOO Express? It was an easy way to onboard less technical clients that don’t know what hosting, et cetera are, but still want the flexibility of WOO and the scalability. Matt Mullenweg:Of WordPress.com oh, what I will say is that, you know, just like every other WordPress host in the world on WordPress.com we’re making a ton of investment into sort of making things easier and not that onboarding. One thing people don’t realize is now every paid plan on WordPress.com supports full plugins and themes. So even the four buck a month one, you get the full WordPress.com scalability, the platform of WP Cloud on every single paid plan. So there’s not the two tiers of paid plans anymore. Which kind of puts us in a similar category to every other web host in the world. Right. You pay for it you get full WordPress now that capability and our, you know, sort of the, the very, very deep technical investments we’ve made that done to make that scalable performance secure. Everything like WordPress.com sites basically never get hacked. You know, you don’t have to worry about security in the same way that you might on a host that does not invest as much in the security. Those sorts of things are available and were very much thinking about tailored experiences by the way, not just for WooCommerce but also other plugins. So other plugins that all the other E commerce plugins in the WordPress community, anything on WordPress.com I want it to be kind of one click easy and in fact just, you know how there’s blueprints for playgrounds where you can kind of like pre configure something. I think we’re going to start to see that become more common in preconfiguring a hosting setup as well. Yeah. Katie Keith:So you’re kind of saying it’s not really needed because things have moved on more generally with WordPress.com and the different options and so on. Matt Mullenweg:Well, and no, I think it’s something like it still might be needed. Katie Keith:I mean so it will express whether that’s needed. Matt Mullenweg:Oh yeah. Well, so to get the scalability and everything, you don’t need it anymore. Scalability, security upgrades, everything. The onboarding experience I think could definitely still be very much improved. So that’s something I still do think is needed. James Kemp:So yeah, and it was touched on in Porto. Having WooCommerce installed in WordPress is very much like you have a plugin installed. WordPress is the main site and you have this kind of E commerce section. And I think what something like Woo Express offered was a flip of that where you’ve got this, this E Commerce admin experience versus a WordPress with e commerce. So I do feel like that side of things is needed and I think that’ll be interesting to see. Matt Mullenweg:And when you put it like that, I almost feel like it should just be a setting in the plugin. James Kemp:Right, yeah, that’s been discussed. Matt Mullenweg:Woo is a minor thing for some things, some sites it’s the whole thing and in which case I know there’s. It is tricky because a lot of plugins fight for real estate in the sort of navigation, the sort of standard chrome of WordPress but I think with user control again, you know, it might be aggressive to do this by default or something. Yeah. In the plugin. But like you know, having it be like so people know what they’re doing. They can switch it on and off and like, you know, for a plugin with the sort of surface area of Woo, certainly putting things at top level navigation, I think is okay. You have a few things there. And two, you can imagine something where it does become a bit more primary. Now that said, I say, like, don’t, don’t completely hide the word presto. People still are going to have pages and blogs and everything like that and it’s nice to have the dashboard where they see the news and get involved with the community and all that sort of stuff. Yeah, cool. I think we’re coming up on time. So how would you like to wrap it up? Katie Keith:Let’s wrap it up with one more question about the future, which feels like a good ending. So let’s go to Robin’s question, which is long term, what does WooCommerce look like in three plus years? James Kemp:Oh. Matt Mullenweg:So things I’m certain of, it’ll be faster. Making a ton of investments in performance. Updates will be seamless. I deal with a lot of things in the world, so despite people’s perceptions of me, it actually takes a lot to get me truly riled up. But the one thing that will do that without fail is when an update breaks a site. To me, that is the worst thing you could ever do with software. It makes me furious. Totally unacceptable. And it needs to happen zero times. And it’s possible. It’s hard, but it’s possible. And I think not just Woo, but every WordPress plugin developer has a responsibility to really put in the work, to make updates as seamless as possible. Otherwise once you lose that trust in updates, it’s gone. So I’ll say that updates will be frequent and seamless and the interface will be much, much more, much, much more modern in the sense that it’ll feel a lot more like a sort of modern app. And by the way, WordPress is going to evolve alongside that. So we’re doing some fun stuff to sort of spruce up the WordPress admin a bit as well. And so Woo will both benefit from that and I think build on top of it as well. James Kemp:Awesome. The update point is very relevant. Do you feel like that’s something that needs to happen at the plugin level or at the WordPress hosting level as well? Matt Mullenweg:That’s a good question. I think there’s work at every level, sort of like a defense in depth. This is idea in security. Like you don’t just want one layer of security, you want multiple things because one of them’s probably going to fail inevitably. So then you have all these other layers in place that still makes sure the bad thing doesn’t happen, the fatal thing doesn’t happen. So I do really appreciate at the hosting level, you know, the investments people make into auto rollbacks or some even do it like with visual testing on the front end and stuff like that. And of course providing an ability for users to do that on demand. Is that sort of undo button beautiful? That’s very important as a last resort. I think the other important thing, and this is also getting easier with AI, is testing and sort of like having a great beta program, getting things out there in the world, doing automated testing on various, you know, since you can get to know, I’m sure you or feedback from your users and what the most common things they use WooCommerce with or your plugin with is like. How are you testing that? If you’re a developer, are you testing the beta versions of both WordPress and WooCommerce? So finding any changes that might either you need to update for or that maybe, you know, the core platform needs to be informed that they mess something up because they missed some edge case or some API you were using. So that it is. It’s going to take a village. But we’ve done it with WordPress, you know, now for, you know, knocking on wood. But, but for many the we’ve had many, many, many years of a very smooth update process and you know, for also hundreds of millions or billions of times now for plugins and themes as well. But of course Core has become, I think rightly so, very trusted for upgrades. Katie Keith:Yeah. Well, thank you so much for coming on and also thanks to everybody who submitted questions. Matt Mullenweg:I really appreciate it and congrats on this new format, new show, everything. I will definitely be a listener and watcher and can’t wait to see what you all do. James Kemp:Amazing. Thank you. Next month we have James LePage joining us. We’re going to be talking about how well the title is AI meets Woo and how AI is already reshaping E commerce. So pop that in your calendar. It’s on Tuesday 10th February at the same time? No, an hour earlier. It’s an hour before ET and 5pm CET and hopefully there won’t be any technical issues on that one. Katie Keith:Yeah, we’ll be experts by then. And after that, James and I will be back every month to discuss a different area of WooCommerce. So please subscribe. This is a new podcast.

Title: AXT Touts Surging Indium Phosphide Demand for AI Data Centers at Needham Conference Amid Export Curbs

AXT NASDAQ: AXTI executives highlighted rising demand for indium phosphide wafers tied to accelerating optical connectivity needs in AI data centers, while also addressing China export controls, capacity expansion plans, and the company’s ongoing effort to list its China subsidiary on Shanghai’s STAR Market. Get AXT alerts:Sign UpCompany overview and product focus Speaking at the 28th Needham Growth Conference, CFO Gary Fischer said AXT was founded in 1986 and went public in 1998. The company produces specialized compound semiconductor wafers “for when silicon wafers won’t work,” with manufacturing based in China and headquarters in Fremont, California. Vice President Tim Bettles said AXT manufactures three core compound semiconductor substrate materials: germanium, gallium arsenide, and indium phosphide. Bettles characterized germanium as a relatively small part of the business—less than 10%—and said it is used predominantly in satellite solar cells. He added that the company limits its exposure to germanium because profitability can be highly sensitive to volatile raw germanium prices. Bettles said gallium arsenide is the material the company was founded on, with applications including industrial lasers, VCSELs used in data centers, LEDs for lighting and display, printer heads, and cell phone power amplifiers. He said AXT continues to pursue growth applications in that segment. Indium phosphide demand tied to optical interconnect growth Management emphasized that indium phosphide is the key driver of recent investor interest. Fischer said AXT has “the best product in the market for indium phosphide,” and argued that the market has become more aware of indium phosphide’s role in data center infrastructure. He described indium phosphide as “one of the first items in the value chain” for AI data centers. Bettles said indium phosphide is the core substrate material for optical transceivers, including pluggable optics and co-packaged optics (CPO). As data rates rise, he said connectivity increasingly shifts from copper and electrical links to optical links. He described two major demand vectors: “Scale-out” optics used for rack-to-rack connections, where Bettles said AXT is seeing significant growth. He said order demand could grow roughly 2x in 2026 and potentially another 2x in 2027 for scale-out. “Scale-up” tied to CPO and silicon photonics, where Bettles said silicon handles much of the modulation but indium phosphide is still required to generate light via an indium phosphide-based gain chip. He said AXT expects an inflection point when CPO adoption takes off, pointing to 2028–2029 for “real growth beyond what we’re seeing today.” In response to a question about current exposure, Bettles estimated that AI data center connectivity is still a small part of revenue today—single digits, “pushing 10%”—but growing rapidly. He also estimated that data center-related demand is roughly 30%–35% of the total addressable market for indium phosphide substrates, with most of that currently tied to traditional (non-AI) data centers. Vertical integration and customer supply chain positioning Executives repeatedly highlighted AXT’s vertically integrated supply chain in China. Bettles said the company has about 10 raw material-related companies and capabilities that include producing or sourcing key inputs, making quartz for furnaces, building furnaces, and producing high-temperature furnace materials. He said AXT owns two companies supplying gallium and providing purification and recycling, as well as high-temperature crucibles made from pyrolytic boron nitride. Bettles said this concentration on a single campus in China helps mitigate supply chain risk, supports recycling, and allows AXT to control raw material costs and scale upstream capacity alongside substrate demand. He contrasted AXT’s “backwards” integration with competitors that integrate “forwards” into devices such as lasers and detectors, which can create conflicts with customers. When asked about downstream exposure, Bettles said AXT sells bare substrates rather than epitaxial wafers, supplying epi vendors and laser makers. He named epi vendors including LandMark, VPEC, WIN Semiconductors, and IQE, and said laser and related customers include Lumentum, Coherent, Broadcom, Intel, MACOM, and Applied Optoelectronics. He described AXT as operating at the beginning of the value chain, with components ultimately flowing into transceiver manufacturers and then data center systems. Export controls, geographic revenue mix, and permitting risk Management said export controls are a key risk factor. In response to a question, Bettles said indium phosphide was added to China’s export control list on Feb. 4, 2025. He said AXT must apply for an export permit for every order shipped outside of China. Fischer said the company experienced a period in 2025 where no permits were received in the first half, followed by permits arriving in the third quarter and then “steadily” since. Fischer said the permit process is one of the company’s major disclosed risks and noted it is controlled by the Chinese government, leaving AXT with limited control and visibility. Bettles described the process as opaque and said permit timing varied in ways the company does not fully understand. He added that permitting can involve multiple agencies beyond the Ministry of Commerce, including regional bureaus and other government bodies, and that even the Ministry of Commerce may have limited transparency into timing. On geographic exposure, Fischer said revenue historically has been roughly 40%–50% to China, with U.S. revenue typically in the high single digits and Japan in the double digits, though he did not provide exact figures. Bettles separately estimated that indium phosphide revenue outside China is “more than 70%, 75%” currently, while noting the China market has historically skewed toward GPON and telecom applications and is beginning to show growth in higher-speed areas. Capacity expansion and pricing comments AXT said it is expanding indium phosphide capacity. Bettles said the company is doubling capacity through 2026 and expects that by the end of 2026 it will be at double the capacity level of the end of 2025. He said AXT has an advantage because it can repurpose an existing building previously used for gallium arsenide crystal growth, allowing expansion at relatively low cost and on a shorter timeline. He added that competitor Sumitomo is also doubling capacity, but has indicated it could take two and a half to three years, and that another competitor, Japan Energy, holds roughly 10% share and has announced capacity increases. Bettles said AXT expects market share to depend on which supplier can expand capacity fastest, and said AXT believes it is positioned to gain share. On pricing, Bettles said the company generally expects pricing to remain relatively stable across most applications, but noted exceptions such as low-average-selling-price GPON markets in China and certain consumer or regional segments. He said AXT is reassessing pricing to establish a more standardized baseline, and noted that one competitor has pursued significant price increases of about 40%, while AXT is avoiding broad across-the-board increases. Fischer also said AXT continues to pursue a long-delayed plan to take its China subsidiary, Tongmei, public on Shanghai’s STAR Market, describing the process as ongoing and “interactive,” but taking longer than expected as the company remains in the queue and responds to information requests.About AXT NASDAQ: AXTIAXT, Inc NASDAQ: AXTI is a global supplier of compound and single-element semiconductor substrates, offering a range of materials critical for high-performance electronic and optoelectronic devices.

Fischer said the company experienced a period in 2025 where no permits were received in the first half, followed by permits arriving in the third quarter and then “steadily” since. Fischer said the permit process is one of the company’s major disclosed risks and noted it is controlled by the Chinese government, leaving AXT with limited control and visibility. Bettles described the process as opaque and said permit timing varied in ways the company does not fully understand. He added that permitting can involve multiple agencies beyond the Ministry of Commerce, including regional bureaus and other government bodies, and that even the Ministry of Commerce may have limited transparency into timing. On geographic exposure, Fischer said revenue historically has been roughly 40%–50% to China, with U.S. revenue typically in the high single digits and Japan in the double digits, though he did not provide exact figures. Bettles separately estimated that indium phosphide revenue outside China is “more than 70%, 75%” currently, while noting the China market has historically skewed toward GPON and telecom applications and is beginning to show growth in higher-speed areas. Capacity expansion and pricing comments AXT said it is expanding indium phosphide capacity. Bettles said the company is doubling capacity through 2026 and expects that by the end of 2026 it will be at double the capacity level of the end of 2025. He said AXT has an advantage because it can repurpose an existing building previously used for gallium arsenide crystal growth, allowing expansion at relatively low cost and on a shorter timeline. He added that competitor Sumitomo is also doubling capacity, but has indicated it could take two and a half to three years, and that another competitor, Japan Energy, holds roughly 10% share and has announced capacity increases. Bettles said AXT expects market share to depend on which supplier can expand capacity fastest, and said AXT believes it is positioned to gain share. On pricing, Bettles said the company generally expects pricing to remain relatively stable across most applications, but noted exceptions such as low-average-selling-price GPON markets in China and certain consumer or regional segments. He said AXT is reassessing pricing to establish a more standardized baseline, and noted that one competitor has pursued significant price increases of about 40%, while AXT is avoiding broad across-the-board increases. Fischer also said AXT continues to pursue a long-delayed plan to take its China subsidiary, Tongmei, public on Shanghai’s STAR Market, describing the process as ongoing and “interactive,” but taking longer than expected as the company remains in the queue and responds to information requests.About AXT NASDAQ: AXTIAXT, Inc NASDAQ: AXTI is a global supplier of compound and single-element semiconductor substrates, offering a range of materials critical for high-performance electronic and optoelectronic devices.

Bettles said the company has about 10 raw material-related companies and capabilities that include producing or sourcing key inputs, making quartz for furnaces, building furnaces, and producing high-temperature furnace materials. He said AXT owns two companies supplying gallium and providing purification and recycling, as well as high-temperature crucibles made from pyrolytic boron nitride. Bettles said this concentration on a single campus in China helps mitigate supply chain risk, supports recycling, and allows AXT to control raw material costs and scale upstream capacity alongside substrate demand. He contrasted AXT’s “backwards” integration with competitors that integrate “forwards” into devices such as lasers and detectors, which can create conflicts with customers. When asked about downstream exposure, Bettles said AXT sells bare substrates rather than epitaxial wafers, supplying epi vendors and laser makers. He named epi vendors including LandMark, VPEC, WIN Semiconductors, and IQE, and said laser and related customers include Lumentum, Coherent, Broadcom, Intel, MACOM, and Applied Optoelectronics. He described AXT as operating at the beginning of the value chain, with components ultimately flowing into transceiver manufacturers and then data center systems. Export controls, geographic revenue mix, and permitting risk Management said export controls are a key risk factor.

Title: It's shaping up to be the 'prove it' year for workers in Silicon Valley

Every time Tim publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In Silicon Valley, 2026 is shaping up to be a show-your-work year. Across Big Tech, companies are tightening worker oversight amid layoffs, AI-driven job anxiety, and cuts to entry-level roles. If 2025 was about bosses calling on workers to be hardcore, 2026 is about making sure they actually do it. A look inside two of the biggest players reveals what heightened accountability can look like: Business Insider exclusively reported this month that Amazon stepped up efforts to let managers track employee badge swipes and revised performance reviews to focus more on individual accomplishments. Meanwhile, Business Insider also learned that Meta is using dashboards to track workers' AI usage and simplifying its review structure with a winner-take-more approach that better rewards the highest performers. It is also cutting about 10% of workers at its metaverse division. Taken together, the moves signal that Big Tech is ratcheting up the stakes for workers who find themselves in a market that's sluggish for seemingly all but AI's shiniest superstars. The ante-upping comes as companies are pumping massive sums into AI — and, in many cases, are still waiting for the returns to materialize. A desire to see more performance metrics may stem from a need to quantify how workers are using AI to boost productivity. "I suspect in a lot of tech firms, there is kind of a mood of panic," Matthew Bidwell, a management professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, told Business Insider, referring to executives' fear of falling behind in the AI race. Bidwell added that the sense of urgency coming from the top around AI then leads to the question, "How do we make sure we're squeezing the most out of people?" Big Tech's answer? Go big on metrics. Inside Business stories reveal the inner workings of companies from Silicon Valley to Wall Street that are shaping our world today. Sign up for the newsletter. It's not just Amazon and Meta. Microsoft has worked to shed its "country club" reputation, while Google has also changed how it rates employees to incentivize outsize performance. Productivity dashboards, tool-usage metrics, and increasingly granular performance evaluations are becoming central to how managers gauge value. The goal, executives say, is to ensure accountability and reward top performers. The shift is also philosophical: Productivity isn't assumed. It has to be proven. At Amazon, managers have a dashboard to track how much time workers are spending at its corporate outposts — and to flag those who are brushing off the company's return-to-office mandate. The company, as part of its performance review process, is asking its corporate workers to provide three to five accomplishments that exemplify their work. Meta is also adjusting how it keeps score of workers' performance — in part by giving more frequent feedback and tightening the focus on "rewarding outstanding performance," a Meta spokesperson told Business Insider earlier this month. The demand for greater productivity isn't limited to tech. Citi CEO Jane Fraser sent a memo to the bank's staff on Wednesday, entitled "The bar is raised," in which she made it clear to Citi's more than 200,000 workers that she expects them to raise their standards in 2026. "We are not graded on effort. We are judged on our results," Fraser wrote in the memo. The power moves from Big Tech likely reflect a mix of factors, industry observers said. There is the expectation that AI will supercharge workers; yet, there is also a view that something has to justify the massive outlays on the technology. Spending on AI tools that help programmers write code, for example, can bring with it the expectation from management that workers become faster and more efficient. At Incedo, an enterprise AI and data firm, coding assistants have helped boost workers' productivity between 25% and 40%, Nitin Seth, the company's cofounder and CEO, told Business Insider. "As that is happening, there is a squeeze on jobs," he said. Across tech, Seth said, that can mean an imperative to produce more or cut jobs — or both. Incedo has reduced workers because of AI's productivity windfall, he said, though the company continues to hire data engineers among other roles. The company didn't specify how many roles it has cut. Even so, Seth said, AI's productivity bounce in the tech industry hasn't been as great so far as some bosses and boards would like. He said that by the final months of 2025, many business leaders experienced the "sobering realization" that while the early gains from AI were impressive, carving out further wins had proven difficult. Seth likens the AI environment to that of roads and cars — where AI infrastructure is the road and an AI use case is the car. Companies have been spending big on the roads, Seth said, but as yet, "there aren't too many cars." There's also a sunnier take: Leaders feel compelled to "better justify" the people they employ in order to protect their jobs, said Christopher Myers, the faculty director of the Center for Innovative Leadership at the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School. The idea, he told Business Insider, is that dashboards make it clear what workers are doing. It's a way of competing with the readily available metrics on what AI is churning through. One clear fallout is that employers will be able to save money by pushing out low performers, Myers said. RTO mandates, he said, can also be a way of letting go of workers unwilling to comply. Whatever's behind it, he said, leaders' thinking appears to be, "I'm really going to grade hard." It's likely that investors are worried about the number of workers at some companies, said Wharton's Bidwell. Since Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter — and the company's ability to carry on even after deep staff cuts — some investors have concluded that tech firms' pandemic-era bloat could be eliminated, Bidwell said. "He came in. He fired everybody. It didn't fall over," he said of Musk. That has led to what Bidwell sees as "a big cultural shift" in tech about the need to hire the best and the brightest — if only to keep them from going to competitors. The shift means that leaders in Silicon Valley are asking tougher questions about who is pulling their weight. That pressure, Incedo's Seth said, then falls on managers and, ultimately, down to rank-and-file tech workers who are seeing increased performance expectations. "There is greater pressure, greater anxiety, and it's kind of like a snowball effect," he said. Do you have a story to share about your career? Contact this reporter at tparadis@businessinsider.com.

Title: Could Netflix Throw More Cash Into Its Warner Bros. Deal? Investors Are Wondering

Cash is king. Investors tracking the streaming-media M&A saga of the moment may need to decide whose is more regal. Streaming giant Netflix (NFLX) is reportedly considering an all-cash offer to acquire Warner Brothers Discovery (WBD), a change to its previous cash-and-stock bid that would appear to take a direct shot at Paramount Skydance's (PSKY) rival proposal. News of Netflix's possible change dropped after Paramount Skydance ratcheted up its hostile bid for Warner Bros. on Monday; the latest twist would appear to simplify the terms for shareholders weighing the two offers, though it was unclear exactly how much Netflix might offer in a cash-only deal, which hasn't been announced. Neither Paramount nor Netflix responded to Investopedia's query in time for publication. Industry consolidation has historically led to higher prices—not great news for consumers who have been paying more and more for streaming services in recent years. That's one of the concerns some have about what might happen if Warner Bros. Discovery gets pulled into another company. Netflix's stock climbed after Bloomberg first reported that the company was working on revising the terms of its acquisition late Tuesday. Its stock is down more than 1% so far today and is at its lowest price since it and Warner announced their agreement in early December. Paramount's stock, down just under 1%, is also near lows struck after the company muscled in. To recap: Shortly after Netflix announced its cash-and-stock deal to purchase Warner Bros. in December, Paramount Skydance made its own offer public, saying its all-cash bid was better than the streaming company's cash-and-stock one. It has since been campaigning to bring shareholders to its side, and amended its proposal to address some of the reasons Warner outlined for rejecting it in private negotiations. On Monday, Paramount ratcheted up the pressure, saying it intended to nominate directors for election at Warner Bros.' annual meeting and that it would solicit votes against the Netflix agreement. The company also sued Warner Bros. that same day for more information about its deal with Netflix. If Netflix's all-cash offer materializes, Paramount may have to come up with a different argument for why shareholders should choose its proposal, or lean on its other points—mainly, it argues, a faster timeline and greater certainty of closing. In the meantime, some investors are happy with the possibility of more cash on the table, as well as more competition for Warner Bros. “We’re pleased with the bidding war here,” Oakmark fund manager Bill Nygren told CNBC on Wednesday.

Investing Tesla (TSLA) delivered 1.6M vehicles in 2025, down 8.6% year-over-year. This marks the steepest annual drop in company history. Nvidia‘s open-source Alpamayo platform could enable any automaker to deploy autonomous vehicles. Tesla faces intensified competition as rivals adopt the technology. Tesla will stop selling Full Self-Driving as an $8K one-time purchase after Feb. 14. The company will instead offer only a $99 monthly subscription. Sending You to Google News in 3 © metamorworks / Getty Images Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock surged to a new all-time high of $498.83 in December, driven by optimism around its artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and energy initiatives. However, shares have since pulled back 11%% amid broader market concerns. While these ancillary businesses contributed to the stock’s rally, Tesla remains primarily an electric vehicle (EV) company, even as global deliveries declined 8.6% in 2025 to 1.6 million units — the steepest annual drop in its history and the second consecutive year of falling sales. Deliveries were down sharply in key markets like Europe (down almost 28%) and China (hitting a three-year low in October). Now, Tesla faces intensified pressure on the automotive front following Nvidia‘s (NASDAQ:NVDA) CES 2026 reveal earlier this month of advanced technology that could challenge its dominance in autonomous driving. Nvidia has been a key player in the automotive sector since 2015 with its DRIVE platform, a scalable architecture for autonomous vehicles. DRIVE integrates high-performance computing, sensors, and software to enable advanced driver assistance and full autonomy. By 2026, the ecosystem includes partnerships with automakers like Mercedes-Benz and Volvo, using DRIVE Hyperion for Level 4-ready systems. The platform processes data from cameras, radars, and LiDAR, supporting simulation for safe testing. This long-term involvement has positioned Nvidia as a supplier-agnostic enabler, contrasting with Tesla’s vertically integrated approach. At CES 2026 in Las Vegas, Nvidia unveiled the Alpamayo family, an open-source portfolio of AI models, simulation tools, and datasets aimed at accelerating safe, reasoning-based autonomous vehicle development. Alpamayo 1, a 10-billion-parameter vision-language-action model, introduces chain-of-thought reasoning to handle complex, rare scenarios like unpredictable pedestrians or adverse weather. Paired with AlpaSim for high-fidelity testing and 1,700 hours of curated driving data, it emphasizes explainability and safety. Mercedes-Benz plans to integrate it into vehicles like the CLA, with U.S. deployments starting this year. Alpamayo could also revolutionize self-driving by enabling any automaker to become an AV producer through open models that integrate with existing fleets. Developers can fine-tune on proprietary data and validate in simulation before deployment. Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER), for example, has partnered on Alpamayo and DRIVE AGX Hyperion 10 for Level 4 autonomy, aiming to scale to 100,000 vehicles by 2027 with Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) initially supplying the cars. Others, including Bosch and Magna, are expanding adoption, potentially flooding the market with competitive AV options. Tesla, which is counting on its Cybercab to help revive its fortunes when it begins its production in Q2, trails Alphabet‘s (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Waymo in autonomy, with Waymo logging over 100 million driverless miles and 450,000 weekly paid rides across five U.S. cities. Tesla’s 7 billion miles are supervised, requiring human intervention. As more manufacturers adopt Alpamayo, Tesla could face more competition, eroding its EV sales further amid already declining deliveries. Is Tesla panicking yet? Elon Musk announced on X that Tesla will stop selling Full Self-Driving (FSD) as a one-time $8,000 purchase after Feb. 14, offering it only as a $99 monthly subscription. This aims to boost adoption (currently at 12% of owners) and generate recurring revenue amid slumping sales. It may also hedge legal risks tied to unfulfilled autonomy promises. With more AV choices emerging, Tesla’s sales decline could worsen. Nvidia’s Alpamayo isn’t an immediate Tesla-killer but could erode its edge by democratizing AV tech for rivals, pressuring Tesla’s core EV business amid an ongoing decline in EV demand. Still, Tesla’s long-term outlook as the U.S. EV leader remains strong, with analysts forecasting 12% delivery growth to 1.83 million in 2026, aided by a refresh of its Model Y. Ancillary segments like energy storage (up significantly) and robotics could offset car woes, but success hinges on ramping up its robotaxi ambitions. Investors shouldn’t be too concerned yet about this threat, though it is real. And if it hits its autonomy milestones, Tesla stock could be considered a buy at this price point. Although Tesla stock still trades at a premium, caution is warranted so I wouldn’t be picking up large tranches of shares just yet until it shows clear progress is being made.

Title: The big bills to watch as Colorado’s 2026 legislative session begins

Time Published: 2026-01-14T15:48:42Z

Colorado lawmakers will try to tackle some of the state’s most pressing issues during the 2026 legislative session, which starts Wednesday, from affordable housing and the high cost of health care to public safety and artificial intelligence. Any bills debated at the Capitol this year will come against the backdrop of a strained state budget. The legislature is facing a roughly $850 million shortfall, meaning there’s essentially no money to spend on new programs and services.Here are some of the big-ticket legislative items to keep tabs on during the 120-day lawmaking term. Democrats remain in control at the Capitol. They have big majorities in both the state House and Senate, and Democratic Gov. Jared Polis gets to decide which bills to veto. That means Democrats get to set the legislature’s priorities, and this year, Democratic leadership said their goal is to make Colorado more affordable. “We just really want to build upon what we’ve done already when it comes to increasing wages, when it comes to lowering costs — just creating pathways for families to be able to succeed and not have to worry so much about how they’re going to pay their medical bills or groceries,” said House Majority Leader Monica Duran, a Wheat Ridge Democrat. Duran said Democrats plan to take a multipronged approach to bringing down the cost of living, with bills to addressing health care premiums, homeowners insurance and property taxes. They also want to expand last year’s efforts to increase price transparency. Democrats plan to introduce several bills aimed at boosting Colorado’s affordable housing stock, setting up a familiar fight with local governments over land use.One of the most significant housing measures, called the HOME Act, would give qualifying affordable housing developers, public schools and universities the ability to bypass local zoning laws and build homes on their land. “We feel like, with those three entities in the bill, that we’re really going to capture a lot of folks who are already doing really good work in this space to bring about more supply and, further than that, affordable housing to our communities,” said state Rep. Andrew Boesenecker, a Fort Collins Democrat who is leading the legislation. The proposal — modeled in part on a bill that failed last year — has the support of Polis, who has made increasing housing inventory a top priority as he enters his last year in office. Another affordable housing bill Democrats plan to introduce this year would make it easier for homeowners to sell off a portion of their property. The proposal builds on legislation passed in 2024 that made it easier for Coloradans to build accessory dwelling units, also known as casitas, on their properties, and would apply to higher-density areas of the state, like the Denver metro area and in Grand Junction. Local governments are already opposing both bills. The Colorado Municipal League, which represents the interests of towns and cities at the state Capitol, argues the measures would undermine the rights of local communities to make decisions for themselves and could violate the constitutional self-governance powers of home rule cities. Democrats also want to make property insurance more affordable by creating programs to help people protect their homes against hail and wildfire, the two largest insurance cost drivers. The legislature tried to make that happen last year by imposing fees on policies to fund the mitigation initiatives, but the proposal was rejected over concerns about imposing new costs on consumers. House Speaker Julie McCluskie, a Dillon Democrat who is leading the effort, said she’s looking for a new funding mechanism. “I am pursuing something that will hopefully drive funding for those homeowners that are willing to harden their roofs,” she said. “We also want to pursue ways we can protect communities from catastrophic wildfire with either some type of reinsurance plan or deeper investments in mitigation.” Keeping health insurance premiums down is another central piece of Democrats’ affordability work this year and comes in response to congressional Republicans’ decision not to extend subsidies for Affordable Care Act plans. The legislature passed a one-year fix last summer, during the special legislative session. Lawmakers are now trying to figure out how to sustain those savings going forward. It’s proving difficult given the state’s budget constraints. “I don’t know what the specifics of the bill are going to look like at this point,” said state Rep. Kyle Brown, a Louisville Democrat. “We’ve been talking about different funding sources.” Brown said he’s optimistic that a wide range of perspectives have come to the table to develop a solution, from hospitals to insurance companies to consumer groups. House Democrats also plan to expand their work to increase transparency around consumer prices in an effort to prevent price gouging. Last year, they passed measures to crack down on price increases during natural disasters and outlaw undisclosed fees for goods and services, also called junk fees, especially when it comes to rental housing. Go deeper into this story in this episode of The Daily Sun-Up podcast. Subscribe: Apple | Spotify | RSS Now, they plan to introduce a bill that would require delivery services, like DoorDash and Instacart, to disclose when they charge more for items than they would cost a customer to purchase directly. Bill sponsor Rep. Yara Zokaie, D-Fort Collins, said the goal is to make it easier for consumers to find affordable options when shopping for groceries. “People are not able to really make an informed choice when they don’t know that they’re paying a markup,” Zokaie said. The bill also would put a cap on how much a business can charge “captive consumers” for an item. Captive consumers are those who have to buy an item from one specific seller. For example, when someone buys beer at a baseball game, the price is higher than it would be outside the stadium. Democrats’ bill would limit how much can be charged for a beer in a stadium relative to what it would cost in a more traditional setting, like a restaurant. Senate Majority Leader Robert Rodriguez, D-Denver, said lawmakers are also looking at ways to replace certain tax credits rolled back by the Trump administration. Given the political makeup of the legislature, Democrats do not need the support of Republicans to pass bills, and no GOP measures can pass without Democratic support. Still, the vast majority of legislation that becomes law in Colorado has bipartisan support. And affordability is an area where the two parties will work together. Senate Minority Leader Cleave Simpson, R-Alamosa, said his caucus will look for areas where it can find common ground with Democrats.“Making life more affordable,” Simpson said, summarizing the GOP’s big goal at the Capitol this year. The legislature is expected to take its third stab at revising a 2024 law that aims to prevent discrimination by artificial intelligence systems used by businesses and governments to make decisions in areas like hiring, education, health care and banking. Lawmakers delayed implementation of the law to June from February after they failed to broker a deal among consumer protection groups, unions and the business community — namely Big Tech — during the special session over the summer. They also tried and failed to reach an agreement on the policy during last year’s regular lawmaking term. As it is written now, the law will require companies to assess and disclose, to regulators and consumers, when AI is being used for consequential decisions, like employment, loans and housing. It will also require companies to explain how their technology works to consumers who dispute how AI made a determination. Those in the tech industry who develop AI tools have complained that the law will stifle innovation. Separately, companies that use AI products say the statute is too burdensome and will expose them to a great deal of liability. Rodriguez, the lawmaker most involved in the bill, suggested he won’t let changes to the AI law pass this year if they don’t offer enough protections to consumers. He thinks Colorado’s bill will become an example for other state legislatures, so he’s trying to be extra vigilant. “I don’t want to be the model bill that is not protective of consumers,” he said last week at The Colorado Sun’s legislative preview event. “That is a line that I’ve been really strong (on). Because once one bill is in, everybody starts running that. Are we actually doing the right thing to protect Coloradans and consumers across the country?” Rodriguez called AI the “industrial revolution in the technological age.” He said any tweaks to the law must include requirements that consumers be made aware when AI is used to make decisions about their health care, banking and hiring, and that consumers be given a chance to correct information and appeal. “Those are my core beliefs,” he said. “Everything inside of that I’m willing to negotiate.” Rodriguez said the governor’s latest task force of interest groups looking at the regulation was “in a good place” as of a few weeks ago. And Rodriguez is optimistic the law will take effect in June with changes. Polis said his concern is that Colorado will “go it alone” on AI regulation, which would discourage tech companies from operating in the state. “We’re not a big state,” he said. “So if we go more to what California has done or Texas has done, that would be one model. Ultimately, I do believe this will fall in Congress’ lap — and I hope that they take it on. The American people want to see protections, and we also want to make sure we’re a great country for innovation. But I think it’s very perilous for Colorado to do something that is different than either other states or the federal government, because, ultimately, consumers will be hurt in Colorado.” Adding another layer to the debate is the executive order signed by President Trump on Dec. 11 aimed at banning states from regulating AI by threatening lawsuits and funding cuts to states that don’t comply. AI will likely be one of the most-lobbied issues at the Capitol this year. A review of lobbying disclosures from the Secretary of State’s Office found that nearly half of the 182 companies and organizations that hired lobbyists to sway lawmakers on AI during the special session were from the health care and tech sectors, followed closely by investment, general business and telecommunications groups. Several other technology bills are also in the works. One measure will aim to require that social media sites and video games have privacy settings that can be set by parents and not easily turned off by kids. Zokaie, who is leading the bill, hopes the proposal will help prevent the platforms from promoting addictive or compulsory use or from becoming places where adult users can exploit children. “We’re not going to stop that from happening completely, no,” she said, “but the company is going to have a responsibility to show they took reasonable steps to prevent it from happening.” Social media companies generally oppose additional regulation and are expected to fight the bill. Two measures around data centers are also set to be introduced at the Capitol this year. One of the upcoming bills will be focused on the potential environmental impacts of data centers. It would require developers and the companies running the centers to be transparent about water and power usage. Bill sponsor Sen. Cathy Kipp, D-Fort Collins, said she wants the bill to also require that data centers use as much renewable energy as possible and prevent their energy usage from impacting the cost of utilities for the communities around them. A second data center bill that may be introduced would offer some incentives to businesses that build the massive facilities in Colorado. “It’s one of those things where business wants it and labor wants it, but then the environmentalists have concerns with it,” Rodriguez said. For the second year in a row, the Colorado labor movement will try to tweak the state’s labor laws to make it easier for unions to force all workers at a company to pay fees for collective bargaining representation — regardless of whether they are members of a union. A forthcoming bill, once again dubbed the Worker Protection Act by supporters, would repeal a requirement that a union get the approval of at least 75% of workers at a company before they can negotiate with a business over union security. Union security is the term for when workers are forced to pay fees for collective bargaining representation, even if they have not joined the union. Unions are required to bargain on behalf of all workers at a company which is why they feel it’s only fair that union security be imposed to cover the cost of things like lawyers and negotiating experts. Polis vetoed the same measure in 2025, and he said he’ll veto the 2026 version, too, if there aren’t major changes. He’s not willing to eliminate the union security vote altogether. “There’s nothing different, so I’m not quite sure why they’re doing it again,” Polis said. The governor said he is open to reducing the 75% threshold — a proposal labor leaders rejected — and he would be willing to negotiate a similar compromise with business groups if asked. Preventing the Worker Protection Act from passing is the top priority of business interests at the Capitol this year — just as it was in 2025 Democrats also plan to make energy and the environment priorities at the Capitol this year, though the details of their plans remain in flux. “You’re going to hear a lot about energy this session,” Polis said, “including making it easier to permit energy projects and get them done. One of the reasons we can’t have nice things is we don’t let them be built.” Some of those changes may be tied to a rewrite of the laws governing Colorado’s Public Utilities Commission, which oversees how much some consumers pay for things like electricity and natural gas. Another energy bill planned for this session is tied to Democrats’ affordability push. The proposal would require Colorado’s biggest energy providers, including Xcel Energy and Black Hills Energy, to provide electricity to low-income customers at a minimal cost. Under the bill, utility companies would have to provide these customers with enough electricity for basic needs and only charge them the cost of producing the energy without making a profit. Sponsors also want the bill to prevent the utility companies from increasing rates for other customers to make up for any losses in profit from the lower rates for low-income customers. House Minority Leader Jarvis Caldwell, a Colorado Springs Republican, said his caucus is concerned about the pace of the state’s climate and energy goals and how they could result in increased costs for consumers. “We’re really concerned about this 2050 goal for a 100% carbon emissions reduction being moved up to 2040, which when you talk to utility companies, they all say that, frankly, it’s undoable,” Caldwell said, referencing a rumor about Democrats’ environmental policy plans this year. “The result of it will be potentially doubling our utility bills within the next couple of years.” Another focus for Democrats will be responding to the Trump administration, particularly when it comes to federal immigration enforcement. State laws already prevent state and local officials in Colorado from sharing Coloradans’ personal information with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement unless it’s being used for a criminal investigation. But some lawmakers would like to tighten those limits. Last month, state Rep. Lorena Garcia, an Adams County Democrat, said she wants to strengthen existing state laws to ensure the liability extends “beyond just the individuals that might share public information, but it also extends to agencies that allow it to happen.” “We still have more work to do to protect our communities and protect individuals that are targeted by this lawless agency,” Garcia said, referring to ICE, on a call in December with reporters and state legislators from California, Illinois, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia. The existing laws are at the center of a lawsuit filed against Polis last year by a former state employee, Scott Moss. Moss says he was instructed by the governor’s office to turn over Coloradans’ personal information to ICE in response to an immigration enforcement subpoena from the agency. A state judge has blocked Polis from ordering certain state workers to hand over the requested personal information to ICE while the case is litigated. Lawmakers could also adopt ICE-related policies enacted in other states, like requiring agents to wear masks and clear identification. Democrats also plan to introduce bills to improve public safety and regulate law enforcement. One bill would require law enforcement to get a warrant before using the Flock Safety database in their investigations. Flock is a video surveillance network that includes license plate readers. Police say it helps them with investigations, but data privacy experts are concerned about misuse — including by federal immigration enforcement. The system has been used incorrectly in at least one high-profile case in Colorado. Another measure would require utilities to notify the public about planned power outages via phone calls or text messages, email and broadcasts on local radio and news stations. Supporters argue that early warnings are necessary for Coloradans to safely prepare for power outages, especially those who rely on electronic medical devices, and that alerts can give them time to make necessary preparations, like turning on a generator. The bill is in part a response to the death of a Delta woman who received no advance warning of a planned power shutoff and died when her medical equipment failed during the outage.A third bill, sponsored by Majority Leader Duran, would establish a statewide assessment protocol to help law enforcement identify domestic violence danger faster. One public safety issue that doesn’t appear to be on Democrats’ radar this year, after a series of major bills over the past decade, is guns.

Title: The Future of E-commerce: AI Shopping, Social Commerce, and Why Your Website Still Matters
URL: https://www.dreamhost.com/blog/future-of-ecommerce/
Time Published: 2026-01-14T15:00:00Z

Commerce is fragmenting across platforms, AI agents, and social feeds while customers expect seamless experiences everywhere. Platforms excel at discovery and impulse purchases, but websites remain the trust anchor for considered purchases and long-term relationships. Merchants who orchestrate all three channels — rather than betting everything on one — will capture more customers and keep more margin. Picture this: a frazzled parent types “Plan my kid’s birthday party under $300” into ChatGPT. Within seconds, they’ve got a theme, a supply list, and links to buy everything — cake topper, streamers, party favors, and bags — without ever typing a URL or landing on a homepage. Meanwhile, a 20-something scrolling TikTok at 11 p.m. watches a creator demo a skincare routine, taps “buy,” and has three products headed to their door before the video ends. These are hardly hypotheticals anymore. TikTok Shop hit $33.2 billion in global gross merchandise value (GMV) in 2024, with $9 billion from the U.S. alone: a 650% year-over-year explosion just 16 months after launch. The broader U.S. social commerce market has already reached $114.7 billion in 2025. And Morgan Stanley predicts that nearly half of U.S. online shoppers will be using AI shopping agents by 2030, potentially adding $115 billion to e-commerce. If you’re a merchant reading those numbers, you might feel the ground shifting beneath your carefully optimized product pages. Should you abandon your website and go all-in on social? Is your homepage about to become as relevant as a phone book? Well, here’s where things get interesting. DreamHost’s Local Business Trust Index found that shoppers are 7x more comfortable making purchases of $100 or more on a company’s website than through social media platforms. They’re also 14x more likely to spend $500+ on a website. And their average comfortable spending amount? Just $36 on social platforms, versus $177 on a website. So no, your website isn’t dead, but it might be changing jobs. Let’s unpack what’s happening and what it means for your online storefront. Two forces are reshaping how people buy things online: the explosive growth of social commerce and the emergence of AI shopping agents. Together, they’re creating a world where your next customer might discover, evaluate, and even purchase products without ever intentionally visiting your website. But there’s a persistent trust gap that keeps your owned digital presence more relevant than ever. The numbers show a fundamental shift in where commerce happens. While social commerce has been growing for years, AI shopping agents represent something newer, and potentially even more disruptive. On Black Friday 2025, AI-driven traffic to U.S. retail sites surged 805% year-over-year, helping drive $11.8 billion in online spending, a new record. The practical implications are significant. ChatGPT already has a Shopify integration for in-chat purchases. Amazon’s Rufus, Walmart’s Sparky, and Target’s ChatGPT integration are making AI-assisted shopping feel as natural as asking a store associate for help. Plus, AI browsers, like Perplexity’s Comet, let users drop in a grocery list and have the AI add everything to their cart automatically. Discovery, comparison, and increasingly even checkout are happening inside platforms and AI assistants — not on your homepage. But that’s only half the story. For all the excitement around social commerce and AI agents, there’s a fundamental asymmetry in where people are willing to spend serious money. When we conducted our Trust Index survey in November, our findings were striking: Social platforms are optimized for entertainment and discovery, not for detailed product information, clear return policies, and brand credibility signals that people need before making significant purchases. What does this mean for retailers? Platforms excel at getting you seen, but your site is still where serious spending and long-term trust live. When you cut through the noise, we see three shifts that will actually shape how you sell online in the next few years. Think of social commerce as window shopping on steroids, especially for Gen Z and younger millennials. The format rewards scrolling, discovery, and split-second purchase decisions. You see something interesting in a 30-second video, you tap buy, it shows up in three days —the friction between “that looks cool” and “I own it” has essentially disappeared. The platform isn’t replacing traditional e-commerce, but it is creating a new category: the ambient, entertainment-driven impulse buy. 👉What it means for e-commerce retailers: Use TikTok and Instagram as discovery engines and low-friction checkout points for products under $50: bundles, limited drops, trending items. This is your impulse shelf. For higher-value items, use social content strategically to nudge people back to your website, where they can explore your whole brand story, detailed product specifications, shipping policies, and authentic customer reviews. Subscribe now to receive all the latest updates, delivered directly to your inbox. AI shopping agents are essentially digital personal shoppers that can follow instructions, stick to budgets, compare options across multiple retailers, and even complete checkout. They’re moving from novelty to infrastructure faster than many merchants realize. The major players are already in the market: ChatGPT with Shopify integration, Amazon’s Rufus, Walmart’s Sparky, Target’s ChatGPT integration, and dedicated AI browsers like Perplexity’s Comet. These tools can create grocery lists, research products, compare prices, and automatically add items to carts. AI agents aren’t making emotional decisions or responding to flashy graphics. They’re optimizing for specific criteria. Here’s how agents choose which products to recommend: 👉What it means for e-commerce retailers: Make your catalog machine-readablewith special attention to your data hygiene. Fill in product attributes consistently (materials, sizing, compatibility), use descriptive, honest product titles, add structured data/schema markup, and answer common questions directly on product pages so AI has something trustworthy to quote. AI-native browsers and OS-level assistants are making commerce feel like a conversation rather than a destination. Comet lets users create a grocery list and have the AI add items to their Instacart cart automatically. OpenAI’s Atlas browser is built around the same premise: tell it what you need, and it handles the shopping. Meanwhile, retailer assistants like Rufus, Walmart’s AI tools, and Target’s ChatGPT integration are making checkout feel like one tap from anywhere. The boundary between “browsing the internet” and “shopping” is dissolving. 👉What it means for e-commerce retailers: Customers might first encounter your brand inside someone else’s interface, like an AI chat, a voice assistant, or a browser sidebar. This changes what they see first, but not what matters: In light of all of this, do you need to reframe what your website actually does? Maybe. Your site is no longer just an “online store”. Now, it’s the source of truth for everything else in your commerce ecosystem. Your website is the authoritative answer to every question an AI agent, comparison shopper, or cautious buyer might ask. Materials? Dimensions? Return window? Warranty? When an AI is deciding whether to recommend your product, it’s pulling from your product pages. When a customer is deciding whether $200 is worth it, they’re checking your site for reassurance. Social platforms and AI agents can introduce people to your brand. Your website is where they come to validate what they discovered. Customer reviews, testimonials, your origin story, your values — these live on your site. This might be the most important function of all. When someone buys through TikTok Shop or an AI agent’s recommendation, you get a transaction. When they buy through your website, you get a relationship: email addresses, purchase history, preferences, and browsing behavior. This is data no platform can take away, and no algorithm change can erase. Big-ticket purchases and long-term relationships still consolidate on websites. Social and AI channels are discovery mechanisms; your site is where commitment happens, and you can map the entire customer journey. At DreamHost, we’ve been championing website ownership for over 27 years. Owning your site is how you maintain control of your brand, data, and margins while the rest of the internet experiments with new ways to shop, and while the internet becomes increasingly subscription-based, we’re advocating more than ever for the open web. So how should e-commerce merchants navigate this new landscape as it emerges? Here’s a four-step framework you can use. Before chasing new channels, make sure your foundation is solid. Make your site the strongest version of itself: fast, mobile-friendly, and clear. Add reviews. Publish detailed policies. Provide content that answers questions before shoppers ask them. Each improvement compounds your trust advantage, and helps both humans and algorithms see your store as credible. The fear of missing out on TikTok Shop or Instagram Shopping is real. But the merchants who succeed with social commerce treat it strategically. Pick one or two platforms where your audience already lives. Test product angles, creator partnerships, bundles, and price points. Let social give you rapid consumer insight, but don’t rely on it for long-term stability. Preparing your store for AI shopping agents doesn’t require technical expertise. It requires discipline and consistency. Think of it as giving AI a clean transcript of your store, so agents can understand and represent your products accurately. If you’ve been in e-commerce for more than a few years, you’ve seen platforms change their rules overnight. Algorithm updates, policy shifts, regulatory uncertainty — any single channel can become unreliable with little warning. Here’s how to protect yourself: Every few months, there’s a new platform, a new AI integration, a new commerce channel that everyone insists you need to be on immediately or risk irrelevance. Here’s a checklist for cutting through the hype. Before jumping on any new platform or tool, ask yourself: The merchants who thrive in rapidly changing environments aren’t the ones who chase every trend. They’re the ones who test intelligently, measure honestly, and know when to double down versus when to walk away. AI agents and social commerce will increasingly handle discovery and low-friction purchases. That’s not a threat — it’s a distribution opportunity. New channels mean new ways for customers to find you, new moments to capture attention, and new paths to purchase. But websites remain the trust anchor, the data source, and the place where real customer relationships live. When someone’s deciding whether to spend $200, they’re not doing it in a TikTok comment section. When they want to understand your brand, read reviews from people like them, or know exactly what they’re getting — they come to your site. Owning your site isn’t about resisting change. It’s about having a home base while you explore what’s next — keeping control of your brand, data, and margins while the rest of the internet experiments with new ways to shop. Sell anything, anywhere, anytime on the world’s biggest online store platform. John Robison John is the Director of Product (WordPress) at DreamHost.

Title: Just One Major AI GPU Lineup To Consume As Much Memory This Year As 100-150 Million Smartphones, Contributing To $100-$150 Per Unit Price Hikes From Apple And Samsung

NVIDIA's architectural design changes with its new Vera Rubin GPUs will consume a significant proportion of global memory resources this year, when such resources are already in short supply, worsening the memory crunch for all smartphone OEMs, including giants such as Apple and Samsung. These firms would likely have to raise the prices of their 2026-launching smartphones to compensate for the ongoing price-led demand destruction in the memory sphere, as per a new note from KeyBanc. NVIDIA has implemented a number of AI-critical design changes in its new Vera Rubin AI GPUs, which serve to further restrict the already-constrained global memory market and create far-reaching turbulence even for some of the globe's industrial titans such as Apple and Samsung. AI query processing creates a huge temporary memory log for context building purposes, aptly called the KV Cache. For NVIDIA's AI systems, this memory log is currently stored within the high bandwidth memory (HBM) modules. However, with its Vera Rubin AI GPUs, NVIDIA is implementing a new solution, called the Inference Memory Context Storage (ICMS), which will act as a dedicated memory resource for the KV Cache. As we noted in a dedicated post recently, this solution means NVIDIA could pack around 16 TB of NAND per GPU in a rack, which equates to 1,152 TB in a single NVL72 configuration. Now, KeyBanc has added additional color to this critical context by noting that NVIDIA's new AI GPUs could consume as much memory this year as between 100 million to 150 million smartphones, equating to around 10 percent of the global smartphone market: "NVIDIA’s (NVDA) latest Vera CPU utilizes 1.5TB of memory—up from Grace’s 512GB—implying that NVIDIA will require 20 billion gigabits (Gb) of memory this year. This consumption is equivalent to 100–150 million smartphones, or just under 10% of the total smartphone market." These dynamics are worsening the overall situation even for tech titans such as Apple and Samsung. For instance, we reported recently that while Apple has secured access to sufficient NAND resources through the first quarter of 2026, KIOXIA was expected to raise its pricing for Apple once a long-term NAND supply agreement is signed, as per an assessment by Morgan Stanley. Of course, DRAM constitutes an even bigger bottleneck for Apple, especially as Apple had previously secured access to DRAM under very favorable long-term contracts. As such, Morgan Stanley now expects Apple to secure access to DRAM resources through Q1 2026 only with a sequential price hike of over 50 percent. To make matters worse, Apple is experiencing upheaval within other sections of its sprawling supply chain. According to a new Nikkei Asia report, the Cupertino giant is reportedly struggling to secure sufficient supplies of high-end glass fiber cloth (T-glass). For the benefit of those who might not be aware, a substrate serves as the base on which Integrated Circuits (ICs) and other components are placed, while also playing a critical role in heat dissipation.A T-glass, on the other hand, is a special fiberglass with a high silica content that is often used within the substrate for microchips, providing a myriad of benefits, including better thermal stability, a flatter surface for intricate wiring, and higher reliability. Apple purchases almost all of its T-glass from Japan's Nitto Boseki (Nittobo). However, AI-related demand has reportedly exhausted Nittobo's existing supply capacity, forcing Apple to directly approach the Japanese government for assistance in securing enough T-glass supply. The Cupertino giant is also trying to secure its T-glass from alternative sources, including Mitsubishi Gas Chemical, which also relies on Nittobo's T-glass. In the interim, Apple is reportedly mulling using a lower-quality T-glass, but such a move would require extensive prior testing. Samsung's DS division has recently raised the price of DRAM supplied to Samsung's MX division by about 60–70%.They’re pushing such an absurd condition even on MX, which is part of the same family— so just imagine how much they’re raising prices for other companies.I think the… Interestingly, even Samsung, which produces its own memory, is not immune to the ongoing demand-destruction-via-price-hikes dynamics in the memory sphere. As per anecdotal reports, Samsung's DS division, which produces memory chips, has agreed to provide those chips to Samsung's MX mobile division only at price hikes of around 60 percent to 70 percent. The situation has prompted Samsung to raise the price of its upcoming Galaxy S26 series by between $30 and $60 in select regions, including its home market of South Korea. On the whole, given the fact that memory accounts for around 20 percent of a given smartphone's Bill of Materials (BOM), KeyBanc analysts believe that OEMs like Samsung and Apple "may need to raise handset prices by $100–$150, which could negatively weigh on demand."

Title: JPMorgan CEO and CFO: Staying competitive requires investment

Good morning. Earnings season is underway. JPMorgan Chase reported fourth-quarter 2025 earnings on Tuesday, with investors looking past solid headline results to focus on higher expected costs and a one-time reserve tied to the Apple Card deal, sending shares modestly lower. The bank posted net income of $13 billion, down 7% from a year earlier due to a $2.2 billion pre-tax credit reserve build related to its pending acquisition of the Apple Card portfolio from Goldman Sachs. Revenue rose 7% to $46.8 billion, while net interest income climbed 7% to $25.1 billion, driven by higher revolving credit card balances and improved deposit margins. Morningstar Director Sean Dunlop wrote in a note on Tuesday that as the first bank to report results and the largest bank in the U.S., JPMorgan’s earnings serve as “a barometer of consumer, corporate, and financial system health.” He added that JPMorgan’s “broad-based revenue growth suggests all three remain in good shape, though management’s tone and excess reserves point to a cautious outlook beyond 2026.” Dunlop raised his fair value estimate for JPM shares to $289 from $259, while still viewing the stock as expensive. CFO Jeremy Barnum said on the earnings call that consumers and small businesses remain resilient. JPMorgan projected 2026 expenses of about $105 billion, with Barnum describing the increase as a function of structural optimism and the need to invest to stay ahead. “More generally, the environment is only getting more competitive, and so it remains critical to ensure that we are making the necessary investments to secure our position against both traditional and non-traditional competitors,” he explained. During the Q&A session, CEO Jamie Dimon said higher spending, including on technology and AI, is necessary to compete with fintechs such as Revolut and SoFi, as well as established financial firms like Charles Schwab. “These are good players,” Dimon said to analysts on the call. “We analyze what they do and how they do it… We are going to stay out front — so help us God. We’re not going to try to meet some expense target and then 10 years from now you’d be asking us the question, ‘How did JPMorgan get left behind?’” Barnum also warned that President Donald Trump’s proposal to cap credit card interest rates at 10% would likely reduce access to credit rather than help consumers, arguing that intense competition already compresses margins and that price controls would force broad lending cutbacks — especially for higher-risk borrowers. Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.com Betsabe Botaitis was appointed CFO of P2P.org, a non-custodial institutional staking provider. Botaitis brings over 20 years of leadership across financial services, fintech, and Web3, with experience building governance and operations in high-growth organizations. Most recently, Botaitis served as CFO and treasurer at Hedera. Botaitis' career spans both traditional financial institutions and crypto-native organizations. She began in retail banking before holding senior finance roles at Citigroup and LendingClub, and later co-founding and serving as CFO of a blockchain company. Julie Feder was appointed CFO of Obsidian Therapeutics, Inc., a clinical-stage biotechnology company. Feder brings over 20 years of strategic finance experience in life sciences and health care. Feder joins Obsidian from Aura Biosciences, where she served as CFO for six years. Before Aura, she was CFO at Verastem. Before that, Feder spent six years at the Clinton Health Access Initiative, Inc., as CFO. Global law firm Hogan Lovells has published its Employment Horizons for 2026 report. The firm analyzes the most pressing issues impacting employers worldwide. This year's report examines emerging developments such as new rules on AI and data use in the workplace, shifting protections for vulnerable workers, evolving pay transparency requirements, changes to working time and family‑friendly policies, and renewed scrutiny of non‑compete agreements. AI is speeding up a big change in the job market: instead of hiring mainly for job titles, employers are increasingly hiring for skills, according to a new report. Wharton and Accenture created the Wharton-Accenture Skills Index (WAsX), a regular, data-based measure that shows which skills are valuable, which are not, and how fast these priorities are changing over time. In the report, an analysis finds that generalist skills like communication and leadership are oversupplied, while technical, analytical, and execution-focused skills remain scarce. Another finding is that skills have price tags—but value is contextual. For example, “strategic analysis” is linked to an $8,000 increase in annual pay for sales representatives, but a $10,000 decrease for validation engineers. AI is reducing demand for routine cognitive work (writing, basic analysis) while increasing demand for operations, compliance, and judgment-based skills. "Companies like ours think in terms of occasions because, simply, that’s when we do our business — when people come together, it’s often a moment for a tall, frosty beer, whether with or without alcohol." —Rahul Goyal, president and CEO of Molson Coors Beverage Company, writes in a Fortune opinion piece.

Investing Stocks were walloped on Tuesday after JPMorgan missed analysts’ fourth-quarter earnings estimates. The good news on Tuesday was the December consumer price index report that showed inflation hitting the 2.7% target, while core inflation came in below estimates at 2.6% Investors will be watching the other big banks that will report this week after the somewhat worrisome JPMorgan print. Sending You to Google News in 3 © Thinkstock Futures are trading lower after the January rally hit a wall on Wednesday, with all major indices falling, and the selling looks set to continue today. The main culprit yesterday was JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM) shares, which took a hit after missing analyst estimates for the quarter. The banking giant posted $4.63 per share, below the expected $4.86, primarily due to a surprise decline in investment banking fees and costs associated with the Apple Card portfolio. Revenue slightly beat expectations, and trading and net interest income showed strength, making it a mixed report. That noted, the bank was priced to perfection, so the sellers traded on the print, especially after Jamie Dimon warned of risks. The Dow Jones Industrials took the biggest shot Tuesday, closing down 0.88% at 49,191, led by JPMorgan’s decline. The S&P 500 closed 0.19% lower at 6,963, while the Nasdaq finished 0.10% lower at 23,709. The Russell 2000, which has been on a roll in 2026, closed at 2,632, down 0.11%. Yields were mixed across the Treasury curve on Tuesday, with buyers leaning to the middle and longer maturities, while there was some selling in the short-term T-bills. The positive news on inflation overshadowed the feud between President Trump and Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell, as well as the Justice Department’s subpoenas. The 30-year-long bond finished trading on Tuesday at 4.83%, while the benchmark 10-year note was last seen at 4.18% Energy stocks were the big winners as prices were higher across the energy complex on Tuesday. Prices for the major benchmarks rose primarily due to escalating geopolitical tensions surrounding Iran, with concerns about potential supply disruptions outweighing increased supply prospects from Venezuela following President Trump’s threat of a 25% tariff on countries trading with Iran, which could start impacting global supply routes. Brent Crude finished the session at $65.38, up 2.36%, while West Texas Intermediate closed at $61.02, up 2.55%. Natural gas ended the day flat at $3.42. After a solid rally to start the day and new record highs, Gold reversed midday and ended the day 0.25% lower at $4,586. The likely reason for the slight pullback was profit-taking. Still, sales were limited by ongoing geopolitical tensions with Iran and by uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration’s new investigation into the Fed. The weaker-than-expected US inflation report also supported expectations of potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, which typically benefit gold and will likely do so going forward. Silver continued to march higher, finishing the day at $86.80, up 1.95%. The cryptocurrency market saw broad gains, with major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum rising, supported by positive regulatory news and resumed institutional inflows, as the overall crypto market capitalization rose back over $3.2 trillion. Senator Tim Scott released a draft of the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, which aims to provide more explicit rules for digital assets, and that was perceived positively by traders. At 8A EST, Bitcoin traded at $94,990, while Ethereum was quoted at $3,293. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports daily to identify new investment ideas for both investors and traders.

Title: Welcome to the era of the megamanager

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The great middle manager flattening is in full swing, and those who remain are seeing their dominions balloon. It's the era of the megamanager, driven by cost cutting, leaner bureaucracy, and slow hiring. A new Gallup survey reveals how teams are evolving and the factors that contribute to manager burnout. Managers' average number of reports — their "span of control" — has grown over the past year, rising from 10.9 in 2024 to 12.1 in 2025. It's also a marked increase from pre-pandemic levels; in 2013, managers had an average of 8.2 people reporting to them, and by 2019, this number had increased to around 9. Are you a manager with 25 or more direct reports, or have been asked to take on more reports in the "Great Flattening?" Contact this reporter at jkaplan@businessinsider.com. That's driven primarily by an increase in teams with 25 or more people, which saw a two percentage point rise over the past year. Around 13% of managers have 25 or more direct reports. At the same time, 97% of managers are taking on individual contributor work that falls outside of their leadership purview. "I don't think increasing span of control blindly is going to work very effectively if those conditions aren't taken into account," Jim Harter, Gallup's chief scientist of workplace management and well-being, said of the balance between individual contributor tasks and leadership responsibilities.

In recent years, layoffs at firms like Intel, Amazon, and Meta have trimmed middle managers to rectify what they viewed as excessive layers of bureaucracy. "Having fewer managers will remove layers and flatten organizations more than they are today," Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote in a 2024 memo. "If we do this work well, it will increase our teammates' ability to move fast, clarify and invigorate their sense of ownership." Flattening management layers is a concept that experts previously told Business Insider is sound, provided that remaining managers have support, training, and the right mix of responsibilities. In 2024, Yvonne Lee-Hawkins, a middle manager, told Business Insider that she had gone from managing zero to 21 direct reports and ultimately quit due to burnout. "Our meetings became transactional because we only had time to discuss the most urgent issues," Lee-Hawkins said. "We no longer had time to get to know each other, ask questions, seek advice, or work on career development." What's key in trimming layers, as the Gallup survey illustrates, is how engaged workers already feel, and how these new megamanagers spend their time. For instance, managers who spend less time on individual contributor work — tasks outside their leadership duties — typically have more engaged teams, regardless of the team's size. "When you have employees increasingly detached from their employer, and then you suddenly start increasing span of control without putting the right conditions in place, I think you run a risk because they're already increasingly feeling detached," Harter said. "We found that managers that have at least one weekly meaningful conversation with each employee do substantially better." Tanuj Deora, a Gen X vice president for deployment at clean energy firm Sparkfund, said that the trend around being more "thoughtful" about bureaucratic structure within companies has value. He's held management roles since the late 1990s, advising on structures for teams of up to 50. He said it's essential to consider a manager's level of experience. "If they're relatively new managers, you probably want to give them five or six people. You want to give them a couple of people," Deora said. Gallup's Harter said that there are often two reasons someone becomes a manager: They're a strong individual contributor, or they have a long tenure at their company. However, neither of those factors necessarily relates to how effective they'll be in a managerial role. "What happens is in organizations, people stay a while, and they feel a need to promote people continually. And the avenue for promotion tends to be, we're going to give you a managerial role because it tends to be associated with more money and status," Harter said. "I would say the most effective organizations think about how they create high-status individual contributor roles so that people don't feel like they have to become a manager to be effective."

Title: The 3 main storylines investors need to be watching as earnings season picks up steam

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Earnings season kicked off with a bang on Tuesday with a report from headliner JPMorgan. The company's stock ultimately fell 4% due to a mix of two factors unique to the business: (1) a surprise drop in investment banking revenue and (2) uncertainty around President Trump's proposed credit card interest cap, to which JPMorgan is especially exposed as America's largest issuer. It was a good primer for the upcoming earnings season, which could make or break the fortunes of major US companies, especially when it comes to AI plans. The previous quarter already saw a simmering of the red-hot AI trade for companies planning to continue spending heavily on capex without immediate tangible results. Just ask Meta and Microsoft how it went when they pledged to keep pouring billions into AI (spoiler alert: not well). With that in mind, First Trade — with the help of the equity strategy team at Goldman Sachs — has put together a three-part earnings primer for those looking to gain an edge up.

Watch for signs of AI-adoption progress So far, in the AI trade, it's been the infrastructure stocks that have dominated — the chipmakers and picks-and-shovels companies that make up the physical components of data centers. Goldman says that gains will broaden out to increasingly include companies showing productivity gains unlocked by AI. A prime example of this dynamic in action came last quarter, from freight-logistics company CH Robinson, which raised its profit-growth forecast specifically due to new AI efficiencies. The stock spiked 20% during the next trading day, and it's been at record highs pretty much ever since. The market is being clear about what it wants. Actually achieving that is the hard part. 2. Monitor how companies are planning to spend their cash Concerns over AI overspending reached a fever pitch last quarter — a trend Goldman expects to subside throughout 2026 after one last hurrah. The firm predicts that hyperscaler capex will see above-forecast growth for one more quarter, then begin a gradual deceleration, as shown in this chart: An additional element to watch is the degree to which that AI capex spending comes at the expense of share repurchases. After all, buybacks are crucial for engineering share-price increases during periods devoid of other positive catalysts. Goldman predicts that investors will reward companies generating strong free cash flow, which have the flexibility to return cash to shareholders. The firm says that group of stocks already outperformed throughout 2025. 3. Check the sustainability of earnings growth for mega-cap tech The number to watch here is 20%. That's the target Goldman has set for Magnificent 7 profit expansion in the quarter. Any downside disappointment here could mean stock declines. After all, earnings growth is the lifeblood of any bull market. Jump to

Title: Goldman Sachs breaks down what the doomsayers get wrong about the US economy in 8 charts

Every time Alex publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. American investors are worried. They've been worried for a while now: that a recession is coming, that stock valuations are overheated, and that AI spending is the only thing keeping the economy (and markets) afloat. And if you're in the wealth management business, like Goldman Sachs, it's your job to listen to these concerns. To nod solemnly and empathize as your millionaire clients lay bare their greatest fears. And then it's your job to tell them that, actually, things aren't so bad, and despite all the apparent chaos out there, it would be quite unwise to cash out your chips in the US stock market. Goldman Sachs' wealth management unit did just that Monday, sending out a report to clients saying that the outlook for the US economy and stock market is bright — and that most of the concerns keeping investors awake at night are overblown. "Clients — and also some colleagues — are now asking whether it is time to reduce exposure to US equities in favor of other developed and emerging markets," the firm's Investment Strategy Group wrote in its 2026 outlook report. But it concludes that many of the perceived risks dominating conversations these days — from tariffs to government dysfunction to market concentration — are overstated, and that the most significant risk for equities, a US recession, is unlikely. The group puts the probability of a recession at 25%, down from last year's estimate of around 35%. Instead, Goldman's base-case projection calls for continued economic expansion and robust earnings growth for the S&P 500. "We wanted to emphasize that in spite of all the headlines that you read about 'Is America on the decline?' et cetera, we want to make a very strong stand and say, 'No, that is not the case,'" Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, Chief Investment Officer of the Investment Strategy Group, said in a media appearance for the report's release. The US remains the preeminent destination for investors around the world, Mossavar-Rahmani said — and a "surprising" number of popular narratives miss what's actually driving growth and returns. "We want to dispel a couple of myths," Mossavar-Rahmani said. Here are some of the other takeaways from Goldman's Investment Strategy Group, and what they're telling wealthy clients to do with their money in 2026. Goldman's team argues that "US preeminence" is evident across multiple measures, including economic wealth, labor productivity, deep capital markets, and natural resources — advantages they say are difficult for other major economies to match. They also point to US leadership in key innovation areas, including semiconductors, biotechnology, and AI, as well as the scale and liquidity of US equity and bond markets. Despite political turmoil and tariff uncertainty, Goldman says the US remains a magnet for global capital. "When people say, 'Oh, money's flowing out of the US.' It actually isn't. We had one month when that was the case," Mossavar-Rahmani said. That month of outflows came last April, in the aftermath of Trump's Liberation Day tariff plan announcement. Since then, foreign investors have flooded back into the US. One argument for US economic fragility is that the boom in AI-adjacent tech spending — including data centers, chips, and power infrastructure — is propping up GDP. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, which has a more dour global economic outlook, estimated the US would have been in a recession in the first half of last year if not for AI investments. A report from Deutsche Bank shows they're not alone in that sentiment. But Goldman says that view is off base, and that people underestimate how much consumption contributes to GDP. The bank's investment strategy group estimates all tech-related spending accounted for 0.5% of the 2.1% GDP growth in 2025, and Goldman's chief economist says AI capital expenditures accounted for just 0.1%. The estimate, which "includes everything related to AI, including data centers," Mossavar-Rahmani said, is "probably a little bit on the high side because they're trying to include all the power generation as well, all the utility infrastructure that has benefits elsewhere other than just AI." This dovetails with the myth that the US stock market is dependent on AI and the Magnificent Seven stocks (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla), according to Mossavar-Rahmani. "It's just not correct that AI has driven everything in the US, including all earnings and including S&P 500 returns," Mossavar-Rahmani said. While no one disputes the incredible performance of these tech titans, Goldman contends that the rest of the S&P 500 receives short shrift and that earnings growth and returns remain respectable even after stripping out the contributions from the Magnificent Seven. "This idea that it would be a poor economy, a weak economy, no earnings, no returns is again, just another falsehood," Mossavar-Rahmani said. The S&P 500 hit record highs last year, and investors often worry that new highs mean a painful drop is imminent. In reality, history shows that the market usually continues to post robust gains after hitting an all-time high, Goldman notes. While Goldman acknowledges valuations are elevated, it doesn't see an overheated market reminiscent of past market bubbles. It expects the S&P 500 to continue its rise in 2026, with a base-case estimate of a 7% total return and 10% earnings growth. Goldman's "good" scenario assumes a 17% return; its "bad" scenario assumes a 15% decline in a recession. (The team assigns a higher probability to upside than downside.) "We do think that there are some good fundamental reasons why valuations have increased over time that are not just because of speculative excesses," said Brett Nelson, head of tactical asset allocation within Goldman's investment strategy group. In the run-up to the Dot Com bust at the turn of the century, for example, valuations and investor exuberance were divorced from earnings reality, which isn't the case today. Yes, the S&P 500 is highly concentrated, Goldman says, but today's tech companies have enormous profit margins justifying their stock valuations, not just hype. Goldman isn't worried about a bubble in US equities. Where its investment strategists do see cause for concern is bitcoin. "We do think bitcoin is a bubble," Mossavar-Rahmani said, noting that explosive price behavior in the cryptocurrency usually precedes a steep drawdown. "We are even more convinced than we were in 2021 that bitcoin has no real value, that it is a speculative and trading asset and that only questionable practices support its current price," the 2026 outlook report says. Another area of concern is gold, which is at unsustainable price levels unless central banks — especially the Chinese government and households — continue to buy it to prop it up, Mossavar-Rahmani said. "We do not recommend clients use gold or bitcoin as a hedge in their portfolios," the report says. There are also "pockets of euphoria" in generative AI, with some public and private companies carrying bubble-like valuations, according to Goldman's outlook, which calls out the circular financing, easy credit, and questionable economics, coupled with soaring expectations. "Some AI company founders and CEOs of the major companies involved with AI have raised expectations to an unrealistic level about what AI will deliver in the near future in terms of both revenues for the AI companies and productivity gains for enterprises leveraging AI," the report says.

The Menlo Park-based company announced the layoffs Tuesday morning in an internal memo from Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth first seen by Bloomberg. Earlier reporting from the paper cites estimates that Reality Labs employs about 15,000 workers, making the cuts roughly 10% of the division's workforce. “We said last month that we were shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward Wearables,” Meta spokesperson Tracy Clayton wrote in a statement to state press outlet SFGate. The move was a “part of that effort,” and Meta plans to “reinvest the savings to support the growth of wearables this year,” Clayton added. Meta’s cuts arrive as the first major tech layoff of 2026, after large workforce reductions tapered off late last year. In November 2022, Meta cut about 11,000 employees in one of the largest layoffs in its history, while CEO Mark Zuckerberg simultaneously reaffirmed the company’s long-term commitment to the metaverse. The move exposed early tension between Reality Labs’ mounting losses and investor pressure for efficiency, even as Meta insisted the strategy remained intact. By the end of the same year, Meta’s metaverse push appeared to struggle due to weak user adoption, unclear consumer demand, and the growing financial drag of Reality Labs. As capital tightened and interest rates rose, the scale of the bet became harder to justify, setting the stage for the company’s current shift away from its previously heavy metaverse investment. Still, the roughly 1,000 roles being eliminated in Reality Labs represent a small fraction of the roughly 154,000 technology job losses recorded across 2025, according to data from Challenger, Gray & Christmas. “Technology has been pivoting to both developing and implementing artificial intelligence much more quickly than any other industry. This, coupled with over-hiring over the last decade, created a wave of job loss in the industry,” the research firm wrote. The tech sector led all private industries in layoffs last year, with job cuts rising 15% from 2024. Industry data compiled by Layoffs.fyi show that tech layoffs fell sharply into late 2025, dropping from 18,510 in October to 8,932 in November and to around 300 in December, as large, headline-scale workforce reductions tapered off heading into year-end. Among its FAANG peers, Meta’s move appears modest in scale. Amazon accounted for the largest workforce reductions within the group over the past year, cutting tens of thousands of roles across retail, devices, and AWS through multiple rounds, per layoff data sourced from public reports. Google and Microsoft implemented smaller but recurring layoffs, generally in the low thousands per round, tied to cost controls and AI-driven restructuring, while continuing to hire selectively in priority areas. Apple largely avoided mass layoffs, relying instead on attrition and slower hiring, while Netflix made limited cuts, typically numbering in the hundreds, as it adjusted operations following changes to its password-sharing model. Records on the California Employment Development Department do not yet show that a worker adjustment and retraining notice (WARN) attributed to Meta has been filed as of Wednesday morning, per Decrypt's review. The EDD “has not received any WARN notices from Meta,” a spokesperson told Decrypt after confirming with their WARN unit. Decrypt has reached out to Meta and will update this story should they respond.

Title: What Did Workers Have to Say in 2025?

Michigan’s Labor Legacy sculpture (detail), Hart Plaza, Detroit. Photo: Jeffrey St. Clair. Despite experiencing the harm of corporate greed and our collapsing social safety net firsthand, workers remain underrepresented in mainstream media. Here at Inequality.org we do our best to counteract that blind spot by publishing pieces with worker voices front and center. Not only do we give workers a platform to voice their perspectives, but we also help disseminate their opinions to newspapers and other media across America through our OtherWords editorial service. Below is a selection of the worker perspectives we published in 2025. If you’re also a worker interested in sharing your thoughts, don’t hesitate to get in touch with us at inequality@ips-dc.org. Jaz Brisack’s 2025 book “Get on the Job and Organize” traces the labor organizer’s experience from Nissan plants in the South to forming part of the nucleus taking on Starbucks to fighting for a union at Tesla. Inequality.org managing editor Chris Mills Rodrigo spoke with Brisack to discuss key takeaways from those hugely important campaigns and the path forward for the labor movement. The anti-union playbook is well rehearsed at this point: sow uncertainty among workers with propaganda and promises that employers will listen, as long as a union doesn’t get in the way. But even if workers successfully win an election, companies have a trump card in their back pockets: delay a first contract as long as possible. Registered nurses Sarah Johnson and Jason Fratangelo have experienced that tactic firsthand. Since winning an election at Michigan’s Corewell Health East in 2024, the company has used every excuse in the book to delay contract negotiations. That’s why Johnson and Fratangelo wrote a piece supporting the Faster Labor Contracts Act, which would require employers to come to the bargaining table after just 20 days. Speaking of delaying contract bargaining, that’s just what Amazon has done since workers at the company’s JFK8 facility in Staten Island shocked the country by voting to unionize in 2021. Despite the company’s intransigence, the union at the warehouse — now affiliated with the Teamsters — has been giving a critical voice to workers. When the bosses refused to do anything about a sewage leak at the facility last August, Yackisha Nebot Lopez and other workers successfully organized to demand to be sent home with pay. Assaults on worker rights came from all sides in 2025. Fran Marion, a fast food worker and organizer, detailed how a plan from Missouri lawmakers to redistrict the state would suppress working-class participation in elections and facilitate the roll-back of hard-fought labor wins. “We were already living in modern-day economic slavery,” Marion wrote. “Now they’re trying to put us in political slavery too. But we won’t let them.” When Flequer Vera was thinking about starting a business, he was worried about replicating the same economic system that he’d struggled through as a migrant worker years earlier. Inspired by a trip to Spain’s Basque Country, Vera opted for a cooperative model. The company he helped found, Sustainergy, has helped retrofit thousands of homes in the Cincinnati area to be more energy efficient. But the primary success of Sustainergy for Vera has been the family-sustaining jobs that the work has supported. Janeé Roberts was first introduced to working at Amazon via her mother, who operated a forklift at the company’s MEM6 warehouse in Mississippi. When Roberts’ mom had an aneurysm on the job, Amazon did nothing to support her recovery. Now Janeé is an organizer with the union at Amazon’s DCK6 location in San Francisco fighting for every other worker who has suffered on the job with little to no support from one of the world’s richest companies. Federal workers were the canary in the coal mine for the second Trump administration’s full frontal assault on labor rights. Before DOGE eliminated her job, Sabrina Valenti was working on coastal restoration at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to protect communities from hurricanes up until the beginning of 2025. With mass layoffs at her organization and spending cuts across the board, Valenti warns that future hurricane seasons could be even more threatening. Another federal worker who shared a personal story through Inequality.org this year was Paul Osadebe, an attorney at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Osadebe pleaded with his fellow federal workers to stay on the job as long as they could because of the critical services they provide to Americans. Later in the year, Osadebe was fired after blowing the whistle on Trump political appointees at HUD who had made it nearly impossible to effectively enforce the Fair Housing Act. Even after the infamous Wells Fargo “fake accounts” scandal of 2016, Kieran Cuadras continued to observe recklessness aimed at squeezing the bank’s employees and consumers to pump up executive paychecks. In this op-ed, the former Wells Fargo internal misconduct investigator calls for taxes on excessive CEO compensation to encourage more equitable corporate practices. Our nation’s leaders, says Cuadras, need to “do something about a CEO pay system that rewards executives with obscenely large paychecks for practices that harm workers and the broader economy.” Organizing Amazon, now America’s second-largest private employer, has been a primary goal of the labor movement. Reverend Ryan Brown was a key figure in an independent campaign to organize a warehouse in North Carolina. Before their union vote, Brown wrote for Inequality.org about the massive anti-union and surveillance campaign that Amazon was waging at his workplace. Despite losing the election this time around, workers at RDU1 outside of Raleigh and across the country are not stepping down. Worker struggles are of course not limited to this country. In February, Abiramy Sivalogananthan of the Asia Floor Wage Alliance wrote for us about a new campaign from garment workers in the Global South to improve working conditions and hold the American companies pulling in billions from exploitation accountable. Over 1,000 workers have called on their allies in the U.S. to sign onto their campaign. Child care teacher Rita Bee shared one of the bright spots of the year — New Mexico’s adoption of universal, no-cost child care. Families will save an average of $12,000 per year — a true game-changer for low-income households in one of the country’s poorest states. The state is funding the program through taxes on oil and gas extraction from public lands. “Taking care of our children and setting them up for success is the best thing we can do for our families, our communities, and our nation,” Bee wrote. This first appeared on Inequality.org. Sarah Anderson directs the Global Economy Project and co-edits Inequality.org at the Institute for Policy Studies.

The firm will supply and instal 3,263 off-grid DC solar photovoltaic water pumping systems under the PM-KUSUM B Scheme India’s fiscal policy set to stop being contractionary… The Ministry of Finance is set to unveil its budget for FY2026-27 on 1 February 2026, and this budget comes in the light of the Finance Ministry being reasonably well placed to hit its fiscal deficit target of 4.4% of GDP, despite a low nominal GDP growth and deep tax cuts, both for personal income tax and goods & services tax. The expenditure side, too, saw a strong come back, with capex spending rising rapidly in terms of execution, and lower energy prices giving space for containing subsidies. For FY27, we see the government broadly maintaining the current deficit, modestly reducing it to 4.3% of GDP for FY27, while capex spending targets should broadly move in sync with nominal GDP growth, which bounces back to 10.1% yoy in FY27 in our view. …and move to a debt targeting framework The Ministry of Finance is on track to hit its medium-term fiscal target of below 4.5% of GDP it had set in 2021 for the fiscal deficit and is going to pivot to a debt sustainability framework from FY27, targeting 55% of central debt to GDP, down from an estimated 56.1% of debt in FY26. This would make the fiscal position less contractionary, but maintain fiscal sustainability, ensuring spending rises broadly in sync with the nominal growth cycle, and not a drag on economic activity. Revenue projections to undershoot in FY26 From a revenue perspective, the dual tax cuts from income tax and GST will add some stress (2% lower than BE in our view), but the surge in non-tax revenues, both dividends from RBI and other public sector enterprises will make up for some of the shortfall. While the GST compensation cess has been phased put as per the recent reforms, we expect savings of Rs 350bn for FY26 basis the repayment schedule of the back-to-back loans. Still, we see scope for revenue growth to rise by 10.7% yoy, aided by reasonable growth in direct taxes, mild recovery in GST and higher provisions for dividends (RBI dividend to be ~INR 2.9trn as per our est.) and divestment inflows. With this, we see the overall revenue to GDP ratio rising to 9.6%, modestly up from 9.5% in FY26. The new revenue assumptions also will have the 16th Finance Commission recommendations incorporated, which we see largely remaining unchanged in terms of devolution. Spending mix to see defence, capex prioritized Unlike FY25, FY26 has seen a major surge in capex spending in H1FY26, but trends are expected to normalise in H2FY26. We expect some overshoot of the capex spending in FY26 (additional defence spending, +2% vs BE). We see capex allocations growing to INR12.5trn (3.2% of GDP) in FY27, and with energy prices coming off, the subsidy bills are likely to move sideways in FY27, at best. Further within capex government’s focus could remain intact in a few strategic areas: Defence, Railways & Shipbuilding while roads, rails and housing could remain subdued in FY27. We do not see the government budgeting for the eight-pay commission in FY27, which we believe will come into effect in installments in FY28-FY29, which over a year will cost the government around INR 2.4-2.8trn (0.54% - 0.65% of GDP) but split between FY28 and FY29. Further the changes proposed in VB-G RAM G may also implies some savings for the Centre. “As India approaches the Education Budget 2026, Artificial Intelligence must move from the margins to the core of education policy and funding. Though access and digital adoption have increased, the next wave of reform must be AI-enabled learning outcomes, faculty upskilling, and curriculum modernisation. Strategic budgetary support is required to integrate AI across disciplines, not as a mere technical subject, but as a managerial, ethical, and decision-making tool that future leaders need to master. More significantly, investments in AI-driven research, simulation-based learning, and industry-academia collaboration will massively increase employability and innovation capacity. The other important aspect is funding in teacher training, data infrastructure, and responsible AI frameworks to ensure inclusive and ethical adoption. A forward-looking budget embedding AI into the education ecosystem will be critical in building globally competitive institutions and future-ready talent for India’s knowledge economy.” “The importance of MSMEs is growing at a fast pace in the economy. The industry is infact emerging as a key pillar supporting India’s manufacturing renaissance in the defence sector and beyond. In areas such as drone manufacturing and unmanned systems, targeted capex incentives, output-linked support, rationalised taxation and R&D enablement can help MSMEs scale indigenous technologies and accelerate adoption. From a policy standpoint, the upcoming Budget must focus on execution and scale by lowering entry barriers for high-tech MSMEs, speeding up procurement cycles and creating stable demand visibility in defence manufacturing. Strengthening access to financing, encouraging advanced manufacturing investments and deepening domestic value addition will help MSMEs move up the value chain and advance India’s self-reliance goals while positioning the country as a global hub for defence and drone technologies.” Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL) and a subsidiary of Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL) on Wednesday announced an oil discovery in Onshore Block 1, Abu Dhabi. The discovery happened on Tuesday. IOCL and BPCL announce a significant oil discovery in Abu Dhabi's Onshore Block 1, marking a major achievement in exploration. Ola Electric on Wednesday announced the expansion of its 4680 Bharat Cell platform. As part of the initiative, businesses and start-ups can now directly purchase the 4680 Bharat Cells, or the 1.5kWh 4680 Bharat Cell battery pack for application across automotive, humanoids, drones, and portable medical equipment. Ola Electric expands its 4680 Bharat Cell platform, empowering start-ups and businesses with innovative energy storage solutions for various applications. The government’s continued focus on strengthening domestic manufacturing and improving ease of doing business has created a strong foundation for sectors such as packaging. For glass manufacturers, further rationalisation of duties and calibrated safeguard mechanisms on key raw materials like soda ash can help ensure long-term supply stability and support capacity expansion. Glass and aluminium manufacturing are energy-intensive processes, and targeted incentives for energy efficiency, cleaner fuel adoption and technology upgrades will encourage faster transition while improving cost efficiency across the sector. There is also a significant opportunity to further strengthen India’s circular economy. Glass and aluminium are infinitely recyclable, and fiscal support for organised collection, segregation and recycling infrastructure will help increase recycled content, reduce resource dependence, and enhance global competitiveness. Such measures in the upcoming Union Budget will enable packaging manufacturers to invest with confidence and reinforce India’s position as a reliable hub for sustainable glass and aluminium packaging. Sustainability/ MSMEs Neha Juneja, Founding Member IndiaP2P & EquiRize We expect the Budget to advance initiatives and incentives that improve MSME credit access and accelerate green economy investments aligned with India’s SDG priorities. MSMEs account for ~30% of GDP, ~45% of exports, and over 20 Cr. jobs, yet face a credit gap exceeding ₹20 lakh crore. Addressing this through credit impetus and compliance rationalisation can materially lift employment and export competitiveness. Increased policy support for renewables, green mobility, and clean cooking sectors, which together represent $50Bn+ in annual investment potential, will strengthen medium to long term economic and climate resilience and meet our national green targets for 2030. Insurance Ankita Srivastava, General Manager – Growth & Strategy at THIP (The Healthy Indian Project) “Ahead of the Union Budget 2026, India’s health and life insurance sector stands at a pivotal moment. While GST exemptions have improved affordability and demand, long-term growth will depend on deeper structural reforms. Enhanced tax incentives, stronger micro-insurance frameworks, simplified distribution, and robust consumer protection are critical. Recent FDI liberalisation adds momentum, but the budget’s policy direction will ultimately shape penetration, innovation, and public trust.” Lending/ Finance Neha Juneja, Founding Member, IndiaP2P & EquiRize The lending sector is seeking measures that encourage the unlocking of alternative capital sources for the sector, including from retail investors. Measures such as rationalisation of TDS on listed NCDs, increased limits for RBI-regulated P2P lending, will lead to flexibility and scale in capital sourcing for NBFCs and direct lending. Health & Pharma Sudipta Sengupta, Founder & CEO, The Healthy Indian Project (THIP) As India prepares its annual budget, my key expectation is clarity and courage in supporting preventive healthcare startups. Global AI platforms like ChatGPT Health will inevitably reshape consumer health information, but without policy support, they risk overwhelming homegrown players who understand India’s realities far better. Preventive health is not just a business opportunity; it is a national necessity. I hope the government creates incentives, grants, and regulatory safeguards that empower Indian startups to innovate responsibly, compete fairly, and build trusted health ecosystems rooted in evidence, ethics, and accessibility. Vigneshkumar Dhandapani, Associate Vice President, Avalon Consulting (Pharma) “A few critical outcomes that the Indian pharma industry expects from the 2026 Union Budget: - Increase healthcare spend to 2.5% of GPD as per NHP 2017 long-standing targets, up from 1.9% of GDP in FY25. - Correction of the inverted duty structure is critical as inputs currently have higher GST rates than the finished products. Contract manufacturers and generic MSME drug manufacturers are heavily affected. ‘GST rate rationalisation’ or mandating full ITC refund holds the key. - Bulk Drugs PLI 1.0 covered 41 APIs; however, the industry awaits clarity on the scope of Rs. 15,000 Cr. Pharma PLI. Widening the net of APIs to reduce >60% dependency on China is critical and needs to be covered. - R&D is a key success enabler for the industry. Revival of 200% weighted R&D deduction would motivate the pharma firms to invest more in cutting-edge drugs/products.” Justdial, India’s No. 1 local search engine, reported a consistent performance for the third quarter of FY26 marked by steady execution across its core business while continuing to deepen its AI-led platform capabilities.

Net profit stood at ₹118.0 crores, supported by disciplined cost management and stable operating performance. User and merchant engagement on the platform remained steady, with 184.5 million unique visitors recorded during the quarter and total business listings crossing 52.8 million as of 31st December 2025, underscoring Justdial’s continued relevance as India’s go-to platform for local business discovery. Mr. Shwetank Dixit, Chief Growth Officer, Just Dial, commented: “In the quarter gone by, we continued to evolve Justdial into a more intelligent, AI and automation-led platform. A key area of progress during the quarter was our move towards agentic AI, enabling the automation of critical workflows, including AI-driven analysis of user calls to businesses to identify genuine category-level intent and automatically create qualified leads, along with AI deployment across backend operations and sales functions. Looking ahead, we plan to deploy agentic AI–powered voice and chat interfaces across sales, customer support, and data verification, while embedding AI deeply into our search experience to enable more intuitive, conversational discovery. Together, these initiatives are simplifying how businesses manage their digital presence while making local discovery faster and more intuitive for our users.” Piramal Finance Limited, a leading Retail-led diversified NBFC, has raised USD 350 million in multilateral financing from two of the world’s most respected development finance institutions (DFIs) — the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) — reaffirming strong institutional confidence in the company’s strategy, governance and responsible growth trajectory. The funding package comprises: USD 200 million from IFC, and USD 150 million from ADB, under its Sustainable Finance Framework. The facilities carry a tenor of five years and will be drawn in tranches between January and March 2026, in line with regulatory guidelines. The company is also in advanced discussions to secure an additional USD 150 million from select DFIs, taking the total multilateral fundraising pipeline up to USD 500 million. This marks Piramal Finance’s inaugural DFI borrowing, further strengthening its diversified and long-term funding profile. Sees policy continuity over big-bang moves in Union Budget 2026 Mumbai, 14th January 2026: According to smallcase managers, Indian equity markets are entering 2026 on a firmer footing after a year of consolidation, with improving valuations, realistic earnings expectations and strong domestic fundamentals shaping a more constructive outlook. The three women smallcase managers Sonam Srivastava, Founder of Wright Research, Prachi Deuskar, Co-founder, Lotusdew Wealth and Investment Advisors, and Sneha Jain - Founder & CEO, WealthTrust Capital Services believes that while global events could be a source of uncertainty, India’s macro fundamentals remain strong. The smallcase managers believes that the coming year is likely to reward earnings-led investing rather than momentum-driven trades. They project a strong consumption-led growth cycle in 2026, supported by moderate inflation, tax cuts, GST reductions, and interest-rate cuts that boost disposable incomes and ease borrowing conditions. Commenting on the road ahead, Sonam Srivastava, smallcase Manager and Founder of Wright Research, said, “CY25 was a year of digestion rather than disappointment. After the strong post-COVID rally, Indian equities spent most of the year consolidating, with returns becoming narrower and more selective. As we move into CY26 which structurally is more constructive than CY25, valuations look far more reasonable today, earnings expectations are realistic rather than euphoric, and India enters the year with macro stability. We expect returns to be earnings-led in CY26 rather than multiple-led, which favours disciplined stock selection and factor-driven strategies.” She added that mid-teens earnings growth for Nifty companies, combined with improving sector breadth, makes the medium-term risk–reward more attractive despite global uncertainties. Sneha Jain, smallcase Manager, Founder & CEO, WealthTrust Capital Services said, “After the valuation reset in 2025, large caps, traditionally the premium P/B cohort, are now trading below SMIDs on a price-to-book basis — an inversion that signals subdued expectations despite superior balance-sheet strength, cash flows and governance. This provides valuation comfort and makes large caps relatively more attractive over the next 6–8 months, though allocations should remain aligned to overall asset allocation, with large caps serving as a stability anchor rather than a tactical overweight.” Budget Expectations: Women managers expects continuity over Big-Bang Announcements The managers say that Women investors and managers are not looking for headline-grabbing announcements, but for continuity. Fiscal discipline, sustained infrastructure spending, support for manufacturing and MSMEs, and clarity on long-term capital gains taxation matter more than short-term incentives. Any measures that deepen capital markets, improve retirement savings participation, or increase financial inclusion for women would be structurally positive. They expect the upcoming Union Budget to focus on continuity and structural support rather than short-term stimuli. They say that policy stability will be more critical than headline-grabbing measures. According to Prachi Deuskar, smallcase Manager and Co-founder, Lotusdew Wealth and Investment Advisors, “We anticipate the Union Budget will reinforce policy continuity around infrastructure, formalization, and fiscal prudence, alongside measures to deepen household financial participation. We also expect some support measures for the MSMEs, such as easier access to finance, credit guarantees, and incentives to boost productivity and market access. Structural incentives for manufacturing, long-term savings products, and policies that enhance ease of investing and compliance are likely to strengthen investor confidence and broaden market participation.” She noted that measures improving ease of investing, access to credit and long-term savings participation would be particularly constructive for sustained wealth creation. Sectors to watch in CY26: Quality, Capex and Selective Growth Experts believe sector leadership in 2026 will remain selective, with quality and balance-sheet strength taking precedence over broad-based rallies. They added that that valuation dispersion across market segments is creating opportunities, particularly within large caps. Sonam Srivastava highlighted that financials, capital goods and manufacturing-linked sectors remain central to the investment narrative. She highlights that well-capitalised private banks and select NBFCs continue to benefit from steady credit growth and stable asset quality. Industrials, capital goods and defence are supported by the multi-year capex cycle. Manufacturing-linked themes such as EMS, auto ancillaries and specialty chemicals are becoming more selective but attractive at corrected valuations. Technology services could offer incremental upside as global demand stabilises. Consumption recovery is likely to be gradual rather than sharp. Sneha Jain bets more on Information Technology and Precious Metals. She notes that The earnings yield of CNX IT has inched below the US 10yr Bond yield. Markets are pricing Indian IT similar to a Bond expecting low to no growth. Any growth in Indian IT sector should lead to rerating. On other hand, the gold–silver ratio, which was the primary indicator behind our silver call, has reverted to its historical median, suggesting silver now looks fairly overvalued at current prices. At the current ratio, gold offers a higher implied 1-year forward return than silver, reflecting relatively better risk-reward at this juncture. While, Prachi Deuskar believes that Capital goods, industrial and defence sectors stand to benefit from ongoing infrastructure capex and supply-chain shifts. She notes that select consumption segments and healthcare demonstrate resilient demand, while niche IT and technology service providers with differentiated offerings could outperform as digital adoption grows. While, FMCG sector is reporting signs of demand recovery and double-digit earnings growth, underpinned by improving core consumption trends. Budget Expectations – What must not be overlooked. India today does not suffer from a lack of intent or ambition in defence manufacturing. Over the years, industry has developed meaningful capabilities, created robust infrastructure, and nurtured specialised talent aligned with clearly identified defence priorities. What now requires equal attention is the sustainability of this ecosystem as it moves from promise to performance. The cost and risk borne by industry in taking a technology beyond early production are often underestimated. From practical experience, the most fragile phase of any defence programme is the transition from initial production to scale. This is the stage at which development timelines tend to stretch, costs escalate due to refinements and testing, and programme momentum can weaken. Similarly, capital investments made by industry in defence manufacturing are inherently long term in nature and expenditure is uneven across budget cycles. Hence disrupts capacity planning, quality systems, compliances, and after-sales support though the overall budget allocation appears stable. On the exports front, there is today genuine global interest in sourcing defence systems from India. However, exporting defence equipment cannot be treated as an extension of domestic procurement. To be credible in international markets, industry must invest upfront in regulatory compliance, certifications, disciplined documentation practices, and long-term maintenance and support infrastructure. A Union Budget that recognises these realities, without micromanaging execution, can strengthen national security while creating long-term economic value. “As we look ahead to Budget 2026, retail and bond investors alike are keenly focused on fiscal consolidation and credible deficit guidance. A disciplined glide path toward narrower deficits not only helps keep government bond yields steady but also creates conditions for Indian corporates to tap the debt markets with greater confidence. Increased corporate borrowing via bonds can meaningfully boost capital formation and support broader economic growth. On the tax front, I do not expect major changes in direct or indirect taxes, other than clarifications, since both regimes have undergone significant reform over the last 12 months.” “With the Union Budget 2026-27 approaching, the rail sector is entering a phase where execution and reform will matter as much as headline allocations. The Railways Minister’s ‘52 Reforms in 52 Weeks’ programme signals a clear push toward system-wide improvements in operations, safety, and service delivery. Based on recent trends, the rail outlay is expected to see a calibrated increase of around five percent, taking the overall allocation to approximately ₹2.65 lakh crore, including extra-budgetary resources. With electrification nearing completion, capital deployment is likely to be redirected toward easing congestion through new lines, gauge conversion, track doubling, and the expansion of Dedicated Freight Corridors and economic corridors linked to ports and mineral clusters. The reform agenda’s focus on faster adoption of artificial intelligence and advanced technologies for safety, predictive maintenance, and train operations is particularly encouraging, as it reflects a shift from asset creation alone to measurable performance outcomes. From an industry standpoint, continued capital support, regulatory simplification, deeper private sector involvement, and a more enabling framework for public-private partnerships will determine how effectively policy intent translates into on-ground execution. The forthcoming Budget should therefore focus on converting reform intent into projects that directly reduce congestion and lift operating efficiency across the rail network.” Rajat Bokolia, CEO, Newstone, says, “As the Union Budget 2026 approaches on February 1st, Tier II cities like Sonipat are becoming top real estate investment spots. Tier II cities offer affordable prices compared to Tier-1 cities. Sonipat leads this trend in the NCR. Better connectivity, RRTS, Metro extensions, UER-II, and the Sonipat Master Plan 2031 attract homebuyers as well as developers. Sonipat offers affordable options compared to Gurugram or Noida, along with rising job opportunities. The key expectations from the budget are that it might raise affordable housing limits, increase home loan tax deductions, and reduce GST/Stamp duties. This would drive more growth in tier-II cities like Sonipat. Investors could see post-budget price rises making Tier-II cities a smart investment choice.” Abhay Mishra, President & CEO, Jindal Realty, says , “The upcoming Union Budget 2026 should recognise that India’s housing momentum is now led by Tier-II cities rather than just metros. With better infrastructure and stable prices, these markets can grow faster if the budget boosts urban infrastructure spending, gives tax support to homebuyers, and encourages affordable housing. Sonipat, an emerging NCR hotspot, is benefiting from expressway connectivity, Namo Bharat, and industrial growth, which is driving homebuyers’ demand. If the budget channels more funds and policy attention to cities like Sonipat, it can firmly position growing economic hubs of India as the real driver of the country’s real estate growth.” - Yashank Wason, Managing Director, Royal Green Realty, says, “The upcoming fiscal budget is a crucial opportunity to strengthen real estate, especially in fast-growing Tier II and III cities, which are now effectively challenging metros across segments. These markets are offering infra-led projects, superior amenities and more spacious homes at comparatively reasonable prices, drawing both end-users and investors. Major developers are entering these cities, supported by government policy easing and recent GST relief, helping people enjoy better lifestyles in their hometowns while easing migration pressures. The industry now expects further tax incentives, clarity on GST and continued policy support to sustain safe, long-term real estate investments.” Navdeep Sardana, Founder, Whiteland Corporation says, “The upcoming 2026 union budget is the most anticipated day for Indian real estate. While 2025 saw absorptions in office and premium real estate sectors, there has been a policy push for these segments. The premium segment is looking for a fiscal maturity. With premium real estate now the current trend, industry’s focus has moved beyond tax sops. The most critical expectation for the ultra HNIs is the re-evaluation of Rs 10 crore cap on capital gains reinvestment under sections 54 and 54F. Increasing this limit is important to facilitate the movement of uber-luxury properties. Moreover, we expect the union budget to propel ESG compliant luxury developments and smart housing technology integration via specialised green financing tax credits. Industry expects the budget to introduce policies simplifying availability of finance for developers, providing better liquidity and lower barriers. For NRI investors, a further rationalisation of TDS on property sales would significantly improve foreign capital inflows into India’s growing residential market, which is expected to dominate the 2026 landscape.” Rajan Yadav, Director, Roots Developers, says, “On February 1, 2025, the union budget is expected to provide measures to improve the real estate segment. The industry seeks tax deductions on home loan interest, better subsidies for buyers, and disbursements to reduce EMIs and risks. Such steps can drive growth and urban development while restoring demand in luxury segments. In luxury real estate, sustained demand from HNIs and NRIs will ensure project placement with wellness amenities and ESG compliances, even without direct incentives. A buyer centric budget will make housing purchases more attractive while maintaining luxury real estate’s strong performance.” Mr. Rishabh Periwal, Senior Vice President, Pioneer Urban Land & Infrastructure Ltd. says, “According to the latest Cushman & Wakefield report, Delhi-NCR recorded a strong 39% quarter-on-quarter rise in new housing launches in Q4 2025, reflecting sustained buyer confidence. Gurugram led this growth, accounting for a significant share of launches along key growth corridors such as Dwarka Expressway, Golf Course Extension Road, and New Gurugram. With enhanced connectivity to IGI Airport, Delhi, and major commercial hubs like Yashobhoomi and Cyber City, these infrastructure-led developments are reshaping the region’s residential landscape. Homebuyers and investors should focus on such emerging, well-connected micro-markets for long-term value appreciation.” One of the most welcome reforms in 2025 was the government’s decision to remove GST on life insurance. This has made life insurance about 18% more affordable, encouraging more people to secure their families’ futures. While insurers have faced increased operational costs due to the loss of Input Tax Credit (ITC), I am hopeful that increased demand driven by better affordability will help offset this impact. For the upcoming Union Budget, we have three key expectations that will not only benefit the life insurance industry but also help improve financial security for millions of Indians: 1. Better Tax Benefits for Protection and Health Insurance To accelerate insurance penetration and achieve the vision of ‘Insurance for All by 2047’, we are hopeful that the government will consider enhancing tax benefits on life and health insurance. Specifically, we recommend either increasing the current limit or introducing a separate, dedicated section for life insurance premiums. It is also crucial that these tax benefits be extended to both the old and new tax regimes, making insurance more inclusive and accessible to all. 2. Tax Relief on Annuity Plans India is facing a widening retirement savings gap, projected to reach $85 trillion by 2050 [1] .We need to do something to fill this gap. To tackle this, the budget this year can: Extend the ₹50,000 deduction to all pension and annuity products. Reduce tax on annuity payouts, making retirement income more tax-efficient and attractive for savers. Simplifying and enhancing tax benefits for these products will encourage more Indians to invest in long-term income security. 3. Increase Premium Cap for tax-free maturity for ULIPs to ₹5 lakh Today, ULIPs have a ₹2.5 lakh annual premium cap for tax-free maturity. We hope the Budget will raise the ULIP cap to ₹5 lakh, same as traditional products. A uniform cap will make tax benefits easier to understand for everyone. With continued policy support and forward-thinking reforms, the life insurance sector is ready to play a stronger role in safeguarding financial well-being and enabling long-term security for Indian families. “The GST waiver has made life insurance more affordable and accessible. We’re hopeful that this year’s Budget will continue that momentum. Better tax benefits for protection and health plans—under both tax regimes—can help more families get covered. We also hope to see stronger support for pension products and an increase in the premium cap for ULIPs to Rs. 5 Lakh, similar to traditional plans. Simple, inclusive reforms can go a long way in securing India’s financial future and accelerate progress towards ‘Insurance for All by 2047.’” With the pre-Budget approaching, we are hopeful that India is entering an important phase in its medical tourism journey. Policy reforms are recognising medical value travel as a structured, systems-led growth opportunity. Continued investments in healthcare infrastructure, expanding digital health adoption, and improving access for international patients have created a strong foundation. The next phase of growth will depend on clearer policy direction and faster, simpler medical visa processes, along with well-defined cross-border care pathways and patient facilitation standards that reduce uncertainty for families planning treatment. Medical tourism is a multi-billion-dollar global industry, and India is well positioned to strengthen its leadership with world-class clinicians, advanced hospital networks, and a compelling value proposition centred on outcomes, affordability, and patient experience. Going forward, international patients will increasingly expect transparency, continuity of care, and seamless coordination throughout treatment, travel, and recovery. Strengthening digital health integration, enabling insurance alignment, and supporting accredited patient facilitation platforms will be critical to building trust. Looking to 2026, with the right policy support, India can extend medical tourism beyond metro cities into emerging healthcare hubs, building a more inclusive and resilient ecosystem. “As India’s digital payments ecosystem continues to expand, the Union Budget plays an essential role in reinforcing infrastructure, security, and regulatory clarity. Policies that support secure digital adoption, ease compliance for MSMEs, and encourage innovation can help sustain growth across the fintech sector. For payment aggregators, stable regulatory frameworks and technology-focused incentives are key to scaling responsibly while maintaining trust. Continued focus on cybersecurity, data protection, and ease of doing business will strengthen the overall payments landscape. The direction set through the Budget will influence how fintech players contribute to financial inclusion and build a resilient digital economy in the coming years.” NITCO Limited, a leading player in the tiles, marble, and mosaic industry, has reported a strong 85% growth in sales in December 2025 as compared to January 2025, on a month-on-month basis, reflecting strong business momentum and sustained demand across its product categories. The growth was driven by focused execution, strengthening market presence, and growing customer confidence, marking a significant milestone in NITCO’s journey towards scalable and sustainable growth. Sales momentum was supported by strong customer demand, ongoing product portfolio enhancement, improved distribution reach, and sustained operational efficiencies. Commenting on the performance, Mr. Vivek Talwar, Chairman & Managing Director, NITCO Limited, said, “Achieving 85% growth in sales reflects the strength of our business strategy, the dedication of our teams, and the trust our customers have placed in us. We remain focused on sustainable growth while continuing to invest in innovation, capacity expansion, and customer experience.” Fusion CX, a global customer experience (CX) services provider, today announced the acquisition of Skycom BPO, an El Salvador–based nearshore BPO company with delivery operations across Latin America. The acquisition adds approximately USD 25 million in annualised topline revenue to Fusion CX. The acquisition marks a strategic step in Fusion CX’s expansion across Latin America (including the Caribbean), strengthening its nearshore delivery ecosystem and enhancing its ability to support complex, high-volume CX programs for North American and international clients. Skycom’s operating expertise across telecom, utilities, BFSI, and digital-first enterprises complements Fusion CX’s existing capabilities and expands its bilingual service offerings and regional scale 3QFY26 preview: Pricing lags; volume momentum builds · Price slippages in 3QFY26; non-trade prices recovered in Dec-25: The pan-India average cement price in 3QFY26 declined c2% q-q, primarily driven by the South and East region (c3% q-q; cINR10-15/bag). The non-trade prices saw a sharp correction post the GST cut (especially in the South and North), though it recovered partly in Dec-25 along with sequential demand pick up. While the industry’s realisation growth is likely to decline c2% q-q in 3Q, dealers cite optimism of potential price hikes (both trade and non-trade) ahead along with seasonal recovery. · Strong demand pick-up in Dec-25; Heading firm into a seasonally strong 4Q: The industry’s 3Q volume growth rebounded to high single digit, in our view, post a 4-5% growth witnessed in 1HFY26, as construction activities resumed from end Nov-25. Driven by a ramp-up in newly acquired capacities and organic additions, we estimate c15% y-y volume growth for our coverage, led by UTCEM (c21% y-y; c13% LFL), ACEM (c13% y-y) and JKCE (c14%), but a subdued volume growth for SRCM (c3% y-y). · Operating costs to soften q-q; but lower realisations are likely to impact profitability: In 3Q, the average US petcoke prices remained elevated at cUSD120/ton, i.e., close to the Sep-25 exit (+c4% q-q/ c21% y-y), which is likely to exert pressure on P&F costs, though partly offset by the decline in imported coal (South Africa) prices (-c2% q-q) and higher green energy mix. Overall, we expect operating cost/ton to soften c1% q-q owing to operating leverage and the reversal of elevated 2Q fixed cost but see a cINR50/ton q-q decline in EBITDA/ton on lower pricing and subsidy income. · Sector EV/EBITDA near its past 10-year average; Upgrade DALBHARA to Neutral: Prolonged demand weakness stretching to mid-3Q eroded price stability in the previous quarter. However, the recent demand pick-up has raised the probability of near-term price hikes. In our base case, we expect 3Q slippages to recover but don’t see a meaningful hike in 4Q, amidst a year-end volume push. Our preference remains UTCEM and JKCE. We upgrade DALBHARA to Neutral. Strong 2025; compounding should continue in 2026 We have been positive on Indian Telecoms for a while, and telecoms remains among our preferred sector pick in India in 2026 (See 2026 Outlook). The telecom industry’s structure has improved, which is reflected in strong revenue growth over the past years, EBITDA margin improvement and a moderating capex intensity. While valuation multiples have expanded, we expect healthy doubledigit returns led by earnings growth. We see a strong likelihood of a mobile tariff hike in 2026, and the sector is tapping new growth drivers, such as home broadband and data centres. Telcos have ramped up their consumer offering by bundling content, cloud and AI, which can eventually be monetised. We like Reliance and Bharti Airtel. We recently downgraded Indus Towers to Neutral. · 2026 should be an eventful year: Jio IPO, tariff hikes, AGR resolution, Indus dividends: We expect 2026 to be an eventful year for the Indian Telecom industry and would watch out for 1) Jio Platforms IPO, which could raise the weightage of the sector in indices; 2) We see high likelihood of a mobile tariff hike in 1H2026; 3) the DoT recently provided relief to VIL on its AGR dues. However, we do not expect this to have any meaningful impact on the Indian mobile market share trends in 2026; 4) non-mobile opportunities, such as home and data center, could see an increase in the share of capex. Increasing adoption of digital services, such as cloud and AI services, creates differentiation opportunities in the near-term (e.g. Jio bundling Google AI Pro) and a possible monetisation opportunity in the medium term. · 3QFY26 should be a relatively stable quarter; healthy growth on the back of stable tariffs: On account of stable India mobile tariffs for over a year, we expect largely stable q-q revenue trends (+2-2.5% q-q for Airtel and Jio). On a y-y basis, sales growth should remain strong and in double digits (c10-11% for Jio/Airtel). EBITDA growth should remain ahead of sales growth for both Airtel and Jio. For Indus, the AGR dues relief for VIL is a positive. However, we recently downgraded the stock to Neutral as the stock has moved by 35% over 1Y and our concerns of weak growth and high maintenance capex keeps us from raising the valuation multiples. As India prepares for the Union Budget, there is a crucial opportunity to reorient healthcare towards prevention and early intervention. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) continue to place a growing burden on individuals, families and public health systems, yet many conditions remain undetected until advanced stages. Strengthening structured screening programmes and enabling technology-led risk assessment can help identify disease earlier, improve outcomes and reduce avoidable hospitalisation. Targeted policy support for preventive health infrastructure, workforce training and data-driven screening models can optimise long-term healthcare spending while easing pressure on tertiary care facilities. Encouraging public-private collaboration and integrating preventive screening into primary care pathways will be key to building a more sustainable system. A forward-looking budget that prioritises early detection, personalised risk profiling and preventive care can help India move from a treatment-centric approach to a healthier, more resilient population. This shift will support affordability, equity, productivity, and long-term national well-being across diverse communities nationwide and sustainably. Wholesale Price Inflation (WPI), based on provisional estimates, increased marginally to 0.71% on a month-on-month (M-o-M) basis in December 2025, compared to 0.52% in November 2025, while continuing to remain below the 1% mark, said Mr. Rajeev Juneja, President, PHDCCI, in a press statement issued here today. The marginal uptick in WPI was primarily driven by higher inflation in the Fuel & Power and Manufactured Products groups on a month-on-month basis, he highlighted. Inflation in the Fuel and Power category (weight: 13.15%) rose from 0.90% in November 2025 to 1.23% in December 2025, reflecting increased prices of electricity (4.46%), coal (0.66%), and mineral oils (0.07%) during the month, Mr. Juneja noted. The Manufactured Products group (weight: 64.23%) witnessed an uptrend, moving from a deflation of (-) 0.21% in November 2025 to an inflation of 0.41% in December 2025 on a month-on-month basis. This increase was attributed to higher prices in the manufacture of basic metals, chemicals and chemical products, non-metallic mineral products, textiles, cement, lime and plaster, he added. Dr. Ranjeet Mehta, CEO & Secretary General, PHDCCI, stated that WPI inflation is expected to remain range-bound, supported by benign international crude oil prices, GST rate rationalisation, and healthy rabi crop production. India’s pro-growth pivot takes hold As we write our outlook for India’s economy into 2026, our market call sees Nifty at 30,000 by Mar-27, yielding 15% return vs. 10.1% in CY25, despite global headwinds. This is premised on earnings rebound (14-15% growth in FY27E; 3-5% in FY26E), led by acceleration in sales growth from 6.9% in FY26E to 10.9% in FY27E, and PAT growth from 10.9% in FY26E to 13.3% in FY27E. The earnings uptick will be led by a rebound in nominal GDP growth (earnings sensitivity to GDP growth is ~0.6) and built on a durable foundation of higher incremental free cash flow and improving balance sheet optionality. Expect nominal GDP to grow 10.5% YoY in FY27E from 8.5% YoY in FY26E. EM assets have higher tailwinds in CY26 than DMs: EM assets have higher tailwinds versus DMs – easy financial conditions, moderate inflation, soft DXY and valuation comfort. The asset class leadership is also shifting. The AI theme is past its easy beta phase (selective gains from uniform winners, announcement-led rally to proof of revenue and ROI) and dominance of the US market is dissipating, providing space for under-owned markets and contra-AI trade. India’s relative valuation premium to its EM peers is closer to historical inflection point (1.6x), and an uptick in nominal GDP growth should aid FPI inflows. In past 25 years, peak-to-trough (drawdown) cycles of net FPI equity inflows have been strongly correlated with nominal GDP growth. We see conditions in India being prime for return of FPI inflows. SBI Life launches ‘SBI Life- Smart Platina Advantage’, a life insurance guaranteed savings plan for long-term financial confidence – ‘SBI Life- Smart Platina Advantage’ is designed to seamlessly support financial needs across life stages with assured, long-term savings and protection India, 14th January 2025: In today’s fast-changing world—where aspirations grow alongside responsibilities—financial security is no longer just about finances, but about certainty, peace of mind, and the ability to protect loved ones through every phase of life. Recognising this need, SBI Life Insurance, one of India’s most trusted private life insurers, launched ‘SBI Life – Smart Platina Advantage’, an individual, non-linked, non-participating life insurance savings product that offers long-term guaranteed benefits along with life insurance protection throughout the policy term. Designed to help individuals plan confidently for life’s milestones—be it children’s education, retirement planning, corpus creation, building second income etc., —SBI Life – Smart Platina Advantage enables individuals to build a disciplined financial corpus with assured guaranteed additions every policy year. The product combines predictability with flexibility, ensuring one to secure defined maturity outcomes while paying premiums for a limited duration. Key features of SBI Life – Smart Platina Advantage are: · Long-term Guaranteed Benefits with life insurance cover · Pay premiums for a Limited Period while enjoying life cover for entire Policy Term · Tax benefits, as per applicable provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961 · Option to receive maturity proceeds in instalments, offering post maturity liquidity and financial flexibility Indian capital markets will continue to prioritise profitability, transparency and strong corporate governance despite a surge in initial public offerings, said Ashish Kumar Chauhan, NSE Chief, during IPO Baatcheet, a special show by Startup Policy Forum (SPF). Chauhan said India’s public markets differ fundamentally from more risk-tolerant markets, with Indian investors, both institutional and retail, placing greater emphasis on sustainable businesses and investor protection. “Broadly speaking, India is about profitability, about transparency and about better corporate governance.” he said. Emphasising the importance of trust in public markets, Chauhan said strong corporate governance remains central to sustaining investor confidence, particularly as retail participation continues to deepen. “Corporate governance is the backbone of this trust. It’s like a pond out of which we all drink… it’s easy to destroy that trust, but very difficult to build,” he said. Addressing founders of listed companies, Chauhan said promoters must recognise the responsibility that comes with managing public capital and consistently prioritise shareholders. “Whenever in doubt, take the decision in favour of the other investors, not yourself. Even if it is legally allowed, don’t do that because morally it may not be correct,” he said, referring to the need to reduce asymmetries of information and power between insiders and public investors. Chauhan cautioned against viewing new-age IPOs as assured wealth creators, noting that long-term outcomes will be determined by post-listing performance over one-, two- and five-year periods. He said public markets carry inherent risks and that returns depend on business fundamentals, governance standards and market cycles. Reflecting on the evolution of India’s capital markets, Chauhan highlighted the growth of retail participation, with over 12 crore unique investors at NSE today, representing nearly 25 per cent of Indian households. He said this reflects increasing trust among households in entrepreneurs and market institutions.

Sharad Mathur, MD and CEO, Universal Sompo General Insurance “Achieving the goal of ‘Insurance for All by 2047’ will require a clear, time-bound roadmap supported by targeted policy and budgetary measures. The focus should be on building shared digital insurance infrastructure such as interoperable platforms and cost-efficient distribution frameworks that can be used across the industry to expand reach, particularly among first-time buyers. The Budget can also play a catalytic role by allocating sustained funding for insurance awareness and literacy initiatives, especially in rural and low-income regions where adoption remains uneven. In parallel, government insurance and welfare schemes should be structured to enable wider participation from private insurers through more consultative and business-friendly frameworks. Together, these measures will help narrow protection gaps, improve affordability and translate the vision of universal insurance into on-ground outcomes.” Alok Rungta, MD and CEO, Generali Central Life Insurance “The forthcoming Union Budget can bring about compelling reform for the life insurance sector by making long-term financial protection more accessible and relevant for today’s families. To achieve this, the limits on tax concessions for life insurance and retirement products must be revisited, as current thresholds do not reflect rising incomes or evolving life-stage needs. Expanding deductions or making incentives easier to claim will significantly boost demand for higher-value policies, especially given the high protection gap in India. Affordability and participation can be improved by simplifying taxation across life insurance products, encouraging pure protection plans and incentivizing long-term savings. Equally important will be policy continuity and regulatory clarity, enabling insurers to plan responsibly and invest for the future.” Gaurav Garg, Research Analyst at Lemonn Markets Desk, writes: “The strong response to the Bharat Coking Coal IPO underscores investor confidence in the company’s monopolistic position in India’s coking coal segment and its long-term demand visibility. The anchor book was fully subscribed at 1x, with 11.88 crore shares allotted, raising ₹273.13 crore, providing early institutional validation to the issue. Exceptional oversubscription in the NII category reflects strong valuation comfort and expectations of listing gains. Robust participation from retail and shareholder segments highlights broad-based investor interest and trust in the Coal India ecosystem. While QIB demand remained relatively measured, the overall subscription trend points to favourable secondary market sentiment, supported by the scarcity value of a pure-play coking coal producer and steady demand from the steel sector.” Executive Centre India Limited has received the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) approval for its proposed initial public offering (IPO).

Rajkumar Subramanian, Head- Products and Family Offices –PL Wealth Management on Silver Outlook, writes: “Silver is emerging as one of the most compelling strategic metals in the current cycle, sitting at the intersection of investment demand and industrial transformation. In India, this dual character is even more pronounced. Beyond its traditional role as a store of value, silver is increasingly driven by structural demand from solar energy, electronics, electric mobility and advanced manufacturing. As India accelerates its renewable and infrastructure ambitions, silver’s industrial relevance strengthens its long-term price support. At the same time, rising retail participation and growing interest from HNI and family capital are positioning silver as a portfolio diversifier alongside gold. However, investors must remain mindful that silver is inherently more volatile than gold, with sharper price swings driven by global growth expectations, dollar movements and speculative flows. It is best approached with disciplined allocation and a medium- to long-term perspective.” Shadowfax's IPO opens January 22 with a price band of ₹118-124, aiming to raise ₹1,907 crore.

Market analysis by Vikram Subburaj, CEO, Giottus.com January 14, 2025 Bitcoin steadied near the mid-$90,000 zone over January 13-14 after a choppy start to the month. BTC prices but tested the $95,000 level today and this is a constructive signal after the recent bout of consolidation. The move suggests buyers are defending higher levels even as macro uncertainty persists. On the downside, the $90,000-$92,000 band continues to act as a key support zone. Sustained acceptance above $95,000 would be required to open the door for a fresh leg higher and any failure to hold this range could invite renewed range trading. Institutional positioning showed early signs of stabilisation. After several sessions of heavy redemptions, US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a strong net inflow on January 13 and helped arrest downside momentum. Derivatives markets reflected a more balanced stance as funding rates normalised and liquidation activity remained contained. This indicates a leverage reset rather than forced capitulation. On-chain data also point to a cooling of aggressive profit-taking. Realised profits have moderated sharply from late-2025 peaks. Momentum indicators have reverted toward neutral territory and this is consistent with consolidation above prior breakout levels rather than distribution. Among major altcoins, Ethereum held firm above $3,000. BNB traded largely in the $930-$960 range and found support near recent lows. Solana oscillated between roughly $135 and $150 and reflected continued interest in high-throughput layer-1s even as volatility stayed elevated. XRP hovered around the $2.05-$2.15 band and consolidated after earlier gains. Overall, altcoin performance remained mixed and showed selective strength. Rotation into altcoins continues to be tactical rather than trend-defining, with traders unwilling to commit aggressively ahead of clearer macro and Bitcoin-led direction. Macro cues continue to dominate sentiment. Markets are tracking US inflation data, Federal Reserve guidance, and energy price movements, all of which are influencing global risk appetite and crypto flows. Our advice: Bitcoin’s ability to test $95,000 is a positive structural sign, but this remains a range-bound, event-driven market. Traders should respect the $90,000 support, avoid high leverage, and add exposure only on confirmed spot-led strength. Prioritise BTC and ETH over high-beta altcoins until macro clarity improves and price acceptance above resistance is sustained.

Revenues grew 3.2% CC QQ, led by Autos (7.3%) on back of bunched-up deal ramp-ups (Mercedes) as well as JLR returning to growth. Outlook remains positive in Autos for steady growth going forward on back of scope expansion in certain large deals (Suzuki) as well as continued growth in JLR for another 1-2 quarters. Media & Telecom and Healthcare should return to growth as per co in 4Q, driven by deal ramp-ups post furloughs-led decline in 3Q. Margin expansion was impressive at 240bps QQ, returning to 20%+ after 3 quarters helped by utilization increase, which remains the biggest lever (75%, can go to 80%) Co targets to get back to 25% margins by 4QFY27 (JPMe 24%).

Since its equity fund raising in 18M, VIdea has expanded sites by 110K and unique BB towers by 21K Assume incremental tenancies from twin tenants at 68K by FY28CL for Indus VIdea’s fund raising should add upside to Indus’s growth of 10-11% Cagr in core revenue and Ebitda.

Hurrah? Not quite yet Believe investor focus will now shift to operating profit (PPOP), & there are likely to be PPOP cuts going forward This will be driven by the culmination of multiple factors: modest loan growth, NIM pressure and slower fee income. Loan growth remains sluggish for the sector and SBIC is no exception. Unless there are more rate cuts by the RBI, NIM is likely to decline from 4QFY26 onwards driven by lower yields. Lastly, cessation of rental spending and lower instance-based fees will place pressure on fee income Cut FY26-28 PAT est 10%-14% Nomura on Indian hotels Initiate Buy, TP Rs 830 Buy owing to 1) IHCL’s high visibility on ADR growth driven by constrained hotel supply, strong demand, and a low ADR base (in USD terms); 2) better quality of earnings (improving ROIC) as IHCL expands largely through management fee and capital-light Ginger models; 3) IHCL appears well positioned to achieve/exceed its 2030 targets for revenue, ROCE, & portfolio hotels target.

Margin pressure from loss of GST input tax credit was largely offset by a favourable product mix shift toward retail protection, improved product-level margins and supportive yield curve movements. Retail protection growth was strong at 40% YoY in 3QFY26, aided by GST removal. ULIP sales picked up, while management also highlighted a pick-up in non-par sales. On regulatory front, discussions about potential commission norm changes introduces some uncertainty, but expect any changes to be pragmatic given the high-push nature of insurance sales & regulator’s focus on improving penetration.

Large-scale retail brokers are in a transitionary phase—shifting to one-stop platforms for financial products distribution from pure-play broking-led market proxies. Angel’s aggressive customer acquisition strategy and demonstrated business agility underpin constructive stance. Niche market leadership, customer-centric approach driving high brand recall and lean business structure generating elevated operating efficiencies augur well for Groww. Cross-sell potential is high for both, aided by confluence of rapidly expanding product bouquet and a large and swiftly expanding captive customer base. While market volatility and regulatory headwinds weigh in, nascency of Indian markets and regime change in financial products’ purchase journey position the transformational plays in a sweet spot. Re-rating is contingent on effective business diversification. Our Capital Markets preference: wealth>brokers (large)>AMC>RTA. Prefer Angel over Groww currently due to its brand re-positioning and steady business diversification whilst benign valuation. Angel: ‘Buy’ — Angel has demonstrated business agility by smoothly transitioning to a digital-first broking platform from a traditional one. NSE active clients +18% CAGR over Mar ’22-Nov ’25, market share +495 bps. Net broking revenue mix declined to ~54% in 1HFY26 from ~60% in FY2022. Focus is on expanding product bouquet, viz. credit, distribution, Ionic Wealth, etc. Over the medium term, we expect calculated adjusted EBDAT margin to improve to 36.1% by FY2029E from 34.2% in FY2026E as broking volumes pick up, customer acquisition run rate revives and leverage benefits kick in new initiatives. EPS CAGR +26% over FY2026-29E. Re-rating contingent on prudent execution of revenue diversification strategy. Groww: ‘Buy’ — Groww’s customer-centric approach, first-mover advantage in direct MF and leadership in retail broking driving high brand recall and elevated cross-sell potential to a large captive customer pool (average active users +61% CAGR over FY2023-25) augur well for revenue accretion. Lean business structure offer potential to expand margins further; calculated adjusted EBITDA margin at 69.3% by FY2029E (+870 bps over FY2026E). EPS CAGR +35% over FY2026-29E. Fii: -1678 Dii: +1323 -- Bloomberg - Morgan Stanley increased bonuses by about 20% for bankers in Asia after the firm closed in on a record $10 billion in revenue from the region last year. - Revenue jumped on outsized gains in equity trading, prime brokerage and wealth management, with fees from stock sales and mergers approaching $1 billion. - High-performing managing directors across country banking and booming sectors are expected to receive total compensation including bonuses of $2 million to $2.5 million. Morgan Stanley increased bonuses by about 20% for bankers in Asia after the firm closed in on a record $10 billion in revenue from the region last year, people familiar with the matter said. Revenue jumped on outsized gains in equity trading, prime brokerage and wealth management, the people said. The investment banking and capital markets divisions also regained momentum, with fees from stock sales and mergers approaching $1 billion, the most in years, they added, asking not to be identified because the numbers are confidential. A media representative for Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong declined to comment. The Asia record has set traders and bankers up for a robust bonus season. Overall, investment bankers got a 15% to 20% bump for the past year while traders and product specialists in the institutional equity division got more, with top performers seeing increases of at least 30%, the people said. High-performing managing directors across country banking and booming sectors such as technology are expected to receive total compensation including bonuses of $2 million to $2.5 million, the people said. Average compensation of $1 million to $1.5 million represents a sharp contrast to 2024, the people said, after about a fifth of managing directors received no bonuses that year. Morgan Stanley reported $7.64 billion in revenue from Asia in 2024, accounting for about 12% of the New York bank’s global total. That topped arch-rival Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for the third year in a row. Morgan Stanley’s Asia head Gokul Laroia told Bloomberg in a rare interview last year that he was eyeing $10 billion in revenue within five years. Trading momentum in the final quarter helped the firm near its goal much sooner than that. Morgan Stanley’s Asia revenue, which includes Japan and Australia, rose 29% to $7.27 billion for the nine months ended in September. The boon echoed a global revenue surge, with stock traders beating expectations as US President Donald Trump’s policies kept markets on edge. The bank is slated to announce its 2025 earnings on Thursday, joining several Wall Street firms releasing results this week. Despite a record year in Asia, Morgan Stanley cautioned against raising bonuses too sharply, aiming to smooth compensation. Factors such as share-price gains and a large junior workforce tempered growth in the overall bonus pool, another person said. Some 26 bankers and staff in Asia were promoted to managing directors, spanning equity, investment banking and fixed-income divisions, the people said. Dhaval Ajmera, Director – Corporate Affairs, Ajmera Group “The real estate sector has emerged as one of the major contributors to economic growth. In order to keep the momentum rolling and further pick up the pace, we expect the ministry to announce policy reforms and remedial measures in the upcoming budget that will benefit the buyers and developers alike. Most importantly, the sector expects to waive the cap currently placed on home loans and introduce tax benefits on the interest paid by buyers, irrespective of the ticket size. This will, in turn, be a mega-booster for the economy and will have a great run in the Indian real estate ecosystem. Equally significant is the need to truly accelerate India’s transition to Net Zero. In relation to this, we urge the Ministry to introduce an Interest Subvention Scheme - specifically for Green-Rated Real Estate Debt. While developers are keen to build sustainable, IGBC/LEED-certified projects, the sky-high cost of capital remains a major barrier. As a remedial measure, a government-backed subvention of 200-300 basis points on Green Bonds would directly reduce the borrowing costs, making green projects financially viable rather than just aspirational. Last but not least, we look forward to a rationalisation of GST on residential projects and redefine the terminology of affordable housing from price-oriented to measurability, as this will be the last mile help in formalizing the Housing for All dream of the honourable PM.” Ashish Munjal, Co-founder and CEO, SUNSTONE Budget 2026 is an opportunity to transform India’s demographic dividend into a genuinely future ready workforce. To be able to address the growing skills gap, we need to have a major allocation of funds for project-led programs in artificial intelligence, data science, and other emerging technologies, besides investment in multilingual digital learning platforms under Digital India. This means funding not just content, but labs, faculty development, and industry led projects that bring NEP’s vision to life inside classrooms. Affordability, however, remains the biggest barrier for millions of deserving students, especially in Tier-2 and Tier-3 India. The Central government can ease this by expanding interest free or subsidised education loans on an EMI model, strengthening credit guarantees, and increasing the scholarship corpus for under-served communities. At the same time, tax deductions on individual and corporate spend towards recognised skill certifications will normalise lifelong learning. In the same way that health insurance has become standard, we need to provide incentives through “employer sponsored learning credits” with tax incentives and cofunding structures that make it attractive for companies to invest in campus talent and early-career upskilling. Doing so would sharply improve employability outcomes and hasten India’s march toward a resilient, innovation-driven economy. Trump said tariffs are driving record investment, boosting wages and curbing inflation, warning of major fallout if the Supreme Court strikes them down. EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said fresh sanctions will be proposed against those behind Iran’s protest crackdown as deaths rise and pressure mounts on Tehran. India and France discussed defence, technology and nuclear cooperation under Make in India as Ajit Doval and Emmanuel Bonne led strategic talks. India is considering a dedicated rocket-cum-missile force to counter China and Pakistan, Army chief says, as military reforms and modernisation accelerate. TCS CEO Krithivasan highlights clients' proactive tech decisions and AI deployment amid ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, driving improved decision cycles. TCS CEO K Krithivasan discusses AI transformation, changing aspirations of Indian IT talent, and macroeconomic impacts on business strategies.

Title: AI Could Spell Trouble for Software. These Experts Say to Avoid One Stock In Particular

Software was once the hottest industry on Wall Street. Not so in the AI era. S&P 500 software stocks lagged the broader index for the second consecutive year in 2025 as companies making the “picks and shovels” of the AI buildout—like semiconductors and memory devices—led the stock market higher. And analysts expect the challenges weighing on software stocks, especially application developers, to persist in 2026. One example: Oppenheimer on Tuesday downgraded Adobe (ADBE) stock to “Perform” from “Outperform” and withdrew its price target entirely, citing threats from AI that apply to varying degrees across the application software industry. The news pulled Adobe, shares of which have lost more than a fifth of their value over the past 12 months, down more than 5% on Tuesday. Software stocks were expected to have a strong 2025 supported by the deployment of AI agents. The rollout of those agents has moved much slower than expected, weighing on investor sentiment and raising concerns about the software industry's vulnerability to AI disruption. One of the primary issues Adobe faces, according to Oppenheimer, is the perception that AI is weakening its competitive position. Gen AI “is increasing the velocity of content creation while lowering price and subscriber growth,” wrote analysts led by Brian Schwartz. The company faces new competition from LLM providers like OpenAI and advertising platforms like Meta, which have introduced creative tools that allow people other options for doing what previously required an Adobe license and specialized knowledge. Investors also worry that generative AI could upend the seat-based pricing model on which many software-as-a-service providers like Adobe are built. Traditionally, Adobe sells a client a set number of Creative Cloud licenses for a set amount of time, which has meant reliable revenue. It and other software companies will have to adapt if the usage-based pricing—in which a customer pays each time they use a service—favored by AI developers and hyperscalers becomes the norm. Even if seat-based models remain standard, AI threatens to undercut software subscription growth by helping companies to get by with smaller teams and lowering the cost of switching vendors, according to a recent Deutsche Bank note. AI isn’t seen as a threat to all software companies. Infrastructure software stocks performed well last year as companies accelerated IT modernization and cloud migration efforts as they sought to transition to more AI usage, according to Deutsche Bank. Shares of data analytics software provider Palantir (PLTR) more than doubled in value last year as its commercial sales soared. Cloud migrations also helped support shares of companies like MongoDB (MDB) and Snowflake (SNOW). Morgan Stanley analysts expect many of the trends that fueled last year's infrastructure software rally to carry into 2026. They argue the rollout of AI copilots and agents should support demand for data management and observability tools, as should robust cloud growth. Cloud and AI spending are expected to remain top priorities for companies this year. Cloud spending growth is expected to hold steady at 10%, according to a Jefferies survey of IT executives and chief investment officers. That survey also found that, on average, nearly 12% of IT budgets will be dedicated to AI this year, up from 6.5% last year. Adobe's stock is down more than 50% since peaking in 2021. About half of the analysts with current ratings tracked by Visible Alpha rate Adobe stock a “Buy,” while two are neutral and three recommend selling. The average price target near $392 represents 26% upside from Tuesday’s close.

Title: Meta is changing its performance review to reward output over effort, taking a page from Amazon and X

Meta Platforms Inc. just became the latest tech company to rejig its performance review process to hone in on an employee’s output, as opposed to effort. The company is rolling out a new performance review platform called Checkpoint, which will grade workers, grouping them into four categories and rewarding top performers for exceptional work, according to internal documents obtained by Business Insider. “We’re evolving our performance program to simplify it and placing greater emphasis on rewarding outstanding performance,” a Meta spokesperson told Fortune. “While our employees have always been held to a high-performance, impact-based culture, this new direction allows for more frequent feedback and recognition in a more efficient way.” The memo outlined the predicted distribution of outcomes and pay multipliers for base bonuses. About 20% of employees will be labeled “Outstanding” and will be eligible for a bonus double their pay; 70% will be labeled “Excellent” with a 115% pay bonus; around 7% will fall into the “Needs Improvement” category, eligible for a bonus up to 50% of pay. Around 3% of employees may be labeled “Not Meeting Expectations” and will be ineligible for a bonus. On the other hand, the system will reward top performers with bonuses worth up to 300%. The performance review update comes as other Big Tech companies have overhauled their performance review systems to better reflect employee performance. Amazon’s new review system asks corporate workers to list three to five accomplishments that reflect their best work. And in 2022, Elon Musk asked X (formerly Twitter) employees to explain what they accomplished every week. Meta is planning a company-wide meeting Jan. 22 to further explain the changes to employees. The new changes will impact the 2026 performance cycle and will not change the current review cycle. The new system will entail two review cycles per year, using the same rating system each cycle. As part of this new review timeline, bonuses will be paid out twice annually. Tech companies have increasingly sought concrete examples of output as proof of productivity, requiring that employees demonstrate how well they perform. While outcomes have been a longstanding cornerstone of corporate performance reviews, the new push toward output-based assessments reflects a growing desire among tech leaders to incentivize employees to prove outstanding performance. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has pushed to reduce management layers and to eliminate bureaucracy since taking over from founder Jeff Bezos in 2021. Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in 2022 that he was aiming to make the company more lean to promote “product excellence and productivity.” That has been the trend at Meta, where the tech company called 2023 the “year of efficiency” as the company scaled back headcount. In 2022, the company laid off about 13% of its workforce, or 11,000 employees. And last year, the company cut 5% of its workforce, or roughly 3,000 workers, targeting low performers. To be sure, an update to Meta’s performance review system is not a warning sign that additional layoffs are on their way. But Meta is set to announce layoffs this week in the company’s Reality Labs business, according to reporting by The New York Times, as the company scales back its metaverse unit. “We typically manage out people who aren’t meeting expectations over the course of a year,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said ahead of last year’s cuts. “But now we’re going to do more extensive performance-based cuts during this cycle.”

Title: This Analyst Says Advanced Micro Devices Will Soar 30% in 2026. Here’s Why It’s Time to Buy.

Investing Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock surged 78% in 2025. KeyBanc upgraded AMD to Overweight with a $270 price target citing 30% upside. AMD’s server CPUs are nearly sold out for 2026. Average selling prices may increase 10% to 15% in Q1. Analyst forecasts AMD AI revenue will reach $14B to $15B in 2026 driven by MI355 and MI455 accelerator shipments. Sending You to Google News in 3 © HelloRF Zcool / Shutterstock.com Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock climbed 78% in 2025, driven by growing adoption of its artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators and expectations for next-generation products. The company’s Instinct MI300 series gained market share in data centers, competing against Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). At CES 2026 earlier this month, AMD showcased advancements like the Helios AI platform and previews of future chips, signaling it was continuing to innovate and not rest on its laurels. This morning, KeyBanc analyst John Vinh upgraded AMD to Overweight with a $270 per share price target, implying 30% upside from yesterday’s closing price, citing sold-out server CPUs and strong hyperscaler demand. He forecasts at least 50% growth in AMD’s server CPU business and $14 billion to $15 billion in AI revenue for 2026. With these drivers pushing it forward, AMD has significant tailwinds that may propel shares beyond a mere 30% gain. KeyBanc’s note followed an Asia supply-chain trip revealing robust demand for AMD’s AI and data-center products. The firm noted AMD’s server CPUs are nearly sold out for 2026, prompting a potential 10% to 15% increase in average selling prices in the first quarter. This tightness stems from hyperscalers ramping up AI infrastructure investments, who are projected to spend over $600 billion in capital expenditures (capex) in 2026, a 36% increase from 2025, primarily on AI infrastructure. The analyst expects AMD’s server CPU revenue to grow at least 50% year-over-year in 2026, fueled by the EPYC line’s adoption. In Q3, AMD’s fifth-generation Epyc Turin CPUs accounted for over half of all Epyc-related revenue. Similarly, AI-related revenue is forecast to hit $14 billion to $15 billion this year, boosted by shipments of the MI355 accelerator and a major ramp in the MI455-powered Helios platform. Earnings estimates were raised to $4.01 per share for 2025 and $7.93 for 2026, up from prior forecasts. AMD’s valuation justifies the $270 target price, based on 34 times the 2026 earnings estimate. AMD trades at 32 times consensus 2026 earnings, compared to peers at 27 times, reflecting its growth premium. The note also highlights tight memory supply pressuring PCs but benefiting AMD’s margins through a data center shift, aligning with the upgrade the analyst gave for Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and indicating overall semiconductor strength. At CES 2026, AMD unveiled the Helios rack-scale platform, integrating 72 Instinct MI455X accelerators, EPYC Venice CPUs on 2 nanometer (nm) Zen 6 architecture, and Pensando Vulcan NICs. This setup delivers up to 3 AI exaflops per rack, targeting trillion-parameter AI model training with high bandwidth and efficiency. Helios matches Nvidia’s NVL72 in scale but emphasizes memory richness and cost-effectiveness through the open source ROCm software stack. The company also previewed the Instinct MI500 series for 2027, built on CDNA 6 architecture with 2nm process and HBM4E memory. It promises up to 1,000 times the AI performance of the MI300X through architectural enhancements, FP4 formats, faster interconnects, and improved memory. These announcements position AMD to challenge Nvidia in AI inference and enterprise deployments, appealing to buyers seeking open standards over proprietary systems. The MI500 series’ projected performance leap addresses escalating AI demands, with global compute capacity expected to reach 10 yottaflops in five years. A yottaflop is one septillion — a 1 followed by 24 zeros — floating-point operations per second. Zen 6 CPUs on 2nm enhance efficiency, supporting data-center expansions. Roadmaps show AMD launching Zen 6 this year and Medusa APUs in 2027, bolstering the PC and embedded markets. Partnerships with OpenAI, Luma AI, and others underscore its ecosystem’s growth. These developments narrow the gap with Nvidia’s 92% market share, potentially capturing more in cost-sensitive segments. AMD’s focus on scalable, efficient AI positions it for gains for years to come as infrastructure spending expands. Analysts maintain a Moderate Buy consensus on AMD, with a consensus price target of $277 per share — higher than even KeyBanc’s target and implying 33% upside. After AMD’s November earnings report, firms like Melius Research, Raymond James, Wells Fargo, and multiple others set targets at $300 or much higher. With strong product demand and next-gen developments like MI500 on the horizon, price targets below $300 will appear quaint in three to five years, meaning you should be buying AMD stock now.

Title: What’s Going On With Bitcoin And The Stock Market? Analyst Breaks It Down

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Bitcoin (BTC) and the stock market have experienced sharp price swings and declines since 2025. Because of this volatility, a crypto analyst has warned that the market correction could intensify further in 2026. In a detailed analysis, he outlines a bearish scenario for Bitcoin, suggesting the flagship cryptocurrency could soon face another price crash amid persistent downward pressure in the broader stock market. Market analyst Doctor Profit has raised concerns about the direction of the crypto and traditional markets, warning that both Bitcoin and stocks are currently in a severe bear market. In a technical breakdown on X this Monday, the expert highlighted three major bearish setups forming simultaneously in Bitcoin. He highlighted a massive Bearish Divergence on the weekly and monthly charts, a clear bearish flag signaling a potential drop toward $70,000, and a possible Head and Shoulder pattern that could still play out. While he acknowledged that Bitcoin could still experience short-term price increases and briefly rise toward the $97,000-$107,000 range due to strong liquidity, he said that the ultimate target remains $70,000. Doctor Profit emphasized that Bitcoin’s potential decline to $70,000 could go two ways. It could either break out of the bearish flag to that downside target or complete the Head and Shoulders pattern before reaching $70,000. He stated that he will not add new short positions at current prices but plans to increase them aggressively from $115,000 to $125,000 if Bitcoin moves into the $97,000 to $107,000 range. The analyst painted a similarly grim picture for the stock market. He said he was “ultra-bearish” on both Bitcoin and the financial system. He also noted that the banks are stressed and that forced liquidations in precious metals like Silver are creating ripples across the broader market. Additionally, Doctor Profit noted that insider activity shows clear signs of panic among investors, with record levels of selling since August 2025. Because of this, the analyst believes that the market is heading for a 2008-style crash. Consequently, he has concluded that the current market conditions are too extreme. On the bright side, Doctor Profit said that although he maintains short positions on stocks and Bitcoin, he remains bullish on Gold and Silver. He explained that any upside to the $97,000-$107,000 range will prompt him to increase his short exposure and roll spot profits for BTC from $85,000 into these positions. Toward the end of his analysis, Doctor Profit discussed upcoming events that could influence Bitcoin and the broader financial markets this week. He stated that the US CPI inflation forecast of 2.7% will be released this Tuesday. Other than this, the rest of the week is expected to have few market-moving events. Doctor Profit has also highlighted January 15 as an important date because US lawmakers will vote on the CLARITY Act. He explained that if the bill passes, it will move closer to becoming law, setting clear rules and oversight for the crypto market.

Title: Meta Reportedly Laying Off More Than 10% Of Reality Labs
URL: https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-reportedly-laying-off-over-10-of-reality-labs/
Time Published: 2026-01-13T16:06:21Z
Full Content:
Meta is laying off around 10% of its Reality Labs division, specifically targeting VR and Horizon Worlds, The New York Times reports. Reality Labs, if you're unaware, is the division of Meta behind its Quest headsets, Horizon software, smart glasses, and sEMG wristband, as well as researching future technologies such as Codec Avatars and true AR glasses. The New York Times estimates Reality Labs at roughly 15,000 staff, suggesting that more than 1500 could be losing their job. Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth has scheduled an all-hands meeting for tomorrow, both the NYT and Business Insider claim, describing it as the “most important” of the year. The report comes just over a month after Meta officially confirmed "shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward AI glasses and Wearables", a statement which itself followed early reports of the cuts from The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and Business Insider. "Within our overall Reality Labs portfolio we are shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward AI glasses and Wearables given the momentum there," last month's statement read. "We aren't planning any broader changes than that." With the layoffs reportedly taking place this week, we'll bring you updates as we learn of Meta staff affected. Meta's funding shift from Horizon Worlds and VR to smart glasses is happening just over a year after a leaked memo from Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth told Reality Labs staff that 2025 will determine whether their projects are "the work of visionaries or a legendary misadventure". In the memo, Bosworth described 2025 as "the most critical year in my 8 years at Reality Labs", and told staff they "need to drive sales, retention, and engagement across the board but especially in MR". Note that at the time, Meta was using MR to refer to VR too, a nomenclature that it ended earlier this year. "And Horizon Worlds on mobile absolutely has to break out for our long term plans to have a chance", Bosworth followed that sentence with. Since then, Reality Labs saw its highest-ever quarterly revenue in Q4 2024 with the launch of Quest 3S, which was the top-selling console on Amazon US for Christmas. But this momentum did not carry through into 2025 at all. The first two quarters of 2025 saw Quest sales decline year-over-year, revealing that while Quest 3S was a popular stocking stuffer, it simply is not a successful year-round product. While Q3 saw a rebound, Meta explained that this was due to retailers stocking up on Quest 3S for this year's holiday season. Meanwhile, Meta has continued to push its Horizon Worlds "metaverse" platform with multi-million-dollar creator competitions, especially focused on smartphone-only worlds, as the company hopes to scale the platform from a social VR space to a cross-platform Roblox and Fortnite competitor. This relative stagnation in Meta's Quest and Horizon Worlds effort is contrasted with skyrocketing sales and significant public and investor interest in its smart glasses. In multiple earnings calls last year, Meta's partner EssilorLuxottica said that the Ray-Ban Meta glasses were performing "exceptionally well", with sales having more than tripled compared to 2024. Both companies have claimed to be selling many models as fast as they can make them. Meta has also claimed "unprecedented demand" for its higher-end Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, recently announcing a delay of its international expansion plans to catch up with US production. UPDATE: UploadVR can confirm that the layoffs include the closure of Twisted Pixel Games (Deadpool VR), Sanzaru Games (Asgard's Wrath), and Armature Studio (Resident Evil 4 VR). UPDATE 2: Meta announced that its VR/MR fitness service Supernatural will no longer receive any "new content or feature updates". Get a weekly summary of the most important VR and AR news.

Company Name Bradwell Elevator Pitch Bradwell is a complete AI workspace for solo and small law firms looking to move faster, integrating domain-specific legal AI into daily practice.

It gives smaller firms big-firm AI capabilities without the overhead through an orchestration layer of specialized AI agents. Bradwell learns your standards and prior work to suggest next steps, clauses, and tailored client-ready service offers. What makes your company unique or innovative? Provides solo and small legal teams with secure top AI capabilities. Bradwell delivers specialized legal AI to small practices without IT integration, onboarding, or any heavy lift.

Personalizes legal AI to your practice, learning your clause preferences, positions, tone, and prior work so drafts and redlines match your standards. Start for free, get instant value. No demo or credit card required. Start a free trial immediately and get top legal AI at your fingertips. What problem does your product solve? Most solo and small-firm attorneys are relying on generic LLMs (like ChatGPT) outside of their working environment (e.g., Microsoft Word), because the most advanced legal AI is largely being built for large teams, such as Am Law 100 firms and S&P 500 legal departments. That leaves lean legal teams with a tough choice: use general-purpose AI that isn’t designed for legal workflows, or spend time piecing together tools and prompts, then rechecking everything to meet professional standards. Bradwell closes that gap by making top-tier, domain-specific legal AI accessible to solo and lean firms. Built by a team of former practicing attorneys and AI experts, Bradwell handles multi-step complex legal work and adapts to how you practice over time. Who are your competitors? Bradwell competes with four categories of tools: Where Bradwell wins is as an AI-native environment built to learn and mirror a firm’s institutional knowledge directly within Word.

We’ll invest in integrations with the tools lawyers already live in (e.g., Microsoft 365 and CRMs), and scale distribution through partnerships and product awareness. As we expand, we’ll keep a lawyer-first product roadmap, adding new workflows and practice-area modules, while building customer success that drives sustained adoption and long-term expansion. Have you received outside funding? $1M – $5M in outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. Bradwell is female-founded and female-led, as both co-founders are women!

We run the team on clear norms: be kind, be sharp, and do remarkable work. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? At Bradwell, we’re building legal technology that works for any legal professional, and we take pride in the following: Through these efforts, we aim not only to make an impact within our company, but also to inspire the broader legal tech ecosystem. Anything else you’d like us to know? N/A. Company Name Candle AI Elevator Pitch Candle AI is the legal email assistant that helps small and mid-sized law firms eliminate email overload freeing up hours for higher-value work. It works right inside Outlook/Gmail and 1) instantly pulls client and case details from systems like Clio and Filevine into the inbox, 2) drafts accurate, context-aware replies in second, and 3) manages email templates so you can respond to clients faster. Lawyers and paralegals save up to 90 mins per day on email and respond to clients up to 75% faster. What makes your company unique or innovative? While most legal AI tools require lawyers to leave their inbox, navigate case systems, and learn complex prompts, Candle brings the legal workspace directly into Outlook and Gmail, where legal teams already do a lot of their work, so there’s no workflow change. Our AI leverages firm-specific data, templates, and systems, reducing risk while improving accuracy and compliance. We turn email from one of the biggest time drains in a law firm into a revenue-driver and client service advantage. This helps reduce non-billable time and enables law firms to provide alternative billable models which focus on efficiency and productivity. What problem does your product solve? Attorneys spend a large portion of their day on email (up to 66%), constantly switching between inbox, case management systems, and documents. This leads to a loss of focus, lost billable time, and slower client responses. Candle significantly reduces context switching and drafts accurate email responses instantly, helping legal teams work faster and stay focused. We are also focused on empowering small and mid-size law firms and giving them a competitive advantage through Candle AI. Who are your competitors? There are general AI email assistants such as Superhuman, Copilot and Gemini which focus on individual productivity but are not designed for law firm workflows or shared case context. There are also legal specific tools such as Vesence and August that offer Outlook and Microsoft-based integrations and helpful assistance with email composition and summarizing. Candle AI takes a different approach by treating email as the central workspace for a lot of legal work. Most client communication and case activity already happen in the inbox. By integrating directly with systems such as Clio, Filevine, CasePeer, and INSZoom, Candle AI brings fuller matter context into Outlook and Gmail and connects email to the firm’s systems of record. This allows Candle to automate client communication and support legal teams beyond drafting and summarizing.

Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Our primary goal within the next year is to refine the product and spread through Texas. Following Texas, we will have state specific features for the top five states for the legal community (TX, IL, NY, CA, FL). Following a commanding presence within the Big 5, we will spread to where we are most needed in the US. We are also looking at relationships with lawyers in India but that may not materialize within the next five years depending on revenue. Have you received outside funding? No outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. The primary owner is an African American man. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? Anything else you’d like us to know?

We have since changed our name to CaseCreate, refined our branding, and cleaned up our web functionality so we are ready for this year. Company Name ChronoTracer Elevator Pitch ChronoTracer helps litigators and investigators easily master the facts of their case. It automatically creates a complete, defensible chronology from evidence, transforming emails, texts, social media, call logs, media files, and other formats into structured events. With deterministic extraction and instant, intuitive filtering, teams surface what matters immediately and stop wasting weeks building chronologies by hand. What makes your company unique or innovative? ChronoTracer is the only platform that begins with a full chronology rather than an empty container. It automatically assembles comprehensive, source-linked events across every major evidence type with no hallucinations or guesswork. Automatic, deterministic extraction lets ChronoTracer reach tens of millions of events – something manual, drag-and-drop tools simply can’t do. It requires no integrations, is easy to adopt, and offers fast onboarding, minimal training, and SOC 2–aligned controls. What problem does your product solve? Even with modern e-discovery systems, building a factual chronology remains a slow, manual task. Teams spend countless hours stitching together communications, phone logs, and documents just to understand what happened and when. This slows strategy, obscures patterns, and forces costly, repetitive review cycles. ChronoTracer eliminates that bottleneck by generating a full, structured chronology automatically—and then making it effortless to filter and search for exactly the events, custodians, channels, time periods, or themes teams need. Instead of hunting through evidence, users get clarity on day one instead of week six. Who are your competitors? ChronoTracer competes with spreadsheets and other manual chronology-building approaches, e-discovery and fact-management platforms that require drag-and-drop timelines, digital forensic consultants who produce reports with specialized tools, and various start-ups focused on fact organization. These alternatives rely heavily on human effort, limiting accuracy, slowing insight, and capping the volume they can handle. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://www.loom.com/share/e09d14d2bb1d40ae8eeda303771a7686 When was the company founded? 2025-01-01. Where is the company located? Austin, Tex. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Large and medium-sized law firms and boutique litigation firms that handle cases with high evidence volumes; investigation teams; corporate legal departments; and government. What is the price of your product or service? Ranges from $5k-$20k per month depending on evidence complexity and volume. Tell us more about your traction. We have supported several large high-profile cases, including an FCPA case, a federal public corruption case and a state RICO case. We are also supporting complex civil cases, internal investigations and international arbitrations. Customers have told us that they could not have handled some of these cases without ChronoTracer. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Over the next five years, ChronoTracer will grow through a mix of direct sales and strategic partnerships. We are currently focused on selling directly to law firms handling complex litigation and investigations. In the coming year, we will expand distribution by partnering with e-discovery service providers and selling directly to corporate legal departments for internal investigations and compliance matters. As the platform matures, we will also work with government contractors to introduce ChronoTracer to investigative agencies, attorneys general, regulators, auditors, and prosecution teams. This multi-channel strategy positions ChronoTracer to become the standard chronology solution across the legal and investigative ecosystem. Have you received outside funding? No outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. Our five-person core team is meaningfully diverse. We include individuals from different religious traditions, ethnic backgrounds, genders, national origins, and sexual orientations. These varied perspectives shape how we build ChronoTracer and how we support our customers. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? As a young company, our broader community impact is still developing, but we aim to contribute meaningfully over time. As we grow, we plan to support pro bono litigation and the legal teams pursuing cases that align with our values. Anything else you’d like us to know? I attended last year’s event and the startup showcase, and it was clear how valuable the forum is for new legal technology providers. We would welcome the opportunity to introduce ChronoTracer to this year’s audience. Company Name CollBox. Elevator Pitch CollBox helps law firms get paid 40% faster without turning lawyers into bill collectors. We automate and manage accounts receivable using smart reminders, integrated workflows, and a human-first approach that reduces write-offs, shortens payment cycles, and improves cash flow—while preserving client relationships. $100M+ recovered for small to mid-sized firms. Awarded Best Business of Law App in the 2025 Clio Integration Awards. What makes your company unique or innovative? CollBox is unique because we don’t treat accounts receivable as a software-only problem. Most legal tools stop at sending reminders. CollBox combines intelligent automation with trained, U.S.-based A/R specialists who step in when automation alone isn’t enough. Our platform is purpose-built for law firms, integrating directly into their billing workflows and applying proven collections strategies that preserve client relationships. This hybrid model, AI-assisted automation plus human follow-up, helps firms get paid faster without asking attorneys or staff to become bill collectors. We’ve modernized a critical but neglected function in legal operations by making collections proactive, measurable, and client-friendly. What problem does your product solve? Law firms struggle to get paid on time for work they’ve already completed. Invoices go unpaid, follow-ups are inconsistent, and collections often fall to attorneys or overextended staff – none of whom are trained or incentivized to manage accounts receivable effectively. This results in delayed cash flow, write-offs, administrative strain, and uncomfortable client interactions. Most legal software stops at sending automated reminders and offers no real strategy for collecting overdue balances. CollBox solves this by turning accounts receivable into a structured, proactive process—helping law firms reduce payment delays, recover more revenue, and eliminate the burden of collections from their legal teams. Who are your competitors? CollBox operates in a category that overlaps with, but is distinct from, several existing solutions. Our closest alternatives are law firm billing and practice management platforms (such as Clio, MyCase and Smokeball) that offer basic invoice reminders but stop short of managing accounts receivable or collections strategy. Some firms also rely on in-house staff or traditional collection agencies, which are either inefficient, costly, or harmful to client relationships – especially for work in progress or recently completed matters. Unlike these options, CollBox is purpose-built to manage the full accounts receivable lifecycle for law firms, combining automation with human follow-up in a client-friendly way. We don’t replace billing software or act as a collection agency; we fill the critical gap between invoicing and getting paid. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYKZcWJlYA When was the company founded? 2015-12-21. Where is the company located? Austin, Tex. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Small to mid-sized law firms (~3-30 attorneys). What is the price of your product or service? Starting at $599/month. ARPU is $775/month. Largest client pays $2,280/month. Pricing is based on the volume of clients a law firm bills in a typical month. They are then paced on a flat monthly subscription fee where they keep 100% of dollars recovered. Clean-up is available for older invoices for an additional one-time project fee (avg. of $10,000). Tell us more about your traction. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. CollBox is launching a new funding round in January 2026. The goal of this raise is to encode years of accounts receivable mastery from what is already the leading A/R solution for SMB law firms into an AI-driven operating system that gets law firms paid for their hard work and minimizes attorney & legal staff involvement – quickly, reliably, automatically. There is no clear leader in the market for solving the cash flow crisis that is rampant in SMB law firms and practice management systems’ features aren’t getting the job done. CollBox intends to define the accounts-receivable category in legal and cross $1B recovered for law firms by the end of 2030. Have you received outside funding? $1M – $5M in outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. CollBox is intentionally building a diverse, multi-lingual, and inclusive team across professional background, geography, and lived experience. Our leadership combines expertise from financial operations, technology, and customer service, including professionals who have worked alongside law firms. We employ team members from a range of geographic locations and career paths, prioritizing skills, empathy, and communication over traditional credentials alone. This diversity of perspective is critical to our human-first approach to accounts receivable, where prioritizing the dignity of law firm clients and maintaining respectful relationships matters even more than the technology we create. As we grow, we are committed to inclusive hiring practices and building a team that reflects the diversity of the legal professionals and clients we serve. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? CollBox contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community by lowering barriers to access for law firms that historically lack the resources of larger organizations. By making professional-grade accounts receivable support affordable and scalable, we help small and midsize firms—many of which are minority-owned, women-owned, or first-generation practices—run healthier, more sustainable businesses. We also prioritize respectful, client-friendly communication in our collections approach, reinforcing ethical, inclusive practices that protect both firms and the clients they serve. Internally and externally, we value collaboration, transparency, and empathy, and we actively participate in legal industry events, education, and knowledge-sharing to help firms of all backgrounds succeed. Anything else you’d like us to know? While founded technically in 2015, we created CollBox for law firms just 2.5 years ago when we launched our product into the Clio ecosystem, which earned us recognition as one of the best three new apps in the 2023 Clio Integration Awards. Company Name CounselPro Elevator Pitch CounselPro is the AI financial intelligence engine for legal professionals. We instantly structure years of raw PDF financial history (bank statements, check images, and credit card records) into audit-ready data. Whether tracing commingled assets or auditing bankruptcy filings, we replace weeks of manual entry with instant precision. Our platform delivers a source-linked audit trail, turning chaotic discovery into defensible legal strategy in minutes. What makes your company unique or innovative? While the legal AI boom has focused almost entirely on text (drafting, research, and contracts), CounselPro solves the massive, ignored bottleneck of financial data. We are the first platform to successfully automate the “forensic loop” for legal professionals. Our innovation lies in three key differentiators: What problem does your product solve? We solve the “Financial Discovery Bottleneck.” In high-stakes litigation like divorce, bankruptcy, and fraud, the “smoking gun” is often hidden within thousands of pages of PDF bank statements. Extracting this evidence is currently a broken, manual nightmare. Legal teams are forced to burn billable hours or paralegal budgets on “stare and compare” data entry in Excel. This is low-value grunt work that kills morale and destroys margins. Beyond the cost, this manual process introduces significant risk. Human review suffers from fatigue, leading to high error rates where critical fraudulent transfers or hidden accounts are easily missed. Existing tools fail to bridge this gap. OCR software merely provides raw text, while accounting platforms require pristine data to function. CounselPro solves the disconnect between “raw PDF” and “legal strategy,” eliminating the manual friction that makes financial cases so expensive, slow, and prone to error. Who are your competitors? Valid8, Docuclipper, Lido. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://www.counselpro.ai/watch. When was the company founded? 2024-07-01. Where is the company located? New York, N.Y. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Small to midsized law firms specializing in bankruptcy, family law, estate planning, accounting, and PI. What is the price of your product or service? Tiered based on usage, from $100/mo – $5,000+/mo. Tell us more about your traction. In the first six months of active selling, CounselPro onboarded 50 law firms entirely through inbound demand, with zero outbound sales. All acquisition to date has come from referrals, SEO, and GEO-driven discovery, indicating strong product market fit. Customers include solo family law practitioners, U.S. bankruptcy trustees, accounting consultancies, and teams working on complex federal civil rights matters. Adoption is fully self-service. Users discover the product independently, onboard without assistance, and see immediate value on their first set of documents. Revenue is driven by subscription and usage-based expansion as customers apply CounselPro to additional matters. The product is used on live cases, and multiple customers have described it as a “game changer” for financial discovery. Volume: we have already processed over $10B+ in financial transactions, proving our architecture scales to enterprise demands immediately. Retention: we are seeing rapid expansion within firms; once a single partner uses CounselPro for one case, it typically becomes the standard operating procedure for the entire firm’s financial discovery. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Our growth strategy is grounded in doubling down on the channels and behaviors that have already driven organic adoption, while expanding the surface area of the product within the legal ecosystem. We will continue to lead with a product-led, self-service motion supported by educational content that addresses real financial discovery problems. This includes practice-area-specific guides, examples, and workflows that help practitioners understand not just how to use the product, but how to apply financial intelligence more effectively in litigation. In parallel, we plan to deepen our presence at industry events where hands-on demonstrations matter, including ABA TECHSHOW and other practitioner-focused conferences. Live exposure to real documents consistently accelerates understanding and adoption. We will also pursue partnerships and integrations with widely adopted practice management and case management platforms that lawyers already use every day. Potential partners include Stretto, Clio, and Smokeball. These integrations allow CounselPro to fit naturally into existing workflows and reduce friction in how financial documents move from intake to analysis. Finally, we plan to expand the product’s analytical capabilities and supported use cases across bankruptcy, family law, fraud, and complex civil litigation while maintaining disciplined growth. Our goal is to become the default financial intelligence layer for legal professionals by making the product indispensable, rather than sales driven. Have you received outside funding? No outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. As a bootstrapped company, our leadership and workforce reflect a diversity of incentives and perspectives that are often absent in venture-backed legal tech. Because we are not constrained by VC growth mandates, predefined pricing models, or top-down product roadmaps, we stay directly aligned with the day-to-day realities of legal professionals doing complex financial work. This structure allows us to build alongside our users, not above them. Product decisions are driven by real practitioner feedback across firm sizes, practice areas, and geographies rather than by investor expectations. In practice, this results in more accessible pricing, faster iteration on real problems, and tooling that serves solo and small firms just as effectively as larger ones. We believe this proximity to the problem creates a more inclusive product and a more representative legal-tech ecosystem by ensuring that advanced financial analysis tools are not limited to firms with large budgets or enterprise buying power. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? We contribute to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community by lowering the barrier to advanced financial analysis for firms that have historically been priced out of it. Today, meaningful financial discovery often requires expensive forensic accountants, large internal teams, or enterprise-only software. That reality disproportionately favors well-resourced firms and limits access for solo practitioners, small firms, legal aid organizations, and professionals working in underserved jurisdictions. CounselPro changes that dynamic. By delivering court-defensible financial intelligence through self-service software and usage-based pricing, we make sophisticated forensic capabilities available to a much broader range of legal professionals. This enables more equitable representation for end clients and allows smaller firms to compete on analytical depth, not headcount or budget. We believe inclusivity in legal tech is not just about who builds the software, but who is empowered to use it… and who ultimately benefits from it. Anything else you’d like us to know? The legal industry is at an inflection point where AI adoption is moving beyond drafting and research into operational, evidence-driven workflows. Financial discovery is one of the major categories still dominated by manual processes and spreadsheets. CounselPro exists because this shift cannot be solved with general-purpose AI. It requires defensibility, traceability, and domain-specific logic. We believe this category will define the next wave of legal technology, and we are building the foundational platform for it. Company Name DraftyAI Elevator Pitch DraftyAI is an AI-powered drafting and case-prep tool built specifically for immigration attorneys. It helps lawyers generate high-quality USCIS briefs, motions, and support letters in minutes using their own templates, evidence, and jurisdiction-specific requirements. By automating the most time-consuming part of immigration practice, DraftyAI saves attorneys up to 60% of drafting time while maintaining attorney control, accuracy, and data security. What makes your company unique or innovative? Most legal AI tools are generic, prompt-based, or optimized for research – not real legal work. DraftyAI is immigration-first, built by practicing immigration attorneys, and designed around how cases are actually prepared. We combine guided workflows, template-based drafting, evidence uploads, and jurisdiction-aware formatting to produce filing-ready drafts. What problem does your product solve? Immigration attorneys spend 40–60% of their time drafting repetitive, high-stakes documents, often nights and weekends, because outsourcing is expensive and generic AI is risky. This bottleneck limits case volume, increases burnout, and delays filings for clients. DraftyAI removes drafting as the choke point in immigration practice by turning hours of manual writing into minutes, without sacrificing quality, accuracy, or attorney oversight. Who are your competitors? Our competitors include immigration-specific AI tools such as CaseBlink, Visalaw.ai, Parley, Imagility, and Visas.ai, as well as general legal drafting tools embedded in platforms like Clio or Filevine. Unlike research-focused or form-centric tools, DraftyAI is purpose-built for immigration case preparation and drafting, with an emphasis on real attorney workflows, template control, and filing-ready output. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://www.draftyai.com. When was the company founded? 2023-04-13. Where is the company located? Coral Gables, Fla. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? DraftyAI primarily serves solo, small, and mid-sized U.S. immigration law firms (1–25 attorneys), including employment-based, family-based, asylum, and removal defense practices. Our customers are firms handling moderate to high case volume that need to scale drafting and case preparation without increasing headcount or risking quality, compliance, or burnout. What is the price of your product or service? Various monthly plans starting at $250 per person. Tell us more about your traction. DraftyAI is a live, revenue-generating SaaS platform used by immigration attorneys across the U.S. We have dozens of active paying law firms and a growing pipeline driven primarily by founder-led education, referrals, and conference exposure. Customers report saving up to 60% of drafting time on complex immigration filings. DraftyAI has been featured in Bloomberg Law and the ABA Journal, selected for AILA’s Innovators Spotlight, and is actively used by firms handling high-volume, high-stakes matters. We are seeing steady month-over-month growth in users and engagement, with strong retention among firms that incorporate DraftyAI into their daily workflows. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Over the next five years, DraftyAI will expand from an immigration-specific drafting solution into a broader case preparation and workflow platform for immigration law firms. Near-term growth focuses on deepening value for existing customers through enhanced drafting workflows, collaboration features, and integrations with popular immigration tech stacks. Mid-term, we will scale distribution through strategic partnerships, CLE-driven education, and bar association engagement. Long-term, our goal is to become the default infrastructure layer for immigration case preparation, supporting firms as they scale volume, improve quality, and reduce burnout, while maintaining strict attorney oversight and compliance. Have you received outside funding? Less than $1M in outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. DraftyAI is led by a woman immigration attorney and immigrant founder, and was built alongside two co-founders who are also immigrants. We come from different professional backgrounds (law, engineering, and operations) and built this company through years of trust, collaboration, and shared values rather than a traditional startup pipeline. As immigrants and children of immigrants, our lived experiences directly inform the way we approach immigration law, legal technology, and the responsibility that comes with building tools lawyers rely on for high-stakes work. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? DraftyAI contributes to a more inclusive legal tech community by making advanced AI tools accessible to immigration lawyers who are often left out of traditional legal tech, especially solo and small immigration firms, many of which are led by women, immigrants, and first-generation professionals. We focus on affordability, ease of use, and education. That means transparent pricing, free trials, and free resources that help lawyers understand and use AI responsibly without needing a technical background or enterprise budget. Our goal is to make modern legal technology feel usable and safe for everyday practitioners, not just large firms. Anything else you’d like us to know? DraftyAI was built by immigration lawyers who have lived the realities of high-stakes casework, client anxiety, and burnout. Our approach to AI is intentionally conservative, attorney-centered, and compliance-first. We believe the future of legal tech isn’t about replacing lawyers; it’s about protecting their judgment, time, and well-being, especially in practice areas where the human impact is profound. Company Name EstateMin Elevator Pitch EstateMin modernizes trusts and estates departments. We replace pen-and-paper and fragmented processes with a structured, digital intake workflow that captures accurate client information upfront, reduces administrative burden, and improves the client experience from first contact. What makes your company unique or innovative? EstateMin was built to replace the pen-and-paper workflows still common in trusts and estates. Co-founded by a former Clio Product Manager, probate paralegal and a technical co-founder, we use AI to rapidly ship updates and new features based on real law firm needs. Since launching in September, EstateMin has been adopted by over 20 paying firms. What problem does your product solve? Collecting intake information for every asset, debt and beneficiary in an estate takes hours when done manually. EstateMin replaces this fragmented, pen-and-paper process with a structured digital intake, saving significant staff time, reducing errors, and allowing firms to start matters with complete and usable client information from day one. Who are your competitors? Our primary competitors are pen-and-paper intake processes and legacy workflows. In the software market, alternatives include Trustate and Decision Vault, with many of our customers having already converted from these solutions. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://www.loom.com/share/34b38e1f115440fb972a945ff85a370c. When was the company founded? 2025-09-08. Where is the company located? Boston, Mass. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Small to mid-sized firms with a trust and estates department. What is the price of your product or service? $99-$250 per month. Tell us more about your traction. EstateMin began in Ireland, where we secured early customers and validated the core intake workflow. To support scale, we prioritized deep integrations and partnered with Clio before expanding into the U.S. market. In August, we onboarded three U.S. pilot firms—100% of which converted to paying customers. Since launch, EstateMin is live with firms in over 10 U.S. states, supporting multiple users and active matters. To date, more than 70 estates are live on the platform, with law firms and their clients actively using the product. We have also had four one-call closes, where firms signed up and paid within a single 40-minute demo and are now active users. One Florida firm said, “I had high expectations and they have been exceeded.” Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Over the next five years, EstateMin will scale from client intake into a full estate lifecycle platform. Our near-term focus is growth within trusts and estates practices, with a target of 300 law firms by the end of 2026, representing approximately $950K in ARR. From there, we will expand into a digital estate vault, extending access to accountants and wealth managers. Using AI, the platform will continuously track and update clients’ entire estates during their lifetime, creating a shared, accurate source of truth across professional advisors. Have you received outside funding? Less than $1M in outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. EstateMin is led and co-founded by a female CEO. Diversity and inclusion are core to our leadership perspective and inform how we build, partner with law firms, and support the legal community. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? EstateMin actively contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community through both formal policies and everyday culture. We are led by a female founder, prioritize inclusive hiring and collaboration practices, and intentionally partner with and support underrepresented voices in the legal profession. Inclusion is embedded in how we build our product, engage with law firms, and foster an open, respectful team culture. Anything else you’d like us to know? In just three months, EstateMin has onboarded multiple paying customers, built a strong pipeline, and secured partnerships that position us for significant growth in 2026. Our momentum is driven by a highly complementary founding team combining deep legal domain knowledge, senior product leadership from Clio, and a technical co-founder with strong execution capability. We have also recently closed a small funding round to accelerate delivery and scale. Company Name EstateScribe Elevator Pitch EstateScribe is an AI-powered drafting platform built specifically for estate-planning attorneys. We turn a client intake data, interviews, and client documents into fully formatted, jurisdiction-specific estate plans in minutes, using context-aware automation designed, built, and tested within an estate planning law firm. From intake, to drafting, and client funding on the backend, EstateScribe automates the entire process, so attorneys can focus on what really matters, advising their clients. What makes your company unique or innovative? EstateScribe is the first AI-native drafting engine built exclusively for estate planners. Unlike tools that bolt AI onto legacy templates or offer a simple chatbot, we designed our system from the ground up to mirror the attorney workflow—starting with intake, continuing through interview mapping and logic validation, and ending with a fully-formatted, attorney-level plan. Our platform uses a hybrid approach combining deterministic legal logic, a proprietary knowledge map, and a context-aware generative model trained on structure rather than client data. Every edit, decision, and dependency across the matter is connected. When the attorney updates a key fact or changes a distribution scheme, the entire drafting system updates downstream provisions automatically and transparently. This makes EstateScribe the first tool that can actually think like an estate-planning attorney, rather than merely assemble documents. Streamlining intake, voice transcribing client interviews, drafting in seconds vs. hours, and always keeping the attorney in the loop is the core of the EstateScribe platform. While legal tech broadly is crowded, estate planning is uniquely underserved. Most innovation has focused on litigation, CLM, or large-firm workflows. Trusts and estates — especially for solo and small firms — remain dominated by legacy template tools and manual processes. What problem does your product solve? Estate-planning attorneys spend an enormous amount of time on repetitive drafting: combing through intake forms, reconciling notes, updating provisions, formatting long trust documents, and making sure every related clause stays consistent. Traditional automation tools require rigid templates, complex interviews, or manual exports into Word – slowing attorneys down instead of speeding them up. We built this while running an Estate Planning firm, so we know these problems because we’ve lived them firsthand. We found that almost 90% of our time was spent on intake and drafting, rather than the actual fun and useful part of running a law firm, which is spending time with more clients to ensure their plans are as effective as possible. EstateScribe solves this by eliminating the manual drudgery of intake, drafting, and client communication. Attorneys upload their intake worksheet or fill out our interactive digital interview, and EstateScribe generates a jurisdiction-specific, cleanly formatted estate plan that reflects attorney preferences, standard clauses, and state law nuances. The system flags and explains every AI-generated section, ensures consistency across all documents, and preserves attorney control. The result: faster drafting, dramatically fewer errors, and the ability for attorneys to scale their practice without burning out or hiring additional staff. Estate planning is one of the few areas of the law that consistently bills at a fixed fee rate, so the more efficient attorneys can be, the higher their margins or the ability to adjust pricing to have as competitive advantage in the market. My co-founder and I didn’t start this journey hoping to be legal tech founders, we started hoping to build a main-street law firm that could offer top tier estate planning for clients in our town. With all the amazing things happening in the legal tech ecosystem, we were ready to sign up for the latest and greatest AI product for estate planners, yet nothing came. After scheduling every demo out there and trying to wrap our heads around why no one was changing this industry like they were PI, Litigation, and Corporate Law, we decided it was time to do something about it. Who are your competitors? Our primary competitors are WealthCounsel, InteractiveLegal, HotDocs and other legacy drafting platforms. We have competition from the direct-to-consumer side from companies like Trust&Will.com, Vanilla, Wealth.com, Legal Zoom, and Estate Guru. We firmly believe in the importance of the estate planning attorney in the process. The estate-planning market broadly breaks into three distinct verticals, each serving a different customer with different incentives, economics, and risk profiles. 1. Direct-to-Consumer Estate Planning. Examples: LegalZoom, Trust & Will. These platforms sell estate-planning documents directly to consumers, typically at low price points. Strengths: Limitations: These tools serve basic needs, but they are not substitutes for attorney-led planning, especially as estates grow more complex. 2. B2B Through Wealth Managers/RIAs. Examples: RIA-embedded estate planning tools, advisor-led document platforms (wealth.com, vanilla, Estate guru). These solutions position estate planning as a value-add for financial advisors, often using attorneys behind the scenes. Strengths: Limitations: These platforms work well for select advisor-driven use cases, but they don’t meaningfully modernize how estate-planning attorneys actually practice law. 3. EstateScribe’s Vertical: B2B for Attorneys. EstateScribe is built specifically for estate-planning attorneys – not consumers and not intermediaries. We believe this is the most defensible and scalable segment because: Our approach preserves attorney oversight while unlocking efficiency, consistency, and scale. The majority of estate plans in the U.S. are drafted by solo and small-firm attorneys, yet this group has been historically underserved by both consumer platforms (too simplistic), and enterprise legal tech (too expensive and rigid). By focusing on B2B for attorneys, EstateScribe: This creates a structurally defensible position that consumer-facing or advisor-centric platforms cannot easily replicate. EstateScribe does not compete by replacing attorneys or bypassing them. We compete by making attorneys dramatically more effective, enabling them to serve more clients –including underserved middle-class families – while maintaining quality, compliance, and trust. A core principle of EstateScribe’s strategy is that attorneys must see us as partners, not threats. While the other verticals bypass the attorney entirely or reduce their role a post-hoc rubber stamp, we are intentionally designed to be the opposite. Demo Video URL (if you have one) N/A. When was the company founded? 2025-01-01. Where is the company located? Jackson, Wyo. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Small and solo estate-planning firms, boutique trusts and estates practices, and any attorney looking to scale without increasing staff overhead. Our platform is built for the 1–10 attorney firm where time savings, workflow efficiency, and document quality have an immediate and direct economic impact. However, we also see opportunity to address estate planning departments within larger firms to help increase the volume and capabilities in that specific niche. What is the price of your product or service? $350/month/seat (1 free paralegal, additional paralegal +100). Custom enterprise pricing for large firms. Tell us more about your traction. EstateScribe has secured pilot commitments from estate-planning firms in Wyoming and Texas – our initial rollout states – and has expanded into early interest from firms in Maryland and Kentucky. We recently secured a co-marketing agreement with 8am, providing us access to a broad distribution channel. We presented on the Solutions Showcase stage at Legal Tech Connect NYC, have been invited to meet with the Wyoming State Bar Estate Planning Counsel, and attended The Legal Tech Fund Summit 2025. Multiple firms are in our onboarding pipeline as we prepare for a public launch. Our MVP has already demonstrated the ability to produce attorney-level estate plans in minutes, dramatically accelerating drafting and intake workflows, and is in use at our law firm. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. In five years, EstateScribe will be the default drafting and workflow platform for estate-planning attorneys nationwide – trusted, embedded, and indispensable – while enabling firms to scale profitably and better serve the underserved middle-class market. We believe technology should amplify attorney judgment, not replace it. EstateScribe is built on the premise that senior legal expertise remains essential, even as drafting, intake, and workflow become increasingly automated. Our growth strategy follows a deliberate, credibility-first path: 1. Establish category leadership in standard to mid-complexity estate planning. We will initially dominate the $250,000–$15 million net-worth segment, where the majority of estate-planning demand exists and where inefficiencies most directly constrain firm growth. This segment offers the strongest combination of volume, repeatability, and immediate ROI for attorneys. 2. Expand upward without alienating the profession. Rather than positioning EstateScribe as “AI replacing lawyers,” we position it as infrastructure for modern estate-planning firms. As adoption grows, we will increasingly support higher-complexity practices by accelerating drafting, enforcing consistency, and reducing operational drag—without compromising attorney oversight. 3. Product expansion driven by real practitioner demand. Our V2 roadmap includes asset protection planning, complex irrevocable trusts, business formation services, probate automation, and related workflows. These expansions will be released incrementally, informed by real-world usage data and direct feedback from practicing attorneys—not speculative feature development. 4. State-by-state credibility, then national scale. We are launching in beachhead states (Wyoming and Texas), where our Chief Legal Officer is licensed and actively practices, ensuring product validity and practitioner trust. While the platform is architected for all 50 states, we will continue expanding through pilot firms in each jurisdiction to validate document quality and state-specific compliance. Our goal is nationwide availability by the end of 2026. 5. Relationship-led growth. Our core growth engine is user trust. EstateScribe was built directly out of an estate-planning practice, and we believe sustained adoption depends on deep practitioner alignment. As a result, our early scaling investments prioritize customer success and support. This approach ensures high retention, strong word-of-mouth growth, and a product that evolves alongside its users. We have unique insights from running an active estate planning practice and can sell to our customers better than anyone else. Our hope is for founder-led sales to get us established and growing exponentially until we can justify/it makes sense from a growth perspective to hire an outbound sales team. By combining disciplined market entry, practitioner-driven product expansion, and a clear respect for the attorney’s role, EstateScribe is positioned to become the long-term infrastructure layer for estate-planning firms nationwide. Have you received outside funding? $250k in friends-and-family round in addition to reinvesting our law firm revenue into the company. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. We are a first-generation founding team operating out of rural markets in Wyoming and Idaho – areas traditionally underrepresented in legal tech innovation. Our leadership backgrounds span law, trust administration, engineering, and entrepreneurship. We work with distributed engineering talent, including individuals from underrepresented groups in software development and law. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? By equipping small and solo firms with advanced drafting tools, EstateScribe expands access to high-quality estate planning for middle-class families, rural communities, and underserved regions that often lack affordable estate planning services. Our software enables attorneys who serve diverse demographics to increase capacity and reduce costs. We’re working on engagement with bar associations and are working with community-based practitioners to ensure that modern drafting tools are not limited to large or urban firms. Our goal is to democratize technology that historically required high overhead, expensive training, or large staff. Anything else you’d like us to know? EstateScribe was built because we lived the problem. As small business owners who learned to run and operate a law firm, we know how difficult, expensive, and time-consuming drafting and other manual workflows can be, and how deeply it affects access to estate planning nationwide. Our approach is not theoretical; it’s based on thousands of real client interactions. We believe estate planning is one of the most impactful areas of law, yet one of the most underserved by modern technology. EstateScribe is bringing true innovation to this critical practice area at a time when demand is rising, and attorney capacity is shrinking. Company Name Immediator Inc. Elevator Pitch Gut instinct, tradition, and billable hours currently drive the process in determining when to begin settlement negotiations in personal injury litigation. Immediator saves both sides time and money by applying data analytics to signal when settlement negotiations are likely to succeed. Developed by experts in law, data science, and insurance, Immediator is an AI-driven decision support tool that uses data, not speculation, to provide an objective method for evaluating optimal settlement timing. What makes your company unique or innovative? Litigation consumes time and money because decisions about when to negotiate settlement rely on instinct instead of statistical insight. Lawyers and insurers spend months debating when a case is ready to resolve, during which costs rise, reserves stay idle, and relationships strain under uncertainty. Immediator brings the discipline of data to the art of negotiation. Our neutral, AI-powered platform is the first of its kind because it provides an objective evidence-based measure of settlement readiness, a percentage we call PRISM (Probability of Imminent Settlement), helping both sides know when it’s a fruitful time to begin negotiation. Built by litigators, claims professionals, and data scientists, Immediator applies secure, legally engineered analysis that protects privilege, safeguards data, and delivers clarity professionals can act on confidently. The result is faster settlements, lower costs, and smarter decisions. Unlike systems that manage files or scrape data to create documents, and unlike human mediators who rely on intuition, Immediator defines a new category— settlement intelligence. Immediator does the job of a human mediator. Unlike a human mediator who parachutes in after the close of discovery and the expenditure of massive amounts of litigation costs, Immediator goes to work even before the lawsuit is filed, comparing the parties’ alignment on key issues to signal when to begin settlement negotiations, even if the optimal time is before discovery closes. What problem does your product solve? There is no system that tells plaintiff lawyers and insurance companies the right moment to settle, so insurance defense lawyers end up controlling the timeline. Plaintiffs (and their lawyers) and insurance companies are aligned in their interest in keeping costs down and resolving cases sooner. Defense lawyers are paid by the hour. This misalignment of interests often leads to unnecessary delays, unnecessary litigation expenses, and 55% of claim dollars lost to transaction costs. Immediator is the solution. Immediator uses data to detect the right moment for settlement and triggers direct negotiation between plaintiffs and insurers, preventing months of avoidable billable hours and other potentially unnecessary litigation expenses. Who are your competitors? Immediator has no direct competitors other than traditional human mediators. Most emerging legal tech platforms focus on facilitating communication or expediting document preparation, not determining settlement readiness. Immediator’s differentiation lies in using data science to model alignment and readiness objectively, while safeguarding confidentiality and neutrality. Immediator’s closest B2B SaaS competitors are Bot Mediation, EvenUp, Riskonnect, and Discover Docket. None of these tools offers neutral, data-driven predictive analysis of optimal settlement timing. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zngh4I7VEbs. When was the company founded? 2025-06-27. Where is the company located? Savannah, Ga. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Our target customers are liability insurers (and their adjusters) and personal injury (plaintiff) lawyers. The goal is to become the go-to platform for personal injury litigants by demonstrating time and cost savings for both sides. What is the price of your product or service? Immediator plans to charge an annual subscription fee per user and a separate charge per case/claim handled on the platform. The specific rates will be negotiated with the customers and subject to a specific user agreement. The prices will begin small, in order to build our customer base, and increase over time as our platform’s value to customers grows. Customers will be offered bundles to reduce cost. We anticipate that our product will become sticky, which will provide us with opportunities to expand our pricing to match its value. Tell us more about your traction. Every plaintiff lawyer we have spoken with is interested in the tool and many have become angel investors. We have reached out to one major liability insurance company so far (a company everyone would recognize by name and immediately know their slogan), and that company has expressed great interest. We are working on a pilot project with them for beta testing, data partnership, and ultimately as a future customer. The product is not yet ready for customers, so we have not pursued sales opportunities. We are focusing our energy on finishing the product and working with our interested partners. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Immediator plans a land and expand strategy. Initially, we will work to grow our customer base by selling the benefits of the platform to liability insurers, because Immediator ultimately has the potential to save insurance companies as much as 40% on their litigation costs, including hourly attorney fees and expenses. Plaintiff attorneys will be invited to the platform by the insurance companies. We plan to reach out to plaintiff lawyers independently to demonstrate the benefits and neutrality of Immediator. We will provide white glove service and inexpensive pricing to our initial customers so as to show them the value the product can add to their bottom line. We plan to offer software integration with the litigation tools already utilized by our customers so that adoption can be seamless. We will allow direct, encrypted communication and transmission of evidence and documents between the parties, with firewall protection preserving confidentiality and attorney-client privilege. The end goal is to make the platform so universally used and sticky that litigants and insurers cannot afford not to use it. Have you received outside funding? Less than $1M in outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. Two of Immediator’s four founders are women, and one is a U.S. military veteran. Maury Argento, a former captain in the U.S. Army, will be our CEO, and she has also served as our head of product development. Dr. Jill Ferdinands, our chief data scientist, created the algorithm we call PRISM (Probability of Imminent Settlement), and she will lead the company as it refines its AI-driven model as more and more data are obtained and analyzed. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? The heart of Immediator is its neutrality. Rather than utilizing the good old boys’ network or defaulting to gut instinct, Immediator will be the first platform to bring hard science and numbers as the driving force behind the decision when to begin settlement negotiations. The vast majority of human mediators are men. Immediator was created by women to replace the old way of doing business with rationality, as opposed to emotion. Anything else you’d like us to know? Immediator was conceived by our co-founder, Jason Crawford. He represents catastrophically injured victims, and he has practiced for over 32 years. Over that time, he has watched his clients’ recoveries be consistently diminished because litigation is so expensive. His goal has always been to put more money in his clients’ pockets by being a good steward of their case expenses, and a dollar saved to a client is even better than a dollar added to the settlement because a percentage of the latter is shared with the plaintiff lawyer. Reduced litigation spending makes a real difference in personal injury victims’ lives, but it also adds to the bottom line of the insurance companies. Understanding this fundamental alignment of interests ultimately led to the creation of Immediator. It also helped that Jason was married to a Ph.D. who specializes in data science. Company Name Lawdify Elevator Pitch AI-native evidence analysis and claims preparation for construction disputes, akin to a contractor-side equivalent of what EvenUp does for PI plaintiffs. A contractor drops project materials (contracts, emails, daily logs). Lawdify OCRs, parses and organises everything by parties, dates and issues (delays, variations) and generates a claim (or defence) pack with a fact-checked timeline, a structured claim/response, and flags for weaknesses in evidence. What makes your company unique or innovative? We are building the first AI-native collaboration platform purpose-built for construction and infrastructure disputes, designed to create a true network effect across the entire ecosystem: downstream users like law firms and expert witness firms, midstream claims consultants, and upstream in-house contractor teams. What makes us different is that we have engineered Lawdify from day one to work for global projects. Founded in Singapore and now expanded into Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, the U.K., and Dubai (with the US next), we have continuously tuned the platform to handle two realities that break most legal tech at scale: the idiosyncrasies of evidence across jurisdictions and the complexity of working across languages. At the core of the product is a dispute intelligence layer that turns project documentation into a living “Case Brain” of the contract: rights, obligations, and how they connect to change requests, time extension requests, and variations over the life of a project. Using graph and vector databases, we map and trace large volumes of evidence to claims, and track how the case narrative evolves over long time horizons. This gives teams a clearer, continuously updated view of what the contract says, what the evidence supports, and how the dispute is developing (across borders, languages, and stakeholders). We are the only AI tool with an Excel add-on that connects directly to the “Case Brain” behind the matter allowing for fact-checking massive spreadsheets (such as project schedules, progress logs, cost trackers, and payment applications) against thousands underlying emails, reports, meeting minutes, and other project records. What problem does your product solve? Lawdify solves the problem of inefficient, adversarial construction dispute resolution. Contractors often lose time, money, and margin due to poorly organised evidence, unclear claims, and late-stage legal intervention. Disputes cost the industry over $80 billion annually and take 13-18 months to resolve on average, driven largely by incomplete records, unsubstantiated claims, and poor contract compliance. By replacing fragmented workflows and costly legal prep with an AI-native, claims-ready workspace, Lawdify cuts down dispute resolution time, reduces legal fees, and gives contractors a faster, fairer path to resolving or avoiding disputes entirely. Who are your competitors? (Somewhat) Direct competitors: Indirect competitors in eDiscovery (Relativity, Everlaw, Reveal, Luminance) but they usually stop at review and only relevant when a construction claim has become a full-blown dispute rather than focus on dispute prevention and pre-dispute management. General copilots like MS Co-pilot, GPT Enterprise, Gemini Enterprise etc while they can draft claims given sufficient context, they are not really built to ingest and structure years of messy evidence. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://youtu.be/4lsf-J_K4lc. When was the company founded? 2023-09-09. Where is the company located? Singapore. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Law firms with construction disputes practice, claims consultants, and contractors. What is the price of your product or service? From $10K/year to $100K/year depending on size of the team, volume of documents, and complexity of the workflows. Tell us more about your traction. Working with some of the largest law firms in Asia specialized in complex and high value construction disputes, claims consultants, expert witness firms, and construction contractors. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Year 1 (2025). We are growing Lawdify by tapping into disputes teams in Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Japan that focus on high stakes disputes including construction. Year 2 (2026). We expand across APAC with law firm’s construction disputes and expand by pulling in the rest of the ecosystem on each matter (claims consultants, expert witnesses, and law firms) as collaborators on the same structured record, creating a network effect and repeatable referrals. We start US expansion focusing on mid-tier contractors. Year 3 (2027). We replicate this playbook to create the go-to platform for construction disputes with contractors based in the US that have global presence including in APAC. Year 4-5. We become the default disputes infrastructure for construction matters by standardizing these workflows across firms and experts, and extending from claims preparation into full-stack dispute handling (from intake through tribunal-ready filings) Have you received outside funding? $1M – $5M in outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. Eliza Jiang (CEO & co-founder): Chinese descent (Guangzhou native, native Cantonese and Mandarin speaker), culturally Latina since I grew up in Panama (Panamanian national, fluent/native Spanish speaker). First generation Chinese immigrant to Panama, first one to attend university in the family with international student financial aid. First lawyer/professional in the family and paid law school with scholarships and student loans. Lived and worked in Toronto, Ottawa, New York, China, Hong Kong, Singapore. Hong Kong permanent resident. Max Godoy (CTO & co-founder): Chilean national, grew up in the island of Chiloe in south of Chile, self taught coder and have been coding since 14. Trained as engineer and recruited by Singaporean aerospace engineering company. Lived in Asia, 2x startup founder of AI and blockchain analytics company. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? Lawdify contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community by expanding what “legal tech” serves and who it is built for. We are building from APAC outward for a global user base, not the other way around. That means supporting cross-border matters, multilingual evidence, and region-specific dispute processes so teams in markets that are often underserved by US-centric tools can still benefit from high-quality AI workflows. We also focus on a part of the legal ecosystem that is frequently left out of innovation: construction and infrastructure disputes, where outcomes affect livelihoods, public works, and small-to-mid-sized contractors. By making evidence organization, fact-checking, and claims preparation faster and more accessible, we help smaller teams (including boutiques and lean in-house groups) operate with capabilities that previously required large headcount and expensive systems. Finally, our collaboration approach brings together the full set of stakeholders on a matter (law firms, expert witnesses, claims consultants, and contractors) on a shared, structured record. That reduces information asymmetry and makes dispute work more transparent, consistent, and accessible across different teams, geographies, and working styles. Anything else you’d like us to know? We started a more general AI legal tech tool for disputes case preparation and have found a wedge and great use case in construction disputes, which is why we are doubling down on this industry. Company Name LawFi, Inc. Elevator Pitch LawFi offers flexible and customized legal fee financing options, allowing clients to access legal services while paying the costs over time. LawFi’s legal fee financing platform combines financial technology, a proprietary loan origination system, and utilizes AI to assess market and court data to determine the optimal term and loan amount for each matter. LawFi can approve a legal fee loan in minutes, not days or weeks. Now, lawyers can offer clients a better way to pay for legal services. What makes your company unique or innovative? LawFi is not a litigation funding provider investing in high-stakes contingency legal cases. LawFi is the first installment loan product specifically designed to finance legal service fees. Our proprietary AI-driven decision engine uses alternative data (employment, income, cash flow) to approve more clients, not just those with prime credit. We enable law firms to embed financing directly into their workflows, depositing funds directly into client trust accounts, transforming legal payments, and providing access to justice. What problem does your product solve? LawFi helps address the access-to-justice gap by enabling the 166 million Americans living paycheck to paycheck to afford legal representation. We remove financial barriers for clients who are either unable to pay upfront fees or prefer to finance their legal services, while ensuring that lawyers receive payment upfront. This approach increases the number of clients served and reduces receivables. Who are your competitors? Competitors include credit card companies, Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) providers, and general personal loan platforms. However, these traditional loan options are not tailored or customized for legal services. They do not underwrite the legal matter being financed, and often have higher costs, lower approval rates, and less flexible terms for legal matters. We differentiate ourselves from BNPL solutions targeting the legal market because (i) LawFi is the lender and underwriter; we are not simply a lead pass-through to a thrid-party BNPL underwriter or lender; (ii) Our technology enables us to approve a significantly higher percentage of applicants than BNPL solutions, by using open banking technology and cash flow underwriting allowing us to evaluate the ability to repay based on a broader range of factors; (iii) Our proprietary algorithms underwrite the legal matter being financed to establish what a matter should cost and the proper repayment terms based on the type of dispute, jurisdiction, market and court data; (iv) We provide law firms with an advanced platform and embedded finance tools and resources to quickly and easily add financing to their payment options; (v) LawFi has developed the first fully functional and bar complaint legal fee financing platform, not just a link found in a payment processor platform payout page; and (vi) Unlike a BNPL solution, LawFi has developed the first fully compliant refund policies that do not claw back fees or loan proceeds from law firms. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://bit.ly/lawfi_demo, Password: LegalFintech. When was the company founded? 2021-11-08. Where is the company located? LawFi is a remotely operated company with headquarters located in Jacksonville, Fla. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? LawFi customers include lawyers, law firms, and their clients (borrowers). LawFi can target the full spectrum of lawyers and law firms, from sole practitioners to large law firms. Our initial focus is on small to mid-sized law firms, solo practitioners, and their clients. We are targeting firms focused on serving the needs of individual consumers and small business owners, making loans for services in practice areas such as family law, trusts & estates, civil litigation, and other consumer-facing areas, as well as business law, transactions, and commercial litigation. What is the price of your product or service? LawFi legal merchant accounts are free to lawyers and law firms. We do not charge any set-up, implementation, or other subscription fees. Like other credit card networks, lenders, or BNPL financing options, LawFi only charges its law firm clients a Merchant Discount Rate (“MDR” or “financing fee”) on the total loan amount for the matters we finance after the firm has approved and accepted the financing and confirmed receipt of the funds in their account. Our fees range from 7.5% to 15% of the loan amount. Borrowers pay a fixed interest rate (significantly lower than other financing options) and a 2% loan origination fee, which is added to the loan amount and paid over the term of the loan. Tell us more about your traction. LawFi launched its platform in June 2025 at the 75th Annual Florida Bar Convention. We have developed a growing waitlist and have partnered with Cordell & Cordell, the nation’s largest family law firm, and others to offer our legal fee loans in a limited Florida rollout. We plan to expand the rollout across the entire state of Florida to complete our pilot program and then expand across the country. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. LawFi plans to scale nationwide by partnering with bank sponsors, credit unions, law firms, bar associations, legal payment processors, and other legal technology providers to expand its digital lending platform and AI-driven underwriting capabilities. We will continuously enhance our technology, broaden our network, and develop new products to support access to justice for millions of Americans. Have you received outside funding? Yes, LawFi has been capitalized to date by founders, friends, and family (angels), raising $3M in cash and significant non-cash contributions from team members. We are currently negotiating three term sheets for our first seed credit facility of $25 million, with an accordion feature to $150 million, to support our Florida pilot program. Additionally, we are preparing to launch our first institutional equity offering for between $5M and $10M. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. LawFi’s leadership team comprises professionals from diverse backgrounds in legal, finance, technology, compliance, and operations, with experience spanning major fintech firms, law firms, and financial institutions. We emphasize building strong, inclusive, and equitable teams. Our current team includes minorities and women. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? LawFi’s mission is to make legal services financially accessible to all, especially middle-class Americans and those who are underserved. By bridging the Access to Justice Gap, we empower diverse communities to obtain legal representation. Anything else you’d like us to know? LawFi is the inventor of the Legal Fee Loan and the only company offering a proprietary legal fee lending platform purpose-built for the legal industry. Our technology is designed to transform the way legal services are paid for and accessed, ensuring that everyone can obtain legal services regardless of their financial situation. Company Name LawQi Elevator Pitch The AI transformation is underway. It is undeniable, and its impact will be enormous. The firms, bar associations and legal workplaces that develop the legal professionals who drive the transformation will thrive. The ones that hesitate will be stuck wondering how it all changed so fast. LawQi delivers what most AI training can’t: true literacy, foundational competency, and actual behavior change. Affordably scalable for any organization, it equips the people who power competitive advantage. What makes your company unique or innovative? LawQi is where lawyers use AI to learn AI. Legal professionals build real competency through real work, not passive lectures or demonstrations. LawQi builds real AI competency. The first innovative differentiator is the learning method itself. The platform serves as both personal AI tutor and experimental workspace, where users master prompting techniques, test capabilities, and analyze documents in real-time through interactive discovery. This builds transferable skill and valuable AI understanding and intuition that works across any AI platform. Comprehensive modules cover AI fundamentals, advanced techniques, the tools landscape, and critical professional topics including liability and insurance coverage. Users navigate content at their own pace, and each lesson incorporates hands-on experimentation with immediate feedback to lock in and extend the learning. Core course material is supplemented by 100+ topic explainers in LawQi’s memory, drawn on to support answers and presented as clickable citation links when relevant to a learner’s conversation with the AI tutor. Our approach sidesteps the biggest pitfalls in AI training: LawQi delivers true AI literacy, foundational competency, and actual behavior change. The second innovative differentiator is the delivery model. A fully-managed, turn-key solution for bar associations, law firms and other organizations. Whether supporting larger initiatives or serving as the complete program for organizations lacking training infrastructure, LawQi scales to create true AI literacy, foundational competency, and actual behavior change organization-wide. For lawyers in small firms, bar associations are the institutions legal professionals trust above even their firms to prepare them for an AI-powered future. However, smaller bar associations lack the time and funding to prepare their members for the AI transformation, and larger bar associations lack the capacity for dynamic delivery, timely content creation and agile platform integration of emerging models. Among firms, smaller and many mid-size firms lack dedicated training staff. Meanwhile larger firms implementing specialized tools are too stretched to provide foundational training for their broader workforce. Whether supplementing larger initiatives within a firm or serving as the complete program for organizations lacking training infrastructure, LawQi scales to create true AI literacy, foundational competency, and actual behavior change organization-wide. The third innovative differentiator is the price. We price as low as $1 per member per year for bar associations and as low as $1 per FTE per month for law firms for organizations engaging our global platform (some conditions apply). Private instances, including the ability to incorporate the bar or firm’s learning materials and capable of customization to their priorities, are also available. The final innovative differentiator is our foundation. We built LawQi as the evolution of our experience developing and supporting the “AI Academy” programs of the Ontario Bar Association and Canadian Bar Association. Our technology partnership with Praxis AI means we deliver our programming on award-winning platforms that are battle-tested across major universities and enterprises – a leading-edge stack that combines pedagogical excellence with enterprise-grade security and scalability, from an organization profiled by Anthropic and described by them as “leading the AI revolution in education.” Our foundation speaks to our ability to immediately accommodate ALL associations and firms recognizing the AI transformation now underway and the urgency of equipping the people who power their capacity to meet the moment. What problem does your product solve? Poor AI literacy and competency among lawyers is now an industry-scale problem, and it calls for an industry-scale response. LawQi is the only provider immediately capable of delivering baseline AI training at an industry scale. No amount of webinars, pilots or even firm-wide rollouts of legal AI products changes the fact that the rate of AI advancement means that all facets of legal knowledge work and practice will be impacted in unknown and unknowable ways throughout 2026 and beyond. While some lawyers, firms and legal organizations are at the vanguard, most are at the starting line, unaware that a race has even begun. We have an urgent, mass-education need and a dawning realization that our traditional thinking and approaches to technology training takes us in the wrong direction when it comes to AI. I’d go so far as to say that lawyers in particular have at most 12 months left to develop a holistic understanding of generative AI in the context of what it means for the practice of law and administration of justice before the window closes for good. That’s how fast AI is evolving. If we don’t act, we risk the majority of our AI learning opportunities being reduced to those focused on operating systems we didn’t design, managing processes we don’t understand, in a transformation we never guided. It doesn’t have to be that way. The ultimate trajectory will be of our own making, but our collective ability to guide the transformation means we need a critical mass with baseline understanding of how AI works now. We don’t have that baseline yet because legal AI advancement, innovation and adoption has been sparse, diffuse, and either seen as optional or for the foolhardy. Our institutions (firms, bar associations, courts and legal departments of all sorts) haven’t embraced meaningful full-firm, full-bar or full-org AI training to build that baseline. Indeed, before LawQi, it wasn’t even an option. It is now. Who are your competitors? All CLE providers, whether private, bar affiliated, non-profit or commercial, and whether targeting individuals, firms or bar associations. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://youtu.be/6uDpwAgxBqE. When was the company founded? 2025-05-06. Where is the company located? Ottawa, Ontario. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Bar associations (or similar) of any size (from small county to the largest state bars), firms and legal organizations of 50 FTE (all roles) or larger. Our offering is scalable to organizations of any size. What is the price of your product or service? We price as low as $1 per member per year for bar associations and as low as $1 per FTE per month for law firms for organizations engaging our global platform (some conditions apply). Private instances, including the ability to incorporate the bar or firm’s learning materials and capable of customization to their priorities, are also available at higher price points. Tell us more about your traction. The first iteration developed for the benefit of the 16,000 member Ontario Bar Association (OBA) came in November 2024. Launched in beta as the “AI Academy,” it was conceived by Colin Lachance, then holding an appointment as the OBA Innovator-in-Residence, with a dual purpose of fulfilling his mandate to AI education for the OBA and for evaluating the potential of this particular learning approach. Following a content update and learning path refresh, its popularity among Ontario lawyers grew, as did demand from other Canadian jurisdictions for access. In July 2025, the 40,000 member Canadian Bar Association contracted with LawQi (the newly incorporated business that assumed management of the OBA AI Academy and now provides the distinct LawQi Global platform) to roll out the CBA AI Academy nationally (including assuming OBA’s financial responsibility for Ontario beyond the term of the prior arrangement). Throug the CBA, the AI Academy has been accredited for 2.75 hours of Ethics/Professionalism and 0.25 of substantive law. The commercial version of LawQi outside the ambit of the CBA relationship took shape over the early fall, with successful beta testing across multiple customer groups, and the go-to-market content and platform experience were finalized in early November 2025. Clients in pilots or anticipated to onboard in January/February 2025 include: placements at two national and three large regional law firms with a combined FTE of 4,000), state-wide availability to over 1500 team members across 50+ legal aid offices, roll-outs to teams of 50-100 of three different pro bono organizations in three different jurisdictions. Several other active client conversations likely to result in pilots or launches by the end of February include three state bars, two county bars, three trial lawyers associations and one legal insurance company (for the benefit of its insured attorneys). In addition, LawQi will be placed at no-charge in at least 3 law school classes. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Our goal for 2026 is to serve as many lawyers as we can. In a recent “Lawyers who Learn” Lawline podcast, we talked about upskilling 100,000 attorneys by 2030, but we are confident that we can (and must) go well beyond that in just 2026 to build the baseline competency we believe the profession needs. That is our sole priority for 2026 and we will keep our offering and price points in line with that focus. Beyond 2026, consistent and vocal user feedback from among our AI Academy and LawQi base highlights the high demand for experiential training in other aspects of attorney work. Our relationship with Praxis AI also reveals a number of promising avenues for ultra-personalized learning, professional development and even practice activities. We will closely monitor user feedback as it relates to demand for those services and plan for product expansion beyond AI training in 2027. Have you received outside funding? No outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. N/A. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? LawQi advances inclusion by partnering with bar associations – the institutions serving the entire legal profession, not just elite firms. Similarly, we also prioritize support of legal aid, pro bono and not-profit organizations through pricing our offerings to them at bar associations rather than law firm levels. Our bar association pricing – as low as $1 per member per year – makes professional-grade training accessible regardless of practice setting or resources. Solo practitioners, small firm lawyers, legal aid attorneys, and underserved communities access the same quality training as large corporate firms through their bar membership. This prevents a divide where only well-resourced organizations develop AI competencies while others fall behind. Bar associations serve diverse memberships across practice areas, geographic locations, and career stages. By empowering these trusted institutions to lead their members through the AI transformation, LawQi reaches the full spectrum of legal practice—from rural solo practitioners to urban specialists, from new lawyers to experienced practitioners transitioning to new technologies. The platform’s self-directed design accommodates diverse learning styles, experience levels, and schedules. Professionals navigate modules on fundamentals, advanced techniques, tools landscape, and critical professional topics at their own pace, removing one-size-fits-all constraints disadvantaging learners with different backgrounds or time availability. The embedded AI assistant provides personalized support, meeting users where they are rather than assuming baseline technical literacy. Legal professionals from non-technical backgrounds, different generations, or varied educational experiences all develop essential competencies—from prompting techniques to understanding liability implications—ensuring the entire legal community can participate in shaping the AI transformation of law.

Company Name LegalBridge Elevator Pitch LegalBridge is AI-powered case management built exclusively for immigration law firms. We automate the entire visa workflow: document categorization, cover letter drafting, recommendation letters, exhibit generation, form filling, client portals, case tracking, invoicing, and final export. Attorneys cut case prep time by 60% while doubling client capacity. Serving 70+ U.S. law firms, from solo practitioners to 20-attorney practices. What makes your company unique or innovative? LegalBridge is the only immigration case management platform with native AI across every workflow stage. Five core innovations set us apart: Unlike legacy platforms that digitize paper workflows, LegalBridge reimagines them. We built for AI-first, not AI-added. What problem does your product solve? Immigration attorneys face a crushing operational burden. Preparing a single O-1A or EB-1A case requires organizing hundreds of documents, drafting 20-page cover letters, generating dozens of exhibit labels, filling government forms, and coordinating with clients, employers, and recommenders across time zones. Most firms rely on outdated software designed before modern AI existed. The result: paralegals spend 15+ hours per case on manual document organization. Attorneys write the same cover letter sections repeatedly. Client communications scatter across email, text, and phone calls. Form errors cause RFEs that delay approvals by months. LegalBridge solves this by consolidating every immigration workflow into one AI-powered platform. Document uploads auto-categorize. Drafts generate from templates trained on successful filings. Client portals centralize communication and document collection. Questionnaires pre-populate government forms. Exhibit lists generate and reorder with drag-and-drop. The outcome: attorneys handle 2x the caseload without adding headcount, case preparation time drops by 60%, and RFE rates decrease through AI-driven consistency checks. Who are your competitors?

LegalBridge is founded and led by immigrants. Our leadership team represents India’s technology and startup ecosystem, bringing firsthand understanding of the immigration challenges we solve. The company includes team members from multiple backgrounds, gender identities, and regions across India and the U.S. Diversity is embedded into our lived experience and our product vision immigration is our founders’ personal story, not just a market opportunity. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? LegalBridge actively supports the immigrant founder and legal tech communities from diverse background through several initiatives: We host events for our community of 20,000+ immigrant founders and professionals, creating networking opportunities and sharing immigration knowledge freely. These events connect entrepreneurs navigating their own visa journeys with attorneys who can help. Our pricing structure democratizes access to advanced technology. Solo practitioners and small firms pay $5,000/year, receiving the same AI capabilities that larger firms access. This ensures immigration attorneys serving underrepresented communities can compete with well-resourced practices. We partner with immigration attorneys who serve asylum seekers, DACA recipients, and other vulnerable populations, offering discounted access to ensure technology reaches those handling the most critical cases. As immigrant founders building for immigration law, we are committed to ensuring this practice area, which directly shapes who gets to participate in American society, has access to the best possible technology. Anything else you’d like us to know? LegalBridge exists because three immigrants decided the system that shaped their lives deserved better technology. We built every feature immigration attorneys actually need: AI document categorization, document chat, client collaboration portals, AI-drafted cover letters and recommendation letters, drag-and-drop exhibit lists, email questionnaires, automated form filling, final export, case status tracking, one-click invoicing, and one-click retainer generation. One platform. No juggling systems. We bootstrapped without outside funding because we wanted to build for customers, not investors. Every feature exists because an immigration attorney told us they needed it. The immigration legal market remains underserved. Legacy vendors carry decades of technical debt. New entrants bolt AI onto old architectures. LegalBridge is AI-native from day one. We are profitable, growing, and obsessed with making immigration attorneys more effective. TECHSHOW recognition would accelerate our mission and introduce LegalBridge to firms still struggling with fragmented, outdated tools. We would be honored to demonstrate how AI transforms immigration law practice. Company Name Litmas Inc. Elevator Pitch Litmas is an AI powered tool designed specifically for litigation attorneys that digitizes the workflows litigators use to move a case through the litigation process, in one unified platform. Litmas AI enables attorneys to responsibly draft motions, pleadings, discovery documents, organize evidence and conduct in-context verifiable case law research. This combination of AI enhanced workflows results in substantial time savings and greater accuracy and visibility. What makes your company unique or innovative? Litmas AI is built for litigation, not general legal work. It connects facts, evidence, and case law into one drafting workflow instead of producing free form AI text. Every result is thoroughly traceable to source documents and cited authority, so attorneys can verify accuracy instantly. This makes Litmas usable in real litigations, where mistakes and hallucinated citations are unacceptable. What problem does your product solve? Litigation work is slow and manual. Attorneys repeatedly draft similar motions, pull facts from scattered documents, and double check research under deadline pressure. Generic AI tools make this worse by hallucinating case law and forcing lawyers to verify every single output. Litmas solves this by connecting facts, evidence, and precedent into a single workflow, reducing drafting time while maintaining professional reliability. Who are your competitors? Our competitors include traditional legal research platforms such as Westlaw and Lexis, AI assisted drafting tools, and newer AI legal assistants such as Spellbook or Clearbrief. These products either focus primarily on research, provide general AI chat experiences, or address isolated drafting tasks. Litmas differs by combining motion drafting, evidence organization, and case law application into a single litigation focused workflow. with fully sourced outputs designed for use in active cases.

Litmas was built based on practicing litigators input and logic every step of the way and is used daily on real life litigation cases throughout the country, today. Company Name PowerPatent Inc. Elevator Pitch PowerPatent is an AI co‑pilot for patent lawyers that turns invention disclosures and drawings into near‑ready patent applications in minutes. It automates first drafts, checks consistency between claims, spec, and figures, and flags patentability risks so firms can file stronger patents faster, increase flat‑fee margins, and free attorneys to focus on strategy, not slog work. What makes your company unique or innovative? PowerPatent is unique because it combines a highly automated, “full‑spec in minutes” drafting engine with built‑in diagnostics that continuously check quality, consistency, and patentability while you work.​ End‑to‑end AI drafting co‑pilot. Unlike tools that only help with snippets or templates, PowerPatent can generate background, summary, detailed description, and even claims from disclosures, figures, and part lists in a single, guided flow.​ The system is designed so attorneys start from an almost complete draft, then refine and strategize, instead of building the application from scratch.​ Embedded quality and risk checks. PowerPatent layers in AI‑powered consistency checks, functional‑claim analysis, and automated cross‑referencing between claims, spec, and drawings to catch gaps and ambiguities that weaken enforceability.​ It also uses prior‑art and Section 103 conflict prediction signals to highlight potential patentability issues early, making the drafting process more strategic, not just faster.​ Workflow and ecosystem integration. The platform integrates drafting, review, docketing, and USPTO Private PAIR connectivity, so firms do not have to juggle separate tools for composition, checking, and prosecution.​ Cloud collaboration features let inventors and attorneys co‑develop drafts, with AI suggesting additional embodiments and variations to broaden protection and reduce design‑around risk.​ What problem does your product solve? PowerPatent solves the problem that patent drafting and prosecution work in law firms is slow, labor-intensive, and margin‑compressed, by automating first‑draft generation and routine prosecution tasks so attorneys can spend more time on strategy and client counseling.​ Core problems for law firms Traditional patent drafting requires many hours of manual background, claim, and detailed description drafting per case, limiting throughput and making flat or capped fee work less profitable.​ Attorneys and staff lose time to repetitive tasks such as reusing boilerplate, aligning specs and drawings, and ensuring formality compliance across multiple jurisdictions, which increases turnaround time and risk of error.​ How PowerPatent addresses them For drafting, PowerPatent’s AI co‑pilot turns an attorney’s input (claims, invention summary, drawings/part lists) into a comprehensive first draft in minutes, including background and detailed description sections aligned with the figures.​ For prosecution, PowerPatent supports the full patent lifecycle by first turning raw invention disclosures into high‑quality, consistent applications that are easier to prosecute efficiently and strategically. During prosecution, it tracks office actions, automates responses, and surfaces metrics so teams can control cost and maximize term and portfolio strength. Once assets are granted, the platform helps map patents to products and markets, inform valuation and monetization strategies, and then periodically flag low‑value or non‑core assets for pruning using portfolio views and AI‑driven keep‑vs‑drop analysis.​ The system analyzes large patent datasets to propose accurate, guideline‑compliant language and structure, reducing drafting errors and downstream prosecution rework while allowing lawyers to focus on tailoring claims and legal strategy.​ Impact on law‑firm economics By compressing drafting time and automating low‑value steps, firms can increase associate productivity, handle more matters per attorney, and make fixed‑fee patent work more scalable and profitable.​ Cloud collaboration and workflow features let distributed teams and outside counsel iterate on drafts faster, improving responsiveness to clients and shortening time to filing without adding headcount.​ Who are your competitors? PowerPatent competes in the AI patent‑drafting/prosecution‑support space with a large and fast‑growing field of tools.​ Direct AI drafting competitors: DeepIP (formerly Davinci)​, Rowan Patents​, Dolcera IP Author​, ClaimMaster (AI‑assisted drafting and proofreading)​, Qatent​​, IP Author/IP Author.ai, Patently Create​, ipagent.ai​, PatentGPT​, XLSCOUT Drafting LLM​, Paximal​, Added Matter​.

Law‑firm and investor traction: PatentPC uses PowerPatent to streamline drafting and prosecution on active client matters, validating that the workflows support sophisticated U.S. practice and flat‑fee economics.​ Tran.vc applies PowerPatent across a growing portfolio of AI, robotics, and deep‑tech startups, demonstrating scalability from single cases to multi‑asset portfolios.​ Inventiv channels early‑stage founders into the platform, showing that it can compress time from disclosure to filing and support monetization‑driven IP decisions.​ In‑house corporate traction. Cisbay, Micronoc, Monolithic 3D, and IntraAction use PowerPatent in‑house to draft, refine, and manage patent filings more efficiently than with outside counsel alone, using automation to cut cost while maintaining attorney‑level quality.​ These internal deployments show that the platform works not only for law firms but also for lean corporate IP teams that need repeatable workflows for drafting, prosecution metrics, and portfolio pruning. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. PowerPatent plans to grow over the next five years by deepening product capabilities across the patent lifecycle, expanding into more practice settings (firms, in‑house, and government), and building a partner ecosystem that drives distribution and data advantages.​ Product expansion. PowerPatent will evolve from “AI drafting co‑pilot” into a full lifecycle platform covering invention capture, drafting, prosecution analytics, portfolio valuation, monetization, and pruning. The roadmap emphasizes more domain‑specialized AI models, richer automation for office‑action responses, and tools that tie patents directly to products, revenue, and risk so legal teams can make board‑level decisions from within the product.​ Go‑to‑market and customer segments. Growth will focus on three core segments: patent boutiques and mid‑size firms doing flat‑fee work; in‑house teams at IP‑intensive startups and growth companies; and eventually larger enterprises and public‑sector organizations that need scalable IP workflows. Channels will include direct sales to firms, partnerships with VC funds and incubators (leveraging Tran.vc and similar relationships), and integrations with existing IP management and docketing systems to reduce switching friction.​ Data, ecosystem, and defensibility. Over five years, PowerPatent aims to compound its data advantage by learning from anonymized drafting and prosecution outcomes to continuously improve drafting quality, claim strategy suggestions, and keep‑vs‑drop recommendations. The company will also pursue alliances with search, analytics, and IP valuation providers, positioning PowerPatent as the drafting and decision‑making layer that sits on top of the broader patent data ecosystem.​ Have you received outside funding? No outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. PowerPatent is led and staffed mainly by minorities, with a founding and core team that is Asian and African Americans, bringing perspectives that are historically underrepresented in both legal tech and the patent profession. This diversity shows up not only in ethnicity, but also in career background, combining patent attorneys, engineers, and entrepreneurs who have navigated immigration, first‑generation professional, and cross‑border innovation ecosystems. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? PowerPatent contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community by putting minority founders, inventors, and patent attorneys at the center of its product and ecosystem. The company is led and staffed entirely by minorities (Asian and African), and it actively mentors and trains underrepresented founders, students, and junior practitioners on how to use AI to access high‑quality patent protection without needing a large‑firm budget. PowerPatent also collaborates with minority‑owned firms, diverse startup ecosystems, and global technical communities, ensuring that voices from outside the traditional AmLaw and BigTech corridors help shape how AI is applied to patents and IP strategy. Anything else you’d like us to know? PowerPatent is built by practicing patent attorneys and engineers who live the daily realities of drafting, prosecution, and portfolio strategy, so the product is grounded in real‑world workflow and ethics rather than hype. The team is already embedded in the legal community through teaching, mentoring founders, and speaking on AI and patents, and views ABA TECHSHOW as a long‑term partnership opportunity to help solo, small, and mid‑size firms safely adopt generative AI. PowerPatent is committed to transparent, human‑in‑the‑loop use of AI, clear data‑handling practices, and continuous feedback from practitioners so that automation strengthens, rather than erodes, professional judgment and access to high‑quality patent representation.

Have you received outside funding? Less than $1M in outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. Well it’s really just me right now so I guess that inherently means zero diversity. 🙂 Kidding aside, I would say my background as a non-attorney with a product background from customer facing retail is generally diverse vs the traditional players in this market. Outside, customer-centered focus -> innovation. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? We are based in the heart of Atlanta which is extremely diverse and my office is a tech co-working space that is surrounded by diversity. I will likely hire from within this talent pool as we grow. Anything else you’d like us to know? I’m a father of two awesome kids that recently stepped away from a 20-year corporate career with The Home Depot with the last 15 years focusing on leading product management teams. I’ve had a long passion for wanting to solve customer problems and having gone through my own recent divorce I spotted an opportunity to make an impactful change. SayWell is taking a fundamentally different approach to improving coparent communication (and the fallout that lawyers ultimately deal with). The legacy providers try to stop parental fighting by documentation and eventual hand slapping. SayWell is an in-conversation moderator positioned to make a real impact on co-parents lives. Company Name SecureSplit. Elevator Pitch SecureSplit is an AI powered divorce financial platform for family law firms, mediators, and CDFAs. We replace spreadsheets and email with a single workflow for client intake, organizing income, expenses, assets, and debts, running state specific support and property division calculations, and producing clean, court ready financial reports that save time and reduce costly errors. What makes your company unique or innovative? Most tools in family law focus on documents, not the numbers. SecureSplit is built for the financial side of divorce, from intake to court ready reports, in one browser-based workflow. Both spouses enter data once, the system standardizes it, runs state specific support and division calculations, and flags gaps or inconsistencies with AI assisted checks. It is collaborative, multi state, and API ready, so firms can plug a modern divorce financial engine into the rest of their legal tech stack. What problem does your product solve? Divorce lawyers, mediators, and CDFAs are stuck juggling spreadsheets, PDFs, email, and outdated calculators to make financials court ready. This manual, fragmented workflow is slow, error prone, and hard to delegate, which drives up costs and stress for clients. SecureSplit solves this by turning messy inputs from both spouses into a single structured dataset so professionals can run support and division calculations and generate clean reports in a few clicks. Who are your competitors? Our main competitors are legacy divorce financial tools like Family Law Software, DissoMaster, and other state specific support calculators, plus the “DIY stack” of Excel, PDFs, and email that firms still rely on. We compete by offering a single, modern workflow that covers intake, calculations, and reports in one place. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://securesplit.com/investor-page When was the company founded? 2025-01-01. Where is the company located? Newark, Del., HQ; San Diego, Calif. and Greensboro, N.C. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Our primary target is solo and small to mid-sized family law firms, mediators, and divorce focused financial professionals (CDFAs and RIAs). Over time, we will expand to larger firms and law departments, but our initial focus is on the teams that live in the day-to-day financial details of divorce and need a faster, more standardized workflow. What is the price of your product or service? We use a tiered subscription model. Professional plans for firms, mediators, and CDFAs start around $100 dollars per professional per month, with premium and enterprise pricing based on seats, features, and overall size of the firm. The consumer version is offered as a separate low-cost monthly subscription on essentials.securesplit.com. Tell us more about your traction. We are currently pre revenue with approximately 50 professional customers using SecureSplit on live divorce matters, including family law firms, mediators, and CDFAs. Usage is growing through referrals and a waitlist of additional firms, and we are seeing strong engagement and feedback through regular product sessions and Fireside Chats as we prepare for full launch. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Over the next five years, we will grow SecureSplit by first converting our current professional users into paying subscribers and deepening adoption within their firms. In the near term, we are focused on launching in a small set of key states, refining our core workflows through design partnerships with family law firms, mediators, and CDFAs, and adding integrations to the legal tech tools they already use. As we prove retention and unit economics, we will expand to additional states, introduce premium and enterprise tiers, and develop advanced AI assisted modeling and reporting. Longer term, we will scale through channel partnerships, education and certification programs for divorce professionals, and a complementary consumer product that feeds organized cases directly into our professional network. Have you received outside funding? No outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. Our leadership team is gender diverse and comes from different professional and cultural backgrounds, spanning financial planning, divorce practice, AI, and customer experience. One founder brings 20 years in regulated financial services and divorce work, while the other has led product and CX teams in software. We also work with advisors across geographies, ages, and practice types, which helps us design SecureSplit for a wide range of families and firms. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? We design SecureSplit to lower the financial and technical barriers that keep many families from getting quality help. By standardizing the numbers work, we make it easier for smaller, community focused firms and solo mediators to serve clients who have been historically underrepresented or priced out of traditional advice. We are also building a diverse network of testers and advisors, including women led and minority led practices, and we intentionally use plain language, accessible UX, and remote friendly onboarding so a wide range of professionals can participate in and benefit from the legal tech ecosystem. Anything else you’d like us to know? SecureSplit is at a pivotal stage, with a functional beta in use by about 50 professional users and a broader launch ahead. We are actively seeking design partners among family law firms, mediators, and CDFAs who want to modernize the numbers side of divorce. If selected, we will demo live case workflows, share lessons from 20 years in divorce focused financial planning, and show a clear path from spreadsheets to a modern standard for financial disclosures. Company Name Simone. Elevator Pitch Simone Reception is an AI-powered virtual receptionist built exclusively for law offices. It answers every call instantly with a calm, professional, human-like voice, gathers intake and conflict-check information, and routes calls intelligently. Clients call when life happens. Simone will be there to answer. What makes your company unique or innovative? Simone is unique because it is built exclusively for law firms and designed around legal realities, not generic AI use cases. Unlike traditional virtual reception or generic AI voice tools, Simone is purpose-built for legal intake. It understands the structure of law firms, the importance of conflict checks, confidentiality, ethical boundaries, and the difference between a new lead, an existing client, a court, or an opposing party. Simone is not just answering calls. It is executing legal-specific workflows. It gathers structured intake data, captures names for conflict searches, routes urgency intelligently, and integrates directly into tools like Clio and HubSpot so information is immediately usable, not buried in voicemail or transcripts. What makes Simone truly innovative is balance. It delivers 24/7 responsiveness for clients while protecting lawyer focus and wellbeing. Clients get a calm, professional first voice when life happens. Lawyers and their staff get fewer interruptions, better data, and control over when and how humans step in. Finally, Simone improves over time. As a firm evolves, Simone adapts to its language, services, and priorities, becoming a smarter front door rather than a static receptionist. In short, Simone brings enterprise-grade AI capability to small and mid-sized law firms in a way that is ethical, controlled, and deeply practical. What problem does your product solve? Simone solves the problem of missed calls, interrupted work, and poor first impressions in law firms. Legal problems do not arise on a schedule. Clients often call when they are stressed, anxious, or in crisis, and many of those calls happen outside office hours or when staff are unavailable. When calls go to voicemail, firms lose potential clients, create frustration, and miss critical information. At the same time, answering every call pulls lawyers and staff away from higher-value work and contributes to burnout. Research on workplace interruptions shows that when professionals are pulled away from focused work, it takes an average of over 20 minutes to fully regain concentration. In legal practice, where work is complex and high-stakes, frequent call interruptions quietly erode productivity, accuracy, and wellbeing. Simone reduces that hidden cost by answering calls without breaking lawyer focus. Simone solves this by ensuring every call is answered instantly, professionally, and consistently, 24/7. It captures structured intake and conflict-check information, routes urgency appropriately, and integrates directly into firm systems so nothing is lost or delayed. Simone recognizes that every call is not a 1-minute interruption but a 20-minute productivity hit. The result is a better client experience, fewer interruptions for legal teams, improved lead capture, and a calmer, more sustainable way for law firms to stay responsive without being always on.

When was the company founded? 2025-10-01. Where is the company located? Toronto, Ontario, Canada Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Small, medium and large law firms. Legal Aid and pro bono services. What is the price of your product or service? Starting at $250 per month. Tell us more about your traction Our traction is early, but it is real and practitioner-led. Simone Reception is currently being actively used and tested inside a live law office environment (Evolve Family Law). We are not building this in isolation. It is operating in real conditions, handling real client calls, and being refined based on day-to-day legal workflows. We have validated three key things already: Our immediate traction focus is deliberate. We are prioritizing product quality, ethical guardrails, and legal-specific workflows before scaling sales. The next phase is converting this validated internal use into a structured beta with a small group of law firms, followed by broader commercial rollout. In short, Simone is already proving value inside a real law office, replacing existing paid solutions, and generating strong early demand. We are building on a foundation of real usage, not assumptions. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Our five-year growth plan is deliberate, phased, and grounded in how law firms actually adopt technology. Year 0–1: Product excellence and focused market entry Our priority is to become the best AI receptionist in the legal market, not the fastest-growing generic tool. We will focus on small and mid-sized law firms in Canada and the US, refining Simone Reception through real-world use, structured pilots, and early paying customers. During this phase, we will deepen legal-specific workflows, expand integrations with core legal platforms, and build a reputation for reliability, professionalism, and ethical design. Growth will be steady and intentional, driven by referrals, conferences, and partnerships rather than aggressive sales tactics. Years 1–3: Geographic expansion and platform maturity. Once Simone Reception is proven and stable at scale, we will expand more aggressively across North America, Europe and Australia. This includes deeper US market penetration, multilingual support, and stronger relationships with legal software providers. At this stage, Simone becomes not just a receptionist, but a trusted front door for law firms, handling intake, triage, scheduling, and payments in a way that feels seamless and human. Years 3–4: Product expansion within the Simone ecosystem. With a strong customer base and mature core product, we will expand beyond reception into adjacent AI agents designed specifically for law firms. These may include intake specialists, internal assistants, and client communication agents, all built on the same ethical and legal-first foundation. Existing customers become the primary growth engine, adopting additional Simone products rather than churning to competitors. Years 4–5: Enterprise adoption and global reach. By year five, Simone will be positioned as a category-defining legal AI platform. We will pursue enterprise partnerships with larger firms, legal networks, and professional service providers, while expanding into additional jurisdictions where legal workflows are similar. At this stage, Simone will be deeply embedded into law firm operations, with strong recurring revenue, high retention, and a brand associated with trust, calm, and professionalism. Throughout all five years, our guiding principle remains constant: We grow by solving real problems, protecting lawyer wellbeing, and improving the client experience, not by chasing hype or replacing humans for its own sake. Have you received outside funding? Less than $1M in outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. Our leadership team is diverse in professional background, geography, and perspective, which directly strengthens how we build and grow Simone Reception. Beau Atkins — Legal and Founder Perspective Beau is a practicing family law attorney and CEO of a tech-forward law firm in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. He founded Evolve Family Law with a focus on modern, client-centric legal services and technology integration, and he actively serves on legal innovation and technology committees. This gives Simone deep insights into legal workflows, ethical standards, client anxiety, and the real pain points lawyers and their clients experience with intake and reception. Beau’s lived experience as a lawyer driving process innovation directly informs how Simone is designed to support legal professionals. Sanjay Khandor — Entrepreneurial and Operational Leadership Sanjay brings entrepreneurial and business leadership grounded in technology delivery and growth. Based in Toronto, he has led ventures in digital services and operations, demonstrating success in building and scaling companies. His experience expanding businesses into new markets—including cross-border expansion efforts—enables strategic growth planning for Simone. Av Utukuri — Technical and Product Technology Leadership Av is a seasoned technologist with decades of experience in software and product development across digital systems, hardware, and embedded technologies. His background spans engineering, product strategy, and technology innovation, which positions Simone to deliver a robust, secure, scalable AI platform tailored to legal use cases. Geographic and Professional Diversity The leadership spans multiple regions of Canada, from Alberta to the Greater Toronto Area, bringing different market perspectives. This geographic spread helps Simone understand both regional legal practices and major urban legal tech ecosystems. The team bridges front-line legal practice, entrepreneurial business strategy, and deep technical execution, which is a rare combination in legal tech startups. Diversity of Experience and Perspective We come from distinct professional paths ranging from law practice, technology innovation, and entrepreneurial operations. These differences mean Simone is shaped by varied and multidisciplinary viewpoints, not a single discipline or worldview, and the product is informed by real users (lawyers and clients) and real technical constraints (secure, compliant systems). Each founder contributes a unique lens on problem solving, and that blend produces a more thoughtful, usable, and ethically grounded AI reception product. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? Simone contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community by lowering barriers to access, reducing bias at the first point of contact, and supporting healthier ways of practicing law. First, Simone expands access to legal services by ensuring that every call is answered professionally, regardless of when it comes in. Many people reach out to law firms during moments of stress, crisis, or vulnerability, often outside traditional office hours. By being available 24/7, Simone helps ensure that people who cannot call during business hours are still heard and treated with respect. Second, Simone is designed to reduce bias at the front door of the legal system. Human reception, while valuable, can be influenced by fatigue, assumptions, or unconscious bias. Simone delivers a consistent, calm, and professional experience to every caller, regardless of accent, background, or emotional state. Built-in multilingual and accent support further improves accessibility for clients who may otherwise struggle to communicate clearly or feel understood. Third, Simone supports inclusion within the profession itself. Smaller firms, rural practices, and solo lawyers often lack the resources to provide round-the-clock reception or advanced intake systems. Simone gives these firms access to enterprise-level capabilities without requiring large teams or overhead, helping level the playing field between small and large firms. Finally, Simone contributes to a more sustainable and humane legal tech ecosystem by protecting lawyer and staff wellbeing. By reducing constant interruptions and after-hours pressure, Simone helps create healthier work environments. A more sustainable profession is one that can retain diverse talent over time, rather than burning people out. In short, Simone promotes inclusion by improving access for clients, consistency and fairness at intake, and sustainability for legal professionals, all while being built intentionally for the realities of legal practice. Anything else you’d like us to know? Yes. Simone was built by practitioners, not observers. This product emerged from real frustration inside a working law office and has been shaped through live use, not hypothetical workflows. We are intentionally building slowly and responsibly, with a focus on trust, ethics, and real-world impact rather than hype or speed alone. We believe AI in law should reduce stress, improve access, and support healthier professional lives. Simone is our contribution to that vision, and we are committed to building it thoughtfully, transparently, and in partnership with the legal community. Company Name AutoDox Co., Ltd. Elevator Pitch While everyone builds chatbots, Sonar solves the real pain: formatting. Every lawyer knows the frustration: you inherit a document from a colleague, and spend the next hours fighting with the ruler, restarting numbering for the tenth time, or succumbing to the format painter’s dark arts. Sonar eliminates the pain with one click. Your house styles, applied instantly, perfectly, inside Microsoft Word. What makes your company unique or innovative? (1) Formatting-First Philosophy: Legal Tech goes AI-first. Sonar goes formatting-first. We’re the only legal tech solution that fully automates document formatting end-to-end—the bottleneck everyone feels but nobody addresses. (2) Built Under Constraint, Built to Last: We launched in Thailand with zero legal tech infrastructure, no VC funding, and legal teams operating on razor-thin margins who demanded results from day one – not vague promises of efficiency gains. These constraints forced us to build leaner and smarter than well-funded competitors. What started as a limitation became our edge: enterprise-grade capabilities at a fraction of the cost, designed for real lawyers with real budgets doing real work. What problem does your product solve? (1) The Formatting Bottleneck: Legal work demands perfect formatting, but achieving it manually is brutally time-consuming. Nobody wants to deliver a poorly formatted document to the client, so lawyers spend hours fighting with the numbering ribbon, the ruler, and the format painter, trying to push a paragraph exactly 0.1 inches to the left, or fix that paragraph number that won’t fix itself despite clicking “Restart at 1” fifty times. Unlike knowledge gaps that disproportionately affect juniors, formatting is the great equalizer: it wastes everyone’s time, period. A senior partner at 2 AM before a client deadline faces the same broken numbering as a first-year associate, and there’s no way to delegate it to a secretary or junior. (2) The Broader Workflow Crisis Beyond formatting, legal workflows break down in predictable ways. Junior lawyers doing first-pass redlines without access to the firm’s best precedents. Teams rely on manual error checks that inevitably miss critical issues. Expertise remains trapped in senior lawyers’ experience rather than codified in playbooks anyone can follow. Each inefficiency compounds, turning substantive legal work into administrative chaos. Sonar tackles both problems head-on. First, formatting: we instantly reformat entire documents to match any house style. Second, workflow: our complete suite handles definition tracking, redlines, error checks, playbooks, automations inside Microsoft Word, and an Outlook integration that enables seniors to teach juniors to write professional emails. All of this lives where you work – natively in Word and Outlook. Just open Word, launch Sonar, work smarter. Who are your competitors? Document Formatting: No direct competitors. We’re the only solution that fully automates legal document formatting end-to-end. However, given our broad suite (Word, Outook, Web), we operate in competitive spaces with several established platforms, including: Definitions/Error Checks: Contract Companion (Litera), Definely, LawVu Draft (formerly ClauseBase). AI Drafting/Redlining: Luminance, Litera One, Spellbook, DraftWise, GC AI, and a new one launching every Tuesday. AI Legal Assistant (Legal Research, Workflows, Tabular Reviews): Harvey, Legora, Midpage, DeepJudge. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://youtu.be/HmeX8E8XKSI. When was the company founded? 2023-04-09. Where is the company located? Bangkok, Thailand. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? In-house legal departments of all sizes, small to mid-size law firms What is the price of your product or service? We offer a generous free-forever tier with no credit card required. Paid plans start at $49/month for solo practitioners and scale to $79/month for unlimited usage. Custom enterprise pricing is available for corporate clients and larger teams. Tell us more about your traction. Successful implementations (selection): Law Firm: A leading international law firm in Southeast Asia chose Sonar Legal after evaluating multiple legal tech vendors. In-House: The legal department of Thailand’s largest conglomerate selected Sonar Legal following a comprehensive pilot and evaluation. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. We’re currently a team of seven in Bangkok, with proven traction at both ends of the market. Our next phase focuses on deepening Southeast Asian presence while preparing for international expansion. We’ll grow the team to 20 by the end of 2026, adding dedicated sales and customer success roles to convert our pipeline and support enterprise accounts. Revenue from regional clients will fund controlled expansion into markets with similar pain points: starting with Singapore and Hong Kong, where international firms already recognize the formatting problem. By 2027, we’ll leverage these reference clients to enter the US and UK markets, where legal tech budgets are larger but the core frustration is identical. Have you received outside funding? No outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. Sonar Legal was born diverse. Greek and Thai co-founders, 50% female leadership, team spanning Europe and Southeast Asia with experience in US, EU, and Thai legal systems. Five people, multiple jurisdictions, different legal traditions and cultures shaping everything we build. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? Sonar Legal democratizes access to advanced legal AI through a generous free-forever tier and pricing starting at $49/month. This makes enterprise-level capabilities accessible to solo practitioners, small firms, and underrepresented legal professionals traditionally priced out of premium technology.2. Education & Awareness in Developing Markets. Our founders are actively promoting legal tech adoption in Southeast Asia through guest lectures at ASEAN universities, preparing the next generation of lawyers for an AI-powered legal landscape. Anything else you’d like us to know? N/A. Company Name StreamSettle, Inc. Elevator Pitch We believe that if negotiating parties have a safe place to be reasonable, they will be. StreamSettle is a secure platform that instantly resolves cases by acting as a triple-blind “deal detector.” Both sides confidentially input their true settlement threshold. Our system detects if an overlap exists. If it does, the claim settles automatically at the midpoint. If no overlap, the data remains hidden, and no fees are charged, making StreamSettle truly risk-free for both sides. What makes your company unique or innovative? What problem does your product solve? The core problem is that offers and demands are unreliable data points. In an effort to gain leverage, both sides routinely exaggerate their positions. They then rely on this flawed data to answer a critical question: “Can this case settle?” When the gap between these postured numbers is wide, parties falsely conclude they are “too far apart.” This forces them into years of costly, unnecessary litigation to reach a settlement result that likely existed from the start. It is a classic case of “garbage in, garbage out” – bad data drives efficient markets into expensive gridlock. Who are your competitors? Direct Competitors (Automated Negotiation): Indirect Competitors: Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex6EHDV-l0U. When was the company founded? 2022-10-29. Where is the company located? Cypress, Tex. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? We target a two-sided market: 1. The “Demand” Side: Plaintiff law firms. These range from large “billboard” firms with thousands of active files to mid-sized litigation boutiques and solo firms. These firms are motivated by cash flow velocity and reducing their own overhead costs per case. 2. The “Supply” Side: Insurers & Defense law firms: We target Claims Directors cutting LAE, and forward-thinking Defense Partners who differentiate themselves by offering clients (insurers or self-insured businesses) speedy, efficient resolution. What is the price of your product or service? We operate on a Risk-Free Success Fee model. We charge a fee only if a settlement is reached on the platform. Fee: 1% of the total settlement amount per party. Cap: Maximum fee of $1,000 per party ($2,000 total per case). We plan to raise the cap as we scale, except for our early adopters. No Upfront Costs: There are no subscription fees, setup costs, or charges for testing thresholds that do not result in a deal. Tell us more about your traction. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Years 1-2: The Texas Beachhead (Density Phase): Year 3: Product Expansion (Stickiness Phase): Years 4-5: National Scale (Expansion Phase): Have you received outside funding? Less than $1M in outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. StreamSettle is proudly woman-co-founded and led (Chrysa Jones, COO) and veteran-founded (Joe Jones, CEO, Marine Corps Veteran). Beyond the founders, we have intentionally built a diverse Advisory Board to ensure our product serves the entire legal community. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? Anything else you’d like us to know? We are not just a software company; we are building the settlement infrastructure of the future. Beyond our direct users, we are actively pursuing pilots with major court systems to deploy StreamSettle as a docket-clearing solution. By identifying settleable cases before they consume judicial resources, we aim to drastically reduce the overwhelming backlogs that paralyze our courts, freeing up judges to focus on complex litigation. Our true mission is to reduce the human toll of the process. By removing adversarial friction from routine claims, we allow injured parties to receive fair compensation months faster. We are live, generating revenue, and executing a density strategy that is proving the model works. We would be honored to showcase this at the ABA TECHSHOW. Company Name Trailmate Elevator Pitch Trailmate is the first client-facing AI agent built for law firms – a digital employee designed to handle client-facing work end to end. Lawyers tell Trailmate what they need done (run intake, collect documents, gather discovery responses, give case updates, etc.), and Trailmate turns that request into action – contacting clients and following up autonomously until the task is complete. Firms supervise progress and results in real time, without chasing clients or adding staff. What makes your company unique or innovative? Trailmate is unique because it is not just a chatbot or workflow tool. It is an outward-facing digital employee that actually engages clients autonomously. Lawyers delegate an objective in plain English, and Trailmate autonomously contacts clients, conducts structured conversations, follows up until tasks are complete, validates the results, and escalates only when human judgment is needed. This “delegate and supervise” model creates a new category in legal tech: AI as a digital employee, not software. What problem does your product solve? Trailmate solves one of the most persistent and costly problems in law firms: client-facing work that requires constant chasing, follow-up, and coordination. Intake, document collection, discovery responses, status updates, and other routine communications are repetitive, often deadline-sensitive, and highly dependent on client responsiveness, yet they consume enormous staff time and routinely stall matters. Who are your competitors? Our closest points of comparison are Case Status and Hona, which are modern client communication and portal tools. However, these products are fundamentally passive: they surface information to clients but still rely on firm staff to drive follow-up, collect documents, and move matters forward. Trailmate operates in a different category. It is not a client portal or messaging layer. It is an outward-facing AI agent that executes client-facing work end to end. There is no direct equivalent to this “delegate and supervise” digital-employee model in the legal market today. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://vimeo.com/1152280813 When was the company founded? 2025-06-12. Where is the company located? Woodland Hills, Calif. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Small to medium size law firms with consumer clients (particularly plaintiff-side firms in areas like employment, personal injury, immigration, family law, and consumer law) What is the price of your product or service? Trailmate is sold as a subscription, priced based on the number of active matters and the volume of client-facing work handled by the AI agent. Contracts range from $1,000 per month to $5,000 per month or more, depending on the firm’s volume. Tell us more about your traction. Trailmate is currently in stealth, with a public launch scheduled for January 13, 2026. To date, we have several law firms actively piloting the platform and additional firms in the pipeline that have expressed strong interest and are queued for onboarding post-launch. We have been running Trailmate in production within my own firm, Frontier Law Center, as a design-partner environment. In that setting alone, Trailmate has already conducted 100+ hours of active client conversations, autonomously collected over 1,100 client documents, and completed more than 350 distinct client-facing tasks on behalf of the firm. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Over the next five years, Trailmate’s growth plan is centered on category creation, disciplined expansion, and deep integration into how law firms operate. We will begin by converting our current pilots into paying customers immediately following our January 2026 launch, while onboarding additional early adopters through founder-led sales and partnerships with legal-tech platforms. Shortly after launch, we plan to raise a pre-seed round to accelerate product development, integrations, and go-to-market execution. Trailmate has been fully bootstrapped to date, with product-market validation driven by real usage inside my own law firm. As a domain-expert founder and recognized thought leader in legal AI, I am well connected with both forward-thinking law firms and complementary legal-tech vendors. I plan to leverage these relationships, in addition to traditional advertising / marketing efforts. Have you received outside funding? No outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. I was born in the Philippines and came to the U.S. when I was 3 (half Filipino) and my co-founder is Indian. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? Trailmate is committed to building a diverse and inclusive legal tech community by intentionally hiring with diversity in mind as we grow. We believe assembling a team with varied backgrounds and perspectives leads to better products, a broader worldview, and technology that serves a wider range of law firms and clients more effectively. Anything else you’d like us to know? I am a very early design partner with Eve. We were featured as one of the first law firms to coin the term “AI-Native Law Firm” – https://www.legaltech-talk.com/frontier-law-center-taps-eve-to-become-the-first-ai-native-law-firm/ Company Name TwinCounsel, Inc. Elevator Pitch TwinCounsel is an AI delegation platform for solo and small law firms. Our AI teammate lives in the lawyer’s inbox, automatically building case context from emails and attachments. Lawyers delegate tasks like drafting subpoenas or financial disclosures in plain English – just by replying to an email. Every fact is auditable with source citations. We’ve proven 90% time savings, cutting 90-minute tasks to nine minutes. What makes your company unique or innovative? We solve the context problem that blocks AI adoption in legal. Most legal AI tools are “bring-your-own-context” – they are blank slates that require manual input before they can help. TwinCounsel is different. We automatically build structured case knowledge from the lawyer’s inbox – extracting parties, timelines, facts, deadlines, and documents without any data entry. This organized case intelligence is what makes trusted AI delegation possible. Three differentiators: (1) Inbox-native – we live where lawyers already work, eliminating adoption friction; (2) Automatic case context – our system understands the matter before the lawyer asks for help; (3) Auditable outputs – every generated fact links back to its source, solving lawyers’ #1 trust barrier. What problem does your product solve? Solo lawyers lose over 60% of their day to administrative chaos. Critical case facts are buried across 50-300 emails per matter – scattered in threads, attachments, and forwarded documents. Before lawyers can do actual legal work, they’re forced to manually hunt, organize, and re-type information. This “context gap” causes missed facts, missed deadlines, malpractice exposure, and the painful reality of working 8 hours but billing for only 3. Existing tools don’t solve this. Practice management software requires manual data entry – it’s the source of administrative work, not the solution. Generic AI tools are “blank slates” that require lawyers to copy-paste sensitive client data and provide context for every task. Neither approach gives AI what it needs to actually help: deep, organized knowledge of the case. Who are your competitors? 1) Incumbent practice management systems: Clio, MyCase (reactive dashboards requiring manual data entry) 2) AI-native point solutions: CoCounsel (Thomson Reuters), Spellbook, Gavel Exec (bring-your-own-context tools with no systemic case knowledge) 3) Generic AI chatbots: ChatGPT, Claude (high-friction copy-paste workflows with confidentiality risks) Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://www.loom.com/share/525e13a6982848539308722214b7031d. When was the company founded? 2025-05-17. Where is the company located? San Jose, Calif. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Solo and small law firm attorneys (1-10 attorneys), initially focused on family law, criminal law, and estates/private client practices. What is the price of your product or service? TBD: Subscription fee, tiered by number of matters. Tell us more about your traction Pre-revenue, but we’ve validated the core thesis hands-on. We embedded ourselves for two months inside a San Jose family/criminal law firm, running a “Concierge MVP” where we manually did the work our software will automate. This proved three things: 1) We can build a 360-degree view of a case from email. By assembling context from scattered emails, attachments, and threads, we created the organized case knowledge that makes accurate AI outputs possible. 2) Context + AI done right = highly accurate work. With proper case context, our AI-generated drafts were more accurate than the firm’s paralegal – and verifiable back to source documents. 3) 90% time savings are real and repeatable. Financial disclosures dropped from 90 minutes to 9. Routine court filings from 60 minutes to 6. We’re now expanding our design partner program across practice areas (workflows): our original criminal/family law partner (subpoenas, financial disclosures), personal injury (demand letters), and estates (discovery responses). The workflows differ but the pattern holds – scattered inbox context transformed into accurate, cited drafts. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Year 1: Win the beachhead. Convert design partners to paying customers, ship self-serve onboarding, and integrate with core tools lawyers already use (Clio, Google Workspace, Microsoft 365). Prove that we can turn inbox chaos into organized case intelligence that powers trusted AI delegation. Year 2: Expand across practice areas (family → criminal → estates → immigration → plaintiff PI) and scale to 500+ solo and small-firm users. Deepen integrations so TwinCounsel becomes the connective layer between a firm’s scattered tools—the AI that finally makes their existing software work together. Years 3-5: Become the AI orchestration layer for the small law firm ecosystem. Our structured case knowledge—automatically built from email, documents, and connected systems—becomes the foundation that powers increasingly autonomous workflows. We capture a meaningful share of the $60B legal support market by replacing manual administrative work with intelligent delegation. Have you received outside funding? Less than $1M in outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. Our founding team bridges three continents. Josh Dorward (CEO) is a dual U.S.-Taiwan citizen who spent the past year in Taiwan connecting with the local startup ecosystem; we’re building our core engineering team there. Kenji Hashimoto (CTO) holds triple citizenship – Japan, U.K. and U.S. – bringing a global perspective to our technical leadership. Together we combine Silicon Valley startup experience with deep ties to Asian engineering talent and international markets. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? As an early-stage company, we’re just beginning to engage with the legal tech community. Our approach to team-building is intentionally global – we’re hiring our founding engineering team in Taiwan rather than defaulting to Silicon Valley, bringing geographic and cultural diversity into legal tech from day one. As we grow, we’re committed to maintaining this global perspective in our hiring and community participation. Anything else you’d like us to know? We’re YC S17 alumni with a prior exit (Indivio acquired by Cloudinary). This is the same proven founding team reuniting with perfect founder-market fit: Josh brings legal domain expertise (licensed CA attorney, JD/MBA) plus AI product leadership (Cloudinary GM); Kenji brings 10+ years of automation/AI systems architecture. We’re not theorizing – we’ve validated workflows inside a real firm and proven 10x efficiency gains. Company Name LMI Network LLC Elevator Pitch In an online world where AI algorithms polarize and divide, ZODR (pronounced Zoe-D-R) promotes conflict resolution using AI to help mediators resolve legal disputes between parties. Since most mediators use Zoom, a tool that is also installed on millions of potential mediation parties’ devices, ZODR, through its Zoom integration, gives mediators 1 hub to manage their mediation cases, and after all parties’ give consent to the AI “listening in,” lets mediators get AI recommendations on how to resolve the dispute. What makes your company unique or innovative? ZODR differs from standard case management software and generic use of Zoom for mediation in three ways: What problem does your product solve? Since the shift to online dispute resolution (ODR) after the pandemic’s “zoom boom,” and the explosion of AI legal tools after the 2022 public launch of ChatGPT, conflict resolution professionals are still figuring out how to administer an online mediation practice that incorporates AI and scale it on the web in an era where physical borders no longer matter. While the digital world moves instantly, mediators and arbitrators still spend manual time incorporating AI, chasing emails, scheduling across time zones, and drafting routine settlement clauses from scratch, all as part of their workflow. This friction delays justice and limits the number of clients a professional can serve. ZODR presents an intuitive platform that incorporates optional AI into the mediation session, and helps the conflict resolution professional manage all their matters in kanban-style birds-eye views. Additionally, ZODR addresses the fragmented workflows of the past where sensitive case data is scattered across Zoom, email, and Word documents, creating security risks and breaking the mediator’s flow. ZODR brings order by helping mediators actively manage the lifecycle of the dispute from intake to signed agreement, all with the help of an AI co-mediator. Who are your competitors? Some competitioners in the ODR space include: ODR.com, ADRNotable, Immediation, Next Level Mediation. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://youtu.be/BALex6b2FTk. When was the company founded? 2025-05-31. Where is the company located? Houston, Tex. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Our primary users are private mediators, arbitrators, and boutique dispute resolution firms. Our secondary market includes court-annexed mediation programs and ombuds offices looking to streamline high-volume case management. What is the price of your product or service? $29.99 per seat per month after a 14-day free trial, but discounted on an annual basis and for larger organizations. Tell us more about your traction. Since evolving the “Instant Mediators” community into the LMI Professionals (pros.lminetwork.com) list of online mediators, we have a subscriber base that will be the first to experience ZODR alongside others who have signed up for the wait list. More data will be available soon as we make ZODR fully operational to the general public. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. First, we are not starting from zero since ZODR is part of the LMI Network (lminetwork.com); We are looking to convert the existing user base of LMI “Professionals” (pros.lminetwork.com) (formerly InstantMediators.com). Additionally, we are leveraging the “Justice Sites” (justicesites.com) initiative (launching 2026) to bundle high-performance lawyer and mediator websites with a ZODR subscription. This creates a “sticky” ecosystem where a mediator’s marketing (website) and operations (ZODR) are unified so we can sell a complete “virtual practice” to online mediators. Lastly, we own the LMI Network YouTube channel (YouTube.com/@lminetwork) and podcast (lmipodcast.com), which provides an existing outlet for marketing ZODR features and capabilities in video format. The channel lets us host media content, engage with users, and deliver support tips via video on a ZODR videos playlist. By year 2, we plan to then expand from individual practitioners to small firms and court-annexed mediation programs or community mediation offices. We believe there’s a market for larger high-volume mediation organizations who want to develop their online dispute resolution presence and handle disputes at scale across multiple jurisdictions. This would be most advantageous to family and small claims mediation organizations. By year 3, we want to focus on growing internationally across several markets and expand in multiple languages. AI’s ability to translate/interpret conversations in real time lowers the costs once associated with multilingual dispute resolution. Now mediators around the world can use ZODR to mediate with residents who not only reside outside their jurisdictions, but who also speak a different language. ODR is a worldwide phenomenon because all societies have conflicts and most adults globally now have a full mediation office in their pockets called Zoom. ZODR leverages these 2 facts in order to promote access to justice. Have you received outside funding? No outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. ZODR is a minority-owned business, founded by a first-generation immigrant lawyer and mediator who believes in the American Dream. Mac Pierre-Louis’ cross-border perspective ensures the platform is designed for global jurisdictional compatibility and will drive the mission of democratizing access to justice by making dispute resolution accessible to anyone who can use Zoom for mediation. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? In addition to the above where ZODR is a minority-founded company led by a Black male attorney-mediator and first-generation American residing in Texas, ZODR has hired a Bangladesh-origin development firm, headquartered in Wyoming. This cross-border and diverse leadership ensures our product design avoids the “US-centric/English-only” bias often found in many legal tech. Additionally, we promote access to justice. ZODR is about lowering the cost of dispute resolution by helping mediators run and manage their practices online with the assistance of AI. Traditional litigation is expensive and intimidating; ZODR’s efficiency tools allow mediators to handle lower-value cases profitably. This indirectly empowers underserved communities—who can be encouraged to use Zoom for mediation since they often cannot afford to take time off work to travel to a physical courthouse. ZODR gives the mediator a platform to run and manage their Zoom mediation so that disputing parties can access justice from their mobile devices. Anything else you’d like us to know? While it’s great to disrupt industries and change paradigms to make products better and increase value, we are mindful that in the legal field, innovation will also be measured by how much chaos or stability the innovation brings. Therefore, ZODR is not trying to replace mediators or just outsource legal disputes to AI. ZODR brings the focus back to the human neutral in the middle by augmenting their skills so they can help other people. Human-based conflict resolution will remain the focus of our work.

US stock market crashes again today: Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq are down. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 363.48 points (-0.73%) to 49,226.72, while the S&P 500 fell 0.39% and the Nasdaq slipped 0.44%. The main catalyst for today’s volatility was the December Consumer Price Index report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Headline inflation rose 0.3% month over month and 2.7% year over year, exactly in line with Wall Street forecasts.

Title: 'Big Short' investor Michael Burry explains why he's betting against Nvidia, not Meta or Microsoft

Every time Theron publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Michael Burry says he's betting against Nvidia instead of Meta, Alphabet, or Microsoft because the chipmaker is particularly vulnerable to the AI boom ending in disaster. Nvidia is "simply the purest play," Burry wrote in a Substack post last weekend. The company has become "entirely dependent on hyperscaler spending, and I do not see how that math works," he continued. The investor of "The Big Short" fame, who pivoted from running a hedge fund to writing online late last year, added that Nvidia is likely to "sell $400 billion of its chips this year and there are less than $100 billion in application layer use cases." "Nvidia also is the most loved, and least doubted," Burry wrote. "So shorting it is cheap." Burry also name-checked CoreWeave, a provider of cloud services built for AI and a strategic partner of Nvidia, calling it the graphics-processor giant's "pet." Nvidia's stock price has surged 12-fold since the start of 2023, making the graphics-chip maker the world's most valuable public company with a $4.5 trillion market capitalization. Nvidia did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Burry said that betting against Meta would mean he was "also shorting its social media/advertising dominance," and placing a wager against Alphabet would mean he was "shorting Google Search in all its forms, Android, Waymo, etc." He added that being short Microsoft would be tantamount to "shorting a global office productivity SaaS goliath," referring to the company's software-as-a-service tools, including Word and Excel. Those Big Tech titans aren't "pure shorts on AI" and have staying power, Burry wrote. "They will realize they should not be spending so much, write off assets, and possibly restate earnings," he said. "But they still are dominant companies globally away from the AI buildout." On the other hand, Burry said he would short OpenAI if it were a public company. He highlighted the ChatGPT maker's $500 billion valuation in October, which exceeds the market values of Johnson & Johnson, Bank of America, and Costco. Burry said he owns bearish put options on Oracle, and directly shorted the database company in the last six months. "I do not like how it is positioned or the investments it is making," he wrote, adding that the company, cofounded by tech billionaire Larry Ellison, is making unnecessary, inexplicable moves and "ego" might be the driver. Burry is famous for predicting and profiting from the collapse of the mid-2000s housing bubble, an episode of his career that was chronicled in the book and movie "The Big Short." He wrote on Substack that "technological obsolescence is on the menu as Nvidia now seems to introduce a new chip solution every year or less." That echoed a previous post in which he said Nvidia's Big Tech customers were overstating the lifespan of its chips to drag out their depreciation and flatter their short-term profits, raising the prospect of future writedowns. Burry also warned of trouble ahead, saying he's betting against AI stocks to "have the exposure on the right side when the music stops." Burry spoke about AI more broadly in his post, drawing a parallel between its rise and the history of electricity. He pointed out that building power plants and grids in the late 1980s and early 1990s required "massive upfront capital outlays," technological advances meant equipment such as transformers became quickly outdated and assets rapidly depreciated, and "cutthroat price warfare" between suppliers meant many ran into financial difficulties and were forced to merge with rivals. "What I see in electrification is very similar to what happened during the 2000 data transmission bubble and what I see happening with the AI bubble," he wrote. Burry said that electricity was as transformative to the modern world as a medicine that enables a patient to walk 10 feet, whereas AI "might be the anabolic steroid that allows superhuman feats of strength and ability," but could ultimately prove "more dangerous than anything." He also repeated his caution that if the US tries to win the AI race by going all-in on increasingly power-hungry chips, it will lose as China is ramping up its power-generation capacity much more quickly. "I see a big inventory problem in the AI buildout as a result of the current power generation setup," Burry said. Jump to

Title: 5 Things to Know Before the Stock Market Opens

Stock futures are lower this morning as investors digest earnings reports and await key inflation data; JPMorgan's fourth-quarter results were mixed, as profits and net interest income topped estimates while revenue fell short; consumer price data for December is due out this morning; Delta shares are falling after the airline issued a disappointing outlook; and President Trump is threatening Iran's trading partners with new tariffs over the country's response to recent protests. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are slightly lower as the quarterly earnings season gets underway and investors prepare for the release of inflation data that will be closely monitored by the Federal Reserve. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500, each of which closed at record highs on Monday, were down 0.2% recently, while Nasdaq futures slipped 0.3%. Stocks came under pressure early Monday on news that the Department of Justice is investigating Fed Chair Jerome Powell, but rebounded to finish the day slightly higher. Gold futures were down 0.6% at $4,590 an ounce this morning, after hitting a record high around $4,640 on Monday amid concerns about possible threats to the Fed's independence. Crude oil futures were up 1.7% at $60.50 per barrel, trading above $60 for the first time since early December. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note ticked higher to 4.20%, near its highest level in four months. Bitcoin was at $92,000. up from an overnight low of just below $91,000. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), the world's largest bank by market capitalization, kicked off a busy week of bank earnings this morning. The bank reported adjusted earnings per share of $5.23 on revenue of $45.8 billion. Analysts' estimates compiled by Visible Alpha had projected adjusted EPS of $4.96 and revenue of $46.07 billion. JPMorgan reported $25.1 billion in net interest income, above what analysts had forecast. "The U.S. economy has remained resilient," CEO Jamie Dimon said. "While labor markets have softened, conditions do not appear to be worsening. Meanwhile, consumers continue to spend, and businesses generally remain healthy." Bank stocks sank on Monday after President Donald Trump suggested a cap of 10% on credit card interest rates. During the earnings call this morning, JPMorgan executives are likely to discuss that, as well as a deal announced last week to take over as the backer of Apple's (AAPL) credit card program from Goldman Sachs (GS). JPMorgan shares were little changed in recent premarket trading, after falling more than 1% Monday. The Bureau of Labor Statistics is scheduled to release its closely followed Consumer Price Index report at 8:30 a.m ET. Economists on average expect the report to show that consumer prices rose 2.7% in the 12 months through December, unchanged from the month before. "Core" prices, excluding more volatile food and gas prices, are also expected to have risen 2.8%, which would mark an acceleration in inflation after it unexpectedly slowed in November. Inflation remains well above the Fed's 2% target, and continued signs of price pressures could keep the central bank from cutting its key interest rate again soon. Inflation is generally expected to slow this year as declining housing costs and a lack of wage increases are projected to outweigh the impact of the Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs. Delta Air Lines (DAL) stock is slumping in premarket trading after the airline issued a disappointing outlook. Delta said it earned an adjusted $1.55 in the fourth quarter, roughly in line with the analyst consensus compiled by Visible Alpha, while revenue topped estimates at $16 billion. For 2026, however, Delta said it is expecting adjusted EPS of $6.50 to $7.50, with the midpoint of $7.00 well below the $7.26 analysts currently forecast. Analysts had said leading into the report that Delta and other airlines may opt for more cautious outlooks for 2026 after a difficult last few years of operations, and said that the 2026 forecasts will likely be the focus of airline earnings this month rather than the fourth-quarter results. In Tuesday's report, Delta also announced an order of 30 planes from Boeing, the widebody 787-10, with options to purchase another 30, with deliveries expected to start in 2031. Delta shares were down more than 3% ahead of the opening bell. President Trump threatened a new round of tariffs amid the deadly protests in Iran. "Effective immediately, any Country doing business with the Islamic Republic of Iran will pay a Tariff of 25% on any and all business being done with the United States of America," Trump said Monday afternoon on social media. The larger structure of the tariffs are currently unknown, as the White House has yet to release an official order on the tariffs. The tariffs would be in response to a recent wave of anti-government protests in Iran, which has led to the deaths of more than 600 protestors, human rights groups estimate. Trump has threatened to involve the U.S. military if the killings continue, and has encouraged the protests to topple Iran's government, per CNBC. The legality of Trump's current tariffs are also unknown, with a Supreme Court ruling expected in the coming weeks over whether the president had the legal authority to unilaterally declare the tariffs.

Investing Stocks that plunged on the open on the Federal Reserve subpoena news reversed sharply and ended higher across the board by the close. Fourth-quarter earnings will kick off with the big Wall Street banks reporting this week With some spicy economic news on tap, like today’s December Consumer Price Index print, which is expected to be 2.7% year-over-year, it could move markets. Sending You to Google News in 3 © Chaay_Tee / iStock via Getty Images The futures are trending higher after the December consumer price index came in at 2.7%, which matched Wall Street expectations. The reversal in the futures comes after a wild Monday that saw stocks get hammered on the open, amid news of Department of Justice subpoenas sent to Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell regarding his testimony to Congress last summer. Initially, all the major indices plunged on the news, then reversed sharply to finish higher on the day. Both the Dow Jones Industrials, which closed up 0.17% at 49,590, and the S&P 500, which ended the day higher by 0.16% at 6,977, once again printed new all-time highs as the January strength continues. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was last seen at 23,833, up 0.25%, and the Russel 2000 continued its red-hot start to the year, closing at 2,635, up 0.44%. The R2K is leading all the major indices in 2026, up 5.7% on the year. Wall Street is now looking forward to the start of the fourth-quarter earnings, with the big money-center banks reporting later this week. Yields were higher across the entire Treasury curve on Monday, and you can bet that the controversy with the Federal Reserve receiving subpoenas was a big reason for the selling. The uncertainty about Fed independence and the potential for government intervention pushed bond prices down, echoing past “Sell America” events in 2025. The reality is this will likely blow over quickly, as a mountain of economic news and the start of earnings season will redirect attention. The 30-year bond closed at 4.84%, while the benchmark 10-year note was last seen at 4.19%. Prices were higher across the energy complex on Monday as geopolitical tensions in multiple regions around the globe and the potential for long-term changes to the global oil supply drove crude oil prices higher, with the WTI and Brent benchmarks both climbing. Brent Crude closed trading on Monday at $64.01, up 1.06%, while West Texas Intermediate finished the session at $59.63, up 0.85%. Natural gas stormed back after a wave of frigid weather swept across a large swath of the U.S. Monday, closing up 6.5% at $3.38. In what seems like a never-ending story, Gold closed Monday at $4,596, up another 1.94%. Wall Street’s $5,000 price targets for the precious metal could arrive much sooner than expected. The combination of numerous geopolitical hotspots and Federal Reserve news once again provided the stiff tailwind that has been present for well over a year. Silver also bolted higher on Monday, climbing a massive 6.6% to close trading at $85.14. Wall Street’s $100 price targets are getting closer by the week, and with most rebalancing finished, the path for Silver looks higher. The crypto market traded range-bound and sideways on Monday, influenced by a “risk-off” environment, much like other asset classes, driven by rising geopolitical tensions and uncertainty over U.S. monetary policy, including the escalating dispute between the Trump administration and Federal Reserve Chair Powell. At 8A EST, Bitcoin was quoted at $92,010, while Ethereum was posted at $3, 131. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports daily to identify new investment ideas for both investors and traders.

Wall Street’s $100 price targets are getting closer by the week, and with most rebalancing finished, the path for Silver looks higher. The crypto market traded range-bound and sideways on Monday, influenced by a “risk-off” environment, much like other asset classes, driven by rising geopolitical tensions and uncertainty over U.S. monetary policy, including the escalating dispute between the Trump administration and Federal Reserve Chair Powell. At 8A EST, Bitcoin was quoted at $92,010, while Ethereum was posted at $3, 131. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports daily to identify new investment ideas for both investors and traders.

Title: 9 marketing predictions for 2026 as AI fuels polarity

Let Marketing Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The sense of a stable middle ground is eroding across an industry at a point of contraction, with many displaying mixed feelings about marketing’s future. The sense of a stable middle ground will continue to erode across several aspects of marketing in 2026. Studies indicate the middle class is thinning, altering important consumer milestones. Monoculture is also on the wane as people spend more time engaged with algorithms hypertailored to their interests. On the industry front, marketing services are gravitating toward two polarities in the wake of historic consolidation: White-glove models and plug-and-play ones built around artificial intelligence. Feeling some of the most pain from these developments are the employees who make the industry hum but are facing a grim job market. “There has been a rampant uptick in the past few years of putting the focus on shareholder value,” said Dustin Black, executive creative director at Preston Spire. “Culturally, the difference between decision-makers and makers has never been greater.” The advancement of generative AI could encourage mediocrity — “slop” was deemed a 2025 word of the year for a reason — but also benefit marketers moving against the grain. To grab attention, brands may embrace messaging that is deliberately button-pushing or bold. “A lot of the output is trending toward the median,” said Taryn Crouthers, CEO of Spcshp, about AI in marketing. “It’s about pulling against the median because all of the content is merging to look very, very similar.” Others could step up investment in emergent channels to reach audiences with growing economic influence, including Gen Alpha. There will be no shortage of stages to test these tactics, with a Super Bowl, Olympics and FIFA World Cup on deck. Below, Marketing Dive shares nine predictions for an industry at a point of contraction and displaying mixed feelings about its future. Omnicom’s acquisition of Interpublic Group signals more agency consolidation coming down the pike, experts say. As rumors swirl around additional breakups and sell-offs, a new chapter is on the horizon for ad-holding groups. “It’s absolutely signifying a shift towards media and technology scale as key foundational elements for what the legacy holding companies will reorganize around,” said Jay Pattisall, vice president and principal analyst at Forrester, of the Omnicom-IPG deal. Dealmaking activity could be enabled by further interest rate cuts and a light-touch regulatory environment. Other agencies may broker richer strategic partnerships: For example, Publicis kicked off 2026 by striking a pact with LiveRamp, underpinning the significance of data in the AI arms race, Ad Age reported. Massive layoffs and the death of iconic creative shops — not to mention the likelihood of future cost-cutting measures — have been painful but also mean that an army of talent is seeking its next venture. “You might see a lot of these former executives trying to start their own firms playing to the more niche side of the marketplace,” said Paul Hardart, a clinical professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business. Independents meanwhile may pursue different routes to expansion. ZMC-backed Wpromote’s purchase of Giant Spoon in late 2025 speaks to the role private equity is playing in the formation of “big indies” that could appeal to deep-pocketed brands. “Not tomorrow, not next month, but in the not-so-distant future, there are going to be more options for enterprise marketers to choose from as a result of the private-equity investments in what we historically call independent digital agencies,” said Pattisall. Brands will further push the limits of AI-generated creative in 2026, with football’s big night acting as a key litmus test. Svedka already announced it will run a Super Bowl spot made with AI, but the spirits maker won’t be the only advertiser putting on an AI showcase. “I would say, more likely than not, 50% of all Super Bowl spots we watch this year will utilize generative AI in some facet,” said Chris Neff, chief AI officer at Anomaly, noting that those applications could be in pre-production and not immediately apparent on screen. While the AI content spigot is flowing, marketers will explore different messaging avenues. Brands, including Equinox and Dollar Shave Club, have recently launched campaigns that prod at the backlash to AI slop while still leveraging generative AI tools. However, many continue to underestimate strong consumer aversion. “Rushing into anything — over doing things to that extent — is a mistake,” said Sean Cassidy, CEO of PR firm DKC. “One thing that humans seem to still possess...is a pretty good B.S. detector.” Trepidation around AI extends into other areas, even as the technology becomes institutionalized at brands and agencies. Artificially inflated engagement may create a negative feedback loop for advertisers that are only investing more in social and digital, contributing to the Dead Internet Theory. “The bot traffic is going to increase. Is that going to make the metrics even better? Is that going to be the catalyst for this vicious cycle for it to get worse and worse and worse?” said Neff. “It's very hard to know exactly what’s real and not.” “[Brands are] playing checkers, and data companies are playing chess.” Bill Bruno CEO of Celebrus Advertisers, agencies and other stakeholders have spent years shoring up their land grabs in the data-driven marketing ecosystem to fuel developments like programmatic advertising and help gird against the shift from identifiers like third-party cookies. That rush for data will continue to intensify amid the rise and operationalization of AI-driven advertising, giving marketers a chance to learn and apply the lessons of previous eras. Data transparency and ownership will be key as AI complicates challenges that marketers already face around ad visibility and efficacy, especially amid the rise of zero-click search and AI-powered bots and agents that could muddy measurement waters. “You've got a lot of brands… that are basically using terms like ‘AI readiness’ that don't know what they need or what they're going to do, necessarily,” explained Bill Bruno, CEO of data firm Celebrus. “I don't think a lot of people are thinking two or three steps ahead right now. They're playing checkers, and data companies are playing chess.” To have a better handle on data, marketers can shift focus from collecting data to connecting it via tools like consumer data platforms and data fabric environments that give a more unified view of consumers, several experts said. That can help marketers focus on exactly what they need, rather than getting washed away in a flood of data. “My clients who have been most successful are focusing on marketing-specific use-case data readiness,” said Nicole Greene, vice president, analyst at Gartner. “Do we really know what our customers want? Can we safeguard the data that they have entrusted us with, and as a result, can we do marketing and advertising better?” "I don’t think being more authentic necessarily has to mean scantily clad women... It’s more being true to what the company and what the audience is." Adam Singer Vice president of marketing at AdQuick Some of last year’s boldest advertising featured good jeans, spicy plumbers, the best car to have sex in and a full bush summer. Similarly edgy ad creative could return to the fore as marketers look to break through in an increasingly fragmented and frantic media landscape. While those campaigns relied on — and often parodied — “sex sells” tropes, their success speaks more to their ability to break through an ad landscape that has grown increasingly stale and bland, even before the rise of AI, said Adam Singer, vice president of marketing at AdQuick. “Companies have become really risk averse. I think consumers are really thirsty for brands to do things that are interesting,” Singer said. However, being bold doesn’t mean that brands must turn back the clock and revive aesthetics and attitudes that have largely fallen by the cultural wayside. “I don't think being more authentic necessarily has to mean scantily clad women or even necessarily really attractive celebrities, although celebrities definitely push product,” Singer said. “It's more being true to what the company and what the audience is.” Marketers can bring this type of authenticity to life in several ways, from emotional messages to simply portraying their products with beautiful photography and videography — as long as the company is authentic to its core values. Last year’s Cracker Barrel rebrand fiasco is an example of what not to do. “Everyone tried to make that a political thing and say it was ‘woke,’ but I don't think that's really what was going on,” Singer said. “We've seen companies flattening everything, making everything a little bit more boring, and people are tired of that. They want brands to do big, bold things.” Marketers should prepare for further consolidation in an ad-tech industry that has reached maturity but continues to evolve alongside technological change. “At different areas in the ecosystem, there is a consolidation of the media activation between DSPs and SSPs — most of them are starting to compete with each other and not just partner with each other anymore,” said Mathieu Roche, CEO of identity firm ID5. In the DSP space, Amazon and Walmart continue to develop their offerings, while Microsoft’s sunsetting of Xandr provided a boost to Amazon via a transition partnership. Some brands have looked to test different sell-side workflows, including marketplace deals and guaranteed programmatic buys, especially as more connected TV inventory comes on board, said LiveRamp’s Travis Clinger. Consolidation could benefit brands and publishers as it reduces fees and the costs of operating, but the reduction of consumer choice has caused the space to face antitrust issues. Google is expected to learn the fate of its ad-tech antitrust case this year, and while it appears that it will not face more dramatic structural remedies, any decision could cause a surge in ad-tech M&A, explained Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf, a senior analyst at Forrester. “Google's competitors aren't going to let an opportunity pass them by to take advantage of any weakening of Google's position in the ad tech market,” Mitchell-Wolf said. “I do anticipate the rest of the ad tech market trying to shore up their offerings, just to prepare and posture themselves to have the maximally enticing place to land for any advertisers or publishers that take a look at what Google is offering on the tail end of this.” Though the oldest members of Gen Alpha will be turning only 16 in 2026, the generation is already making waves. The cohort already wields $28 billion in direct spending power, and its influence can be seen within the marketing strategies of brands ranging from Lowe’s to Hi-Chew. In 2026, advertiser interest in Gen Alpha, or those born between 2010 and 2024, will become more concrete, according to GWI Chief Operating Officer Misha Williams. “Thinking about [Gen Alpha] in terms of an afterthought or a demographic not to be considered when you are shaping your brand positioning … is a mistake,” said Williams. While the older end of Gen Alpha is beginning to make purchases for themselves, the cohort holds significant sway over purchases made by their parents and has already established awareness for hundreds of brands. The group is also being raised in the age of social media algorithms and AI, priming them to expect deeper personalization from brands compared to previous generations, Williams explained. “With access to information, people become more aware of what they like, what they don’t like,” Williams said. “So when you’re talking about Gen Alpha and the fact that they’re so young, a critical mistake is to treat them as such.” Brands targeting Gen Alpha should expect media consumption behavior that’s even more fragmented than their Gen Z predecessors, Williams said. The cohort is also more inclined to lean on their social connections to validate whether or not a brand or product aligns with their lifestyle, making it critical for marketers to find an authentic value proposition. “What you’re putting in front of them, from an advertising and marketing perspective, must be authentic,” Williams said. “It has to resonate with them contextually.” "It’s not like marketing was ever an easy job. It just became even more difficult." Dipanjan Chatterjee Vice president and principal analyst at Forrester Social media and creator-led marketing surged in 2025 as giants like PepsiCo and Unilever evolved how they work with agencies and dramatically boosted their investments, a signal of the growing role both channels play in shaping culture. Interest is expected to grow in 2026, with creator ad spend in the U.S. forecast to climb 18% year over year, per the IAB. The bet is a signal that marketers have begun to value community over reach, according to Movers+Shakers Chief Creative Officer Geoffrey Goldberg. Brands will likely direct much of their budgets to smaller creators this year, Goldberg forecasts, noting that AI could help streamline the process by helping marketers scale content volume and better understand target audiences. However, category interest is bound to emphasize growing pains. For example, a rise in AI content on social feeds will likely pressure creators to strengthen their creative muscles to cut through the noise. “Already, the amplification of content and the different styles of content has upped so much because of AI … there’s a lot more people in the playing field,” Goldberg said. “The algorithms are still prioritizing great content, it’s prioritizing that over followers.” A surge in content could see both social media teams and consumers faced with burnout as more brands opt for always-on strategies. Broadly, as social media becomes a more foundational aspect of marketers’ playbooks, concerns around a lack of measurement standardization will only grow, a challenge Goldberg recommends brands approach by prioritizing metrics that prove engagement. “In order for [social] to really be their operating system, we need to be really clear on how we measure success and there’s no singular, clear metric,” Goldberg said. Sports marketing will be a major avenue for marketers looking to reach consumers in an increasingly fractured advertising landscape in 2026. Major events such as the FIFA World Cup and 2026 Winter Olympic Games will deliver captive linear TV audiences while emerging sports and leagues create avenues for marketers to connect with more niche, but growing, consumer groups. “One of the things we're seeing is a really incredible momentum behind a lot of small, micro leagues from a familiarity perspective. They’re not super well known yet, but of the people who are aware of them, they have just incredible momentum. They're personally relevant, culturally relevant. They're really sort of poised to take off,” said Jennifer Musil, global president of research at The Harris Poll. Women’s sports will continue to gain momentum in 2026, especially as more niche sports and leagues become more popular. For example, upstart women’s basketball league Unrivaled signed Maker’s Mark, a Beam Suntory Brand, as its first-ever official spirits partner in December. Women’s sports leagues give small and large brands alike an opportunity to get in early as audiences continue to grow. “Seven of the top 10 leagues in the last data set we looked at from a momentum perspective, are female leagues. So women's sports still has a ton of momentum behind it. It's not done growing yet,” said Musil. Tariffs chaos and confusion will not be left behind in 2025, but will continue to cause issues for marketers and consumers alike in 2026. Economic concerns, such as increased cost of living and inflation, may only exacerbate the issue. While the advertising industry has remained remarkably resilient in the face of tariffs and global ad revenue is expected to climb 8.8% in 2026, the Trump administration’s approach to international trade is expected to still create stress for adland. The on-and-off-again nature of tariffs and the steady rise in prices of imported goods makes it difficult for consumers to create and stick to a budget, which may translate to less discretionary spending. “CMOs are marketing to the end consumer. What is going on with tariffs is exceptionally chaotic because it makes it impossible for consumers to be able to plan their own budgets…because there is complete turbulence as it relates to tariffs," said Mike Proulx, vice president, research director, Forrester. Ultimately, marketers will have to adapt their strategies to better handle uncertainty. This could mean shorter campaigns and quicker turnaround times and an increased focus on value. As consumers tighten their purse strings, putting an emphasis on value and deals could help mitigate some of the chaos of the current economic landscape. This was already a major focus for advertisers in 2025 and could continue to be a viable strategy for 2026. “Over the last couple of years, marketers have gotten used to planning in an environment of considerable volatility. In reality, you can't plan for anything, yet you have to plan,” said Dipanjan Chatterjee, vice president, principal analyst, Forrester. “It's not like marketing was ever an easy job. It just became even more difficult.” Get the free daily newsletter read by industry experts From a condiment collaboration with hip-hop producer Mustard to a Weinermobile race, Todd Kaplan tries to keep activations rooted in insights.

Bitcoin treasury company Strategy has continued its accumulation of the cryptocurrency, taking its holdings to 687,410 BTC with the latest purchase. As announced in an X post by Strategy co-founder and chairman Michael Saylor, the company has completed a new Bitcoin acquisition involving 13,627 BTC, spending an average of $91,519 per token or a total of about $1.25 billion. This purchase is rather large; in fact, it’s the biggest buy that the firm has made since July of last year. In his usual Sunday foreshadowing post, Saylor hinted that the acquisition would be significant, using the caption: “₿ig Orange.” In a reply to the post, the Strategy chairman reflected on the company’s accumulation journey, saying, “Ironic that our $60.25 billion Bitcoin position started with a $0.25 billion purchase in August 2020.” Following the purchase announcement, Strategy’s stack has officially grown to 687,410 BTC and total investment to $51.80 billion. At present, these holdings are valued at $63.28 billion, meaning that the treasury company is in a profit of more than 22%. According to the filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the new acquisition took place in the week between January 5th and 11th, funded using proceeds from the company’s MSTR and STRC at-the-market (ATM) stock offerings. Last Monday, Strategy announced expansions for both its Bitcoin treasury and US Dollar reserve, but the focus this week appears to have been on the cryptocurrency alone. The USD reserve, which was created by the company at the start of December, has seen two additions so far, and the latest one took its value to $2.25 billion. In another X post, Saylor has also shared a chart that compares annualized returns for the best-performing assets in the “Bitcoin Standard Era,” referring to the period since August 2020 when the firm made its first purchase of the cryptocurrency. As displayed in the graph, MSTR has produced the second-most annualized returns in this timespan, with its profits of 60% surpassing even BTC’s, which has managed a return of 45%. The number one performing asset in the period has been Nvidia (NVDA), posting annual returns of 68%. The strength behind the company’s stock was initially driven by the Ethereum mining boom and more recently, by the rise of AI datacenters. “The best-performing assets of this decade are Digital Intelligence $NVDA, Digital Credit $MSTR, and Digital Capital $BTC,” Saylor wrote, framing each asset under a distinct role. Bitcoin kicked off 2026 with a recovery surge, but bullish momentum has faded for the asset as its price is still trading around $91,400. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: NCLA Asks D.C. Circuit to Affirm that Courts Can Hear Constitutional Cases on FTC Enforcement

Time Published: 2026-01-13T01:55:00Z

January 12, 2026 20:55 ET | Source: New Civil Liberties Alliance New Civil Liberties Alliance Washington, DC, Jan. 12, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The New Civil Liberties Alliance filed an amicus curiae brief today in support of neither party urging the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to affirm that the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia has jurisdiction to hear Media Matters for America v. Federal Trade Commission. NCLA does not take a position on the merits of Media Matters’s claims that the FTC investigation demanding internal information from the organization violates the First and Fourth Amendments. The district court issued a preliminary injunction that halted the investigation. NCLA addresses FTC’s insistence upon exclusively managing this dispute in its own internal adjudication system, which puts the agency in charge of deciding the question of its own powers and exclusively controls access to the courts for judicial review of that decision. The D.C. Circuit should reject FTC’s argument on this point, which flies in the face of NCLA’s hard-won Supreme Court victory in Michelle Cochran v. SEC (a/k/a Axon Enterprise, Inc. v. FTC). NCLA persuaded the Supreme Court in April 2023 that our client Michelle Cochran and other Americans could bring constitutional challenges against government agencies like SEC in federal court before enduring allegedly unconstitutional administrative adjudications. Axon/Cochran unanimously overruled six circuit courts of appeal that had trapped parties subject to arbitrary or unconstitutional agency power, forcing them to languish indefinitely in years of administrative proceedings while enduring ongoing, here-and-now violations of their civil rights. The Justices specifically ruled that Axon Enterprise, Inc. and Michelle Cochran had the right to a district court hearing over FTC’s and SEC’s unconstitutional, biased and due-process-denying adjudication schemes. The Supreme Court had already decided this question as far back as 2010 in Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, a ruling that also unanimously recognized district courts’ statutory jurisdiction over such claims. More recently, the Supreme Court in SEC v. Jarkesy recognized Article III district court jurisdiction, including the right to a neutral adjudicator for agency prosecutions. These precedents mean Media Matters deserves its day in district court for its constitutional lawsuit against FTC, rather than being consigned to FTC’s internal tribunal which would delay judicial review until, as Justice Kagan wrote in Axon/Cochran, it would be “too late to be meaningful.” FTC argues that the district court lacks jurisdiction over the case because the agency claims the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914 gives it authority to enforce its Civil Investigative Demands in court as part of cases it brings. But Media Matters brought this lawsuit, not FTC, and the agency has not yet and may not ever sue to enforce the CID against the organization in court. Moreover, FTC’s CID review procedure was established by regulation, not by any statute, so it cannot oust jurisdiction long conferred by Congress on district courts by statute. The mere existence of an in-house adjudication or CID enforcement scheme does not take away district court jurisdiction to hear claims that an agency has violated the Constitution. NCLA released the following statements: “Executive branch administrative agencies cannot pass regulations that purport to displace the judicial power from courts to the agency—especially not when the question is whether the agency itself has violated the Constitution! Such claims must be decided promptly and exclusively in the courts which alone have the power and duty to decide them.”— Peggy Little, Senior Litigation Counsel, NCLA “Plaintiffs alleging violations of their constitutional rights deserve to be heard in a court of law—not by a commission acting as both the prosecutor and the judge.”— L. Margaret Harker, Senior Litigation Counsel, NCLA “When will federal agencies get the message? The Supreme Court has spoken quite clearly in cases like Cochran and Jarkesy. Defendants in agency enforcement actions have a right to contest constitutional aspects of their cases, at least, in federal district court. It is surprising to see this administration stan for the Administrative State by resisting federal district court jurisdiction.”— Mark Chenoweth, President, NCLA For more information visit the amicus page here.
