It’s TransDigm Group (NYSE:TDG). Still overlooking it? We understand. It’s not an exciting tech name or a new AI superstar. It may seem dull. However, this is precisely the tactical error you should sidestep if you aim to grow your wealth. Evading significant fluctuations is crucial for wealth accumulation. The High-Quality portfolio, which aims to minimize volatility while providing compounding upside, has surpassed the S&P 500 and achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Let’s see if you still consider TDG stock unexciting after what we’ll share. You’ve heard enough about tech stocks that fluctuate like trapeze artists. But what if there exists a stock that offers tech-like returns without the chaotic movements? One that provides you with a 5.5% dividend– right now – and possesses the strength to increase that payout continuously? Introducing the defense stock that quietly exceeds expectations – TDG At 5.5%, this dividend outperforms most savings accounts, money markets, and even Treasuries. But here’s the catch – this dividend isn’t a “set-it-and-forget-it” yield. It has momentum behind it. What does this signify? This isn’t merely a dividend investment – it’s a cash-generating machine with growth potential. With healthy margins and swift revenue growth, dividends are set to increase as well. This implies that yields could rise or stay consistent as the stock price appreciates. Either way – you benefit! You enjoy growing income year after year. Many income stocks offer substantial dividends. Few provide them in conjunction with stability and capital appreciation. Contrast that with your favorite tech stocks. Nvidia: -62% in 2022, Meta: -75% drop from peak to trough, and Tesla – well, let’s not even discuss that. With this defense investment, you’re compounding quietly and steadily. And guess what – with its impressive margins, robust cash flow, and a DE ratio of 30%, this stock has considerable capacity to manage increased interest costs as debts are refinanced at higher yields in the coming years. This indicates that the risk to dividend growth is minimal. Think defense stocks are dull? Think again. Tariffs have returned. U.S.-China tensions are rising. The new industrial policy wave (whether called re-shoring, de-risking, or “Make America Build Again”) represents a favorable environment for defense expenses. Defense firms are not only safeguarded – they are positioned to prosper. And TDG has remained steadfast during market crises in the past. However, as the saying goes – never put all your eggs in one basket. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio is crafted to diversify stock-specific risks while providing access to potential growth. With a collection of 30 stocks, it has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 over the past 4 years. Why is that? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; experiencing less volatility, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics

Eira is an editor for Mind the Product. She's been a business journalist, editor, and copywriter for longer than she cares to think about. The Washington Post gets cosy with OpenAI, Anthropic underlines its commitment to safety and Intel proposes more layoffs and restructuring, here are the news stories that caught our attention this week. The Washington Post, owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has partnered with OpenAI to integrate the newspaper's journalism into ChatGPT. ChatGPT now provides users with summaries, quotes, and direct links to original articles from The Washington Post. The newspaper said it continues to be LLM-agnostic and build its own range of AI-powered solutions for both its business and its users. UK AI video generation startup Synthesia is set to launch a new AI agent tool designed to make videos more interactive, according to Sifted. The AI agent will be released in “the first half of this year” and is aimed at improving user engagement by allowing viewers to interact with video content, potentially transforming passive viewing into an active experience. Synthesia also reached over $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) in April and received a strategic investment from Adobe Ventures. This follows a $180 million funding round in January. Chip maker Intel plans to lay off over 20% of its workforce in a bid to streamline operations and reduce bureaucratic inefficiencies. As Intel reported its Q1 earnings CEO Lip Bu-Tan also sent a message to employees that lays out plans for restructuring and expands the company’s return to office mandate from three days to four. The layoffs are thought to affect about 22,000 staff, based on Intel's global workforce of 108,900 at the end of 2024. In a bid to assure us of its commitment to transparency and a proactive culture of safety, Anthropic has published a report showing how its Claude AI model has been exploited by malicious actors and which details the company’s efforts to mitigate this misuse. The report, called Detecting and Countering Malicious Uses of Claude: March 2025, reports that, for instance: According to Anthropic: “This report outlines several case studies on how actors have misused our models, as well as the steps we have taken to detect and counter such misuse.” The report said that users are starting to use AI frontier models to semi-autonomously orchestrate complex abuse systems that involve many social media bots. The company expects this trend to continue as agentic AI systems improve. It also points out that generative AI can accelerate capability development for less sophisticated actors, potentially allowing them to operate at a level previously only achievable by more technically proficient individuals. Anthropic has been largely commended for its transparency in publishing this report. On LinkedIn for example, commentators praised the company for its commitment to safety.

Title: These 7 European And Asian Stocks Are Crushing It And Still Cheap
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/hanktucker/2025/04/25/these-7-european-and-asian-stocks-are-crushing-it-and-still-cheap/

ByHank Tucker ByHank Tucker, Forbes Staff. London-based BAE Systems makes the Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jet and is benefitting from European nations turning away from U.S. defense contractors. Portfolio managers investing in non-U.S. stocks have been trying to get investors’ attention for years, pointing out that valuation multiples overseas have grown much cheaper than stocks in the U.S. since the Financial Crisis, and this year their patience has finally been rewarded. The MSCI EAFE index, covering stocks in 21 developed markets excluding the U.S. and Canada, is up 7% this year, significantly outperforming the 7% decline for the S&P 500 index in the U.S. It represents a small dent in the decades-long disparity between the two—JPMorgan reports that from the second half of 2008 through the end of 2024, the S&P 500’s annualized total return was 11.9%, versus 3.6% for the MSCI EAFE. That amounts to a seven-fold return on investment for the former, while the international portfolio hasn’t even doubled. Some of that dominance is because U.S. stocks have produced much stronger earnings growth, but some is also because the S&P 500’s average P/E multiple has swelled to 21.7x, while EAFE is only at 14.0x after starting in a similar position, according to the JPMorgan report. With fears swirling that tariffs and broader uncertainty will compress earnings in the U.S., international investors are hoping that gap can narrow even more. Asset management giants like Vanguard, BlackRock and Franklin Templeton offer dozens of low-cost international funds to choose from. Active managers that are outperforming the indexers are primarily doing so by zeroing in on European defense stocks and domestically-focused companies that are perceived to be insulated from the effects of Trump’s tariffs in nations like Japan and China. “We’re at the lowest relative weight of the U.S. in quite some time,” says Travis Prentice, chief investment officer of the Informed Momentum Company, which manages $2.5 billion in momentum-based strategies. “In aerospace and defense, particularly in Europe, momentum not only persisted, but accelerated through all this tariff turmoil.” Graeme Forster, a portfolio manager at Orbis overseeing $4.5 billion in its International equity strategy, agrees, singling out airplane engine maker Rolls-Royce, London-based BAE Systems, Europe’s largest defense contractor, and German defense firm Rheinmetall as good bets. Orbis’ international strategy has returned 10.8% annually since inception at the end of 2008, beating its index by four percentage points, and produced a 10% return net of fees in the first quarter this year. Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems are each up more than 30% this year already. Rheinmetall has soared 150% thanks largely to the German parliament’s commitment in March to create a fund to spend more than $500 million on defense and infrastructure over 12 years, a stark departure from the nation’s longstanding frugal spending policies. Trump has been critical of NATO on several occasions, attacking European nations for not paying enough to support the alliance, and paused U.S. military aid to Ukraine in March. That prompted the European Commission to unveil a “Readiness 2030” plan in March enabling $900 million in spending to defend Ukraine and protect themselves from Russia’s aggression. Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission’s president, cautioned that “the security architecture that we relied on can no longer be taken for granted” and urged nations to “buy more European.” That’s contributed to U.S. defense firm Lockheed Martin, which makes F-35 fighter jets, sinking 15% since Trump’s election, while BAE Systems, which also produces fighter jets, has soared. “Sometimes there’s news and sometimes there’s noise, and we’ve always had to figure out how to sift through it, but 2025 has been a particularly newsy year,” says Alaina Anderson, portfolio manager for William Blair’s $1.1 billion International Leaders Fund, which recently added positions in BAE Systems and French cybersecurity and defense firm Thales. “It’s been news that speaks to a change in the structure of markets, the nature of relationships between countries and the durability of long-established institutions.” Anderson’s fund is also adding positions in China despite its status as the chief target of Trump’s trade war, focusing on stocks like Trip.com, the country’s largest online travel company with more than 50% market share within China. “We think there’s low geopolitical risk in that name, given that it’s really domestic-driven consumption,” says Anderson, with the stock up 50% since last August. Despite Trump’s pressure in ratcheting up tariffs on China to as much as 145%, the Shanghai Composite index has lost a mere 1.6% in 2025. Prentice references Beijing-based electronics firm Xiaomi as one stock with momentum after tripling in the past year. It sells everything from smartphones to electric vehicles and could be poised to benefit if America’s largest tech companies face harsher tariffs on imports into China. Orbis’ Forster is more enthralled by opportunities in neighboring Japan, where the Nikkei 225 has roughly mirrored the S&P 500’s losses so far this year. The yen has weakened substantially in the last five years, helping Japanese companies hire skilled workers cheaply in U.S. dollar terms, and Forster thinks the prospect of higher interest rates, which the Bank of Japan raised in January to their highest level in 17 years, could counterintuitively stimulate growth. “Everyone is a massive saver there. Everyone's paid off their mortgages and they've got a ton of money, and it just sits in bank accounts earning zero,” says Forster. From 2016 until last year, Japan had negative interest rates in place, but with inflation finally returning, the rate hikes could make the yen stronger, ease import costs and improve margins for retailers and domestic businesses. Forster likes real estate firm Mitsubishi Estate’s stock, with a valuable portfolio of real estate which trades at about half of its fair value, Orbis estimates. The developer owns most of the property surrounding Tokyo’s famed Imperial Palace—its stock performance has been middling for decades, but it’s rallied 25% so far this year, with rents rising meaningfully for the first time since Japan’s 1989 market crash. “The nice thing about a real estate business is as they push up rent, it’s not a wage-heavy business, so they’re not getting squeezed on the cost side,” says Forster. “That could be very sustainable, because real estate is quite cheap in Japan, and you’re getting it at half price.”

Title: 'Financial and Ethical Misconduct' Allegations Against Davos Founder Klaus Schwab Made Public

Manipulating research, using company funds to pay for private, in-room massages, asking junior staff to withdraw thousands of dollars for personal use, demanding senior management deliver a Nobel Peace Prize nomination. These are just some of the lurid allegations that pushed the World Economic Forum (WEF) to launch an investigation into its now departed founder, Klaus Schwab, after anonymous whistleblowers aired their concerns about the German octogenarian. The assertions – reportedly sent last week in a letter to the WEF, which organises the annual elite gathering of globalist devotees at Davos in Switzerland – accuse Schwab and his wife, Hilde, of financial and ethical misconduct. The family has vehemently denied each and every accusation even as he resigned as the WEF chairman, as Breitbart News reported The Guardian set out the course of events around the controversy that has swamped the unelected, unaccountable elitist organization: The accusations prompted Schwab’s resignation as the WEF executive chair on Monday after its board of high-profile trustees – which includes the BlackRock chief, Larry Fink; the IMF managing director, Kristalina Georgieva; the former US vice-president Al Gore and cellist Yo-Yo Ma – held an emergency meeting to look into the claims on Sunday. Schwab, 87, is said to have argued against the board’s plan for an investigation, before he resigned. The founder had indicated he intended to step down in early April, but the whistleblower letter brought forward his exit. […] The whistleblower letter included a range of claims against the Schwab family, according to the Wall Street Journal and Financial Times. They include an allegation that Schwab used WEF funds to pay for private, in-room massages at hotels, asked staff to promote him for a Nobel peace prize, and instructed junior employees to withdraw thousands of dollars from ATMs on his behalf. The Guardian report noted allegations that academic research was also tampered with, as “The letter also accused Schwab of manipulating the WEF global competitiveness report in order to curry favour with certain governments. “The publication ranks countries based on criteria such as education, infrastructure, labour market and health systems, and is a point of reference for the annual Davos meeting.” Some allegations also extended to Schwab’s wife, Hilde, who formerly worked at the WEF. They suggested she scheduled “token” meetings using WEF money to justify luxury travel at WEF’s expense, according to the Guardian report. The letter claims Hilde also maintained tight control over the use of Villa Mundi, a grand property bought by the WEF overlooking Lake Geneva, while portions of the building were strictly reserved for the family’s own private access.

(JOHANNES EISELE/AFP via Getty Images) The Schwabs have repeatedly denied all the allegations, saying they were unsubstantiated and would be challenged in a lawsuit. As Breitbart News reported, Schwab was born in Ravensburg, Germany, on March 30, 1938. He studied at Swiss universities and at Harvard in the United States, and holds doctorates in engineering and economics, along with more than a dozen honorary doctorates. He was a little-known business professor at the University of Geneva when in 1971 he founded the WEF’s precursor, the European Management Forum.

President Donald Trump at the White House on April 22, 2025, in front of a painting depicting the aftermath of the assassination attempt last July in Butler, Pa. President Donald Trump sat down for an interview with TIME at the White House on April 22. Over the course of the interview, Trump discussed a wide range of issues, including his trade war and the economy, immigration, presidential power, and the situations in Ukraine and the Middle East. Below is a lightly edited transcript of the interview conducted by TIME Senior Political Correspondent Eric Cortellessa and Editor-in-Chief Sam Jacobs. Click here to read our fact check. Advertisement Advertisement TIME: Obviously, a lot has happened. We want to have a conversation about what your first 100 days have looked like in office. And we want to try to touch on as many different points as we can. Trump: There’s a lot, right? A lot of things happening. You know better than anyone that the President of the United States is the most powerful person in the world. At the same time, it seems like you are expanding the power of the presidency. Why do you think you need more power? Well, I don't feel I'm expanding it. I think I'm using it as it was meant to be used. I feel that we've had a very successful presidency in 100 days. We've had people writing it was the best first month and best second month, and really the best third month. But that you won't know about for a little while, because it takes a little time in transition. You know, we're resetting a table. We were losing $2 trillion a year on trade, and you can't do that. I mean, at some point somebody has to come along and stop it, because it's not sustainable. We were carrying other countries on our back with, you know, with trade numbers, with horrible numbers, and we've changed it. You see the market fluctuates quite a bit. Today, it's up 1,000 or 1,200 points. It goes up and down, but that will steady out, and we're taking in tremendous amounts of money. We have, as you know, already, 25% on cars, 25% on steel and aluminum— Mr. President, I think what we’re driving at is that you've taken congressional authority on trade and appropriations. You fired the heads of independent agencies. You're challenging the courts right now, as you know. You're using the levers of government to weaken private institutions like law firms and universities. Isn't this seizing power away from institutions and concentrating them inside the presidency? No, I think that what I'm doing is exactly what I've campaigned on. If you look at what I campaigned on, for instance, you can talk about removing people from the country. We have to do it because Biden allowed people to come in through his open border crazy, insanity. He allowed people to come into our country that we can't have in our country. Many criminals—they emptied their prisons, many countries, almost every country, but not a complete emptying, but some countries a complete emptying of their prison system. But you look all over the world, and I'm not just talking about South America, we're talking about all over the world. People have been led into our country that are very dangerous. If you were walking down the street, and if you happen to be near one of these people, they could, they would kill you, and they wouldn't even think about it. And we can't have that in our country. So you're not concentrating more power in the presidency? I don't think so. I think I'm using it properly, and I'm also using it as per my election. You know, everything that I'm doing—this is what I talked about doing. I said that I'm going to move the criminals out. I saw what was happening early on when I heard that he had open borders, when I, because it was a hard thing to believe. I built hundreds of miles of wall, and then he didn't want to, and we had another, an extra hundred miles that I could have put up because I ordered it as extra. I completed the wall, what I was doing, but we have, I wanted to build additional because it was working so well. An extension. And he didn't want to do that. And when he said he wasn't going to do that, I said, “Well, he must want open borders.” There were sections that were being built. And he stopped to work on it, and I said, this guy actually wants to have open borders. That's going to be a tragedy for our country. That's going to mean that other countries will release into our country some very rough people. We’d love to come back to immigration but maybe start with the economy. Obviously an issue you campaigned on as well. You promised that you would immediately bring down prices and usher in a golden age of America. The prices of gas and eggs have gone down, but the cost of other things remain— The prices of groceries have gone down. The only price that hasn't gone down is the price of energy. The cost of energy, I'm sorry, well, energy has gone down, excuse me. Let me change that—is the interest rates. And interest rates have essentially stayed the same. But almost every other thing, I mean, you take a look at what's going on, and this is, we're taking in billions of dollars of tariffs, by the way. And just to go back to the past, I took in hundreds of billions of dollars of tariffs from China, and then when COVID came, I couldn't institute the full program, but I took in hundreds of billions, and we had no inflation. But let’s focus on what is happening right now because— We took in billions of dollars, we had no inflation. Now, if you take a look, the price of groceries are down. The price of energy is down. Inflation remains pretty much the same. And the IMF is saying it’s going to go up. No, Eric, you can't say what they think, because so far what I thought is right. I've been right about— 401ks are down. The Atlanta Fed says our economy is contracting -2.2% during quarter one. Well, they may have said that, but so far, they've been, I mean, I've been right. If you look at all of the years that I've been doing this, I've been right on things. You're gonna—you're gonna have the wealthiest country we've ever had, and you're gonna have an explosion upward in the not-too-distant future. You know, I've been here now for three months, and I inherited eggs, I inherited groceries, I inherited energy. It was all going through the roof. And we had the highest inflation we've ever had as a country, or very close to it. And I believe it was the highest ever. Somebody said it's the highest in only 48 years. That's a lot, too, but I believe we had the highest inflation we've ever had. I've been here now for three months. And three months, we are taking in billions and billions of dollars from other countries that we never took in before. And that's just the start. Well let’s talk about the tariffs. You want companies to build and make goods here in America. Not in all cases. There are some products I really don't want to make here. Like t-shirts? I can’t–I can give you a list because I actually have a list, but if you want, I could give it to you. Well, I mean, the question is, how can CEOs make long-term plans and investments if our tariff policy can change from day to day and still remains so uncertain? How can they make long-term investments? I'll turn it around. How can they make long-term investments if our country is losing $2 trillion a year on trade? Will you consider giving exemptions— No wait, just so you understand. How can we sustain and how is it sustainable that our country lost almost $2 trillion on trade in Biden years, in this last year. That's not—when you talk about a company. I had the head of Walmart yesterday, right in that seat. I had the head of Walmart. I had the head of Home Depot and the head of Target in my office. And I'll tell you what they think, they think what I'm doing is exactly right. Well, the CEOs of small businesses are saying they may not be able to last another two months with the current regime in place. Will you consider giving small businesses an exemption similar to what you've given to Big Tech? I’d have to look at the individual business. Would you consider it? Our country is going to be very rich in not a long period of time. I've been doing this for three months, and if you look at the kind of numbers that we're taking in and the jobs, and if you look at, more importantly, the companies, the chip companies, the car companies, the Apple. $500 billion. Apple is investing $500 billion in building plants. They never invested in this country. Small businesses are worried that you’re treating the Apples of the world better than you’re treating them. No, I’m treating small businesses—small businesses will be a bigger beneficiary of what I'm doing than than the large businesses. But everybody's going to benefit. If we still have high tariffs, whether it's 20% or 30% or 50%, on foreign imports a year from now, will you consider that a victory? Total victory. Why so? Because the country will be making a fortune. Look, that's what China did to us. They charge us 100%. If you look at India—India charges 100-150%. If you look at Brazil, if you look at many, many countries, they charge—that's how they survive. That's how they got rich. Now, zero would be easy. Oh, zero would be easy, but zero, you wouldn't have any companies coming in. They're coming in because they don't want to pay the tariffs. Remember this, there are no tariffs, if they make their product here. There are no tariffs, if they make their product here. There are no tariffs. This is a tremendous success. You just don't know it yet, but this is a tremendous success what’s happening. We're taking in billions and billions of dollars, money that we never took in before. We're also, very importantly, because of that, because of the money we're taking in, those companies are going to come back and they're going to make their product here. They're going to go back into North Carolina and start making furniture again. They've already started. In Mexico, many car plants that were under construction have stopped. They're all coming into this country. We're gonna, you're gonna see car plants going at a level that you've never seen before. Your trade adviser– I'm also—chips. Look at Jensen. Nvidia. He's gonna spend $500 billion. Look at Mr. Wei from Taiwan. Do you trust them when they say that? These businessmen who say, Oh, I'm gonna spend $500 billion. Oh yeah. Well, I’ll tell you why I trust them. First of all, I think they’re trustworthy people. But more importantly, they have no choice, because they won't be able to pay the tariffs if they don't do it. The tariffs are bringing in the business. Remember, with all the, you know, questions you're asking about tariffs, there are no tariffs when you make your product here. Sure, no, I understand, Mr. President— Zero. Your trade adviser, Peter Navarro, says 90 deals in 90 days is possible. We're now 13 days into the point from when you lifted the reciprocal, the discounted reciprocal tariffs. There's zero deals so far. Why is that? No, there’s many deals. When are they going to be announced? You have to understand, I'm dealing with all the companies, very friendly countries. We're meeting with China. We're doing fine with everybody. But ultimately, I've made all the deals. Not one has been announced yet. When are you going to announce them? I’ve made 200 deals. You’ve made 200 deals? 100%. Can you share with whom? Because the deal is a deal that I choose. View it differently: We are a department store, and we set the price. I meet with the companies, and then I set a fair price, what I consider to be a fair price, and they can pay it, or they don't have to pay it. They don't have to do business with the United States, but I set a tariff on countries. Some have been horrible to us. Some have been okay. Nobody's been great. Nobody's been great. Everybody took advantage of us. What I'm doing is I will, at a certain point in the not too distant future, I will set a fair price of tariffs for different countries. These are countries—some of them have made hundreds of billions of dollars, and some of them have made just a lot of money. Very few of them have made nothing because the United States was being ripped off by every, almost every country in the world, in the entire world. So I will set a price, and when I set the price, and I will set it fairly according to the statistics, and according to everything else. For instance, do they have the VAT system in play? Do they charge us tariffs? How much are they charging us? How much have they been charging us? Many, many different factors, right. How are we being treated by that country? And then I will set a tariff. Are we paying for their military? You know, as an example, we have Korea. We pay billions of dollars for the military. Japan, billions for those and others. But that, I'm going to keep us a separate item, the paying of the military. Germany, we have 50,000 soldiers— I’m just curious, why don’t you announce these deals that you’ve solidified? I would say, over the next three to four weeks, and we're finished, by the way. You’re finished? We’ll be finished. Oh, you will be finished in three to four weeks. I’ll be finished. Now, some countries may come back and ask for an adjustment, and I'll consider that, but I'll basically be, with great knowledge, setting—ready? We're a department store, a giant department store, the biggest department store in history. Everybody wants to come in and take from us. They're going to come in and they're going to pay a price for taking our treasure, for taking our jobs, for doing all of these things. But what I'm doing with the tariffs is people are coming in, and they're building at levels you've never seen before. We have $7 trillion of new plants, factories and other things, investment coming into the United States. And if you look back at past presidents, nobody was anywhere near that. And this is in three months. Will you call President Xi if he doesn’t call you? No. You won’t? Nope. Has he called you yet? Yep. When did he call you? He's called. And I don't think that's a sign of weakness on his behalf. But you would think it’s a sign of weakness if you called him? I don’t–I just look— Well, what did he say? If people want to–well, we all want to make deals. But I am this giant store. It's a giant, beautiful store, and everybody wants to go shopping there. And on behalf of the American people, I own the store, and I set prices, and I'll say, if you want to shop here, this is what you have to pay. This period of uncertainty will be over in three to four weeks? I don’t think there’s any uncertainty there. The only thing—they have an option. They don't have to shop here. They can go someplace else, but there aren't too many places they can go. You understand what I mean though? Sure. Your Treasury Secretary says this situation with China is unsustainable. Oh I agree. You mean the way it is now? Yes. Or the way it was before I got here? The current moment, too, he believes is unsustainable. Well, no, they won’t do any business here, because at 145% it's going to be very rare that you see business. But your conversations with Xi have made you feel like we’re moving towards a more productive— Oh, there’s a number at which they will feel comfortable. Yeah. But you can’t let them make a trillion dollars from us. You can’t let them make $750 billion. See, that’s really what’s not sustainable when China makes a trillion dollars, or a trillion one, when we have almost $2 trillion worth of, I call it loss. Some people don't, but a lot of it’s loss. I say, when you have a trade deficit of $2 trillion I consider that loss. Mr. President, there was a period of time on April 9 when the bond market was under extreme stress and there was a risk of a financial crisis far beyond what the plummeting stock market suggested. I wasn’t worried. What did your advisers tell you, though? You were in the Oval Office with Scott Bessent and Howard Lutnick. What did they tell you to convince you to lift the reciprocal tariffs for the 90-day pause? They didn’t tell me. I did that. What made you decide? It wasn’t for that reason. It wasn’t for the bond market? No, it wasn’t for that reason. I'm doing that until we come up with the numbers that I want to come up with. I've met with a lot of countries. I've talked on the telephone. I don’t even want them to come in. You said the bond market was getting the yips. The bond market was getting the yips, but I wasn’t. Because I know what we have. I know what we have, but I also know we won't have it for long if we allowed four more years of the gross incompetence. This thing was just running—it was running as a free spirit. This was—this was the most incompetent president in history. In our interview last year, Mr. President, you committed to complying with all Supreme Court orders. I said what? You committed to complying with all Supreme Court orders— Yeah. When you and I spoke last April. Are you still committed to complying with all Supreme Court orders? Sure, I believe in the court system. The Supreme Court ruled 9-0 that you have to bring back Kilmar Abrego Garcia. You haven't done so. Aren’t you disobeying the Supreme Court? Well, that’s not what my people told me—they didn’t say it was, they said it was—the nine to nothing was something entirely different. Let me quote from the ruling. “The order properly requires the government to facilitate Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador.” Are you facilitating a release? I leave that to my lawyers. I give them no instructions. They feel that the order said something very much different from what you're saying. But I leave that to my lawyers. If they want—and that would be the Attorney General of the United States and the people that represent the country. I don't make that decision. Have you asked President Bukele to return him? I haven’t, uh, he said he wouldn’t. Did you ask him? But I haven’t asked him positively, but he said he wouldn’t. But if you haven't asked him, then how are you facilitating his release? Well, because I haven't been asked to ask him by my attorneys. Nobody asked me to ask him that question, except you. Do you believe he deserves his day in court? I believe that they made him look like a saint, and then we found out about him. He wasn't a saint. He was MS-13. He was a wife beater and he had a lot of things that were very bad, you know, very, very bad. When I first heard of the situation, I was not happy, and then I found out that he was a person who was an MS-13 member. And in fact, he had a tattooed right on his—I'm sure you saw that—he had it tattooed right on his knuckles: MS-13. No, I believe he's a man who has got quite a past. This is no longer just a nice, wonderful man from Maryland, which people, which the fake news had me and other people for a period of time believing. Now, nobody believes that. And I think this isa very bad—I think this is another menwomen’s sports thing for the Democrats. Maybe, but Mr. President, whatever he might have done, whoever he might be affiliated with, doesn’t he deserve his day in court? Nazi saboteurs who came on our shores at Montauk during World War II had their day in court. Al Qaeda terrorists had their day in court. I really give that to my lawyers to determine, that’s why I have them. That’s not my determination. It's something that, frankly, bringing him back and retrying him wouldn't bother me, but I leave that up to my lawyer. You could bring him back and retry him— That’s exactly right. You could fix this simply by bringing him back and going through the legal process— But I leave that decision to the lawyers. At this moment, they just don’t want to do that. They say we’re in total compliance with the Supreme Court. What about the lower courts? Are you committed to complying with lower courts? Sure. All courts. One more question on this, sir. You took an oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. The Constitution says the Supreme Court is the ultimate authority once they issue a ruling. If you defy them, aren't you violating your oath? I'm not defying the Supreme Court. I never defy the Supreme Court. I wouldn't do that. I'm a big believer in the Supreme Court, and have a lot of respect for the Justices. You asked President Bukele of El Salvador to build out the CECOT prison to house American citizens. You said you would love to send “homegrown criminals” there— No, I didn’t say that. I said if it were permissible according to the law, I would like to do that, yes. Well, do you intend to send American citizens to foreign persons? I would love to do that if it were permissible by law. We're looking into that. When I have a person, these would be extreme cases. When I have a person that is a 28-time in and out person that goes out and tries to kill people every time he or she is out, I would have no problem with doing that whatsoever. We're talking about career criminals that are horrible people that we house and we have to take care of for 50 years while they suffer because they killed people. If you ask me whether or not I would do that, I would, but totally, and I think you have to leave this part of the sentence totally subject to it being allowed under law. And people are looking to see if it would be allowed under law. We have crime rates under Biden that went through the roof, and we have to bring those rates down. And unfortunately, those rates have been added to by the illegal immigrants that he allowed into the country. Which Americans would you do that to? I would do that to people that hit old ladies over the head with a baseball bat, for people that grab their bicycle? You saw that one where they dragged an old woman along the street on a motorcycle, a bicycle, a motorcycle, I think. People that push people into subway trains just before the train is ready to stop. You saw that? The man barely lived. Think of it. And a guy comes up to him, and from behind he pushes him. That's a serious, serious thing. People that shoot people in the back, people that are executioners. Yeah, I would have no trouble with that but subject to it being allowed by law. Do you really want there to be gulags for American citizens in foreign countries? Gulag? You define gulag. Prisons like in the Soviet Union— Look, I see where you’re coming from, from the moment this interview started, and it's fine, I don't mind. I've answered every question that can be answered by mankind or womankind, and I see where you're coming from. Rapid fire. You can't even wait for me to give you the answer. You should let me give you that final answer. Go ahead, sir. No, no, I’m not—I’m just saying, I see where you’re coming from, and you’re just so wrong. You’re so wrong. These are people that have been in jail for 20 times. They're career criminals. Do I have a problem with a career criminal that hits people with baseball bats when they're not looking, that pushes people into subways, that shoots people in the face or in the back? I have absolutely no problem with doing that, if the law allows it to be done and we're looking at it. And one of the reasons I like it is because it would be much less expensive than our prison system, and I think it would actually be a greater deterrent. Sir, on that note, how much are we paying President Bukele for holding those prisoners? I don’t know. I could get you the information, but we’re paying less than we would normally. Did you personally approve those payments? No, I didn’t. Many of the Jan. 6 prisoners you pardoned pleaded guilty to or were convicted of violent crimes as part of the capital attack. Days before you pardoned them, J.D. Vance said “of course” you wouldn't include those who committed violence. What changed? What changed where? At what moment did you decide to include all of the defendants, including the ones who committed violent offenses? Because I've watched in Portland and I watched in Seattle, and I've watched in Minneapolis, Minnesota and other places. People do heinous acts, far more serious than what took place on Jan. 6. And nothing happened to these people. Nothing. And I said, What a double standard it is. And we were talking about a very small group of people that are in your definition, most of these people should have been let out a long time ago. There's never been a group of people, maybe with one exception, I won't even go into it, one exception as a group. But there's never been a group of people that's been treated so horribly as the J6 people. You know, when I say peacefully and patriotically, nobody mentions that. When I say go peacefully and patriotically, nobody ever mentions that. Nobody mentions the fact that the unselect committee of political scum, the unselect committee, horrible people, they destroyed all evidence, they burned it, they got rid of it, they destroyed it, and they deleted all evidence. And we went in looking for evidence, and they said, I'm sorry, we don't have it anymore. It's been destroyed. If I ever did that, it would be unthinkable what you guys, what you two guys, would be doing and writing, but, you know, and nobody wants to talk about it, and you won't write about it, and nobody writes about it. It’s unbelievable, right? But people get it. I mean, people get it. They get what I'm saying, and they obviously believe it, because I had a hell of an election. You campaigned on it, and you won decisively. No and everything I campaigned. If you think of, you know, the way you ask me these questions, like, it's so serious that we're moving people out of the country. I said during the election that I'm going to move them out of the country, and that's what we're doing. Can you talk a little bit about the budget? Yeah. And if we didn't do it, then you two would not be safe. I guarantee it. Some Republicans are considering raising taxes on millionaires in the package you're planning to pass that would extend your 2017 tax cuts. Do you support that idea? Well, I’ll tell ya, I certainly don’t mind having a tax increase, and the only reason I wouldn't support it is because I saw Bush where they said, where he said “Read my lips” and he lost an election. He would have lost it anyway, but he lost an election. He got beat up pretty good. I would be honored to pay more, but I don't want to be in a position where we lose an election because I was generous, but me, as a rich person, would not mind paying and you know, we're talking about very little. We're talking about one point. It doesn't make that much difference, and yet, I could just see somebody trying to bring that up as a subject, and, you know, say, “Oh, he raised taxes.” Well, I wouldn't be, really, you know, in the true sense, I wouldn't. I'd be raising them on wealthy to take care of middle class. And that's—I love, that. I actually love the concept, but I don't want it to be used against me politically, because I've seen people lose elections for less, especially with the fake news. Do you think it would help cover the cost that would be lost from getting rid of taxes on tips and some of these other proposals? Well, that would be able to take it. See, that would be able to do it, but I would not mind personally paying more. But the concept is something that may not be acceptable to the public. Experts estimate that the House Republican budget will result in more than $800 billion in losses to Medicaid over the next 10 years. Do you support that? Due to what? The House Republican budget that would cut roughly $800 billion from Medicaid. I don’t think they’re going to cut $800 billion. They’re going to look at waste, fraud, and abuse. So would you veto a bill if it had cuts to Medicaid? If it was an increase, if we were deducting something from—I would, but it's waste, it's fraud and abuse is what we're looking for. And nobody minds that. If Republicans send you a bill that cuts Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, you commit to vetoing it? If it cuts it, I would not approve. So you would veto that? I would veto it, yeah. But they’re not going to do that. Would you support a ban on congressional stock trading? Well, I watched Nancy Pelosi get rich through insider information, and I would be okay with it. If they send that to me, I would do it. You'll sign it? Absolutely. The FTC is currently trying Meta for maintaining an illegal monopoly by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. Do you think more companies need to be broken up? It depends on the company, depends on the market, depends on what the company does. But I think that a lot of companies certainly have been looked at during the Obama and during the Biden regime certainly. Do you think corporate monopolies have hurt average Americans? In some cases, yeah. In some cases, not. I’d like to ask you some questions about DOGE. You've put Elon Musk in charge of this cost-cutting operation. The question is, why is the government, through DOGE, amassing the sensitive personal information about everyday Americans, which was previously stored across different agencies, all in one place? DOGE has been a very big success. We found hundreds of billions of dollars of waste, fraud, and abuse. Billions of dollars being given to politicians, single politicians based on the environment. It's a scam. It's illegal, in my opinion, so much of the stuff that we found, but I think DOGE has been a big success from that standpoint. [An aide interrupts the interview for President Trump to take a phone call from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi] So if we can just come back to the question before the call, which is the database that DOGE is putting together Americans’ information. Why are they doing that? Because we want to find waste, fraud, and abuse, and want to cut our costs. Some officials have described what DOGE is doing is creating a central kind of “God-mode” view into government databases that has been, up until now, intentionally kept separate. The idea, they say, is to basically use this information to advance your policy goals. Is this an accurate characterization? No, that’s inaccurate, as you know. I mean, it’s a crazy question. We just want to find fraud, abuse. We want to find who's on the rolls that shouldn't be, who's getting paid every month by the government that shouldn't be paid. Do these people exist? In many cases, they don't, in some cases, even worse, they do. They've been getting money, and they shouldn't be. What does your administration plan to do with information obtained by the IRS and other agencies as part of the DOGE effort? Well, I don’t know about the IRS, because, as you know, I’m not involved in it, but we’ve found tremendous waste, fraud and abuse. Tremendous. Will any of it be used to track down and round up migrants as part of the deportation operation? Not that I know of, no. Let's talk about the cuts. As you know, Mr. President, a lot of American companies do business with the government. The DOGE cuts aren't just affecting government employees. They're also affecting American businesses that provide goods and services to the federal government. There were nearly 280,000 layoffs in March across virtually every sector. Why is it better for these people to be out of jobs? Because we have to have an efficient country. And when the country gets down to bare knuckles, you're going to see, you're going to see something the likes of which this world has never seen before. We're going to make our country strong, powerful, and very rich again. Right now, our country is not sustainable. We're being ripped off by everybody in the world, other countries, other people, other militaries, are ripping us off. We're protecting countries for no money or for very minimal money, and that wasn't supposed to happen. We're not supposed to be protecting everybody. We're supposed to be, number one, taking care of ourself, and number two, helping people when we can, helping outside people and outside countries where we can. But we've been ripped off by levels that you've never seen. European Union sounds nice, but they've been very tough. $300 billion loss. China—hundreds of billions of dollars in losses. And I can go through a list, but I don't want to, because there are many friendly countries, our friendly countries, in many cases, are worse than our enemies. And it's not a sustainable model. It's not a sustainable possibility even, that a country can go through that and Biden let it get to a level that is seriously dangerous. Well, many Americans certainly agree with you that they want to get rid of government fraud, waste, and abuse. They want to shrink the federal— It’s not only government. It’s deals. It's horrible deals that have been made with other countries. As an example, China has been ripping us off for many years, until I came along. I raised, I upped tariffs on China, hundreds of billions of dollars. We've done hundreds of billions, hundreds. But domestically, for instance, your administration blocked grants for the National Institutes of Health that funded research into infectious diseases, cancers, Alzheimer's— Well maybe we didn't think they were right. You know, I mean, you look at the people, look at the money that was given away by others. We didn't get anything out of it. Well what do you tell the families and people who are suffering from those diseases? We're taking care of—we're spending a lot. I spent 58—we spent, let's see, I think $58 billion in the first term. We were spending tremendous amounts of money, and I am now, but they have to be a little bit careful. A lot of the money like Stacey Abrams got $2 billion on the environment. They had $100 in the account and she got $2 billion just before these people left—and had to do with something that she knows nothing about. NIH is the world’s largest funder of cancer research— Shouldn’t they be asking those questions? I could give you a list of abuse and waste and fraud, and you don't have any interest in hearing it. I mean, I just see by these questions, just wondering, with all of the bad things that have happened, with all of the things we found, you have no interest in those things. You only have an interest. So what about this? What about that? Our country is going to be strong again because of what we're doing, and this is not a sustainable model, what we're looking at. And I think very importantly, I had a great election. Won all seven swing states, won millions and millions of votes. Won millions of votes. They say it was the most consequential election in 129 years. I don't know if that's right, but it was certainly a big win, and that's despite cheating that took place, by the way, because there was plenty of cheating that took place. In ‘24? ‘24, yeah. ‘20, of course. But ‘24 also, they tried. They tried that. They did their best. It's the only thing they're good at. But we're gonna have a great country again. Just remember, every single question you're asking, I campaigned on it. I campaigned on all the things you're talking about, all the things you're asking about, and openly campaigned. And we're given credit, even by radical left lunatics. We are given credit for that. We're given credit for saying, This is what I'm going to do. If you look at your questions, that's what I campaigned on. Following that call, I'd love to hear a little bit about the role that you're playing on the world stage. And I think that you campaigned on that too. It’s interesting because you see the relationship. I didn't want to wait, you know, have you leave the room, but you see the relationship. I have that relationship with many leaders. If I can stop losing 3,000 human beings a week on average, with Russia, Ukraine, it's only because of me, nobody else could have stopped it. I think we're going to do that, by the way. I think that'll be done. I think that we're going to make a deal with Iran. I think we're going to make a deal with Iran. Nobody else could do that. You said you would end the war in Ukraine on Day One. Well, I said that figuratively, and I said that as an exaggeration, because to make a point, and you know, it gets, of course, by the fake news [unintelligible]. Obviously, people know that when I said that, it was said in jest, but it was also said that it will be ended. Well what’s taking so long? When do you think it will be ended? Well, I don’t think it’s long. I mean, look, I got here three months ago. This war has been going on for three years. It's a war that would have never happened if I was president. It's Biden's war. It’s not my war. I have nothing to do with it. I would have never had this war. This war would have never happened. Putin would have never done it. This war would have never happened. Oct. 6 would have never happened. Oct. 7 would have never happened. Would have never happened. Ever. You then say, what’s taking so long? Do you hear this, Steve? The war has been raging for three years. I just got here, and you say, what's taken so long? Do you think peace is still possible if Putin is President? I think peace is possible. You say if Putin is still president? Yeah, if Putin is President. Can there be peace if Putin is President of Russia? I think with me as president, there's—possible, if very probable. If somebody else is president, no chance. If Putin can make peace? Yeah, I think Putin will. I think Putin would rather do it a different way. I think he’d rather go and take the whole thing. And I think that because of me, I believe I'm the only one that can get this thing negotiated. And I think we’re a long way. We've had very good talks, and we're getting very close to a deal. And I don't believe anybody else could have made that deal. Do you believe peace is possible if Zelensky is still President of Ukraine? Yeah, I do. He is president now and I think we’re going to make a deal. Should Ukraine give up any hope of ever joining NATO? I don’t think they’ll ever be able to join NATO. I think that's been—from day one, I think that's been, that's I think what caused the war to start was when they started talking about joining NATO. If that weren't brought up, there would have been a much better chance that it wouldn’t have started. Should Crimea go to the Russians? Should they get to keep Crimea? Well, Crimea went to the Russians. It was handed to them by Barack Hussein Obama, and not by me. With that being said, will they be able to get it back? They've had their Russians. They've had their submarines there for long before any period that we're talking about, for many years. The people speak largely Russian in Crimea. But this was given by Obama. This wasn't given by Trump. Would it have been taken from me like it was taken from Obama? No, it wouldn't have happened. Crimea, if I were president, it would not have been taken. Would it be acceptable to you in a deal if Crimea and the four other regions that Russia has taken from Ukraine would be folded into Russia under a final accommodation? If Crimea will stay with Russia—we have to only talk about Crimea because that's the one that always gets mentioned. Crimea will stay with Russia. And Zelensky understands that, and everybody understands that it's been with them for a long time. It's been with them long before Trump came along. Again, this is Obama's war. This is a war that should have never happened. I call it the war that should have never happened. You’ve talked about improving relations with Moscow. Are you pursuing negotiations with them on issues other than Ukraine? No— Like nuclear weapons stockpiles or testing? But if a deal has happened, I can see us doing business with Ukraine and with Russia as a country. You've talked about acquiring Greenland, taking control of the Panama Canal, making Canada the 51st state. Maybe you're trolling a little bit on that one. I don't know. Actually, no, I’m not. Well, do you want to grow the American empire? Well, it depends as an empire, it wasn't, these are not things that we had before, so I'd view it a little bit differently if we had the right opportunity. Yeah, I think Greenland would be very well off if they I think it's important for us for national security and even international security. I think Canada, what you said that, “Well, that one, I might be trolling.” But I'm really not trolling. Canada is an interesting case. We lose $200 to $250 billion a year supporting Canada. And I asked a man who I called Governor Trudeau. I said, ”Why? Why do you think we're losing so much money supporting you? Do you think that's right? Do you think that's appropriate for another country to make it possible, for a country to sustain and he was unable to give me an answer, but it costs us over $200 billion a year to take care of Canada?” We’re taking care of their military. We're taking care of every aspect of their lives, and we don't need them to make cars for us. In fact, we don't want them to make cars for us. We want to make our own cars. We don't need their lumber. We don't need their energy. We don't need anything from Canada. And I say the only way this thing really works is for Canada to become a state. Steven Cheung: We’re coming up on time, about 10 minutes. Okay, we'll move quickly then. Last note: Do you want to be remembered as a president who expanded American territory? Wouldn’t mind. One more question on the cuts, sir. You've made cuts to homeland security, cyber defenses, the Nuclear Security Administration, your FBI chief is pushing to shift the bureau from domestic intelligence to criminal investigation. These are programs that were set up after September 11 to prevent terrorist attacks. Are you worried that this could be making America more vulnerable to an attack? No. America will be much stronger. If we are attacked, do you risk being blamed for letting down our defenses? What does that mean? If we are subject to an attack, do you risk being blamed because of these cuts? I think I'll be blamed no matter what. I think if I make the country unbelievably successful, which it's not now, we owe $36 trillion right? It's, you know, when you think about it, a lot of money, a lot of money, but, but no, I think I'll be, I'll be blamed whether it's successful or not. I'm used to it. You may be right about that. UNICEF says that more than 300 children have been killed and more than 600 have been wounded since the ceasefire in Gaza broke down. Who is to blame for those deaths? I would say that the blame for that is Biden more than anybody else, because I had, as you know, Iran was broke, and he allowed them to become rich— More than Hamas? There was no money for Hamas. There was no money for Hezbollah. There was no money. Iran was broke under Trump, and you know that, he knows that, broke. They had no money, and they told Hamas, we're not giving you any money. When Biden came and he took off all the sanctions, he let China and everybody else buy all the oil, Iran developed $300 billion in cash over a four year period. They started funding terror again, including Hamas. Hamas was out of business. Hezbollah was out of business. Iran had no money under me. I blame the Biden administration, because they allowed Iran to get back into the game without working a deal. You’ve begun direct talks with Iran. Are you open to meeting with Iran’s President or Supreme Leader? Sure. You reportedly stopped Israel from attacking Iran's nuclear sites. That's not right. It’s not right? No, it’s not right. I didn’t stop them. But I didn't make it comfortable for them, because I think we can make a deal without the attack. I hope we can. It's possible we'll have to attack because Iran will not have a nuclear weapon. But I didn't make it comfortable for them, but I didn't say no. Ultimately I was going to leave that choice to them, but I said I would much prefer a deal than bombs being dropped. Are you worried Netanyahu will drag you into a war? No. Let’s talk about some of the issues with universities— By the way, he may go into a war. But we’re not getting dragged in. The U.S. will stay out of it if Israel goes into it? No, I didn’t say that. You asked if he’d drag me in, like I’d go in unwillingly. No, I may go in very willingly if we can't get a deal. If we don't make a deal, I'll be leading the pack. You're planning your first major foreign trip for your second term to the Middle East next month. What are the last hurdles for Saudi Israeli normalization? Well, what I want, and the reason I'm doing it, is because Saudi Arabia, I happen to like the people very much, and the Crown Prince and the King—I like all of them, but they've agreed to invest a trillion dollars in our economy. $1 trillion. I'm then going to Qatar, and I'm then going to UAE, and then I'm coming back, and then we're making another. I think our foreign policy has been incredible, and it was before, and it is now. You sort of got a little glimpse of it. Are you closer to a Saudi-Israeli normalization deal than you were before? I have very good relationships in the Middle East, and I think all over the world. I think it's—well, the smarter people understand. I have stopped—I have solved more problems in the world without asking for or getting credit. This would be a big one. Which one? Saudi-Israeli normalization. You had the Abraham Accords, one of your, you know, historic accomplishments— Unfortunately, they did nothing. They did nothing with the Abraham Accords. We had four countries in there, it was all set. We would have had it packed. Now we're going to start it again. The Abraham Accords is a tremendous success, but Biden just sat with it. Can you build on it to get the Saudi-Israeli normalization deal? Well, I tell you what: I think Saudi Arabia will go into the Abraham Accords. Yeah? Yeah, and by the way, I think it will be full very quickly. It would be a big deal if that happens. They did nothing. Oh, that will happen. That would be a big accomplishment. The State Department said it has revoked 300 student visas, primarily because of their participation in campus protests. I want to ask you about this, Mr. President, because you emphasized free speech as a cornerstone of your campaign, you castigated efforts to suppress it. But now it looks like your administration is deporting hundreds of people for engaging in speech you don't like. Why? Tremendous anti-semitism at every one of those rallies. Tremendous, and I agree with free speech, but not riots all over every college in America. Tremendous anti-semitism going on in this country. Are you worried that you're intimidating students or chilling free speech on American campuses and elsewhere throughout the country? No, they can protest, but they can't destroy the schools like they did with Columbia and others. Let’s talk about one case. Are you familiar with the case of the Tufts University student Reynessa Ozturk, who was arrested by a group of plain clothes officers. Well, she has since been accused by your government of having ties to Hamas. They have not revealed any evidence. Would you direct your Department of Justice to disclose the evidence that she is connected to Hamas? I would have no trouble with it, no. I’ll look into it, but I’m not aware of the particular event. You were harshly critical of what you called the weaponization of the Justice System under Biden. You recently signed memos— Well, sure, but you wouldn’t be—if this were Biden, well, first of all, he wouldn't do an interview because he was grossly incompetent. We spoke to him last year, Mr. President. Huh? We spoke to him a year ago. How did he do? You can read the interview yourself. Not too good. I did read the interview. He didn't do well. He didn't do well at all. He didn't do well at anything. And he cut that interview off to being a matter of minutes, and you weren't asking him questions like you're asking me. Well, we appreciate that you are able and willing to answer these questions. It says something about you, Mr. President. I am indeed. I've been answering them for years and I’ve been getting elected by bigger and bigger numbers all the time, but you didn't ask questions like this to Biden, because if you did, he would have crawled under this beautiful desk. You recently signed memos calling for an investigation of Chris Krebs, a top cybersecurity official in your first term. Isn't that, though, what you accused Biden of doing to you? I think Chris Krebs was a disgrace to our country. I think he was—I think he was terrible. By the way, I don't know him. I'm not—I don't think I ever met him. I probably saw him around. You know, I have people come in, like the other one. He came in, and he's on CNN all the time as like an expert on Trump. I have no idea who he is. And Chris Krebs the same thing. I guess he probably said he knows me, but I have no idea. And you know, oftentimes I'll have some people sitting right here, and behind them will be 10 or 15 people from their agency or their office, and they'll stand there, and then all of a sudden, I'll hear that like I'm, you know, they're all time experts in me. I know very little about Chris Krebs, but I think he was very deficient. You've used threats and lawsuits, other forms of coercion— Well, I’ve gotta be doing something right, because I've had a lot of law firms give me a lot of money. Why is that an appropriate use of presidential power? Well, I think it is because I think they felt that the election was rigged and stolen and they didn't want to be a part of it. You think they gave me $100 million each for nothing? You know these law firms gave me $100 million worth of work, et cetera, and other things. And do you think they gave me that because I'm a nice guy? I don't think so. They gave it to me because they knew what they did wrong and they didn't want to get involved with it. And that's okay. That's the way it works, unfortunately. But that is an appropriate use of presidential power, you think? Which is? The threats and the EOs against the law firms. They pay–these are the top firms in the world. These are the biggest, the best: Cravath, Milbank Tweed, Paul Weiss. These are the toughest, smartest firms. They don't, they don't do this unless there's a little problem or a big problem. Isn't cutting a deal with them to remove a threat from you and to do pro-bono work for causes you like just a form of extortion? I don’t think it was a threat. I think they did that because, I assume they did it because they felt they did something wrong. Otherwise they would have, we would have had a lawsuit. You once said you weren't sure how the Civil Rights Act quote “worked out.” Would America be better without it? I never heard of that. Nobody’s ever asked me that before. You said it in a 2020 interview. I don't remember having said that. Cheung: We have time for one more question. When we spoke to you a year ago, we asked whether you would challenge the 22nd Amendment, which limits presidents to two terms. You said, and I quote, “I'm going to serve one term. I'm going to do a great job, and I'm going to leave.” What changed? Well, I’m serving two terms now. You meant one in addition to the one you already served. You mean one more. I have more people begging me to run again, but I haven't looked at even the possibility. But the only thing that's changed is they think I'm doing a great job, and they like the way I'm running the country. They have a border, which you didn't ask about, that's virtually totally closed. The best border we've ever had. Border crossings are down substantially. No, I mean, it's, it's really, people can't believe it. They interviewed some farmers, really beautiful people that lived on the other side. They were being drawn into fights and horror shows, and now, I mean, it was dangerous. One of them got very badly injured, and by an illegal migrant that came across. And they asked him, How is it now? He said, ”Thank God for Donald Trump. It's the best it's ever been. And I've lived here for 50 years.” You recently said you were “not joking” about seeking a third term and that there were methods to do it. What methods? I'd rather not discuss that now, but as you know, there are some loopholes that have been discussed that are well known. But I don't believe in loopholes. I don't believe in using loopholes. You wouldn’t run as vice president to J.D. Vance? I don’t know anything about, what, look, all I can say is this, I am being inundated with requests. I'm doing a good job. Great physical exam, and unlike every other president, I took the cognitive test and I aced it 100% and I bet you guys couldn't get 100% on that exam. It's a tough exam. You know, when you get into the mid questions, it gets to be pretty tricky and pretty tough, and the last questions are very tough, and I aced it. And I guarantee, I'd give you, I'd make a big, beautiful bet that you guys couldn't ace it. But anyway. But look, it's good to have you, it’s a very nasty interview. They don’t ask any of the good things. One final question. Mr. President, you were showing us the new paintings you have behind us. You put all these new portraits. One of them includes John Adams. John Adams said we’re a government ruled by laws, not by men. Do you agree with that? John Adams said that? Where was the painting? It’s right here. We’re a government ruled by laws, not by men? Well, I think we're a government ruled by law, but you know, somebody has to administer the law. So therefore men, certainly, men and women, certainly play a role in it. I wouldn't agree with it 100%. We are a government where men are involved in the process of law, and ideally, you're going to have honest men like me. Thank you, Mr. President.

Title: As Trump Administration Considers Retreat on Tariffs, Will It Resort to Usual US Fallback Option?

With a big push from Washington, the traditional value chain pyramid that has supported the American economic house of cards for decades is under serious duress. So is its global trading system, already strained by geopolitical blowups coming from the empire in decline. Like so much with Trump, he is acting as an accelerant. All “these structural shifts have accelerated in recent months” according to Singapore Senior Minister Lee Hsien. Assessing the Damage So Far A brief look at the damage so far reveals that the century-high tariff levels imposed by Trump are expected to hammer global economic growth this year. The IMF downgraded its projection for global GDP growth to 2.8 percent, down from a forecast of 3.3 percent in January. Humiliatingly for Trump, US growth projections took the biggest hit among wealthier countries, dropping to 1.8 percent growth from 2.7 percent. (Although the EU could join the party if it doubles down on its China “de-risking.”) And as always, the pain will hit the poorest the hardest. Coupled with climate change (where Trump, aside from his degrowth tariffs, is also acting as an accelerant), these trends are heading towards a turning point where global trade growth no longer keeps pace with GDP. That could dramatically slow economic growth in many countries, which will cause more social and political problems. Singapore Minister Lee said “In that event, the world would truly enter a new epoch, which it has not seen since the Second World War.” While Team Trump might be reconsidering the breadth of the tariffs on China, they are still likely to remain high. Here’s the WSJ: One senior White House official said the China tariffs were likely to come down to between roughly 50% and 65%. The administration is also considering a tiered approach similar to the one proposed by the House committee on China late last year: 35% levies for items the U.S. deems not a threat to national security, and at least 100% for items deemed as strategic to America’s interest, some of the people said. To What End? The official line is simple enough. Here’s Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent speaking at the Institute of International Finance on Wednesday: China, in particular, is in need of a rebalancing. Recent data shows the Chinese economy tilting even further away from consumption toward manufacturing. China’s economic system, with growth driven by manufacturing exports, will continue to create even more serious imbalances with its trading partners if the status quo is allowed to continue. China’s current economic model is built on exporting its way out of its economic troubles. It’s an unsustainable model that is not only harming China but the entire world. China needs to change. The country knows it needs to change. Everyone knows it needs to change. And we want to help it change—because we need rebalancing too. China can start by moving its economy away from export overcapacity, and toward supporting its own consumers and domestic demand. Such a shift would help with the global rebalancing that the world desperately needs. That’s all well and good, and perhaps it would be best for China to “rebalance.” But the US refuses to accept that it doesn’t get to make that call. In attempting to use tariffs as a geopolitical bargaining chip, it is weaponizing trade and causing other countries to do the same. There are also indications that Washington is after more than just aiding the “global rebalancing that the world desperately needs.” On April 16 the Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. plans to use global tariff negotiations to isolate China. The Irish Times on the same day had the scoop that any Washington-Brussels deal over tariffs will likely involve an agreement for the bloc to fully join the US in the economic war against China. In addition to the stated goal of reorienting supply chains outside of China via “friendshoring,” there are the more bonkers statements coming from Trump World. Donald Trump’s top economic advisor Stephen Miran let it be known that part of Washington’s rationale behind the tariffs is to force countries to pay the US tribute to maintain its global financial and military empire. Good luck with that. And there’s JD Vance admitting that the US wants China and the “Global South” at the bottom of the international division of labor, meaning that China has gotten too big for its britches. It was fine when it produce low value-added goods or higher-end, designed-in-the-West products, but absolutely not okay if China starts designing and making its own high end products surpassing the West. And so Washington wants to turn back time to the good old days when China knew its place. Good luck with that, too. The problem is the US simply doesn’t have the economic clout it thinks it does to affect this hierarchical vision anymore. The Dispensable Nation Other countries, of course, take issue with China’s ongoing dominance in low-tech manufacturing even as it moves higher up the value chain. Yet Washington’s typical heavy-handed shakedown approach has managed to alienate most of them and push them into China’s embrace: Singapore’s PM has laid it out. He knows the U.S. has abandoned the multilateral trading system, upon which Singaporeans wealth is based. There’s only one stable force with the heft to anchor multilateral trade in this episode of disruption. It’s China. https://t.co/Zb0sZnEOZq — Warwick Powell | 鲍韶山 (@baoshaoshan) April 5, 2025 Add to that the fact that China might also be more willing to relinquish control over low-end manufacturing if it wasn’t so deadset on autarky due to the all-to-reasonable concerns over US efforts to isolate it. Even if the mainstream press is starting to come to terms with the US inability to shape events. Here’s a good summary of the coalescing conventional wisdom from Alan Beattie, former economist at the Bank of England, writing yesterday in the the Financial Times: Bessent and other administration officials are now beetling around the world desperately trying to sign dozens of trade deals while fractious financial markets metaphorically hold a gun to their heads, and we’re asked to believe it is all a cunning plan. Obviously, Trump’s strategy is terrible: it’s not even clear what he wants. But a less inept administration would also be struggling. Over the decades, the US’s leverage to remake the global trading system — capital flows, advanced technology and access to its vast consumer market — has weakened relative to China. Barack Obama used to call the US the “indispensable nation”. In trade and tech terms that is increasingly untrue. During the post-second world war Marshall Plan, the US created a largely Atlanticist political economy in western Europe. It offered not just financial Marshall Aid but also advanced technology, and access to its growing consumer market. Those advantages have dissipated. US aid budgets have massively shrunk relative to China’s, and the so-called Department of Government Efficiency has more or less closed down their last vestiges in the US Agency for International Development. And while China dominates in fields like necessity items, clean tech, mineral processing. The US can offer market access to its increasingly impoverished populace drawing in credit card debt, but even that isn’t a given anymore. Beattie continues: Trump’s idea is to threaten to take market access away with high tariffs and then restore it in return for trade concessions. It’s all stick and no carrot. The credibility of his threat to impose permanently high import duties is subject to the whim of the financial markets, and his trustworthiness in keeping those taxes low following a deal exceedingly suspect. In the global game of trade poker, Trump inherited a weakening hand and is playing it extremely badly. Bessent and his other officials are in a precarious position. The US does not have the aid, the technology or the market access to exert control over global trade the way it once did, and Trump’s erratic behaviour is rapidly increasing the probability that it never will. Other US Options Despite the tariffs gambit blowing up in Trump’s face, the US is unlikely to stop trying, and even an aborted tariffs plan will still cause upheaval in global supply chains. If tariffs don’t force China to make a “deal,” what could Trump opt for instead? Washington is likely to continue with an attempt to weaken Chinese freight shipping and shipbuilding, as well as push ahead with the fight over strategically located ports. For example, there are still US fees for Chinese-built ships and the potential sale of ports in Panama and elsewhere. Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings in March announced that it was selling all its overseas ports, including two at the Panama Canal, to a consortium led by US investment firm BlackRock in a deal worth $23 billion. The Trump administration was reportedly in close contact with BlackRock during the lead up to the sale and helped instigate it with its pressure on Hutchinson so this is essentially a US-led Western takeover. CK Hutchison currently operates 53 ports in 24 countries. Under the deal with BlackRock, the conglomerate would sell all of them except the 10 it operates in mainland China and Hong Kong. A a low profile Italian-Swiss family behind the Mediterranean Shipping Company is acquiring 41 of the ports in the deal, with BlackRock controlling the two in Panama. But the deal remains in question following China’s market regulator launching an antitrust probe into Hutchinson, which coincided with news that a final signing of the deal would not go ahead. While the Panama ports in the deal received the lion’s share of the attention in the US, it’s a deal that would have global implications, as the following map shows: Compare that to a map of global chokepoints, and it’s clear why Beijing is putting the kibosh on the deal: Where chokepoints and Hutchinson ports don’t overlap, such as the Cape of Good Hope, the US is in the midst of a pressure campaign on South Africa with an eye on a naval base there. Chief among China’s concerns with the Hutchinson deal is that the new ownership could, under pressure from Washington, refuse Chinese ships or militarize the ports and use them to enact a maritime blockade of China. Choke points one area we could expect to see US escalation in the face of a potential backtrack on tariffs—more pressure on South Africa, more US violence in Yemen and Somalia, and a further militarization of Panama. One of the driving forces behind Hutchinson’s decision to sell was the increasing pressure being put on its business by the US. From the WSJ: In the days before finalizing the deal, Fink held calls with Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and national security adviser Michael Waltz, ultimately garnering the administration’s blessing, according to people close to the deal. Behind the scenes, Hutchinson executives had grown uneasy that a hostile Trump administration could make life hard on their sprawling global conglomerate… Hutchinson executives had weighted selling these and dozens more ports before, but the timing wasn’t right. With Trump applying pressure — and Hutchinson shares trading at a substantial discount to the company’s underlying assets — that changed. …executives were surprised by Trump’s decision to revoke special trade privileges for Hong Kong, and Panama authorities had just announced an audit of Hutchinson’s contract. There was also the fact that U.S. Southern Command was/is partnering more closely with Panamanian security forces and drawing up plans to seize the Panama Canal by force—only if necessary, of course. Does the failure of the tariffs gambit and potentially the Hutchinson deal too make it more likely the US goes through with such threats? That’s how it often goes with Washington. Like an organized crime outfit, if its terms aren’t accepted, it turns to force. Thing is, even if the Hutchinson ports deal goes through, and even if Washington tried any funny business at them and global chokepoints, we’d still be back in the same spot we are today with the tariffs. The US would still be cutting off its nose to spite its face. We’ll have to wait and see if it’ll go that route again. According to the deal between CK Hutchison and BlackRock, both parties have 145 days to come to a definitive agreement. There are 95 days to go. I didn’t know about the Chinese antitrust move targeting Hutchinson. Fascinating stuff. Thanks, Conor. The talk may be of trade and tariffs and balances and overproduction but what it is really about is establishing American dominance in the 21st century. Consider. Suppose that the US and China decided that they only way to resolve their problems was an economic divorce. China ships nothing to the US and the US ships nothing to China. Trump gets what he wants while China loses only a very smaller percentage of it’s trade and no more headaches. Problem solved, right? Wrong. After this the US will demand that any country that trades with the US abandon all trade and economic links with China – which they are doing already – and you can see in this post how they are already trying to get a chock-hold on world trade. Mostly for China but maybe other countries as well. The DC policy wonks want China isolated from world trade and wrecked so that American dominance can be the name of the game. But for that to happen, China has to be degraded first. Wars have started over less. And this is why Trump wants out of the Ukraine. So that the US can go fully after China. The last two articles of John Helmer present the intelectual underpinnings of this approach. One was already posted by NC. The best way to isolate China internationally is to have it attack Taiwan. To achieve this, Trump will provoke Beijing in any way possible. He may even say something like putting a U.S. missile base on Taiwan. That is what provoked Russia to invade the Ukraine. Blinken told Lavrov that the US would be stationing nuclear missiles in the Ukraine and the only question was how many. The US is busy casting blame on others for its own dreadful domestic policy record of abject failure for 50 years or more where industrial policy in particular and distribution of the benefits of the global trade architecture (including the IMF and World Bank which it dominates) it created as part of its post-WWII neocolonial empire more generally are concerned. The premise that the poor countries of the global majority somehow have cheated Americans via the unequal terms of trade and debt bondage under which they have laboured primarily for the benefit of their comprador elites and US multinational corporations is laughable on its face. Unfortunately the American public is mostly just plain ignorant, so their (mis)leadership class will probably escape accountability yet again. Whether or not the rest of the world is prepared to continue to put up with it, on the other hand, remains an open question … 🤨 Well said. Imagine what would happen if the Chinese government put out a press release that said the US focuses too much on consumption and not enough on investment in productive facilities. This has led to perennial trade deficits and a national federal debt that is unsustainable. The country needs to cut its costs so and increase investments so that it can compete globally instead of just paying for its over-consumption with increased debt. “Does the failure of the tariffs gambit and potentially the Hutchinson deal too make it more likely the US goes through with such threats?” As fans of Mafia movies know organized crime operates in the shadows and when a rogue Don draws too much attention he gets bumped off. So all this blustering in public isn’t even good crime strategy. Here’s suggesting that making threats simply gives Trump a thrill up the leg. Perhaps he is going to attack some country–Iran, Mexico, Panama, Greenland, there’s a list–but why take the risk as long as people are taking him seriously? That may be fading fast. There is a reliance on massive amounts of low wage earners and at the same time a desire for more consumer spending by too many countries. All are in the trap and now fighting each other over access to high earners. Regards to the last sentence, being in the trap and working to earn one’s way up and out of the lowest rungs was seemingly or once upon a time , quite doable but then many things changed oh like 40 years back? Okay or understood if that’s not going back far enough, but really coming out of the stagflation era under Ford then Carter. That was followed by the Reagan and Bush terms brought a lighter approach to broad regulations which was then doubled down upon under Clinton. We’ve enjoyed the proverbial fruit of the inflationary unicorn that came or followed with the Volcker era but then as a country forgot to maintain our manufacturing prowess. Just looking at business headlines this morning, an iconic American technology stalwart like Intel has clearly grown into a mismanaged business, which happens slowly until someone in leadership wakes the heck up. Back to that last thought…just my view that science fiction has been righter all along. The Jackpot isn’t arriving instead it has already been played and continues to play out… “After this the US will demand that any country that trades with the US abandon all trade and economic links with China” China is the leading trade partner of 120 countries. It is totally impossible for them to abandon all trade with China. Just who would be manufacturing all of these things? Apple has already announced that they will be moving iPhone assembly to India but no idea if Trump will hit them up for tariffs from that country- https://www.rt.com/news/616322-ft-apple-to-shift-iphone-assembly-china-india/ But the whole idea of every country abandoning trade links with China for that of an unstable US will not fly.

Title: WEF’s Klaus Schwab and his wife Hilde under investigation for ethical and financial MISCONDUCT

Full Content:
World Economic Forum (WEF) founder Klaus Schwab and his wife Hilde are under investigation for alleged financial and ethical misconduct, including misuse of WEF funds for personal luxuries and cash withdrawals by junior staff. A whistleblower letter accused the Schwabs of blurring personal and organizational finances, such as billing luxury trips and private massages to the nonprofit. Klaus denies the claims, stating personal expenses were reimbursed. Following an emergency board meeting the day before, Klaus retired as WEF chairman "with immediate effect" on April 21, ending his 50+ year leadership amid escalating scrutiny. The scandal follows prior workplace culture allegations, including discrimination claims. Interim leadership falls to Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, a controversial ex-Nestle CEO. Schwab's departure marks the end of an era, but critics argue the WEF's technocratic agenda (e.g., the "Great Reset") will persist, maintaining its influence over global governance.

Schwab's departure marks the end of an era, but critics argue the WEF's technocratic agenda (e.g., the "Great Reset") will persist, maintaining its influence over global governance. Klaus Schwab, founder of the globalist World Economic Forum (WEF), is under investigation for ethical and financial misconduct alongside his wife Hilde. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported Tuesday, April 22, that the WEF's board had opened a new probe into the Schwabs. It followed a whistleblower letter from current and former staff accusing the couple of misusing WEF funds for personal luxuries, including travel and private massages. Moreover, the letter also accused Klaus, 87, of directing junior employees to withdraw cash on his behalf. The allegations upended his planned transition and cast a shadow over the organization he led for more than 50 years. They also triggered his sudden retirement as the WEF's chairman "with immediate effect" â a decision announced Monday, April 21. According to the whistleblower letter, the Schwabs blurred personal and organizational finances by using the nonprofit's resources for private benefits. Among the claims were that Hilde scheduled token meetings to justify luxury trips billed to the WEF and that Klaus requested employees withdraw thousands in cash for unspecified purposes. A spokesperson for the Schwabs denied all allegations, stating that Klaus would sue those spreading "mistruths." Any personal expenses charged to the WEF were later reimbursed, the spokesperson added. Schwab steps down, but will anything change? The WEF's board, which includes figures like BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, held an emergency meeting Sunday, April 20. They voted unanimously to open an independent probe, with Klaus stepping down the following day. His departure marks the end of an era for the WEF, which he founded in 1971 as the European Management Forum before rebranding it into a platform for global elites to shape economic and political agendas. The controversy follows another recent investigation into the WEF's workplace culture, prompted by an earlier WSJ report alleging discrimination against women and Black employees. While the WEF disputed those claims at the time, the new whistleblower allegations accelerated Schwab's exit. Interim leadership now falls to Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, former Nestle CEO and a controversial figure known for advocating water privatization and genetically modified foods. (Related: Klaus Schwab STEPS DOWN as World Economic Forum executive chairman.) Schwab's legacy is deeply intertwined with the WEF's evolution into a hub for global governance, where business leaders, politicians and activists converge annually in Davos. Critics have long accused the organization of promoting technocratic elitism, particularly after Schwab's "Great Reset" initiative, which called for restructuring economies post-pandemic through digital and biological integration. His 2022 warning of future global crises reinforced perceptions of the WEF as a self-appointed architect of humanity's future. Despite Schwab's departure, analysts doubt the WEF's direction will change. "Schwab is a megalomaniac, but his resignation won't alter the WEF's mission," said Michael Rectenwald, author of a critical book on the organization. Others, like journalist Tim Hinchliffe of The Sociable, warn that the WEF will continue pushing a technocratic agenda merging corporations, governments and digital identities. As the investigation unfolds, the WEF faces scrutiny over its governance and the conduct of its leadership. For now, Schwab's sudden exit closes a contentious chapter, but the questions surrounding his tenure â and the organization's influence â remain unresolved.

Whistleblower calls for WEF founder Klaus Schwab to be ARRESTED over "crimes against humanity". Critics blast Klaus Schwab, WEF for trying to "master the future" with global enslavement agenda. Sources include: ChildrensHealthDefense.org WSJ.com APNews.com Brighteon.com The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported Tuesday, April 22, that the WEF's board had opened a new probe into the Schwabs. It followed a whistleblower letter from current and former staff accusing the couple of misusing WEF funds for personal luxuries, including travel and private massages. Moreover, the letter also accused Klaus, 87, of directing junior employees to withdraw cash on his behalf. The allegations upended his planned transition and cast a shadow over the organization he led for more than 50 years. They also triggered his sudden retirement as the WEF's chairman "with immediate effect" â a decision announced Monday, April 21. According to the whistleblower letter, the Schwabs blurred personal and organizational finances by using the nonprofit's resources for private benefits. Among the claims were that Hilde scheduled token meetings to justify luxury trips billed to the WEF and that Klaus requested employees withdraw thousands in cash for unspecified purposes. A spokesperson for the Schwabs denied all allegations, stating that Klaus would sue those spreading "mistruths." Any personal expenses charged to the WEF were later reimbursed, the spokesperson added. Schwab steps down, but will anything change? The WEF's board, which includes figures like BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, held an emergency meeting Sunday, April 20. They voted unanimously to open an independent probe, with Klaus stepping down the following day. His departure marks the end of an era for the WEF, which he founded in 1971 as the European Management Forum before rebranding it into a platform for global elites to shape economic and political agendas. The controversy follows another recent investigation into the WEF's workplace culture, prompted by an earlier WSJ report alleging discrimination against women and Black employees. While the WEF disputed those claims at the time, the new whistleblower allegations accelerated Schwab's exit. Interim leadership now falls to Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, former Nestle CEO and a controversial figure known for advocating water privatization and genetically modified foods. (Related: Klaus Schwab STEPS DOWN as World Economic Forum executive chairman.) Schwab's legacy is deeply intertwined with the WEF's evolution into a hub for global governance, where business leaders, politicians and activists converge annually in Davos. Critics have long accused the organization of promoting technocratic elitism, particularly after Schwab's "Great Reset" initiative, which called for restructuring economies post-pandemic through digital and biological integration. His 2022 warning of future global crises reinforced perceptions of the WEF as a self-appointed architect of humanity's future.

While the WEF disputed those claims at the time, the new whistleblower allegations accelerated Schwab's exit. Interim leadership now falls to Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, former Nestle CEO and a controversial figure known for advocating water privatization and genetically modified foods. (Related: Klaus Schwab STEPS DOWN as World Economic Forum executive chairman.) Schwab's legacy is deeply intertwined with the WEF's evolution into a hub for global governance, where business leaders, politicians and activists converge annually in Davos. Critics have long accused the organization of promoting technocratic elitism, particularly after Schwab's "Great Reset" initiative, which called for restructuring economies post-pandemic through digital and biological integration. His 2022 warning of future global crises reinforced perceptions of the WEF as a self-appointed architect of humanity's future. Despite Schwab's departure, analysts doubt the WEF's direction will change. "Schwab is a megalomaniac, but his resignation won't alter the WEF's mission," said Michael Rectenwald, author of a critical book on the organization. Others, like journalist Tim Hinchliffe of The Sociable, warn that the WEF will continue pushing a technocratic agenda merging corporations, governments and digital identities. As the investigation unfolds, the WEF faces scrutiny over its governance and the conduct of its leadership. For now, Schwab's sudden exit closes a contentious chapter, but the questions surrounding his tenure â and the organization's influence â remain unresolved.

Title: Leinster’s James Culhane hoping for a change of fortune to consistently deliver on his talent
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/04/25/leinsters-james-culhane-hoping-for-a-change-of-fortune-to-consistently-deliver-on-his-talent/
Time Published: 2025-04-25T05:00:01Z
Full Content:
James Culhane may at one point have watched a black cat walk across his path from right to left – left to right is lucky apparently – spotted a single magpie, spilt salt, broken a mirror, and perhaps inadvertently witnessed many more harbingers of bad luck. It might explain his ridiculously unfortunate injury profile that dates to his teenage years. There are invariably two conversation topics when chatting to the talented 22-year-old Leinster backrow, his prowess on the pitch and his resilience in the face of periodic setbacks that might have broken players of lesser character. He’s got a lovely sense of gallows humour that’s evident in his assertion that “this will last a long time”, when asked to discuss his injuries. Culhane explained: “The worst one was in fourth year [in Blackrock College]. I started getting really bad lower back pain, got a scan and [it revealed] a stress fracture in my L5. They weren’t really sure if it was genetic from when I was born or if it had developed over time. “I was in a back brace for six months to let it heal. Then they re-scanned me, and the same defect was there, so it was pretty much genetic from when I was born. That had me out for about 11 or 12 months, pretty much all of fourth year. “I came back in fifth year and I was healthy but, unfortunately, we got knocked out in the first round of the Senior Cup by Gonzaga, so I didn’t play a huge amount of rugby. Sixth year was okay. “In first year in the [Leinster] academy I injured my ankle and had ankle surgery. Then the year after I obviously had that bad injury in Galway” (a reference to a torn hamstring and fractured shoulder suffered in the same match). “I’ve probably had about three surgeries in two years.” The fact that Leinster gave him a professional contract on a, relatively speaking, slim body of rugby – 16 appearances since making his debut against Cardiff in 2023 – speaks volumes for the esteem in which the 22-year-old is held by the coaches. It’s not as if they’re taking a punt. When Ireland won an under-20 Grand Slam in 2022, Culhane was voted the Six Nations player of the tournament on the back of several brilliant performances. Even then, he couldn’t shrug off a medical jinx as he spent a month in hospital with a severe kidney infection. He was nominated for RTÉ’s Young Player of the Year. What’s immediately obvious in watching him is his athletic prowess honed by a cross pollination of sports growing up from mini rugby in DLSP, through school, Gaelic football with Kilmacud Crokes and playing left back for Enniskerry, Wayside Celtic and Cabinteely soccer clubs. He was selected for the Emerging Ireland tour to South Africa last year and captained the team in their final game against the Cheetahs. His return to the country recently with Leinster didn’t quite meet the same success, as he was concussed five minutes in that first game against the Bulls. Breaking into Leinster’s backrow requires not only a set of disparate qualities but also the capacity to play right across the unit. “Yeah definitely you can’t really be one dimensional, you can’t just be able to play number eight, you have to play seven and six, especially when you’re trying to break into a team,” said Culhane. “It’s important. If you’re breaking into a team, you’re probably starting on the bench, and you have to cover many positions, so it is so important to be versatile. I’ve been working on how I’m viewed as a player by the coaches, so they don’t see me as one type of player you know.” Part of that process includes picking the brains of his team-mates. Culhane continued: “I think Caelan [Doris] especially and Josh [van der Flier] they’re just very easy to talk to, they’ve so much knowledge and they’re willing to give it to you as well. “I have been asking them a lot of questions about how they approach the game, especially around the contact area and ball carry and just that element which is especially important for my position. “It is taking that opportunity when you get it, especially when you’re involved with the team of internationals. On the weekend I was delighted to be playing with just so much talent around me, and the way they play elevates your game as well. When you get an opportunity to get your way into that team, you take it.” Culhane certainly honoured that goal in the victory over Ulster, 25 tackles, one turnover and leading the team in successful carries. It’s more than the metrics though; his effectiveness is just as easy to spot with the naked eye. Top of his wish list: consistent game time.

The Portnoy Law Firm can provide a complimentary case evaluation and discuss investors’ options for pursuing claims to recover their losses. Rocket Lab is an aerospace company that provides launch services and space systems solutions for the space and defense industries.

A critical potable water issue, essential for launch pad preparation, would not be resolved until January 2026, creating a substantial risk that the Neutron rocket would not launch as planned in mid-2025. Additionally, Neutron’s only contract was secured at a discount with an unreliable partner. The lawsuit further claims that on February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report titled “Rocket Lab (RKLB): We Think It’s Gonna Be a Long, Long Time,” alleging that Rocket Lab had misled investors about the likelihood of a mid-2025 Neutron launch. Following this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price dropped nearly 10%, according to the complaint. Please visit our website to review more information and submit your transaction information.

Title: State officials and pension-affiliated stakeholders remain concerned about Tesla, even with Musk's pledge to step back from DOGE
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-doge-role-damage-tesla-pension-stakeholders-state-treasurers-2025-4
Time Published: 2025-04-24T22:23:55Z
Full Content:
Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Tuesday that his role at the White House DOGE office will be secondary as he devotes more time to the EV company. Some large Tesla stakeholders and state officials criticizing the company's leadership told Business Insider that they are still concerned. "The company's disappointing earnings were proof that his lack of focus has indeed hurt the company and has permanently damaged the brand value of Tesla," Michael Frerichs, treasurer for the state of Illinois, said in a statement on Wednesday to Business Insider. "It is helpful to hear that Mr. Musk may actually do his job as Executive of Tesla, but we cannot miss the fact that he has caused long-term damage to this company." Frerichs is one of seven state treasurers who sent a letter on April 17 demanding that Tesla's board chair, Robyn Denholm, ensure that Musk devotes "adequate time to the company," given Tesla's recent performance. Depending on the state, treasurers may participate in managing their state's pension funds, which could contain positions in Tesla. "The company's success or setbacks have significant implications for workers, regional industries, and innovation ecosystems in our states," the letter, which was signed by seven state treasurers and the California comptroller, said. Tesla, Musk, and Denholm did not immediately respond to a request for comment. They aren't the only large stakeholders who have expressed concern. Even before his role with the DOGE office, some institutional shareholders had urged Musk to pay more attention to Tesla because they were concerned that the chief executive was juggling too many hats with his Twitter acquisition. In May last year, a group of institutional shareholders submitted a letter to the SEC demanding that Musk and the Tesla board stay more vigilant of the company's long-term growth. Those criticisms have only grown since then. Retail traders and even the most bullish analysts have urged Musk to stay on track as Tesla continued to miss expectations. Tesla reported in its latest first-quarter earnings that total revenue fell 9% from the same period last year. The company's stock dropped 41% on Wednesday from its peak in January. Business Insider contacted the state treasurers who signed the April 17 letter and several institutional shareholders who previously expressed concerns about Tesla's governance. Here's what they said. The New York City Comptroller oversees the city's five public pension funds and has been vocal about his misgivings on Musk's leadership. Last year, he joined the coalition of shareholders who called to vote against Musk's multibillion-dollar pay package. In April, Lander urged the Adams Administration and the New York City Law Department to pursue a securities lawsuit against Tesla. "Elon Musk's pledge is far too little, too late," Oluwatona Campbell, a spokesperson for the comptroller's office, told BI in an email. "Tesla shareholders deserve a full-time CEO dedicated to leading the company, not a part-time lackey for an authoritarian climate denier. Musk must be accountable to Tesla's shareholders and the millions of current and future customers who believe in a green transition." The comptroller's office said in April that the city's five public pension systems held more than 3 million Tesla shares worth about $1.26 billion on December 31, 2024. As of March 28, the shares were worth $831 million, according to the office. Young told BI in an interview that Tuesday's earnings showed the company underperforming expectations. He said he was concerned about Musk's insistence on staying on DOGE for at least the remainder of the month. "I think that's haphazard leadership and it endangers the market and the stability of the government at the same time," said Young, one of the state treasurers who signed the April 17 letter. Young added that Musk should "step back now" from the White House office. He said he was speaking solely in his official capacity as state treasurer and not as a fiduciary to the state. Colorado state employees could have some exposure to Tesla since the state's Public Employees' Retirement Association (PERA) offers a large-cap stock fund with holdings in major US companies, including 2.3% of its holdings in Tesla. PERA's reporting as of December 2024 showed that the fund held about $2.8 billion in assets under management, which means the fund's position in Tesla could be around $64.4 million as of Wednesday. "Yesterday's earnings call from Tesla offered plenty of promises, but what the American people need is performance," Goldberg, who signed the April 17 letter, said in a statement to BI. "It is time for the board to step up and ensure this company delivers and realizes its full potential. We will be watching for meaningful progress over time, not just ambitious words." Goldberg sits on the nine-member board of the Massachusetts Pension Reserves Investment Management, which oversees the state's pension benefits. A spokesperson told BI that the Pension Reserves Investment Trust Fund has about $315 million of passive exposure to Tesla stock, given its holdings in the S&P 500. Russell signed the April 17 letter and, as the principal fiduciary of the state's Retirement Plans and Trust Funds, told BI, "Musk has put Tesla employees, customers, and investors at financial risk." "While we are cautiously optimistic about the market's positive response to Elon Musk's pledge to refocus on his day job, we await concrete actions and will ultimately judge him on performance. The reputational damage he has caused Tesla may never fully be repaired, and his efforts to shift blame onto protesters and recast his role in DOGE as part of his fiduciary responsibility to Tesla are misleading diversions that risk further alienating customers." A spokesperson for the treasurer's office said Tesla represents about $230 million in passive investments of the state's Retirement Plans and Trust Funds, which have about $60 billion in assets under management. KLP, a Norway-based pension company that holds about 900,000 shares of Tesla, was one of the institutional shareholders that criticized Musk's pay package. In a statement to BI, Embu said Musk may have breached his fiduciary duty as Tesla's CEO by prioritizing personal interests over the company's best interests. "His involvement with DOGE appears to offer little strategic value to Tesla, as his association with the Trump administration has arguably harmed Tesla's brand image and sales outlook," he said. Frerichs, who joined the group of state treasurers criticizing Tesla's leadership in the April 17 letter, told BI he was "glad" that Musk committed to spending more time on his company and looks forward to hearing more details to repair the "damage he has done." "Tesla's earnings report was a testament to what happens when a CEO does not have his eye on the ball," he said in an email, adding that "we can call the last three months what it is — a failure by Elon Musk to the duty and care that all shareholders expect from any CEO." A spokesperson for Frerichs' office said the treasurer doesn't manage the sprawling network of pension funds in the state. Pellicciotti told BI in a statement that "the board of Tesla needs to take seriously the severe damage their CEO is doing to the company's performance, brand, and commitment to bringing needed supply and innovation to the EV market." "If Musk's plan is to be a part time CEO and part time Trump surrogate, I'm far from convinced there is a path to recovery, let alone success, in either endeavor," he said. As treasurer, Pellicciotti is a member of the Washington State Investment Board, which manages the state's public retirement and trust funds. However, he does not speak on behalf of the board. As of December 31, the WSIB's top 10 holdings included Tesla at 1% of the $45 billion in assets under management, or roughly $450 million. In February, the American Federation of Teachers — a group of trustees who serve on public pension funds holding positions on Tesla stock — urged major asset managers like BlackRock and Vanguard to review their investments in the EV company, as the stock plunged earlier this year. The group said the pension funds amount to about $4 trillion, including a "material amount" invested in Tesla shares. In a statement to BI, Weingarten said that Tesla's first-quarter earnings were "disastrous" but expected. "On the earnings call, Elon Musk dismissed the problems facing his company and claimed real full self-driving is still just around the corner," Weingarten said. "Tesla continues to be a huge risk to pension portfolios and retirement security. What will Tesla's board do to address this?" Jump to

Title: Spot Bitcoin ETFs Go ‘Pac-Man’ Mode, Gobble Up $1.2 Billion In 1 Week

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Capital poured into US-listed Bitcoin exchange-traded funds this week, with Tuesday alone witnessing nearly $1 billion in fresh cash. The rush propelled weekly inflows to $1.2 billion and total assets under management (AUM) to $103 billion, based on Bloomberg data. The investment deluge occurred while Bitcoin’s price rose above $93,000, reaching $93,700 – its highest since early March. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) remains at the forefront with year-to-date inflows of $2.7 billion. The fund took in another $346 million last week alone. Ark Invest’s ARKB and Grayscale’s Bitcoin funds lag behind with significantly smaller year-to-date inflows of $410.41 million and $385.31 million. Not everything is coming up roses, however. Grayscale’s GBTC has seen $1.18 billion of outflows since January, going against the overall positive tide. The spot bitcoin ETFs went Pac-Man mode yesterday, +$936m, $1.2b for week. Also notable is 10 of 11 of the originals all took in cash too. Good sign to see flow depth vs say $IBIT doing 90% of the lifting. Price up $93.5k. Pretty strong all things considered IMO. pic.twitter.com/HeLwffgT8F — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) April 23, 2025 Ten of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs saw inflows of fresh funds this week, Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas reported. They’re going “Pac-Man mode”, the analyst said on X. That broad-based involvement indicates institutional players are diversifying their bets into several funds rather than focusing on one or two. The value traded across all Bitcoin spot ETFs totaled $496 million, while net assets in them now represent nearly $57 billion – equivalent to around 2.80% of Ethereum’s market cap. As Bitcoin-linked investments thrive, Ethereum products simply can’t seem to get a break. According to reports from CoinShares, investment products centered around Ethereum lost yet another $26.7 million last week. This takes their eight-week outflow amount to a mind-boggling $772 million. Even in the face of this continued outflow, Ethereum remains in second place for year-to-date inflows at $215 million. Short Bitcoin products are experiencing the squeeze. Short BTC products had their seventh consecutive week of outflows, with $1.2 million exiting these funds. CoinShares data show that these short bets have now lost $36 million over seven weeks – 40% of their assets under management. The ongoing outflows from short positions are consistent with Bitcoin’s recent price strength. XRP is the only exception among alternative coins, and its investment products attracted over $37 million last week, the third highest for year-to-date inflows on $214 million. This defies the trend observed in most of the other altcoins, which still face selling pressure. Certainly, all of this new money being poured into Bitcoin ETF investments is perhaps the clearest sign yet that traditional financial institutions are coming around to cryptocurrency as an asset class. We’re talking almost $1 billion coming into the market in just one day: this looks like the dawn of a new era in which acceptance of the asset class by the mainstream is even greater. Featured image from Wallpapers.com, chart from TradingView They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Ondo meets with SEC Crypto Task Force to discuss tokenizing US securities

The protocol proposed a discussion on structuring approaches that would allow for the compliant issuance and distribution of tokenized securities. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Ondo Finance and legal counsel from Davis Polk & Wardwell met with the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s Crypto Task Force on April 24 to discuss regulatory pathways for tokenized versions of publicly traded US securities, according to a memorandum reviewed by the agency’s staff. The meetings focused on structuring options and regulatory considerations for issuing tokenized securities, particularly those referencing assets such as US equities and fixed-income instruments. The topics listed revealed that Ondo’s presentation addressed regulatory challenges, including registration requirements, broker-dealer obligations, market structure rules, financial crimes compliance, and the application of state corporate laws. The firm proposed a discussion on structuring approaches that would allow for the compliant issuance and distribution of tokenized securities while exploring possibilities for participating in a regulatory sandbox or targeted relief. Additionally, Ondo’s legal team outlined key considerations around investor protection, anti-money laundering compliance, and the application of the Exchange Act to token-based issuance models. The initiative marks another step in Ondo’s broader push to integrate traditional financial assets into blockchain-native environments. The firm currently manages over $1 billion in tokenized products, representing 16.4% of the $6.15 billion tokenized US Treasuries market. The Ondo Short-Term US Government Bond Fund (OUSG) is a blockchain-based fund that tokenizes exposure to short-term US Treasuries. Its primary backing is the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), and the fund aims to deliver yield while maintaining liquidity at all times. Meanwhile, a combination of short-term Treasuries and demand deposits held with banks secures Ondo’s US Dollar Yield Token (USDY). Designed to mimic the accessibility of stablecoins, USDY targets non-US investors seeking exposure to US dollar-denominated returns without using traditional financial intermediaries. Both products represent a growing asset class within tokenized finance, consisting of applying blockchain infrastructure to wrap and manage real-world securities in a digitally native format. The meeting represents part of a broader industry effort to seek clarity on regulatory guidelines since SEC leadership changed in January. Since creating its Crypto Task Force on Jan. 21, the regulator has held 81 meetings with key figures from the crypto industry. The meetings involved discussions around a wide range of subjects, including implementing staking in exchange-traded products (ETPs) and the impact of market manipulation on centralized platforms. These movements highlight how the regulator is now open to engaging with the crypto industry under the President Donald Trump administration.

Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) reported first-quarter revenue and profit that exceeded analysts’ expectations, sending shares higher in extended trading Thursday. The tech titan reported revenue of $90.23 billion, up 12% year-over-year and above the analyst consensus from Visible Alpha. Net income of $34.54 billion, or $2.81 per share, compared to $23.66 billion, or $1.89 per share, a year earlier, also topping Wall Street’s estimates. Google Cloud revenue rose 28% to $12.3 billion, while Search & Other segment revenue grew 10% to $50.7 billion. Alphabet also raised its quarterly dividend by 5% to 21 cents, and announced an additional $70 billion in stock buybacks. Alphabet's Class A shares rose close to 5% in after-hours trading. The stock was down about 16% for 2025 through Thursday’s close. CEO Sundar Pichai said Search growth was driven by "engagement we’re seeing with features like AI Overviews, which now has 1.5 billion users per month" after launching in May 2024. On the company's earnings call, Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler said the quarter "marked our largest expansion to date for AI Overviews, both in terms of launching to new users and providing responses for more questions.” Alphabet reiterated its plans to spend $75 billion in capital expenditures this year, most of which is expected to go toward building out the company's AI infrastructure. “We do see a tremendous opportunity ahead of us across the organization,” CFO Anat Ashkenazi said, adding that Alphabet ended the quarter with more Cloud demand than it had capacity. The investments in AI infrastructure, “should help us have a more resilient organization, irrespective of macroeconomic conditions," Ashkenazi said. Pichai also gave Nvidia (NVDA) a shoutout during Thursday's call, saying Alphabet’s relationship with the AI chipmaker “continues to be a key advantage for our customers.” Alphabet was the first cloud provider to offer certain Nvidia's Blackwell GPUs, Pichai said, and will offer its next-generation Vera Rubin chips, which are expected in 2026.

Greenlane, which is rolling out a US EV charging network for big rigs, just switched on its first electric truck stop in Colton, California. April 24, 2025: The flagship facility, at the intersection of Interstates 215 and 10, was completed eight months after breaking ground. It’s got 41 OEM-agnostic chargers with 12 pull-through lanes and CCS 400 kW dual-port chargers with liquid-cooled cables. They’re built to handle big Class 8 electric rigs with ease. Twenty-nine bobtail lanes feature CCS 180 kW chargers. Colton offers a spacious lounge with food and drinks, a water refill station, and restrooms. There’s free wifi, mobile charging stations, and 24/7 customer support. Security includes round-the-clock on-site attendants, security cameras, gated access, and enhanced lighting. Office space is available for leasing, and there’s overnight truck and trailer parking. It’s the first of several electric charging truck stops planned for the company’s I-15 commercial EV charging corridor. Greenlane plans to expand its network with future sites expected roughly every 60 to 90 miles in Long Beach, Barstow, and Baker, California. Greenlane has also secured its first commercial fleet customer, fully electric truckload carrier Nevoya, which will begin operating its fleet of electric trucks out of Colton early next month. Nevoya will use the charging infrastructure and occupy on-site office space. The two companies plan to scale the partnership to include up to 100 of Nevoya’s electric trucks. March 11, 2025: Builder and developer Mortenson is constructing the commercial EV charging facility in Colton, which broke ground last September. It will include more than 40 chargers when it comes online for heavy, medium, and light-duty EVs. In its next phase, Greenlane plans to deploy solar panels and battery storage to enhance grid stability, manage peak loads, and increase energy efficiency. Greenlane’s pull-through lane chargers will be equipped with Alpitronic CCS 400 kW dual-port chargers featuring oil-cooled cables. That means faster charging without the bulk—these cables stay lightweight and easy to handle. For bobtail charging, eFill CCS 180 kW chargers will be available, bringing smart energy management to keep fleet operations running smoothly. To keep everything in check, ABB’s SCADA system will handle remote monitoring and breaker management, boosting reliability and efficiency. Plus, Greenlane’s sites are built with Trenwa precast cable trench, making it easier to expand EV charging infrastructure and upgrade to megawatt charging as fleet demand grows. Greenlane, a joint venture between Daimler Truck North America, NextEra Energy, and BlackRock, also debuted its branded digital technology suite as part of its ongoing development of the I-15 Commercial EV Charging Corridor. The products will be rolled out in phases. Greenlane’s Chief Technology Officer, Raj Jhaveri, said, “Our technology helps maximize uptime and operational efficiency by ensuring vehicles are charged efficiently and ready to meet the demands of their freight schedules.” The tech rollout includes an app that allows drivers to check charger availability and make reservations in advance, a fleet portal that enables fleet managers and dispatchers to plan and manage routes for their electric fleets, and a new Greenlane website. I've never seen a charger site with such an expanse of solar panels. I think it is a very important message to send to to the public to pair solar panels with EV charging. Back of the envelope calculations, however, show that the panels can at best only provide a full charge for maybe 3-4 trucks per day. The vast majority of electricity must come from the grid (hopefully from giant wind/solar farms). Greenlane also now has OnRamp Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that integrate with existing fleet solutions, providing fleet managers and drivers access to optimized routes, efficient charging and refueling schedules, and related charging data and emissions savings.

Title: Google Earnings Stock Soars As Q1 Results Shatter Expectations
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2025/04/24/google-earnings-stock-soars-as-q1-results-shatter-expectations/
Time Published: 2025-04-24T20:06:45Z
Full Content:
Google parent Alphabet reported first-quarter earnings Thursday afternoon, becoming the first of the trillion-dollar U.S. technology behemoths to report earnings from the first quarter, a period marred by elevated economic uncertainty that could weigh on the advertising-heavy Google. Valuing Google might be the "closest thing to impossible" with significant macroeconomic and ... More regulatory uncertainty, shrugged one Wall Street analyst. Alphabet brought in $90.2 billion of revenue in Q1, topping consensus analyst estimates of $89.2 billion, and $2.81 diluted earnings per share ($34.5 billion net income), smashing forecasts of $2.01 EPS ($24.8 billion net income), according to FactSet. That equates to 12% top line expansion from Q1 2024 and 49% bottom line growth year-over-year. Alphabet’s bread-and-butter Google search unit generated $50.7 billion in sales, compared to forecasts of $50.5 billion, and its artificial intelligence-heavy Google cloud brought in $12.3 billion, matching projections of $12.3 billion. Google stock jumped about 5% in after-hours trading immediately following the release, and its $169 afternoon share price has the tech firm on track to open at its highest level in four weeks. The company also announced Thursday board authorization for a $70 billion stock buyback program, and it will increase its quarterly cash dividend by 5% to $0.21. In the earnings call, Google CEO Sundar Pichai declined to “speculate about potential impacts” of tariffs, before adding the rollback of the de minimis tariff exemptions will “obviously cause a slight headwind to our ads business in 2025, primarily from” Asian retailers. Google is grappling with a “negative tariff ad spend impact,” according to Bank of America analyst Justin Post, specifically noting declining spending from Chinese discount retailers Temu and Shein as Trump’s more than 100% tariffs on Chinese imports stifle the flow of goods from the country to U.S. consumers. Still, Google has “relatively less” pressure from the choppy operating environment, according to Post. About 4% to 5% of Google’s revenues come from Chinese companies spending on U.S. advertising, according to Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik, much less than the 7% to 8% exposure from Google’s top digital advertising rival, Facebook parent Meta. Shares of Google rose during Thursday’s regular session ahead of the release, gaining more than 2% to $161, the highest level in two weeks. The bounce came as stocks continued to rally on renewed hopes President Donald Trump would keep backing down from his most aggressive tariff plans, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq index rose nearly 3% on Thursday, heading to its third consecutive day of an at least 2% rally. That’s the first time the Nasdaq has risen by that much in three straight trading sessions since 2001, according to Bespoke Investment Group. Still, Google stock is down 16% year-to-date, slightly worse than the tech-heavy Nasdaq’s 12% decline as fears of an economic slowdown tied to Trump’s trade war broadly ate into investor confidence. “If investing in US tech stocks was difficult right now, underwriting Google might be the closest thing to impossible,” Shmulik wrote Wednesday. Among the massive unknowns swirling around Google are recession concerns, tariff exposure, potential for generative AI to disrupt online search, a “library of regulatory overhangs” and a “potential lightning rod for international retaliation” against American entities, explained Shmulik. Among the “library” of regulatory hurdles facing Google include high-profile monopoly probes from U.S. prosecutors. A federal judge ruled last week Google maintains an illegal monopoly in advertising technology, and the Justice Department argued in an ongoing antitrust case the company should be forced to sell its Chrome web browser. Google is one of the six West Coast tech companies with market values of at least $1 trillion, joined by Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon and Meta (those companies are often lumped together with Elon Musk’s Tesla to form the “magnificent seven”). Google was a key part of the massive tech stock rally as generative AI’s popularity spiked, as its share price more than doubled from the end of 2022 to 2024. But big tech has stalled on Wall Street as recession fears escalated, as Bloomberg’s magnificent seven index has declined about 20% in 2025. Next week, Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft will all report earnings from 2025’s first three months. Tesla, the least valuable member of the magnificent seven, shared its Q1 report Tuesday, missing on both profit and revenue forecasts. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: 5 Top Stocks To Buy Now For May 2025

ByJason Kirsch ByJason Kirsch, Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. I Write Educational Articles On Various Financial Topics ByJason Kirsch, Contributor. These picks diversify across tech, healthcare, consumer staples and environmental services, and are ... More anchored by strong fundamentals and resilient business models. The market landscape in early May 2025 is characterized by uncertainty and fragmentation, driven by a volatile combination of geopolitical instability, shifting sector dynamics and policy unpredictability. Economic rifts have deepened in recent weeks, driven in part by an unclear tariff framework and a lack of cohesive economic direction from both the Federal Reserve and the Trump administration. With inflation pressures unresolved and confidence in long-term policy planning waning, investors are navigating a fragile environment where resilience is just as important as opportunity. This article highlights five standout investment opportunities for the current market climate. The list features a balanced mix of growth-oriented innovators that have seen recent corrections, alongside dependable dividend-paying leaders with strong balance sheets and defensible business models. In an era marked by dislocation and doubt, each of these companies offers a compelling case built on financial durability, competitive edge and potential catalysts poised to reward patient investors. This selection process balances fundamentals, technicals and macro context. For growth stocks, we focused on industry leaders with strong business models that have pulled back on sentiment, rather than fundamentals, offering attractive long-term entry points. Defensive picks emphasize dividend strength, valuation discipline and resilience across cycles. Each name was vetted for cash flow, balance sheet health and near-term catalysts. The result: a portfolio built for both upside and protection in an uncertain 2025 market. Tesla has evolved from a pure electric vehicle manufacturer into a comprehensive company focused on sustainable energy and artificial intelligence. While its automotive division continues to produce the Models 3, Y, S and the recently launched Cybertruck, as well as the $28,000 Model 2, Tesla has diversified into energy generation and storage with its Solar Roof, Powerwall and utility-scale battery installations. The company's vertical integration spans battery production through the Gigafactories, autonomous driving capabilities via its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology and an expanding services ecosystem. Tesla's AI initiatives have accelerated following the commercial launch of its Optimus humanoid robot and Dojo supercomputer applications. The company maintains production facilities across four continents, with its newest Gigafactory in Indonesia having broken ground in late 2024. Despite facing intensifying competition in the electric vehicle (EV) space, particularly from Chinese manufacturers and traditional automakers' electric offerings, Tesla maintains significant advantages in manufacturing efficiency, battery technology and software capabilities. CEO Elon Musk's recent reorganizational efforts have focused on streamlining operations and accelerating the company's artificial intelligence and robotics divisions while maintaining automotive innovation. The decline follows multiple headwinds: lower-than-expected Q1 deliveries, intensifying global EV price competition, and delays in the rollout of Tesla's robotaxi service. Compounding these challenges is growing investor unease over Elon Musk’s political behavior and public promotion of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which many view as symbolic of his broader attempts to undermine government institutions. This has alienated a significant segment of the political left, including many upper-middle-class Democrats (Tesla’s core market), who increasingly distrust Musk and his leadership team. His involvement in multiple non-core ventures, including X (formerly Twitter) and other business interests, has further fueled concerns about diminished focus during a pivotal period for Tesla’s operational performance. Tesla’s Q1 2025 earnings report, released April 22, underscored these concerns. The company missed Wall Street expectations on both revenue and profit, with automotive revenue plunging 20% year-over-year to $14 billion. Total revenue declined 9%, and net income dropped 71% from the prior year. Tesla cited factory upgrades, lower average selling prices, and incentives as key drags. The company also refrained from reaffirming its 2025 growth guidance, instead postponing updates until Q2. Despite this, shares saw a slight after-hours rebound following President Trump’s reassurance on Fed leadership—a sign of the stock’s continued political sensitivity. Yet not all is bleak. Tesla’s energy storage segment grew 67% year-over-year, and the company confirmed it remains on track to pilot both its robotaxi service in Austin and humanoid robot production in Fremont later this year. Meanwhile, the launch of its affordable Model 2 and the ongoing expansion of AI and Dojo infrastructure offer long-term upside. With $26.3 billion in cash and around $13 billion in debt, Tesla maintains the financial flexibility to navigate short-term challenges. For investors with a long horizon, the recent selloff may offer an entry point—albeit one that now demands careful monitoring of political, regulatory, and operational risks. NVIDIA has evolved from a gaming graphics card company into the world's leading provider of computing platforms for artificial intelligence and accelerated computing applications. The company's GPU technology has become the foundation of the AI revolution, with its data center segment now representing over 65% of total revenue. NVIDIA's hardware offerings span the entire computing spectrum, from GeForce gaming GPUs and workstation-class Quadro cards to data center-focused Hopper and Blackwell architectures. The company has expanded its reach beyond hardware through CUDA, its parallel computing platform, and an evolving software ecosystem that encompasses AI frameworks, digital twin simulations and enterprise solutions. In recent quarters, NVIDIA has accelerated its system integration efforts, introducing pre-configured AI systems, such as the DGX SuperPOD, as well as specialized solutions for various industries, including healthcare and telecommunications. The company's collaboration with leading cloud service providers has expanded, with specialized instances featuring NVIDIA's latest GPU architectures available across all major platforms. Meanwhile, NVIDIA's automotive computing platform continues gaining traction with automakers pursuing advanced driver assistance and autonomous driving capabilities, creating another growth vector beyond its core markets. NVIDIA has pulled back more than 30% from its highs, but strong fundamentals and expanding markets make the dip a compelling opportunity. In its latest report, revenue surged 122% YoY with rising margins, countering fears of AI saturation or chip oversupply. With its next-gen Blackwell architecture launching in Q2 2025, NVIDIA is set to lead the next wave of AI infrastructure. Its edge lies in both cutting-edge hardware and a dominant software ecosystem that locks in customers and pricing power. Despite export-related headwinds, its strategic role in U.S. tech leadership remains intact. With projected earnings growth of over 40% through 2027 and rising shareholder returns, NVIDIA continues to offer a rare opportunity for long-term upside. Johnson & Johnson remains a global healthcare leader following its strategic transformation through the Kenvue consumer health spinoff, completed in 2023. The streamlined company now focuses exclusively on its pharmaceutical and medical device segments, which together represent cutting-edge healthcare innovation and stable, recession-resistant revenue streams. J&J's pharmaceutical division boasts a robust portfolio of treatments across immunology, oncology, neuroscience, infectious diseases and cardiovascular health, including blockbuster drugs such as Stelara, Darzalex and Tremfya. Its medical device segment provides essential surgical instruments, orthopedic implants, vision care products and interventional solutions. The company's research and development capabilities remain industry-leading, with an annual R&D investment exceeding $15 billion and a pipeline featuring over 100 clinical development programs. J&J's acquisition strategy has been disciplined yet opportunistic, with recent purchases strengthening its capabilities in robotic surgery, cardiovascular devices and cell therapy platforms. Following the resolution of major talc litigation through its controversial Texas Two-Step bankruptcy strategy in late 2024, the company has reduced a significant overhang that had suppressed shareholder value for years. Johnson & Johnson blends defensive stability with meaningful growth potential—ideal for today’s uncertain market. Backed by 63 straight years of dividend increases and a 3.2% yield, JNJ generates strong cash flow and trades at a modest 14.8x forward earnings. Growth drivers include a robust pharmaceutical pipeline (targeting $15B in new revenue by 2028), expansion in oncology and cell therapy, and a rebound in elective procedures. Its Ottava robotic surgery platform just gained FDA approval. With $19 billion in net cash, JNJ has the flexibility for acquisitions, buybacks, or further dividend hikes, making it a rare combination of resilience and upside. Procter & Gamble maintains its position as the world's premier consumer packaged goods company, with an unparalleled portfolio of essential household brands across categories including beauty, grooming, healthcare, fabric care, home care and baby care. The company's flagship brands—including Tide, Pampers, Gillette, Crest, Charmin and Dawn—hold leading market positions in their respective segments across more than 180 countries. The company's operational excellence initiative, launched in 2023, has generated approximately $2.1 billion in annual cost savings through the implementation of manufacturing automation, supply chain optimization and digital transformation. These efficiencies have enabled P&G to navigate inflationary pressures while continuing to invest in product innovation and marketing effectiveness. Procter & Gamble is a strong defensive play for 2025, backed by essential products, pricing power and a history of consistent performance. With 5.2% organic sales growth, 33% of sales from emerging markets, and 18% from e-commerce, P&G continues to expand through premiumization and innovation. Financially, it’s disciplined, with 68 consecutive years of dividend increases and steady buybacks. Recent gains in the fabric care, health, and home categories demonstrate resilience in the face of intense competition. For investors seeking stability, income, and moderate growth, P&G remains a reliable cornerstone. Waste Management is North America's largest environmental services provider, serving over 21 million customers across municipal, commercial and residential sectors. Its vast network — spanning over 500 collection sites, 260 landfills and 140 recycling facilities—creates high barriers to entry and drives efficiency through vertical integration and dense routing. The company has strategically expanded its sustainability initiatives, positioning itself as both a waste collector and a materials management company, with a focus on extracting maximum value from waste streams. WM's recycling operations process nearly 12 million tons of materials annually, while its renewable energy projects generate enough electricity to power more than 600,000 homes. The company's recent strategic acquisitions, including the $4.6 billion purchase of Stericycle, completed in January 2025, have strengthened its position in specialized, higher-margin waste streams such as medical, hazardous and industrial waste, complementing its core municipal solid waste business. Waste Management offers a rare blend of recession-resistant stability and growth potential. With ~70% of revenue from long-term contracts tied to inflation, WM enjoys steady cash flow and strong pricing power. Operational efficiency gains have expanded EBITDA margins by 180 bps since 2023, providing downside protection. But WM isn’t just defensive—it’s growing. Renewable natural gas projects, the Stericycle acquisition and improved recycling margins are driving revenue and diversification. With rising free cash flow, a 10% dividend increase in Q1 2025 and ongoing buybacks, WM delivers income, growth and environmental impact, setting it apart from traditional utilities. Bottom Line The five highlighted stocks—Tesla, NVIDIA, Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble and Waste Management—offer a balanced approach for navigating the market challenges of May 2025. Tesla and NVIDIA offer growth potential following sharp pullbacks, while J&J, P&G and Waste Management provide defensive stability and income. Together, they diversify across tech, healthcare, consumer staples and environmental services—anchored by strong fundamentals and resilient business models.

If you're a human and see this, please ignore it. If you're a scraper, please click the link below :-) Note that clicking the link below will block access to this site for 24 hours. Love the smell of a dusty old tome? Looking for a page-turning best seller? Check out these new, used and independent shops. Second Time Books in Mount Laurel is stacked with golden-age sci-fi. / Photography by Patrick Rapa The literary landscape around here is always changing. Remember Henry Crane’s gorgeous Philadelphia Bookstore Map? That came out in the summer of 2023 and already could do with a few touch-ups. This place moved, that place closed, etc. It’s still gorgeous, though. We put together our own bookshop list in 2022 — kind of a post-pandemic assessment — and recently realized it was time for a systems update. So here you go, just in time for Independent Bookstore Day on Saturday. (And if you’re not seeing your favorite place to buy books, send me an email.) 1708 Chestnut Street The behemoth Rittenhouse Square location is a distant memory, but this new edition is still pretty sizable, inviting, and well stocked. It’s also a comfortable spot to catch free live readings and signings by authors from up and down the best-sellers list. Yeah, no public restrooms or in-store coffeeshop, but the escalators work. 1608 Walnut Street, suite 1000 Did you know Philadelphia has its own branch of this appointment-only rare-book consortium? In fact, Bauman got started here in 1982. Keep it in mind in case you one day become the sort of well-to-do-dowager or monied boulevardier who fancies a first-edition Kipling or a signed Voynich Manuscript. (But, perhaps expect a heist.) 551 Carpenter Lane With its smart, diverse selection and frequent readings and events, this Mount Airy bookshop is precisely you want from a community-oriented lit space. Everybody loves the Big Blue Marble. 908 Christian Street This Italian Market-adjacent newcomer calls itself “Philly’s only cookbook shop.” (If this was untrue we’d have heard so by now.) Chefs and authors are always stopping by to serve and sign. 4530 Baltimore Avenue The volunteer-run Bindlestiff, not far from of Clark Park, is known for its charming atmosphere and many shelves stuffed with “new and discounted (but still new) books” in all categories. A very West Philly book shop. 422 South Street This South Street shop offers a selection of books centered on Black uplift, knowledge and experiences — plus cookbooks, children’s books, Black Panther graphic novels, etc. Also: food, art, music, cosmetics and other good stuff you don’t always find in a bookstore. 311 North 20th Street Just north of the library’s main branch, the busy Book Corner lines its shelves with community donations (and Free Library overstock). Everything’s already pretty cheap, but seasonal sales can ignite a polite frenzy among gently ravenous readers lured in by the $2 hardcovers and $1 trade paperbacks. The selection is eclectic and always changing, plus they’ve got a super-friendly staff (including cats Chaucer and Catticus). 8511 Germantown Avenue Debra Gress Jansen’s tiny tasteful shop is tucked into a Starbucks in Chestnut Hill. 2202 Fairmount Avenue This cozy, long-running used bookshop in Fairmount has a much larger selection than you’d guess from walking by, and that’s because it’s all shelves in there. The prices are reasonable, and the books are well-chosen and in good condition, too. They’ve even got a cozy spot upstairs that’s useful for sitting down to review potential purchases and petting a cat or two. 7 North 2nd Street Best secondhand bookshop in Philadelphia? Could be. Definitely the best thing about Old City. So much fiction. So much nonfiction. So much everything, arranged in a maze of shelves that will have you crouching and craning to take in every spine. It’s extremely difficult to leave the Book Trader without buying something. 709 South 4th Street The beloved Queen Village spot is all killer and no filler, with a shrewd selection of books that range from the “popular but great” to “lost favorites” to “never heard of this before but now I can’t live without it.” Keep an eye on Brickbat’s Instagram to see what new curiosities have crossed the threshold. 527 South Street South Street is always changing, but Garland of Letters just keeps on keepin’ on with its stock of New Age/old-wisdom books, incense sticks and life-size lion statue in the doorway. The floral-scented shop won a 2019 Best of Philly for its spiritual books and tarot decks. Book Corner, just behind the Parkway Central Branch of the Free Library, is famous for its low prices, but you should still keep an eye out for those seasonal sales. 345 South 12th Street Named for a James Baldwin novel, this Gayborhood favorite calls itself “the oldest, very best LGBTQ and feminist bookstore in the country.” Giovanni’s Room has achieved legendary status at this point. 210 South 52nd Street Philadelphia’s oldest Black-owned bookstore devotes its inventory to African American studies, history, children’s books, biographies and memoirs, philosophy and more. The family-owned shop has been a community resource since the ’50s, as commemorated by the historical marker out front on 52nd Street. 258 East Girard Avenue Jeannine Cook is one of the most celebrated figures in the Philly book scene thanks to her business acumen, community spirit and globe-trotting adventures in art and literary circles. Both of her shops — Harriett’s in Fishtown, and Ida’s in Haddon Township — emphasize books by women and Black authors, and Cook’s own books are on their way, starting with the “meta-romance” It’s Me They Follow due out in September. 2230 Frankford Avenue This nonprofit Kensington/Fishtown bookstore is also a publisher “committed to serving as a launchpad for the next generation of local writers.” At press time, H&H claims to have helped more than a hundred local writers get printed in chapbooks, anthologies and stand-alone manuscript. Their shelves are stocked with indie and small-press surprises, too. (Check out this interview with founder Nic Esposito.) 619 South 2nd Street Open since 2005, Queen Village’s Head House Books offers a choice selection of new titles in a bright, classy atmosphere. Few independent shops around town can match Head House’s busy readings calendar. 84 Bethlehem Pike Rear All sales at this nonprofit shop benefit the Chestnut Hill Library. Most titles sell for a third of their retail price. 3920 Spruce Street Founded in 1971, this Victorian house full of books and ghosts is a lovely place to get lost in thanks to its many rooms bursting with tomes in a variety of categories. 404 South 20th Street I love this feisty little Rittenhouse Square-ish shop. Iffy has dedicated shelf space for zines, speculative fiction and eco/political non-fiction, but if you want to go deeper, check out their calendar for workshops and meetups centered around hacking, soldering and lock-picking. Iffy is the ideal mix of fun and not messing around. North 5th Street Nestled inside North Philly arts hub Taller Puertorriqueño, this shop stays stocked with English and Spanish-language books by Puerto Rican, Latine and Latin American authors. 6307 Woodland Avenue A friendly, charming South Philly shop with its own roving book bus. 20 South 40th Street This amiable used bookstore offers a quantum of solace away from the the hustle and bustle of 40th Street. It’s also an ideal “third place” meeting spot before grabbing dinner at New Delhi or seeing a movie at Cinemark. The Last Word is just big enough to an hour or so searching the shelves for hidden gems and forgotten favorites in the fiction, crime and sci-fi sections. (Pro tip: Don’t skip the bins by the door.) 408 East Girard Compact and curated, this compact Fishtown shop offers new and used literary fiction, kids books and other good stuff, but their menagerie of zines and independent publications is particularly noteworthy. (For example, I picked up a weird little self-published zine that purports to offer “instant photographic evidence” of Bigfoot, UFOs, etc. It’s ridiculous and I love it.) You never know what you’ll find in Old City’s beloved Book Trader. 210 South 45th Street I would not presume to describe this West Philly institution any better than it describes itself: “Nonprofit cooperative bookstore and social center for abolition, autonomy, ecological self-determination, and affirmation of worlds imagined and made by Black, Brown, Indigenous traditions of liberation.” 454 East Girard Avenue Once burrowed deep inside Reading Terminal Market, Miscellanea Libri has more recently called Fishtown its home. New and used, with an eye toward philosophy, history and culture. 1010 South 9th Street An Italian Market institution every bit as important as the butcher, the produce people, the spice merchant, etc. You could spend half your day flipping through the cookbooks, literary fiction and vintage records. More recently, people have been stopping in to pick up Red Tape, proprietor Molly Russkoff’s debut novel. The first printing sold out quick. 529 Bainbridge Street Nobody will say a word if you spend an hour wandering the cluttered aisles looking for exactly the right dusty old paperback to fit your mood. Upbeat, cool and mildly chaotic, Mostly Books has old-school South Street, odds-and-ends, love-of-the-game vibes. 1906 South Street Not enough people know about this cool little shop in the Graduate Hospital area. Most of their shelves are reserved for secondhand books, but they make room for plenty of new and classic titles as well. And don’t miss out on their comic books, greeting cards handmade by local artists, and author-inspired t-shirts. 1726 East Passyunk Avenue This smart, stylish South Philly bookshop has lots of new and interesting reads, but they’re extra cool for putting local authors and publishers on a pedestal. Keep an eye on their calendar for readings of the book and tarot variety. 618 South 6th Street Philly has no shortage of revered/underserved comic book sellers, but let’s give a shout out to this Bella Vista gallery and shop that specializes in underground titles and in-store events featuring the likes of Charles Burns, Daniel Clowes, Maria Bamford. 710 Street 5th Street P.A.T. is only partly a bookshop, but the selection is somehow always worthwhile and affordable. 333 South Broad Street This looks interesting — a store and gallery space dedicated to zines, handmade books, art books and other stuff of the DIY variety. It’s by appointment only; the calendar includes exhibitions, workshops and other events. 5445 Germantown Avenue This Germantown bookshop and community cultural hotspot — run by renowned author and Temple professor Marc Lamont Hill — has a very good slogan: “Cool People. Dope Books. Great Coffee.” Uncle Bobbie’s calendar is often packed with some of the biggest names in books and media, and frequently hosts readings in off-site locations that can handle a crowd. 1525 North American Street, studio 104 A sparse, stylish space in Olde Kensington dedicated to artists’ books and other independent art-related publications. 704 South Street A holdout from South Street’s wilder days, the Wooden Shoe has a rep for reading material with an activist/anarchist edge, including alternate histories, children’s books, banned books, zines, manifestos, you name it. Baldwin’s Book Barn in West Chester is huge. And probably haunted! By books. And ghosts! And books, which are undead trees. 865 Lenape Road, West Chester This place is amazing — just room after room, floor after floor of books in every genre. They’ve got lots of signed and first-print stuff, but also tons of cheap, rare and/or weird stuff. No wonder we called the rustic Baldwin’s Book Barn The Best Reason to Ditch Your Kindle a few years back. 45 West Broad Street, Hopewell, N.J. People with kids sing the praises of this cute children’s bookstore in central Jersey. 7 Manoa Shopping Center, 1305 West Chester Pike, Havertown Let’s just quote the 2021 Best of Philly write-up in its entirety: “Most of the 60,000 or so gently used items at this 17-year-old stalwart are, indeed, half their original price or less. Then there are new reads and rare works — some with a Philly provenance — all stocked by bibliophilic owners Shannon and Cathy Rutherford.” 349 Nassau Street, Princeton, N.J.

Also: People who read that sort of thing are up to something. 44 South Main Street, New Hope One of the crown jewels of New Hope, the bright and inviting family-owned Farley’s earns high marks for its reliable employee recommendations. This, I believe, is the highest praise one can bestow upon a bookshop. 3405 Pacific Avenue, Wildwood, N.J. Yeah, it’s way down the shore but this decades-old seasonal secondhand bookshop a couple blocks off the boardwalk is affordable, reliable and hopelessly quirky. Wildwood’s Hooked on Books is a quirky one-stop-shop for beach reads. 221 Haverford Avenue, Narberth The community-oriented bookstore offers new and used selections and bills itself as “a lovingly curated, forward-thinking haven for voracious readers.” 7900 High School Road, Elkins Park A small shop promising a “carefully curated” short list of titles.

Title: How Trump altered the government in ways that could benefit himself and his inner circle

Time Published: 2025-04-24T19:16:37Z
Full Content:
After staffing the wealthiest presidential Cabinet in modern American history with energy and banking titans, President Donald Trump has spent his first three months in office boosting those industries while dismantling long-established guardrails against government corruption. A CNN review of Trump’s actions as he approaches the 100-day mark of his presidency found that as his administration has slashed the federal workforce and shaken the global economy with tariffs, the president’s team has made changes that could also directly benefit his Cabinet members or their former companies. At the same time, by gutting traditional oversight bodies and embracing historically lax ethics rules, Trump has enabled conflicts of interest and greased the revolving door between government and the private sector. At least eight nominees for executive branch positions would have been banned or had limited roles under previous administrations – including Trump’s first term – due to their recent work as lobbyists, according to an analysis by the watchdog Campaign Legal Center that was reviewed by CNN. Some potential conflicts have played out in plain view – like when Trump used the White House lawn last month to produce what seemed like an elaborate ad for key adviser and top donor Elon Musk’s struggling Tesla brand. The Trump administration has also cleared the way for Musk’s Starlink business to win new government contracts. But other examples of possible conflicts are found deep in Cabinet members’ ethics reports, such as Energy Secretary Chris Wright’s disclosure that he would receive a million-dollar bonus – after his swearing-in – from the fracking company he founded, led and now plays a role in regulating. Even as they’ve agreed to divest, some Cabinet members have found a loophole: giving control of certain assets to their adult children. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick handed the reins of his financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald to his 27-year-old son, while Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has said he would give his interest in litigation against a vaccine maker – part of an industry he is now tasked with regulating – to his adult son. Some of Trump’s policies also could help his own business interests. By establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve, the president is backstopping the value of the cryptocurrency, enriching existing holders of the asset, some of whom spent millions helping reelect the president. Meanwhile, Trump and his family have moved to expand their own crypto interests. And this week, Trump sent the value of his personal meme coin soaring by promising its top buyers a chance to dine with the president next month. Many of the Trump administration’s early actions have pushed priorities that Republicans have sought for years, and the White House says its moves to slash regulations are needed to reduce spending and eliminate government inefficiency. “The people elected me to do the job, and I’m doing it,” Trump said in March. “My administration will reclaim power from this unaccountable bureaucracy.” But from cryptocurrency and energy policies to efforts as niche as rural internet access, some of the administration’s moves also closely align with the financial interests of his top advisers and the president himself. “This administration seems entirely indifferent to ethics, and that contrasts certainly with the past several administrations, including Trump one,” said Richard Briffault, a Columbia University law professor who studies government ethics. “The level of complete indifference to it takes us back to before Watergate.” In the wake of the Watergate scandal, Congress passed sweeping ethics legislation to hold the executive branch more accountable. Within weeks of beginning his second term, Trump flouted many of those decades-old protections – including by firing more than a dozen inspectors general and dismissing the head of the government’s ethics watchdog. He also signed an order making it easier for lobbyists to join agencies overseeing industries they used to represent. The United States has spent years building up an “ethics infrastructure,” Briffault said. “In less than 90 days, this administration has been tearing (it) down.” Trump’s unprecedented moves come as his Cabinet includes some of the richest people to ever hold the reins of power in the federal government. Many came straight from positions of power in key industries. CNN analyzed dozens of financial disclosures and ethics statements filed by presidential appointees to track the wealth and potential conflicts of interest among Trump’s Cabinet members. The disclosures offer a limited picture of nominees’ finances: Officials are only required to list their assets in broad ranges. Still, Trump’s leadership team appears to eclipse the wealth of any previous Cabinet going back decades. Of 21 Cabinet members, seven reported holding at least $10 million in assets, and some are even billionaires. Lutnick – who has been a Wall Street power player since the mid-1990s – has an estimated net worth of $3.1 billion, according to Forbes. That’s roughly 15 times as much as the combined maximum reported net worth of former President Joe Biden’s entire outgoing Cabinet. Five Trump Cabinet members reported holding individual assets worth more than $50 million, the highest range on disclosure forms. And that doesn’t include Musk, the world’s richest person with a net worth of about $371 billion, who as a special government employee is not required to publicly report anything about his wealth. While Biden filled his Cabinet mostly with bureaucrats and politicians, Trump’s team also includes former CEOs who ran major energy and financial services companies before joining him in Washington. “We’re seeing industry officials coming into the executive branch in a way that we’ve never seen in past administrations, including the first Trump administration,” said Danielle Caputo, senior ethics counsel for the Campaign Legal Center. While supporters of Trump’s efforts say industry expertise helps officials better understand the fields they regulate, ethics watchdogs fear actions undertaken by highly-connected officials could benefit their former companies and colleagues instead of the American public. Some moves could particularly benefit the super-wealthy. Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, for instance, has taken a chainsaw to the Internal Revenue Service, which includes a unit that audits America’s ultrawealthy. Data obtained by CNN and first reported by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists revealed that the Global High Wealth unit was hit by layoffs at a far higher rate through March of this year than the IRS as a whole. Trump has also rescinded a Biden-era executive order creating ethics requirements for political appointees. Members of the past three administrations — including those who worked under Trump during his first term — previously had to commit not to accept gifts from lobbyists. They were also banned from working on issues they lobbied on in the two years before their appointment, and after leaving government, couldn’t lobby on behalf of industries they’d recently regulated. Those rules would have banned or limited the roles of eight Trump nominees, including three officials tapped for Environmental Protection Agency roles who lobbied for fossil fuel groups in recent years, according to an analysis by Campaign Legal Center shared with CNN. Additionally, CLC found Trump has named at least six political appointees to serve as senior ethics officials, a role normally held by nonpartisan career officials. Inspectors general across more than a dozen different agencies were fired during Trump’s first week in office. The IGs act as independent watchdogs, and the president is supposed to provide a 30-day notice to Congress before removing them, which Trump failed to do. Trump defended the move by suggesting some IGs had been “unfair” and firing them was “a very standard thing to do.” On the campaign trail, Trump promised to make America the “crypto capital of the planet.” He kicked off his second term with moves to boost the crypto industry such as establishing a national bitcoin reserve, dissolving a Biden-era task force that investigated crypto criminals, installing a Musk ally as “crypto czar” and revoking a banking rule that discouraged financial institutions from owning crypto. At the same time, Trump and his family have gotten deep into crypto by launching a new firm and the president’s own meme coin, a digital asset that has no underlying value and trades largely on hype. Trump also installed Lutnick, a banker who before his swearing-in was overseeing more than $1.5 billion in crypto-related investments, as his commerce secretary. Lutnick has long pushed to legitimize bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Last October, while he was still CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, he told a podcast host he had “hundreds and hundreds of millions” of exposure to bitcoin, presumably through crypto assets held by his firm. Cantor Fitzgerald is now run by his son, which ethicists say leaves Lutnick with an improperly close tie to the firm’s success. “By turning it over to a family member, you may not benefit directly, but you surely have an interest in the well-being of your child,” said Briffault. Cantor Fitzgerald didn’t respond to requests for comment. Meanwhile, Trump’s sons launched a digital currency company, World Liberty Financial, in 2024, and took an ownership stake in a bitcoin mining venture called American Bitcoin last month. Trump’s own media company announced plans earlier this year to potentially buy bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. At least eight top officials in the executive branch disclosed crypto holdings in their financial disclosures, although some agreed to divest the assets. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, HHS Secretary Kennedy and Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz each reported owning more than $500,000 in crypto assets. An HHS spokesperson told CNN that “Secretary Kennedy continues to adhere to all ethical and legal requirements.” So far, the Trump administration’s crypto moves haven’t led to a boom in valuations for digital assets. While the price of bitcoin, a bellwether for the $3 trillion crypto market, skyrocketed nearly 50% between Trump’s election victory and inauguration, it has fallen about 9% since then, mirroring broader stock market declines. Still, Eric Talley, a Columbia University professor who studies corporate law, said he saw the Trump administration’s efforts to promote crypto, and specifically the strategic bitcoin reserve, as “particularly suspicious.” “The economic stakes — if you were a heavy holder of crypto — would be huge and profoundly positive if you could cause the US government to essentially guarantee a big chunk of the stability of the market of at least some of the crypto issuances,” he said. During his time in the private sector, former fracking executive Chris Wright was a zealous and vocal critic of government regulations meant to curb global warming. His company Liberty Energy filed a lawsuit that challenged a federal rule requiring companies to disclose details about greenhouse-gas emissions. In one video he posted on social media, Wright declared, “There is no climate crisis.” Now, as energy secretary, Wright has authority to reverse some of the policies he railed against as Liberty’s CEO. Wright has ordered the department to “build energy infrastructure and remove barriers to progress,” among other steps, to achieve US “energy dominance.” Under his leadership, the agency has ceased its pursuit of a net-zero carbon future, cut fossil fuel regulations and accelerated numerous natural gas export projects. Inside the department, Wright has alarmed some staffers with his embrace of fracking over other energy projects. Four current Department of Energy employees, who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, described a general attitude of hostility toward most renewable energy. One staffer pointed to webpages that once promoted solar energy and have now been taken offline, and other employees described circulating lists of renewable energy programs that could be on the chopping block. Having a former fracking executive run the energy department is “absolutely a conflict of interest,” one staffer said. Some of Wright’s former Liberty colleagues have also followed him into the department, including his current scheduling director, one of his advisers and a Liberty board member who has been nominated to serve as an assistant energy secretary. In the short term, falling oil prices due to economic turmoil under Trump could hurt fracking companies. But leaders at Wright’s former company have applauded the policy shifts. “We have an administration now that is working hard to remove some of the impediments that have been challenges,” Liberty Energy CEO Ron Gusek said at the New York Stock Exchange in March. “Those things give us a path forward to invest in our business.” According to his ethics documents, Wright owned about $54 million worth of Liberty stock as of February, though disclosures show he sold off Liberty shares in recent weeks and moved money into general investment funds. He also disclosed that he would receive a roughly $1 million performance bonus for his work last year from the fracking company in March, after his swearing-in. A Liberty filing last month stated he received his bonus. A Liberty spokesperson said, “To our knowledge, there has been no communication with Secretary Wright or any representative from the Department of Energy regarding Liberty Energy business.” While the fossil fuel industry cheers Wright’s successes, some communities that expected financial help from the Department of Energy have faced roadblocks. Under a program funded by the bipartisan infrastructure law, for example, the department planned to disperse $500 million in grants to help schools in disadvantaged regions across the US improve their energy efficiency. But multiple school district administrators told CNN that since Wright took over, the department has largely stopped communicating with them about federal funding from the program. Now, some districts fear they won’t receive all the money they were promised. Mosier Community School, a public charter school in a rural Oregon county that voted for Trump, was awarded a roughly $870,000 grant from the program. That money could help replace the school’s unreliable century-old heater and windows that are currently held closed with tape, said Brent Foster, who leads a committee to upgrade the school’s infrastructure. This year, the DOE has canceled meetings with the school about the grant and has not been processing requests related to the project, according to Foster, who said he doesn’t know whether the funds will ever come through. Winning the grant “felt like a miracle,” Foster said. “The idea that the federal government would sign a contract… then pull the rug out from under us, it’s difficult to understand.” An Energy Department spokesperson said the agency is reviewing all activities to ensure they follow the law and align with the administration’s priorities. “President Trump’s administration is advancing a strategy of energy addition – embracing all forms of energy that are affordable, reliable, and secure,” said the spokesperson, who added that Wright has complied with department ethics requirements. The federal government has earmarked tens of billions of dollars to close the digital divide, connecting millions of rural Americans to fast, reliable internet. And for years, Musk’s SpaceX has tried to become eligible for the funds, at times without success. In 2022, the Federal Communications Commission rejected a nearly $900 million grant application by Starlink, SpaceX’s satellite internet system, saying the company failed to show it could deliver on the promised service. Similarly, the $42 billion Broadband Equity Access and Deployment Program was specifically designed to prioritize the gold standard of broadband internet – fiber-optic cables – over other technologies such as satellite service. But that changed rapidly after Trump took office. Lutnick announced last month that the Commerce Department would end “woke mandates” and “favoritism towards certain technologies.” In practice, that means potentially opening up billions in funding for satellite internet companies. Lutnick’s directive could enable Musk’s company to earn up to $20 billion from the amended BEAD program, according the Wall Street Journal. Today, Starlink is uniquely positioned to provide commercial satellite-based internet. However, other companies, including Amazon, may compete for BEAD grants in the future. Musk has long criticized the federal government’s rural internet efforts, claiming that had the FCC not rejected Starlink’s grant application in 2022, “it would probably have saved lives in North Carolina” after Hurricane Helene decimated the area. The BEAD program, Musk said, is an “an outrageous waste of taxpayer money” that is “utterly failing to serve people in need.” SpaceX did not respond to requests for comment. Experts say satellite-based internet service could play a useful role in connecting low-density remote areas. But many argue a fiber-optic connection is more reliable and weather resistant than what satellite service can offer today. “Fiber can handle an almost unlimited amount of bandwidth. Fiber is scalable in terms of speed. Fiber is what we call ‘future proof,’” said Christopher Ali, a professor of telecommunications at Penn State University. Lutnick’s move to change the program is now prolonging delays in getting shovels in the ground, even as the GOP has blasted the Biden administration over its failure to spend the money more quickly. Senate Majority Leader Sen. John Thune and 12 additional Republican senators, for example, have said the program has “onerous regulations” and moves slowly due to “unnecessary government interference.” The Commerce Department didn’t respond to requests for comment. Some states with approved BEAD proposals are waiting for the green light from the federal government before starting work while others are amending their proposals. A final draft proposal dated March 2025 from West Virginia obtained by CNN details a plan to bring a fiber-optic internet connection to every resident in the state. But after Gov. Patrick Morrisey met with Lutnick later that month, he announced West Virginia would revise the proposal to “evaluate a broader range of technology options, including satellite.” “The West Virginia Broadband Enhancement Council has always supported fiber deployment and continues to do so,” said Bill Bissett, who heads up the council. “Every day we delay is another day that West Virginians who are underserved or unserved will not have access to this critical resource,” he added. Because of Lutnick’s change, government officials will “re-run a process they’ve already completed solely to put satellite service in places that were going to get fiber,” said Evan Feinman, who until recently oversaw the rollout of the BEAD program. “That service will be dramatically slower, less reliable in bad weather … and will cost at least $800 more per year (per household) than the fiber connections would have been.” The change in direction of the BEAD program is the “poster child for why people should be concerned about conflicts of interest” in this administration, said Briffault, the Columbia law professor, who spoke about how members of Trump’s inner circle could be putting a thumb on the scale. “You cannot be confident that the decision is being made on the policy merits, as opposed to the influence of a self-interested individual who stands to make a ton of money on it,” he said.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. – Safariland®, a brand of The Safariland Group, a leading global provider of safety products designed for the public safety, military, professional and outdoor markets and one of Cadre Holdings, Inc.’s (NYSE: CDRE) (“Cadre”) key brands, is excited to announce its enhanced collaboration with Axon Enterprise, Inc. (“Axon”) in developing the newest suite of holsters and accessories compatible for use with Axon Signal Sensor. This joint effort delivers purpose-built technology that supports public safety agencies by enabling hands-free activation of Axon body-worn and fleet cameras, helping to ensure critical moments are captured while allowing officers to focus on the task at hand. Signal Sensor, formerly known as Signal Sidearm, wirelessly alerts nearby Axon cameras to begin recording the moment a firearm is drawn from a compatible holster, for both real-time situational awareness and transparent post-incident documentation of Use of Force (UoF) incidents. Coming this year, 17 updated holsters from Safariland’s 6000 series will be released with dedicated integration for Signal Sensor, along with eight newly developed firearm fits for the recently introduced Ballast Duty Holster. Safariland will also introduce six non-firearm UoF pouches compatible with Signal Sensor allowing integration with equipment, such as Oleoresin Capsicum (OC) spray, batons and handcuffs. The Signal Sensor unit can also be installed on a range of existing in-market holsters using an adapter designed for backward compatibility. Safariland has worked closely with Axon to simplify the process of ensuring holster compatibility with Axon’s Signal Sensor technology. With a wide range of adaptable holsters, agencies can seamlessly integrate Signal Sensor units either within the holster or mounted, using a bracket. Whether an agency is already equipped with Signal Sensor technology or planning future implementation, achieving compatibility is now easier than ever. “This collaboration sets a new standard for integrated duty gear technology and reflects our commitment to officer safety and innovation,” said Eric Gasvoda, Vice President and General Manager of Duty Gear for Safariland. “We are proud to partner with Axon in delivering a solution that enhances both situational awareness and accountability.” “Working with Safariland allows us to push the boundaries of what’s possible in connected public safety technology and expand holster coverage to protect more lives in more places,” said Craig Trudgeon, Senior Vice President of Product at Axon. “This collaboration enables us to broaden our coverage to include additional models in the future — delivering smarter, more seamless tools that empower officers and build trust within communities.” Safariland and Axon will announce the integrated holster collaboration in Phoenix during the 2025 Axon Week, April 22-25. Axon Week is a premier event focused on public safety technology and innovation.

Title: Google Calls More Remote Staff Back to Office—or Else

We forget how good we had it. Google is putting the last nails in the work-from-home coffin as it orders more remote employees to return to offices on a hybrid schedule or risk losing their jobs. The endless cubicle farms, which could have been repurposed for better use like housing or shopping, are not going anywhere just yet. CNBC reports that teams in Google’s Technical Services and People Operationsâor human servicesâdivisions were told this week they must report to their closest office three days a week or take a voluntary exit package. Some in human resources approved for remote work and who live 50 miles or more away from an office can remain in their positions, but cannot take new roles in the company. The news is hardly a shock. Google has been demanding employees return to offices since implementing mass layoffs in early 2023, and just about every major company has swung back jarringly from the early pandemic, when employees were allowed to work from anywhere. Some company leadersâincluding Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter’s Jack Dorseyâhad once proclaimed that remote work was here to stay forever. The contrast between working in tech from 2010-2020 vs 2020-now is so jarring to think about I sometimes feel like the 2010's couldn't have been real — BuccoCapital Bloke (@buccocapital) April 24, 2025 Despite record profits and earnings, tech companies have said their companies became too bloated during the pandemic, and layoffs would give them more resources to invest in the expensive artificial intelligence build outs. Terminating workers under the guise of remote work could be an excuse to eliminate staff they did not want anyway. Some employees laid off by in recent years Meta, for instance, have reported being added to “do not rehire” lists despite performing above expectations during their tenure. That company laid off an additional 5% earlier this year, but did attribute those cuts specifically to performance. Critics of return-to-office mandates have pointed out the irony of the tech industry in particular eliminating remote work, since the entire idea of the internet was to decentralize communication and enable a flattened, global economy that does not rely on power centers like Silicon Valley. Many people moved when they went remote, stimulating smaller economies. But alas, there is a network effect to being around like-minded individuals, and much of the tech sector is still concentrated in San Francisco. Sergey Brin, one of Google’s reclusive cofounders, told employees in a meeting early this year that 60 hours a week in-office is the sweet spot for staff working on developing cutting-edge AI products and keep up with the competition. Somewhat ironically, luminaries like Brin and Klarnaâs Sebastian Siemiatkowski have said they believe AI will eliminate the need for as many programmers, though others say it will simply increase velocity of new product development. âAs weâve said before, in-person collaboration is an important part of how we innovate and solve complex problems,â Google spokesperson Courtenay Mencini said in a statement to CNBC. âTo support this, some teams have asked remote employees that live near an office to return to in-person work three days a week.â Employees in tech do not have much of a choice in the matter. Recurring waves of mass layoffs have returned power to leadership after a decade in which tech workers could expect enormous compensation and benefits packagesâas well as demand their employers abide by lofty mission statements and shun more ethically dubious work, like defense contracting. CEOs have griped that remote workers are less productive, but the data to support that belief is mixed. There may be some decrease in productivity, and junior employees can benefit from being in office. But turnover is lower amongst remote workers, and by working from home, employees save time commuting. Proponents argue that the remote work model is in fact more performance based than relying on butts-in-seats as a metric for measuring employee productivity. A slew of surveys have found that Americans prefer employers who offer remote work for the added lifestyle benefits, and many would even take a pay cut of up to 20% in order to work remotely. Some employees in tech have been so resistant that they have gone out kicking and screaming, using techniques like “coffee badging” to show up at work for an hour to swipe their badge and go right back home. Meta and Amazon responded by requiring employees to continuously report their location throughout the day. Demanding employees come back to the office is one big way to claw back power. Leaders at Google and others have reasserted themselves in other ways, like shutting down protests and open discussion over company policies that in previous years were encouraged. Leaders apparently now believe that protest and internal dissent harms productivity and that everyone should be laser-focused on the company’s mission.

For more on gears, check out my general Gears Guide, detailing the price, rarity, and use of each type. Let’s get right into the rankings! These Gears financially pay off and then some! If you want to rapidly increase your produce profits and uncover some unusually large and valuable crops, invest in these Gears! These Gears are decent alternatives if you can’t afford or find the S-Tiers in stock. They help grow the size of your produce and uncover valuable mutations, but aren’t as efficient as those in the top tier. Nestled into the average tier, these Gears are solid options to make a quick buck. They’re not the most powerful or fruitful (get it?), but they’re profitable! Whilst not entirely useless, you could safely avoid these Gears and not miss out on much. They’re not great for long-term profits, and hardly make their money back. I wouldn’t recommend investing in these Gears. You’re better off waiting for Mother Nature to handle your crops than sink money into these.

Title: An Apple Bull Trimmed Its Price Target on the Stock Today. Here's Why.

One of Wall Street's Apple bulls pared their optimism on the tech giant's shares today. Bank of America analysts on Thursday maintained their "buy" rating on Apple (AAPL) stock, but they also trimmed their price target by $10, lowering it to $240. (That's still above the Street's mean near $234, according to Visible Alpha.) Their reasons: tariff-related costs that could weigh on margins, along with concerns that delayed AI features could dent device demand. The stock, meanwhile, was ticking higher as broader markets rose. Apple's shares were recently up 0.6% to above $205. Apple is set to join the parade of Magnificent Seven tech companies to report earnings, with its next set of results due next Thursday after the closing bell. Bank of America expects some tariff-driven "pull forward" to have helped lift sales during the most recent quarter, but they're cutting longer-term sales estimates "to adjust for higher costs of navigating a more complex supply chain and for delays in launching an AI enabled Siri." Apple's shares are down about 18% so far this year, underperforming the benchmark S&P 500. Research firm Vanda earlier this week noted recent net selling of Apple by retail investors even as net buying continued elsewhere—such as shares of Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA). "Individuals continue to give off capitulation-lite signals, but a full-blown unwind remains moderately far on the horizon," Vanda wrote in a Wednesday note.

PCMag editors select and review products independently. If you buy through affiliate links, we may earn commissions, which help support our testing. FCC Chair Brendan Carr has been a vocal supporter of Starlink, but on Wednesday, he touted SpaceX rival AST SpaceMobile, which is also developing satellites for cellular connectivity. On X, Carr posted pictures of his visit with GOP Senator Ted Cruz to AST SpaceMobile’s headquarters in Midland, Texas. One picture includes Carr and Cruz posing with AST SpaceMobile CEO Abel Avellan in front of the company's offices. He also published a video discussing the importance of AST, saying the company is creating manufacturing jobs in the US and helping the country counter China’s satellite ambitions. “Importantly, it’s going to help us secure our national defense, including by making sure we stay ahead of China,” Carr says. Curiously, Carr’s tweets didn’t mention AST by name. Instead, his video described the company as a “high-tech satellite production facility that’s putting up the biggest satellites we’ve ever had in the country.” AST’s CEO called out the video, posting on X: “Proud to be based in Texas, where we build and test our American satellite technology.” AST SpaceMobile still needs to secure FCC licenses to test and commercially operate its satellites. Last year, the commission only granted AST limited authority to operate its first five “BlueBird” satellites while tabling its request to launch and operate an additional 243 satellites. AST is also preparing to launch and test an even larger, more powerful BlueBird prototype satellite. But last week, the Indian Space Research Organisation postponed the satellite’s launch from Q2 to July. The FCC must also clear that prototype satellite for experimental testing, which could take months. AST faces a tight timeline since its mobile carrier partners in Europe and Japan want to start rolling out the satellite connectivity next year. The company needs between 45 to 60 satellites in orbit before it can offer continuous coverage over the US. The resulting satellite network is poised to compete against SpaceX’s cellular Starlink service, which is currently available as a beta and will officially launch in July through T-Mobile. Although Carr has supported Starlink, he’s indicated he backs next-generation satellite players in general. This includes saying the FCC must streamline regulations for Starlink and Amazon’s satellite internet rival, Project Kuiper. He’s also urged European governments to adopt Starlink over Chinese satellite services.

Title: Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin stash grows to $103B – Should we be concerned?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/satoshi-nakamotos-bitcoin-stash-grows-to-103b-should-we-be-concerned/

What if Satoshi breaks the decade-long silence and sells? Satoshi Nakamoto, the enigmatic creator of Bitcoin [BTC], has once again found their dormant fortune thrust into the spotlight as BTC prices surge past $94,000. With an estimated 1.1 million Bitcoin under their control, untouched since the protocol’s earliest days, Nakamoto’s holdings have now soared past the $103 billion mark, dramatically reclaiming billionaire status. This rally, which marks a 27% rebound from Bitcoin’s recent five-month low, has sparked both celebration and unease within the crypto community. As the asset approaches uncharted highs, speculation is intensifying around the one question that has lingered for years: what happens if Satoshi ever decides to sell? Source: Meta Gorgonite/X Echoing similar sentiments, was another X (formerly Twitter) user – Dan Lucro, who added, “The question is, will he ever sell… and when?” As expected, another user put it best when he said, Source: Nate Ryan/X Even as Bitcoin’s price continues its upward trajectory, falling to $92,357.57 at press time, following a 1.44% daily drop, Satoshi Nakamoto’s legendary Bitcoin holdings remain untouched. The estimated 1.1 million BTC attributed to Bitcoin’s mysterious creator were mined in the network’s infancy using what is now known as the “Patoshi Pattern,” a distinct mining fingerprint that has helped trace these early coins. Despite growing market speculation and price momentum, Nakamoto has never moved a single coin from this massive stash, further fueling the mystique surrounding their identity and long-term intentions. As Bitcoin’s institutional adoption continues to grow, entities like BlackRock and MicroStrategy now collectively hold more BTC than Satoshi Nakamoto’s estimated stash. While Tesla’s 11,509 BTC may not rival these giants, its steadfast commitment to holding Bitcoin as a corporate asset reflects a broader shift among public companies embracing digital currencies. Yet, the absence of fiduciary responsibility sets Nakamoto’s untouched holdings apart, unlike corporations whose Bitcoin reserves are subject to regulatory oversight and shareholder scrutiny. Interestingly, MicroStrategy chairman Michael Saylor recently floated the idea of permanently removing access to BTC by destroying private keys after death. Hence, in a market shaped by both institutional control and mythical origins, the tension between utility and ownership continues to define Bitcoin’s evolving narrative.

Title: China Market Update: Tariff Talk Roller Coaster Continues

ByBrendan Ahern ByBrendan Ahern, Senior Contributor. CLN Online education company TAL Education missed on the big three (revenue, net income, and earnings per share), despite top-line revenue growth increasing by +42% year-over-year, as selling, marketing, administrative expenses increased to $336 million from $24 million YoY, which weighed on bottom line net income and EPS. The company only used $13.1mm of its $490.7mm share repurchase program, which is strange to me. Thus far, no analyst has asked management about relisting in Hong Kong. I will provide a Hong Kong relisting update via Twitter (@ahern_brendan). Asian stocks were lower, except for Vietnam, which outperformed the region. This followed roller coaster comments Wednesday, as President Donald Trump suggested tariff rollbacks could be in the cards soon. China’s Ministry of Commerce threw cold water on Trump’s suggestion that talks are already in motion. The MoC said, “There are no economic and trade negotiations between China and the United States, at present.” The comments indicate a lack of understanding that the "Art of the Deal" requires Kabuki theatre, drama, and showmanship. Hopefully, the two sides will communicate with one another at the IMF and World Bank meetings in Washington this week. Premier Li and the State Council once again reiterated that it is necessary to “stabilize the stock market and continue to promote the stable and healthy development of the real estate market." Mainland media outlet Yicai noted that U.S. shipments of liquid natural gas to China went to zero in March, versus 412,500 tons in March 2024, as China’s 99% LNG tariff and 94% oil tariff take hold. The European container shipping index futures fell -9% overnight. It is hard to know whether fewer boats going to the U.S. means more supply for Europe, leading to the price decline, or indicating the trade war is weighing on the global economy. Regardless, the two sides should get talking, in my humble opinion. Without question, the biggest news was declines in Meituan and JD.com shares, which fell -5.15% and -6.19%, respectively, overnight, as JD reported a substantial uptick in its new restaurant delivery service.

Title: Google Earnings Will Be Biggest Q1 Report Yet As Investors Search For Tariff And Recession Impacts
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2025/04/24/google-earnings-will-be-biggest-q1-report-yet-as-investors-search-for-tariff-and-recession-impacts/
Time Published: 2025-04-24T14:26:00Z
Full Content:
Google parent Alphabet reported first-quarter earnings Thursday afternoon, becoming the first of the trillion-dollar U.S. technology behemoths to report earnings from the first quarter, a period marred by elevated economic uncertainty that could weigh on the advertising-heavy Google. Valuing Google might be the "closest thing to impossible" with significant macroeconomic and ... More regulatory uncertainty, shrugged one Wall Street analyst. Alphabet brought in $90.2 billion of revenue in Q1, topping consensus analyst estimates of $89.2 billion, and $2.81 diluted earnings per share ($34.5 billion net income), smashing forecasts of $2.01 EPS ($24.8 billion net income), according to FactSet. That equates to 12% top line expansion from Q1 2024 and 49% bottom line growth year-over-year. Alphabet’s bread-and-butter Google search unit generated $50.7 billion in sales, compared to forecasts of $50.5 billion, and its artificial intelligence-heavy Google cloud brought in $12.3 billion, matching projections of $12.3 billion. Google stock jumped about 5% in after-hours trading immediately following the release, and its $169 afternoon share price has the tech firm on track to open at its highest level in four weeks. The company also announced Thursday board authorization for a $70 billion stock buyback program, and it will increase its quarterly cash dividend by 5% to $0.21. In the earnings call, Google CEO Sundar Pichai declined to “speculate about potential impacts” of tariffs, before adding the rollback of the de minimis tariff exemptions will “obviously cause a slight headwind to our ads business in 2025, primarily from” Asian retailers. Google is grappling with a “negative tariff ad spend impact,” according to Bank of America analyst Justin Post, specifically noting declining spending from Chinese discount retailers Temu and Shein as Trump’s more than 100% tariffs on Chinese imports stifle the flow of goods from the country to U.S. consumers. Still, Google has “relatively less” pressure from the choppy operating environment, according to Post. About 4% to 5% of Google’s revenues come from Chinese companies spending on U.S. advertising, according to Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik, much less than the 7% to 8% exposure from Google’s top digital advertising rival, Facebook parent Meta. Shares of Google rose during Thursday’s regular session ahead of the release, gaining more than 2% to $161, the highest level in two weeks. The bounce came as stocks continued to rally on renewed hopes President Donald Trump would keep backing down from his most aggressive tariff plans, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq index rose nearly 3% on Thursday, heading to its third consecutive day of an at least 2% rally. That’s the first time the Nasdaq has risen by that much in three straight trading sessions since 2001, according to Bespoke Investment Group. Still, Google stock is down 16% year-to-date, slightly worse than the tech-heavy Nasdaq’s 12% decline as fears of an economic slowdown tied to Trump’s trade war broadly ate into investor confidence. “If investing in US tech stocks was difficult right now, underwriting Google might be the closest thing to impossible,” Shmulik wrote Wednesday. Among the massive unknowns swirling around Google are recession concerns, tariff exposure, potential for generative AI to disrupt online search, a “library of regulatory overhangs” and a “potential lightning rod for international retaliation” against American entities, explained Shmulik. Among the “library” of regulatory hurdles facing Google include high-profile monopoly probes from U.S. prosecutors. A federal judge ruled last week Google maintains an illegal monopoly in advertising technology, and the Justice Department argued in an ongoing antitrust case the company should be forced to sell its Chrome web browser. Google is one of the six West Coast tech companies with market values of at least $1 trillion, joined by Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon and Meta (those companies are often lumped together with Elon Musk’s Tesla to form the “magnificent seven”). Google was a key part of the massive tech stock rally as generative AI’s popularity spiked, as its share price more than doubled from the end of 2022 to 2024. But big tech has stalled on Wall Street as recession fears escalated, as Bloomberg’s magnificent seven index has declined about 20% in 2025. Next week, Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft will all report earnings from 2025’s first three months. Tesla, the least valuable member of the magnificent seven, shared its Q1 report Tuesday, missing on both profit and revenue forecasts. One Community. Many Voices.

The agreement marks the first full-scale flight test contract awarded by Kratos through the MACH-TB 2.0 program-a $1.45 billion effort aimed at expanding access to hypersonic testing. Rocket Lab was added to the MACH-TB 2.0 subcontractor team in January, building on its prior MACH-TB engagements, which included three successful test launches, two of which occurred within a three-week span. HASTE, the Hypersonic Accelerator Suborbital Test Electron, is a modified version of Rocket Lab's Electron rocket, tailored for suborbital missions. Sharing core technologies like 3D-printed engines and carbon composite structures, HASTE is designed with a reconfigured upper Kick Stage and can accommodate payloads up to 700 kg (1,540 lbs). It supports testing of hypersonic, glide, ballistic, and atmospheric reentry systems at speeds exceeding 7.5 km/s. Across both its HASTE and Electron platforms, Rocket Lab has launched over 200 payloads. "In less than two years since its first launch, HASTE has quickly emerged as a leading commercial test platform of hypersonic systems. With our operational speed and cadence, and the ability to serve multiple mission profiles all in one platform, HASTE is helping to move the needle on hypersonic innovation. I'm confident this will be the first of many new opportunities to serve the nation through the MACH-TB program, and we're proud to be working alongside Kratos to bring this test flight to the launch pad on a rapid timeline," said Rocket Lab CEO Sir Peter Beck. This mission joins a growing schedule of HASTE launches set for 2025 and 2026. Among upcoming flights is a test for the Defense Innovation Unit involving a scramjet-powered vehicle, an extension of a five-launch agreement with Leidos, and a classified hypersonic test for an undisclosed client. In parallel with MACH-TB, Rocket Lab's HASTE platform has been incorporated into other major defense initiatives. In the United States, HASTE is now eligible under the $46 billion Enterprise-Wide Agile Acquisition Contract (EWAAC), expanding its potential role in U.S. Air Force projects. In the UK, HASTE has been included in the Ministry of Defence's Pounds 1 billion Hypersonic Technologies and Capability Development Framework, reinforcing its international strategic value.

Title: Elon Musk’s Luck Runs Out

Why he didn’t see this coming Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Overcast | Pocket Casts For a while, it seemed as if DOGE Elon and Tesla Elon could exist in the same space-time continuum. One of them carried out Donald Trump’s ruthless cost-cutting mission while the other pitched cars that appealed most to people who were highly likely to oppose that mission, or even rage against it. As activists spray-painted STOP DOGE on Teslas at dealerships and anti-Tesla protests spread all over the world, there still was no concrete proof that Elon Musk had to amend either version of himself. Then this week came Tesla’s first quarterly earnings report since Musk started his work with DOGE, showing the company’s profits down 71 percent from the same time last year. After a conference call, one major investor said Musk was “delusional.” Suddenly it seemed as if Musk was on a “Kanye West–like trajectory,” according to Patrick George, editor in chief of InsideEVs and our guest this week on Radio Atlantic. George has been covering Tesla since the 2010s. He’s watched Musk shoot himself in the foot in the lead-up to this moment, so he is well placed to understand why Musk didn’t see this coming. In this week’s episode, the Atlantic staff writer Charlie Warzel interviews George about how Musk found himself in this predicament. The following is a transcript of the episode: News clip: Growing backlash against Elon Musk and his new role in President Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency, also known as DOGE— News clip: Protestors taking out their anger on the Tesla car and owners were busy all over the country— News clip: Tesla, the car company Musk founded and runs, has seen its stock price fall dramatically, as you can see from this chart— As Patrick George, the editor in chief of InsideEVs, wrote in The Atlantic this week: Luck runs out. Patrick George: I think he thought he would come in and gut the federal government and be seen as this great crusader and that everything would’ve worked out great just the way it always has. He’s had all this success before, right? But now, like, people are, you know—they’re running away from this company, and that might be the greatest failure of all here. [Music] Rosin: I’m Hanna Rosin, and this is Radio Atlantic. My colleague Charlie Warzel interviewed Patrick George recently about the tumultuous journey Tesla’s been on, from darling of the environmentally conscious to target of tire slashing. And the two of them land on Musk’s blind spot, which caused him to miss this coming crash. Charlie Warzel: Patrick George, welcome to Radio Atlantic. Thank you for joining me. George: Great to be here, Charlie. Thanks for having me. Rosin: Their conversation explains so well how we got to this moment. George: Covering Tesla in the 2010s, the kind of hate mail we would get from people whenever we’d criticize the company or put something negative in one of the reviews of the Tesla, whatever—there were so many people back then who were such true believers in what he was doing, I mean, thinking that he’s saving the world. And I’m kind of sad for those folks now who really believed in this environmental mission of the company. Those are the ones who are dumping their Teslas. Those are the ones who feel abandoned right now, who feel betrayed by this guy they once believed in who has very much gone to what they perceive as the dark side. Warzel: What has been going through your head over the last few months as we’re watching, you know, Musk take this role in the government and have this interplay between his polarization and the stock? George: You know, every now and then, I have to step back when I read a sentence in the news or I even write a sentence on InsideEVs or for The Atlantic—you know, something like, President Trump holds a White House “summit” full of Teslas, you know, amid widespread protests against Elon Musk, his chief advisor and government cost cutter, that are happening all over the world, including vandalism. And I just stepped back, and I’m like, How did we get here? Like, is someone putting LSD in my coffee every morning? Like, this is just such a baffling, bizarre outcome from the way that Tesla’s trajectory has worked for the longest time and where it’s at now. You know, for lack of a better term, it’s kind of insane, honestly. When I started covering Tesla, and I was a young writer at Jalopnik—I started at the end of 2012. And one of the first things I did was my then–editor in chief, Matt Hardigree, and I—we interviewed Elon Musk from the Tesla factory floor when they were trying to get the Model S up and running. You know, the first car was the Roadster. And that was kind of a science project, honestly. It was a Lotus Elise stuffed with laptop batteries, more or less. And the Model S was their first real car. And they were trying to get it ramped up. And we talked to him, on the factory floor. And I remember, you know, him being at the time very tired but, you know, charming, smart, but also self-deprecating. We were doing stories on those early Model S’s is having all kinds of quality problems. And he was going, Yeah, we’re working on it, but we’re doing this Herculean effort to get it up and running. And, you know, I still think the Model S—the original one—is the most important car of the 21st century, because that was what proved the case of electric vehicles for the whole world. Because they were golf carts before that. They were, you know, the Nissan Leaf Codas, things like that. And it became this It Car in Hollywood. You probably remember this. Everybody—all the celebrities were trading in their Prius for the Model S. And it was fast, and it was sexy. I mean, it could smoke a Porsche 911 in a drag race. Like, a Prius couldn’t do that. And over time, we covered this guy and his company. It’s like, Hey! Here’s this quirky guy who’s kind of breaking all the rules, and he’s doing some cool stuff, and he’s also clearly an asshole too. And he’s insane about some things. But what they’re coming up with is this really interesting alternative to gas. And I can just say personally, you know, by the end of the last decade, I kind of realized that this is the future. This isn’t just a niche alternative to gasoline. It’s the future. And that wouldn’t have happened without Tesla. But there are so many shades along the way of what happened with him that kind of inform where we’re at now, just the way that he treated the press, the way that he treated open access to his company, the way that he treated his own public image, the sort of vindictiveness against his enemies. He can be very vain, certainly. He’s very obsessed with his own public image, you know, very vindictive—obviously, calling that cave diver the “pedo guy” or getting in a huge amount of trouble for saying he had the funds to take Tesla private. He had this Kanye West–like trajectory. It’s like, This guy’s brilliant, but he’s also horrible. And over time, the horrible part of him sort of overtakes that. But, you know, this amount of wealth that he amassed came with this tremendous amount of power. And I think he has gotten really into his own myth and own legend about exercising that power in unprecedented ways. Warzel: So I’ve always been fascinated with the correlation between Tesla’s stock price and Musk as a persona. There’s an analyst at Moody’s who said, quote, “I do think fundamentally that a significant fraction of Tesla’s value is due to the fact that Elon can command this attention continuously,” which sort of suggested to me that Musk is almost like a human meme stock. So I’m kind of curious: How much do you think Tesla’s value is just tied to this future projection of Elon Musk as this guy who’s going to, you know, either have that Edison-esque ability to innovate beyond any constraints or just that, you know, he can kind of brute force his way into making the future bend to his will? George: I think that the value of the company, the image of the company, is extremely driven by him and by his involvement in it. Another analyst we talk to a lot who’s one of the most bullish of all Tesla bulls, Dan Ives at Wedbush, you know, he says repeatedly, Elon is the heart and lungs of the Tesla story. And he said that Elon is Tesla and Tesla is Elon. The idea is that he has had so much success and he’s generated so much value for the company before that surely he’ll do it again, and he’ll keep doing it, and he’s the key driver of that. I’m not sure there is a company in modern times that is so intrinsically linked to one person. Probably the closest analog was Apple and Steve Jobs. I mean, this has also led to kind of lack of accountability with Musk, too, because I think that at any other company, certainly any company in the auto industry that we would cover, if you’ve seen the value of the company get so tanked this hard over a number of months, that person, that CEO would’ve been shown the door by now. But there is this belief that Musk is uniquely the one person who will deliver the future. And that’s something he’s built up himself. Certainly, that’s a myth he’s built up himself. I go back to the early days of Tesla, right? The really early days, like, in the 2000s, there was a New York Times article about Tesla Motors and what they were doing. And Musk—before he was CEO, he was just, like, an angel investor and heavily involved in the company—was furious because it didn’t mention him at all. So he always wanted his image to be wrapped up in that. Long before he owned Twitter, he was one of the central figures on Twitter and really used Twitter to get around traditional media and get around press releases and events and things like that to reach that audience directly and build up a following directly. And you said the phrase meme stock earlier. We hear that quite a bit now, and it’s like, okay, admitting that Musk is damaging the company or wanting him out, that will collapse a lot of that value. So, like, there is an incentive to sort of keep this vibe—I almost want to say grift—going, so it keeps, you know, printing money as it has before. Warzel: I think this protest movement is extremely fascinating. I was in the Bay Area recently, and I was blown away. The person I was visiting used to own a Tesla, and they said— George: Used to? Warzel: Yeah. And, well, this was a while back. But they said that the person they sold it to, a friend, had it keyed the other day. Even just on a very small scale, if it’s not a protest, there seems to be lots of acts of, like, casual vandalism and things like that. And then, as recently as March, I think there was a protest at nearly every Tesla dealership in the United States. So the movement seems to be somewhat durable. And yet I think the very initial parts of this protest we watched coincide with a pretty substantial drop in the stock, so much so that you have Elon Musk and Donald Trump basically doing a Tesla infomercial on the White House South Lawn, right? Teslas and EVs have always had a political valence, but does Tesla have a clear idea of what its brand is now? Because I don’t know if it’s going to sort of reclaim that green, progressive halo anytime in the near future. George: I actually do think that the backlash against Tesla is the biggest crisis it’s ever faced, bigger than when it was a tiny start-up trying to get its first real car out in ’08, when the world was crashing—bigger than when COVID happened, and it had to shut down its factories. I think this is the biggest crisis it has ever faced as a company. And you said at the beginning of our chat, Charlie, the word polarizing, right? And Tesla’s interesting because it’s always been a polarizing brand. Like, when it was embraced by liberals and Californians and the Hollywood crowd, you know, like, the rest of America was like, Hey, you have a Tesla. You’re so smug. You know, you’re saving the world, huh? And now it’s kind of flipped on its head, right? Now you have all of these folks in California who are trying—and kind of everywhere, they’re trying—to get rid of their Teslas, like Democratic-leaning, progressive-leaning, even center-leaning people who are done with the brand because of Elon, because of DOGE. Meanwhile, you have Fox News defending him left and right, saying that he’s an American hero who must be protected at all costs. And you know, Pam Bondi saying she’s going to stick up for him. I mean, what a bizarre reversal this is. And at the same time, there is no evidence we have seen that buyers in red states, more conservative-leaning folks, are going to be flocking the Teslas en masse. Like, I don’t want to stereotype here, but there are many, many studies and data points that we’ve reported on over the years that show that conservative-leaning voters are more skeptical of electric vehicles than liberal-leaning folks are. And that’s a climate-change thing. And it’s also just, like, how they’ve been trained to view EVs over the years, you know? So it’s like, Are you for EVs or not? You want Elon to succeed, but you’re not going to buy his car. You know, like, I have family in deep-red Texas, and, you know, when we were down there recently, everyone was saying, Elon’s the best. He’s great. He’s, you know, cutting government waste. It’s like, Okay, well, would you buy one of his cars? Absolutely not. No. It’s like, that is a problem—that is a problem with them being able to sell cars. And my personal theory is: The ultimate test of this is going to be the new Model Y, which just came out. And, you know, for those of you who don’t know, and I bet there’s a good amount of people listening to this who probably own a Model Y, this is the best-selling EV in the world. By some metrics, that’s the best-selling car in the world. There’s a new one out. It looks a little different. The specs are better. It has more range. They fixed the interior up. It’s nicer. All things equal, this should be the best-selling car in the world again. This should pull a repeat. And if this thing doesn’t sell, if it has lousy—you know, it just went on sale now, so we’re not going to know in the first quarter, but if a Q2, Q3, Q4 rolls around and this thing is sitting on dealer lots unsold, that is an existential problem for Tesla. That’s a disaster moment for them. I think that would be the ultimate proof that they have totally alienated any potential buyers or fans that they might have once had. Warzel: But at the same time, we just talked in this conversation about Musk’s, you know, ability to buoy the company and the stock. Do you think that is under threat, essentially? George: Yeah. And that’s where the disconnect is, right? Is because the stock price at Tesla is all predicated on future stuff. It’s solving autonomous driving. It’s robotaxis. It’s artificial intelligence, which Musk has gotten really into in recent years. It’s predicated on robots too. Like, they see the future as automation. It’s not car sales. It’s not duking it out with Nissan and Volkswagen over market share. Like, he doesn’t think that’s going to propel the company to its, you know, trillion-dollar value and take him to the stars and help him start his Mars colony someday if he’s just, you know, selling cars. When we’re talking about why its value is so high, it’s not just because Elon is great. It’s because for the last decade, Elon Musk has been personally promising that self-driving cars, autonomous vehicles, robotaxis are, you know, about a year away—something he’s been saying since 2016, about. You know, that is the value of the company. That’s where all that money is wrapped up. It’s the idea that this company specifically will solve self-driving cars. Never mind the fact that, you know, Google’s Waymo has years more experience—you know, many, many, many miles more experience. Warzel: Yeah, they’re on the roads. George: They’re on the roads. Yeah. You could go to—what?—half a dozen cities in America and use a Waymo. So they’re years ahead of Tesla at actually getting a quote-unquote “robotaxi” service on the road. But there’s still that belief, with all they’ve invested, that they’ll be the ones to deliver autonomous cars one day. That’s the “valuation of Tesla” part of it. But it’s still a car company. Its revenue still comes from being a car company. Its revenue still comes from other car companies buying regulatory credits—meaning, you know, they pollute so much so they buy credits from Tesla to offset their polluting. That’s a huge source of their revenue. So he may have these grand dreams of robots and space and AI and everything else, but right now, it does need to sell cars. It does need to move metal. And if it can’t do that and the revenue tanks, you know, you can forget AI and robotaxis. And the other thing I think about, too, is supposedly they’re going to be launching their robotaxi service in Austin this summer. Okay. Right. Well, if he’s made this brand so caustic and so controversial, who’s going to want to use that service? I mean, is it really going to be some widespread thing like Uber, or are people going to go out of their way to avoid it? And I think that latter outcome is a very real possibility here. [Music] Warzel: When we’re back, I ask Patrick George to explain why Tesla’s crisis may be existential for reasons beyond Elon Musk. [Break] Warzel: So putting aside Musk just a moment here: The protests we’ve mentioned have been noticeable. I’m curious: What are the non-Musk-related threats to Tesla, right? We have Tesla having this real, genuine, first-mover advantage, especially in the United States. But it’s not alone anymore. You’ve got Rivian. You’ve got Polestar. You’ve got, you know, a series of EV competitors. Taking the Musk and Trump out of it, what does the company have to worry about right now? George: Yeah, let’s start with competition, right? Because it’s not just the start-ups you mentioned. It’s that Tesla sparked this industry-wide shift towards electrification. And when we say electrification, that means more hybrids and eventually a move to an all-EV market. And this started in kind of the middle-end of the last decade, when all of these traditional automakers started chasing Tesla’s value. Like, when you’re Ford or you’re Toyota, you’re looking at Tesla like, Why the hell are they valued so much more than we are? Like, we need to be like Tesla. We need to become tech companies. We need to electrify. And it took them years to do it. And, I mean, let’s be honest. Like, not all of them are pulling this off, this transformation from being traditional carmakers to being, you know, makers of software and battery-powered vehicles. Like, this is all we write about at InsideEVs. It’s just the struggles to do that. But they’re getting there. And some of them are now surpassing Tesla in many ways. Like, you can buy a Hyundai or a Kia with more range than a Tesla has, and faster charging. There’s stuff Volvo’s coming out with that has, you know, 400-plus miles of range. There’s better performance from cars like Audi now that are electric also. So Tesla started this, but they haven’t been able to keep up, and that’s been a huge criticism of this company for a long time, is they haven’t kept their product lineup fresh, as every company should. Like, there was the Cybertruck and then one update to the Model 3 sedan. Beyond that, there hasn’t really been a lot. And meanwhile, you have other companies coming out with, like, three-row SUVs and more crossovers and just more different options in the EV space. And that’s just in the West. The other problem is that once they set up shop in China, which Tesla’s Shanghai factory is what has provided them with stable long-term profits since the early part of this decade. But it also got the entire Chinese auto industry—took that baton and ran with it. And, I mean, you know, we see all the time—like, you probably heard the news last few weeks: The Chinese automaker BYD has a new technology for five-minute EV fast charging. Like, nothing in America comes close to that, and we probably won’t for a decade or more. So with its incredible industrial might, like, China is racing way ahead of Tesla, and Tesla’s kind of a stale brand there. So between the protests in America and Europe that are tanking sales, and the fact that Chinese buyers are moving on to other brands, like, I think the picture doesn’t look great for this company. Warzel: A big thing that I have seen as sort of an EV dilettante is the notion of, you know, especially in America, Tesla’s charging network, and that infrastructural portion being really important to the company. The idea of the BYD extremely fast chargers, like, are those, in your mind, existential threats to Tesla? George: Not any one thing, but put it all together, and yes. And remember what we said about how so much of Tesla’s value is locked up in solving autonomous cars? Well, BYD also has—they call it God’s Eye, an autonomous-driving system that they’re putting on, like, Toyota Corolla–priced vehicles in China. So, like, I can’t attest this myself. It’s obviously hard for us to test Chinese cars as extensively as we would here. But, like, this company claims to have done something Tesla’s promised for a long time, but a hell of a lot cheaper. Then you have faster charging. Then you have the fact that, you know, China’s full of—what?—two dozen Tesla-esque companies that are racing ahead. All these little things adding up, like, it’s like a dam bursting almost—that just all these things that this company pioneered, it can’t keep up with at scale. Tariffs and geopolitical tensions keep BYD and the other Chinese car companies out of our market for now. I personally tend to think that’s a temporary thing, at best, and that capitalism, even China’s version of it, tends to find a way. But, you know, once that happens and one of these automakers is able to sell in this country or even build cars in Ohio or Michigan or Tennessee or whatever, and you know, the Americans can get a taste of something that far surpasses a Tesla for much cheaper, I think that’s going to be a real headache for that company. Warzel: Well, and as you’re saying all this, what’s running through my mind is this, like, complex threat matrix. You know, like, everyone’s sort of encircling Tesla in this way. And meanwhile, Elon Musk—who I said I was going to keep out of it for a second, but I have to bring him back in— it seems from the outside, was not paying any attention to any of this. George: Certainly busy, but he’s also remarkably tactical. I don’t believe, based on everything I’ve heard and read and interviewed, and associates I’ve talked to about the guy—like, he does think many moves ahead. And I think part of the reason that Tesla’s stock price shot up after the election was this belief that by working with Trump, Elon can sort of carve out a regulatory framework, get rid of regulations in America that limit the deployment of autonomous cars—like, essentially that by working with Trump, they could, you know, deploy autonomous cars and robotaxis more quickly nationally and in a way that’s favorable to Tesla. Because right now, the regulations governing autonomous cars are state by state. It’s municipality by municipality. It’s very patchwork. But if you had a federal framework, and if that framework was favorable to Tesla, you know, that is a game changer for their ability to deliver on the promise of their stock price. Like, that’s where my mind goes for the car company, specifically. And when Trump was still on the campaign trail right before the election, Elon said as much. He was basically up there being like, Yeah, we need a regulatory framework that’s going to work for autonomous cars. That’s all boring to say. But the idea is that when you watch Fox News and their defense of this great American business patriot, it’s just that he’s just a hero who is cutting government waste and getting rid of the deficit, when, in reality, I think that he used this to enrich his own companies and to clear out obstacles for the things he wants to do, especially when Tesla’s concerned for robotaxis. But that single-minded focus on autonomy and AI has meant they’ve taken their eye off the ball when it comes to products, when it comes to cars people can buy. And he’s been on record as saying that it’s pointless for us to come out with another car that has a steering wheel. Like, why would you do that? It’s like coming out with, like, a horse and buggy, but the technology’s not there yet. You know, for now at least, it does have to be a car company, and it does have to still do battle with Hyundai and General Motors and BYD, whether he wants it to or not. Warzel: It sounds like a very classic sort of—you know, as someone who’s followed Musk for a really long time—his obsession with the future, and I think genuine. Like, actual, genuine enthusiasm for the possibility of things. His sci-fi brain is so overactive that it causes this. Like, I’m sure that there’s an element of bullshitting here with, like, We’re going to be in Mars by 2030, and everyone’s going to be walking around. George: Been saying this stuff for 10-years-plus. Yeah. Warzel: But I think there is also a genuineness, too, right? Like, the steering-wheel thing feels very real to me, right? Like, This is right around the corner. Of course, we’re not going to build another car with the steering wheel. Meanwhile, every year that future pushes further and further away is another year that Tesla doesn’t have that product that can sort of fill the gap between his understanding of what is to come and the reality that, like, we’re just not there yet. George: Yeah. But this speaks to how they’ve been successful before. And it’s just—that’s the Musk mentality. You just kick down every door until you get what you want. And I go back to when they built the Model 3, you know, the first really affordable sedan. It’s not just that it’s a cheap electric car. It’s built in a completely different way than cars were built before. And the factory that builds it had to be completely reset from how car factories worked. It’s like, Just hit reset on everything, and just do it. That’s your goal. And you just do it. But they are running into technological limitations with how they do autonomous driving. Like, they are not there yet. And, like, I’ve used autopilot. I’ve used full self-driving for many years. I have seen it get better. Warzel: Those are Tesla features. George: Yeah, of course. Right. These are the self-driving Tesla features. I should say, they’re not really self-driving. This is what we would call a semi-autonomous driving-assistance system that kind of helps you on the highway or will take over some steering around town if we’re talking about full self-driving, and they’re getting better. Full self-driving tried to kill me on two separate occasions, Charlie, which really hurt my feelings. And it hasn’t done that in a while, but it’s still not a hundred percent. And for true autonomous driving to work, it has to be safer and better than a human every single time, in every single scenario. And they’re not there yet. Warzel: What is so difficult to put together for someone like myself—but I assume, also, a lot of different people who aren’t paying attention to Musk and Tesla, like, this granularly—we’re talking about an inability to fill the gap between the technological future of Musk’s imagination and the current moment, right? Do you think some of that is just, like, the margins of starting to, you know, suffer these consequences for not delivering? George: You know, a year ago, I kind of thought if Elon ever met his Waterloo, it would be his inability to deliver on these promises of autonomy and autonomous cars. Like, it would just get to the point where that technology’s just not there yet. You know? And maybe someday it will. I think on a long enough timeline, yeah—probably humans will not be driving cars. Maybe that’s 10 years from now or 100 years from now. I don’t know. But lately, I think that what may be his greatest downfall and what may be a kind of death blow to this company is his inability to understand people. He understands technology, but he doesn’t get people. And he has said, you know, empathy is a weakness. He doesn’t relate to other people well. You know, he’s blamed this on being neurodivergent, I guess. Either way, not a great people person. And I don’t think he counted on people abandoning the Tesla brand as furiously as they are, as quickly as they are, in response to him, in response to his actions with DOGE. I don’t think he counted on that. I think he thought he would come in and, you know, gut the federal government and be seen as this great crusader, and that everything would’ve worked out great, just the way it always has, as he’s had all this success before, right? But now, like, people are—you know, they’re running away from this company, and that might be the greatest failure of all here.

(Photo by Justin TALLIS / AFP) (Photo by JUSTIN TALLIS/AFP via Getty Images) Meta Platforms' stock has declined approximately 13% this year, facing headwinds from potential tariff impacts that could affect the company in two significant ways: Despite this year’s setback, Meta has demonstrated remarkable resilience over a longer timeframe, with the stock gaining 56% since early 2022, substantially outperforming the broader Nasdaq index’s modest 7% increase. As an aside, after a negative reaction to earnings, Is IBM Stock Headed To $170? Meta’s outperformance can be attributed to several key factors: Meta Platforms has delivered impressive revenue growth of 39%, increasing from $118 billion in 2021 to $165 billion in the trailing twelve months. This robust performance stems from multiple growth drivers: Meta's profitability metrics show substantial improvement, with the net income margin expanding from 33.4% in 2021 to 37.9% currently. This enhanced profitability is complemented by a strategic 9% reduction in shares outstanding, made possible by the company's substantial $122 billion investment in share repurchases. The combination of higher revenues, expanded margins, and fewer outstanding shares has resulted in a 73% increase in earnings per share, rising from $13.77 in 2021 to $23.86 in the most recent period. Despite Meta's impressive financial performance across revenue growth, margin expansion, and earnings improvement, its P/E ratio has declined by 10%. This valuation compression can be attributed to several factors: Given these uncertainties, investors should ask themselves critical questions: Do you want to hold on to your META stock now? Will you panic and sell if it starts dropping further? Holding on to a falling stock is never easy. While META remains fundamentally strong with impressive growth and improving profitability, investors seeking to preserve wealth in volatile markets might consider alternative strategies.

April 24, 2025 08:38 ET | Source: Berger Montague Berger Montague PHILADELPHIA, April 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Berger Montague PC advises investors that a securities class action lawsuit has been filed against Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RKLB) on behalf of purchasers of Rocket Lab securities between November 12, 2024 through February 25, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investor Deadline: Investors who purchased or acquired Rocket Lab securities during the Class Period may, no later than APRIL 28, 2025, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class. To learn your rights, CLICK HERE. Headquartered in Long Beach, Calif., Rocket Lab is a space company that provides launch and spacecraft design services. The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; and (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner. On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report accusing Rocket Lab of misleading investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025. The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to at least September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026. The report also alleged that the Company’s only Neutron contract so far is a discount deal with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space. On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, nearly 10%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025.

Title: Bitcoin Creator’s Hidden Fortune Tops $100 Billion As Price Surges

The mysterious creator of Bitcoin now sits on a fortune worth over $100 billion, as the cryptocurrency’s price climbed back above $94,000 this week. Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous inventor who disappeared from public view more than a decade ago, holds approximately 1.1 million Bitcoin, according to data from analytics platform Arkham. If Satoshi were a public figure today, their net worth would rank them 16th on Forbes’ list of billionaires worldwide. This would position Bitcoin’s inventor above prominent business personalities such as Binance founder Changpeng Zhao and computer mogul Michael Dell. The value of these Bitcoin holdings reached a high of $120 billion when Bitcoin hit its all-time high in January before falling during the recent market correction. Perhaps most salient in the wealth of Satoshi is just how little money he has utilized. Studies demonstrate that of what’s estimated as 1.1 million Bitcoins residing in the dormant wallets, merely 907 BTC have actually ever been disbursed. Mining from Satoshi had, by and by, reached its end when the singularly patterned mode of mining labeled as the “Patoshi pattern” closed with block number 54,316 during May 2010. Such a defining technical signature has aided researchers following the early mine works of Satoshi throughout over 22,000 blocks. Bitcoin momentarily traded at $94,400 before settling at a slightly lower price, a monthly high. This is a 25% recovery from its recent fall to $74,400 in the first part of this month, the lowest since November 2024. As the value of Bitcoin rises, long-term holders are watching their investments increase again. Whereas Satoshi’s holdings are still the biggest single Bitcoin hoard, institutional investors are closing in. Bitcoin ETFs collectively now hold almost as much Bitcoin as Satoshi, with total holdings worth about $104 billion. BlackRock is the leading ETF providers with Bitcoin holdings of $50 billion, followed by Grayscale with $17 billion. Strategy (previously MicroStrategy) is still accumulating and now holds 538,200 BTC worth nearly $50 billion. The ongoing absence of the founder of Bitcoin has raised so many questions regarding what happened to this massive cryptocurrency wealth. In its analysis, Whale Alert states Satoshi potentially mined as much as 1,125,150 BTC before he vanished from the Bitcoin world. Whether such coins will ever be moved is still one of the largest cryptocurrency enigmas. Traders keep a close eye on these sleeping wallets since any unusual activity may have a noticeable effect on Bitcoin prices and conceivably give information regarding Satoshi Nakamoto’s whereabouts or identity.

Title: What’s Happening With AMZN Stock?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. 27 January 2025, Bavaria, Munich: The logo and lettering of global online mail order company Amazon ... More can be seen under the blue sky on the façade of Amazon Germany's headquarters in Parkstadt Schwabing in Munich (Bavaria) on January 27, 2025. Photo: Matthias Balk/dpa (Photo by Matthias Balk/picture alliance via Getty Images) Amazon’s stock has declined approximately 18% this year, largely due to investor concerns about potential tariff impacts on its business model. This is particularly significant as Amazon’s marketplace relies heavily on third-party sellers from China, making it vulnerable to import tariff increases. Even if the Trump administration eventually reduces these tariffs, Amazon’s operations may face lasting structural changes. Additionally, broader tariff-driven inflation could dampen consumer purchasing power, further impacting Amazon’s retail sales. Separately, What’s Going On With META Stock? Looking at a longer timeframe reveals an even more concerning picture: since early 2022, Amazon's stock has gained only about 9% over three years. This underperformance can be attributed to several key factors: Now, of course, individual stocks are more volatile than a portfolio — and in this environment, if you seek upside with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. Amazon has demonstrated solid fundamental performance with a 36% revenue increase, growing from $470 billion in 2021 to $638 billion in the trailing twelve months. This growth is driven by several sustainable factors: Amazon's net income margin has improved by approximately 31%, increasing from 7.1% to 9.3% during this period. This margin expansion primarily stems from the increasing contribution of AWS, which operates at substantially higher margins than the retail business. As AWS constitutes a larger percentage of overall revenue, it positively impacts the company's aggregate profit margins. The combination of revenue growth and margin expansion has resulted in a 71% increase in earnings per share, rising from $3.24 in 2021 to $5.53 in the last twelve months. Despite strong operational improvements, Amazon's P/E ratio has contracted by 36% (from 51.5 to 32.7) since 2021, reflecting several investor concerns: Given these uncertainties, investors should ask themselves critical questions: Do you want to hold on to your AMZN stock now? Will you panic and sell if it starts dropping further? Holding on to a falling stock is never easy. While Amazon remains fundamentally strong with impressive growth and improving profitability, investors seeking to preserve wealth in volatile markets might consider alternative strategies. Trefis works with Empirical Asset Management—a Boston area wealth manager—whose asset allocation strategies yielded positive returns even during the 2008-09 period when the S&P lost more than 40%. Empirical has incorporated the Trefis HQ Portfolio in this asset allocation framework to provide clients better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

InfoQ Homepage News Inflection Points in Engineering Productivity for Improving Productivity and Operational Excellence Apr 24, 2025 3 min read by Ben Linders As a company grows, investing in custom developer tools may become necessary. Initially, standard tools suffice, but as the company scales in engineers, maturity, and complexity, industry tools may no longer meet needs, Carlos Arguelles said at QCon San Francisco. Inflection points, such as a crisis, hyper-growth, or reaching a new market, often trigger these investments, providing opportunities for improving productivity and operational excellence. Carlos Arguelles gave a talk about Amazon’s inflection points in engineering productivity. When a company first starts, it doesn’t make sense for it to create its own developer tools, as there are plenty of excellent ones available in the industry, he said. But as a company grows (in number of engineers, in maturity, in customer adoption, in domains), investing in its own developer tools starts making sense: An inflection point is when that investment in engineering productivity that didn’t make sense before now suddenly does. This could be because the industry tools do not scale, or because the internal tools can be optimized to integrate better with the rest of the ecosystem, as Arguelles explained. A little papercut where each developer is wasting a couple of minutes per day in toil can add to hundreds of millions of dollars of lost productivity in a company like Amazon or Google. The more obvious inflection point that made investments in engineering productivity become feasible is the number of engineers. Maybe it didn’t make sense for your company to have its own CI/CD proprietary tooling when there were 3000 engineers, but it does when there are 10,000 engineers, because the savings in developer productivity with a toolchain optimized for the ecosystem have a significant return on investment, Arguelles said. He mentioned that the opposite is true as well. When your company is in hypergrowth it may make sense to have duplicate tools (each organization creating its bespoke tool so that it can independently move fast), but when the company stops growing (which is what happened in 2023 with all the big tech layoffs), it makes sense to consolidate tooling and defragment the world. Arguelles gave some more examples of inflection points, like reaching a certain level of maturity where you need to raise the bar in terms of engineering or operational excellence can provide an inflection point or entering an entirely different and new market. Sometimes the inflection point is a crisis or even a single operational issue that could have been prevented with the right tooling: For example, Amazon invested significantly in a number of load, stress, and chaos testing tools after the Prime Day incident of 2018 (where the Amazon Store was unavailable for hours during the busiest shopping day of the year). We had been talking about doing that for years, but that incident helped us sharpen our focus and build a solid case for funding those investments. Inflections can also happen when an organization experiences hyper-growth: I saw Amazon double in size every year, from 3000 engineers when I started in 2009, to 60k-70k in 2022. What this meant in practice is that we needed to be thinking about skating to where the puck was going to be, not where it currently was. Scaling needs and security needs often meant sooner or later we needed to create our own developer tools, Arguelles said. Over time, they developed tools to scale source code repositories and built their own tools for code reviews and CI/CD (including testing and deployment): Because of that hyperscale, we often found ourselves needing to re-think our architecture much sooner than we had envisioned. But it also provided ample opportunities to innovate and think differently! Inflection points are inevitable and occur naturally in many situations: a company drastically increasing or shrinking in terms of number of engineers, a crisis, reaching a certain level of maturity where you need to raise the bar in terms of engineering or operational excellence, or entering an entirely different and new market, Arguelles said. He concluded that it is important to have your eyes open, recognize when these inflection points are around the corner, proactively shape your engineering productivity tooling for the future, and seize the opportunities.

Title: WealthTech, Retirement And Investing Predictions For 2025 And Beyond

ByEric Satz ByEric Satz, Forbes Councils Member. Eric Satz is Founder and CEO of AltoIRA, which provides investment access with retirement savings to private market assets for all. Investors have faced highly volatile and stressful conditions to start 2025, with considerable stock market losses. The ongoing challenges could encourage investors to consider a different approach for allocating their retirement dollars, including alternative assets. In 2024, demand for alternative investments grew dramatically from retail and institutional investors looking to bolster returns and improve portfolio diversification. Private market asset managers are now pursuing the retail channel, so increased supply and demand are meeting in the middle. In addition, new technology platforms opened access to private markets that previously were only available to the very wealthy. I expect these trends to continue and accelerate in the coming years due to increasing investor education, ongoing stock market uncertainty and changing regulatory conditions. For the typical retail investor, most of their portfolio is in a retirement plan such as a 401(k) or individual retirement account (IRA). Most brokers and banks only allow IRA investing in traditional market assets like stocks, bonds and mutual funds. However, investors can use a self-directed IRA custodian to invest their retirement savings in a variety of alternative asset classes, such as private equity, private credit and venture capital. Self-directed IRAs also allow direct investments in cryptocurrencies, which had a moment given the record prices reached by certain coins early this year. I expect the industry to raise more awareness of the different ways to access alternatives in an investment portfolio, including through self-directed IRAs. These accounts can be opened online in minutes. Ultimately, investors want control over their retirement investments, and we’re likely going to see an increase in investors learning how to do so through self-directed IRAs in the years ahead. I expect more traditional industry players, including large retail brokers and financial advisors, to engage with the alts space over the next year as they respond to investor demand. For example, numerous brokers launched crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in 2024, such as Fidelity, BlackRock and Invesco. Financial advisors are also constantly seeking ways to improve asset allocation and portfolio results for their clients. A KKR study found that a portfolio with an allocation of 40% stocks, 30% bonds and 30% alts had a higher annual return than the standard 60/40 stock and bond portfolio from 1927 to 2021. Financial advisors will shift their recommendations to match new research, but they need help doing so. Brokers and advisors who are new to alts could lean on those specializing in this space, such as the recent partnership between the Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst (CAIA) Association and the Financial Planning Association (FPA), to share educational materials. In the past, the alts sector was mostly a manual process and didn’t leverage technology; think pen and paper and fax machines. While this approach made sense when these investments were only for a few high-net-worth individuals, it no longer works for investors in the digital era. Investors need a uniform platform where they can educate themselves, have access to a range of choices, evaluate decisions and then seamlessly execute investments. Ideally, platforms should be backed by human support. Investors are used to these digital platforms and tools for traditional public market-based assets and will expect them for alts, too. That same technology and digital experience should be easily accessed by financial advisors so they feel comfortable referring it to clients. Ultimately, the companies that engage investors with a user-friendly digital experience are the ones that will be better positioned to grow. Over the last few years, the regulatory landscape has become difficult for fund managers, financial advisors and investors to navigate. Government agencies are targeting the industry with more scrutiny and enforcement. That still holds for the time being. While firms seek opportunities to grow and innovate in the alternative investment space, compliance must remain a priority. Things have been slowly moving in a different direction for alts, such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving crypto ETFs, but barriers remain. In addition, if the Fed resumes decreasing interest rates, investor confidence may increase, specifically for private equity and venture capital, leading to increased investment demand. This could create further political pressure from investors to push the regulatory landscape in a different direction. I believe demand for alts will continue to grow as investors realize the potential diversification and investment value of these assets. The industry will adopt more user-friendly wealth tech platforms, both for individual investors and their advisors. While regulatory challenges remain, I am cautiously optimistic that the evolving policy landscape may create a more supportive environment for alternative investments. The coming years should continue expanding access to investment opportunities that were once limited to the ultra-wealthy. Investors exploring alternatives can work with their financial advisors to determine how these options might fit into their long-term retirement planning.

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network Port of Long Beach. Photo: Shutterstock/DJANA 575 By Bloomberg News Apr 24, 2025 (Bloomberg) –For an increasing number of Chinese exporters, many of whom battled through the trade war in President Donald Trump’s first term and who have invested years to capture the spending power of American shoppers, it may be closing time in the US. With tariffs on Chinese imports at 145%, factories that make items like coffee machines and yoga pants have halted shipments to the US and have idled their assembly lines to a three or four day week. And while Trump has indicated that tariffs won’t stay that high on China forever, some fearful exporters are making permanent plans to withdraw from the US market and turn to other regions like the Middle East for sales instead. Exporters are now trying to “survive” the current crisis, said Wang Xin, head of the Shenzhen Cross-Border E-Commerce Association, which represents some 3,000 exporters. Businesses are taking steps to generate cash like selling inventory for higher prices, and cancelling warehouse rental agreements in the US, she said. One such exporter is a Guangzhou-based retailer that sells underwear and yoga pants via Amazon, Temu and Shein, which decided to stop shipping any more products to the US earlier this month, and raised prices of some of its most popular products by as much as 30% to generate more cash. “We had some urgent meetings in late March to discuss our next steps. The conclusion was to stop fighting for the US market,” said sales manager Huang Lun. The plight of Chinese exporters mean US consumers could face rising prices and shortages of crucial goods in the coming months. The grim outlook adds to rising bets among economists that the US will enter a recession if the White House doesn’t back down on its tariff threats. China will also endure substantial economic pain. With their largest market on hold, many factories have cut back production to just three or four days per week, said Wang, citing a recent industry survey conducted by the association. With bank loans and worker salaries to pay, there will be a wave of factory closures and worker layoffs in the coming months, she said. Jenny Huang, a salesperson at a Ningbo-based curtain maker, is trying to diversify beyond the US though 90% of its current client base — business that has come to an abrupt halt — is there. The company will only consider exporting to the US again when tariff situation clears up, she says. Until then, it is exploring opportunities elsewhere such as Southeast Asia the Middle East. “When the tariffs were raised to 54%, people already suffered very slim profits but still decided to stay and buy time to explore new markets with the cash flow generated in the US,” said Wang. “But when it was raised to 125% and then 145%, people decided to quit because you’ll die faster if you insist on staying in the US.” © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: Bitcoin Traders Eye Long Term BTC Accumulation By Selling Put Options

Would you offer insurance when expecting low odds of a claim being made? Most likely, you would, while pocketing the premium without a second thought. Bitcoin (BTC) traders are doing something similar in the Deribit-listed BTC options market, hinting at bullish price expectations. Recently, an increasing number of traders have been selling (writing) BTC put options, likened to providing insurance against price drops in exchange for a small upfront premium. They are implementing this strategy in a cash-secured manner by holding a corresponding amount in stablecoins, ensuring they can buy BTC if the market declines and the put buyer decides to exercise his right to sell BTC at the predetermined higher price. This strategy enables traders to collect premiums (paid by put buyers) while potentially accumulating bitcoin if the options are exercised. In other words, it's the expression of a long-term bullish sentiment. "There is a notable increase in cash-secured put selling using stablecoins—another sign of a more mature, long-term approach to BTC accumulation and a continued expression of bullish sentiment," Deribit's Asia Business Development Head Lin Chen told CoinDesk. Chen said BTC holders are also selling higher strike call options to collect premiums and generate additional yield on top of their coin stash, which is weighing over Deribit's DVOL index, which measures the 30-day BTC implied volatility. The index has dropped from 63 to 48 since the April 7 panic selling in BTC to $75K, according to data from the charting platform TradingView. "We observe that investors remain long-term bullish on BTC, particularly among crypto-native “holders” who are willing to hold through market cycles," Chen said. Bitcoin's price has risen to over $92,000 since the early month slide to $75,000, supposedly on the back of haven demand and renewed institutional adoption narrative. The sharp price recovery has seen BTC options risk reversals reset to suggest a bias for call options across time frames, according to data source Amberdata. Over the past two days, traders have specifically snapped up calls at strike $95,000, $100,000 and $135,000 via the over-the-counter tech platform Paradigm. As of writing, the $100,000 strike call was the most popular option play on Deribit, with a notional open interest of over $1.6 billion. Just how important it is to track flows in the options market can be explained by the fact that the cumulative delta in Deribit's BTC options and options tied to the U.S.-listed BlackRock spot bitcoin ETF (IBIT) and its peers was $9 billion as of Wednesday, according to data tracked by Volmex. The data indicates heightened sensitivity of options to changes in BTC's price, suggesting potential for price volatility. Delta, one of the metrics used by sophisticated market participants to manage risk, measures how much the price (premium) of an options contract is likely to change in response to the $1 chance in the price of the underlying asset, in this case, BTC. So, the cumulative delta of $9 billion represents the total sensitivity of all outstanding BTC and bitcoin ETF options to changes in the spot price. As of Wednesday, the total notional value of all outstanding options contracts was $43 billion. Such large data or sensitivity to price swings in the underlying asset means market makers and traders actively engage in hedging strategies to mitigate their risks. Market makers, or those mandated to provide order book liquidity, are known to add to price volatility through their constant effort to maintain a net directional neutral exposure. "Option deltas have increased to record levels as open interest grew and strike deltas shifted significantly. Option market makers are actively hedging this delta exposure, driven by substantial new positions and notable shifts in strike pricing," Volmex noted on X. According to Volmex, crypto-native options traders over Deribit are positioned more bullishly than those trading options tied to IBIT.

Archives Internal variability effect doped by climate change drove the 2023 marine heat extreme in the North Atlantic, Guinaldo et al., Communications Earth & Environment The year 2023 shattered numerous heat records both globally and regionally. We here focus on the drivers of the unprecedented warm sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies which started in the North Atlantic Ocean in early summer and persisted later on. Evidence is provided that 2023 should be interpreted as an extreme event in a warmer world because of superimposed internal variability on top of human forcing, which altogether, made the 2023 event all-time high due to extreme air-sea surface fluxes in the subtropics and eastern basin. The effect of internal variability has been considerably boosted by the long-term ocean stratification increase due to combined anthropogenically-driven ocean warming and multidecadal variability. The 2023 event would have been impossible to occur without anthropogenically-driven climate change but at the current warmer background climate state, it is assessed as a decadal-type event when considering the full North Atlantic ocean and a centennial event in the subtropics and eastern basin. Considering the regional distribution of anomalies is crucial for risk assessment in a warming climate. Reply to Pielke (2025), Willoughby et al., Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology: Pielke deprecates both the ICAT database, which he once recommended, and U.S. tropical cyclone (TC) damage estimates from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). We do not share these views. Willoughby et al. (hereafter WL24) is based upon ICAT damage for 1900–2017, both then-year and normalized for inflation, population, and individual wealth, extended to 2022 with National Hurricane Center (NHC) official figures from NCEI. Pielke represents the data of Weinkle et al. (hereafter WK18) as a superior source. We find troubling anomalies in the WK18 data. The issue is that WK18 find that normalized TC damage is constant, but WL24 find that it is increasing. Here, we replicate the WL24 analysis with WK18 data and find a statistically significant growth of then-year damage relative to the U.S. economy, a statistically significant increase in the occurrence of the most damaging TCs, and a 0.6% per year increase in TC normalized damage. The last of these is not statistically significant because of the large variance due to the modulation of TC impacts by the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation. Thus, the increase in U.S. TC damage is sufficiently robust to survive the shortcomings of both datasets. Discerning the Elevated Risk of Compound Extreme Heat Stress Followed by Extreme Precipitation Events in the Socially Vulnerable Communities in the Upper Midwest, Khan et al., International Journal of Climatology Compound extreme events have the potential to yield severe socio-economic repercussions. This study delves into compound extreme precipitation events following extreme heat stress (CEPHS), an aspect that needs more extensive examination within the compound event framework in the upper Midwestern United States. Results reveal a significant increasing trend in CEPHS occurrences, particularly in Kentucky, lower, central, and northern parts of Minnesota, Wisconsin, central parts of Missouri, northern parts of Michigan, and western and north-eastern parts of Iowa from 1979 to 2021. Moreover, we observed significantly higher intensities of extreme precipitation events following extreme heat stress compared to those occurring independently, predominantly in the central and northern parts of Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio during the same period. Our analysis also underscores a robust association between CEPHS and convective available potential energy and convective inhibition. These insights offer valuable implications for flood hazard management strategies under climate change within the region. This work was supported by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Hatch project (No. ILLU-741-337). British heatwave discourse (1985–2023): from ice cream to armageddon?, van Dooremalen & Smith, Environmental Sociology: How has public discourse about climate change evolved? This paper answers this question through the paradigmatic case of British heatwaves. These are traditionally considered a fortunate break from dull weather, making them a least likely case for the emergency of a discourse of doom. With a topic-modeling analysis of British national newspaper articles on heatwaves from 1985 until 2023 (N = 35,127), we show that a longstanding Romantic heatwave discourse eventually buckled, and that Apocalypticism finally became the dominant genre in the last decade. A supplementary hermeneutic analysis then indicates and explains complexity within this broad trend. 1980s stories already noted routine heatwave problems, while many recent ones continue depicting positive lifestyle implications. Within the Apocalyptic genre itself climate change is today deemed a factual causal force, whereas in the 1980s and 1990s it was a possible carrier of future dangers. In connecting the genre perspective from literary theory to big data method topic modelling, our approach is parsimonious, novel and replicable in other national contexts. Enhanced flood synchrony and downstream severity in the Delaware River under rising temperatures, Cooper et al., Communications Earth & Environment: River floods threaten life and economic stability, with risks increasing globally, especially in densely populated coastal areas. In mountainous coastal watersheds like the Delaware River Basin, rising temperature is projected to reduce snowpack, reshaping upstream–downstream flood dynamics. However, the impact on flood synchronization between upland tributaries and estuarine mainstems remains poorly understood. Using multidecadal streamflow simulations from a high-resolution hydrological model, we find significant increases in the frequency and magnitude of synchronized floods under future warming scenarios, particularly severe floods (above the 75th percentile). Under higher warming scenarios, snowpack and rain-on-snow floods in headwater subbasins nearly vanish. Surprisingly, this regime shift amplifies estuarine flooding by enhancing synchronization between historically snow-dominated subbasins and their downstream counterparts. Despite intensified synchronization and flood magnitude, cold-season flood risk declines due to fewer rain-on-snow events. Conversely, summer floods grow larger, more frequent, and synchronized, driving a seasonal reconfiguration of flood risk that should be considered in future mitigation strategies.

Title: APP DEADLINE ALERT: AppLovin (APP) Investors with Losses Encouraged to Contact Hagens Berman Before May 5th Deadline in Securities Class Action

April 23, 2025 18:46 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, April 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Just months after basking in the glow of a meteoric 700% stock surge, fueled by investor enthusiasm for its artificial intelligence technology and burgeoning ad business, AppLovin Corp. (NASDAQ: APP) is facing a shift in sentiment on Wall Street. Several prominent investment banks have significantly lowered their expectations for the stock following the release of multiple critical reports from short-selling firms about the mobile advertising technology firm. Adding to its woes, AppLovin is now facing a securities class action lawsuit. Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: May 10, 2023 – Feb. 25, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/app Contact the Firm Now: APP@hbsslaw.com844-916-0895 Analysts Downgrade APP Shares The latest blow came on Friday, April 11, when The Goldman Sachs Group slashed its price target for AppLovin from a lofty $500.00 to a more sobering $335.00. This downgrade followed a similar move by UBS Group earlier in the week, when the firm reduced its price target on AppLovin from $630.00 to $450.00. Short Seller Onslaught: Allegations of Data Exploitation and Inflated Metrics These downward revisions follow a barrage of critical reports from short sellers. Most recently, on March 28, Muddy Waters Research alleged that AppLovin's ad technology "systematically" violates app store rules by "impermissibly extracting proprietary IDs" from major platforms to deliver targeted ads without user consent. The report also claimed a significant churn rate among e-commerce advertisers, contradicting company statements. Earlier, in February, Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research had also critiqued AppLovin's AXON software, with Fuzzy Panda later urging the S&P 500 committee to exclude the company due to alleged "data theft" and "revenue fraud." Securities Class Action Alleges Misleading Statements Adding to AppLovin's challenges, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed against the company. The lawsuit alleges that AppLovin misled investors about the capabilities of its enhanced AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and its "cutting-edge AI technologies." Specifically, the lawsuit claims that AppLovin created a false impression that its technology would efficiently match advertisements to mobile games and expand into web-based marketing and e-commerce. However, the suit alleges that AppLovin was instead exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms and using manipulative practices, including a "backdoor installation scheme," to force unwanted apps on customers. This allegedly inflated installation numbers and, consequently, the company's profit figures. The class action lawsuit further points to the short seller reports released on February 26, 2025, which detailed AppLovin's alleged reverse engineering and exploitation of advertising data from Meta Platforms. These reports also claimed that AppLovin utilized manipulative practices to artificially inflate ad click-through and app download rates, such as self-clicking ads and employing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads. Following the release of these reports, the price of AppLovin shares reportedly fell by more than 12%. Hagens Berman’s Investigation Prominent shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the claims. “The allegations detailed in the short reports and outlined in the recently filed class action complaint, detailing the purported exploitation of user data and manipulative installation schemes, raise serious questions about the integrity of AppLovin's reported growth and the accuracy of its disclosures to the investing public,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

Title: Investors got hosed when Trump’s tariffs tanked markets. Some of America’s billionaires managed to sell before the plunge

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Many of America’s wealthiest business leaders have lost millions, if not billions, of dollars in net worth since the start of the year, as President Donald Trump’s policies hit markets. But some might have lost even more if they hadn’t offloaded millions of dollars’ worth of stock prior to Trump’s tariff announcement in early April — not necessarily because they knew something the rest of us didn’t, but because the wealthiest investors treat their portfolios somewhat differently than the average investor. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Oracle CEO Safra Catz and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon were among the top 10 stock sellers by value during the first three months of this year, according to data from The Washington Service, which tracks buying and selling by corporate insiders. Together, the top 10 insider sellers sold more than 28 million shares of their companies, worth a combined $3.9 billion, during the first quarter, the data shows. That was before markets took a precipitous drop when Trump announced on April 2 widespread tariff hikes on America’s trading partners. Trump has since flip-flopped on many of those tariff plans, but uncertainty has continued to roil markets. Bloomberg first reported on The Washington Service data. Representatives for Zuckerberg and Catz did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A representative for Dimon said his sale was pre-planned and disclosed months before. Corporate executives generally offload stock at regularly scheduled intervals, and there’s no indication that the top sellers were looking to get ahead of the tariff announcement. Still, the timing meant they suffered smaller losses in the value of their stock holdings than if they had sold weeks later. Zuckerberg sold 1.1 million shares worth nearly $733.5 million during the first quarter. Securities and Exchange Commission filings show the sales took place during January and February, when Meta shares were mostly trading above $600. As of midday Wednesday, Meta shares (META) were trading around $530, down 11% year-to-date. Related article These tech leaders donated to Trump. Now they’re out billions of dollars The decline in Meta’s share price has helped to drag down Zuckerberg’s net worth by nearly $30 billion since the start of this year, as of Tuesday, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Even after the sales, Zuckerberg owns more than 342 million shares of Meta, around 13% of the company’s total stock. The decline in Zuckerberg’s wealth this year is particularly striking considering efforts by him and his company to foster a closer relationship with Trump, presumably in hopes that Trump’s policies and actions would benefit his company’s bottom line. That included donating to and attending the president’s inauguration, as well as a $25 million agreement to settle the lawsuit Trump brought against the company for suspending his account after the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack, $22 million of which will help fund a forthcoming Trump presidential library. Catz sold 3.8 million in Oracle shares worth $705 million in the first quarter, according to The Washington Service. Oracle’s stock (ORCL) was down nearly 19% since the start of this year, as of midday Wednesday. JPMorgan’s Dimon sold more than 860,000 shares (JPM) worth $233.8 million in the first quarter. Dimon has warned that a recession is a “likely outcome” of Trump’s trade policies. The top ten insider sellers based on the value of shares sold in the first quarter, according to The Washington Service, were: Zuckerberg, Catz, Palo Alto Networks CEO Arora Nikesh, Nutanix Director Max de Groen, Axis Capital Holdings Director Charles Davis (sold by Stone Point Capital where Davis is chairman and co-CEO), Palantir President Stephen Cohen, Dimon, Tempus AI CEO Eric Lefkofsky, Netflix Co-CEO Ted Sarandos and Dutch Bros Chairman Travis Boersma.

Chip stocks were among the market leaders on Wednesday thanks to President Donald Trump’s statement the day before that tariffs on China “will come down substantially,” as well as vote of confidence by famed investor Cathie Wood. Wood’s Ark Investment Management bought up stock in several chipmakers on Tuesday, including $1.1 million shares of Nvidia (NVDA+0.54%). On Wednesday, Nvidia jumped more than 5%, approaching its 21-day moving average. Palintir Technologies (PLTR+6.03%) also had a strong performance Wednesday, rising more than 7%, while Super Micro Computer (SMCI+0.90%) shot up by 10.2% during the day, AMD (AMD+2.02%) rose 8.1%, Micron (MU+2.76%) jumped 6.8%, and Broadcom (AVGO-1.52%) more than 7%. Although semiconductors and other electronics are currently exempt from steep U.S. tariffs on goods imported from China, administration officials have said those exemptions are temporary, and tariffs would probably be imposed on the sector in a month or two. Those threats have weighed heavily on chip stocks in recent days, but late Tuesday Trump said those tariffs “will come down substantially” and he intends to be “very nice” to China in trade negotiations. As a result, the PHLX Semiconductor Index, which tracks the 30 largest U.S.-listed companies in the semiconductor sector, was up about 4% in trading on Wednesday.

The company’s stock has fallen about 16% so far this year, so investors will be tuning in to Thursday’s earnings call to gauge how exactly how confident Google’s leadership is about the company’s future, particularly in the key areas of AI and cloud computing, and amid a host of legal concerns related to antitrust cases. The shares were up slightly in Thursday morning trading, about 1.3%. Google is expected to report Q1 revenue growth of $89.2 billion (an 11% year-over-year increase) and earnings per share of $2.02 (7% ). Despite the company’s dip in stock price over the past year, Wall Street analysts largely remain optimistic about Google’s future. The consensus? Its core business fundamentals are strong. Still, lingering uncertainties have led some big firms to lower price targets ahead of Thursday’s call. ​Top analysts, such as those at TD Cowen (TD+2.73%), UBS (UBS+1.35%), and Scotiabank (BNS+1.58%), have adjusted their 12-month price targets for Alphabet. TD Cowen reduced its target from $210 to $195, while UBS lowered its from $209 to $173, and Scotiabank dropped its from $232 to $200. But despite these more cautious outlooks, all three firms maintain a “buy” rating on the stock. RBC Capital (RY+1.52%) analyst Brad Erickson said in a report that institutional investors have lowered their expectations: “We believe buy side is expecting a (2%-3%) miss, respectively, relative to sell-side estimates of 9% search growth and 8% overall ad growth in Q1.” Google is dealing with a host of swirling questions that analysts are taking into consideration: rising legal risks, trade war and tariff uncertainty, and increasing competition in AI and cloud computing. For investors, the first-quarter earnings report could be a moment of truth: a chance to reset expectations and refocus on the long-term potential of a $1.9 trillion Silicon Valley giant navigating turbulent waters. Google has gotten plenty of headlines lately as it wades its way through a variety of antitrust lawsuits. The search engine giant was back in court this week, related to a ruling that found the company has an illegal monopoly in online search — in part by paying web browsers and smartphone manufacturers to feature its search engine. And the DOJ told the judge it had an eyebrow-raising solution: forcing the company to sell its popular Chrome browser. Google faces other mounting issues that have put the company in an especially vulnerable position. In a separate antitrust case, a federal judge ruled that the company had illegally maintained a monopoly in some of its online advertising technology, which could result in regulatory fines or structural changes to how Google’s ad business operates — and maybe even a break-up. And Japan’s FTC recently sent the company a cease-and-desist order after it said Google’s search practices were monopolistic. On Thursday, analysts will watch closely for any mention of these legal challenges and for what the company’s strategy is for dealing with them beyond what the company has already said — that they’ll appeal. One key feature of Google’s earnings report will likely be how the company has integrated and improved its AI offerings, especially among increased competition in the realm. Investors will look at how the company’s Gemini AI model has been integrated across Google Search, YouTube, and Google Cloud — and at how the AI will start generating substantial revenue. Jeffries analysts said that Google Cloud is “well positioned to benefit from Gemini AI advances” as the cloud computing suite remains a bit of a highlight for the company. Analysts expect Q1 Google Cloud revenue of almost $12 billion, up 25% year-over-year and slightly below both the Street’s expectation ($12.3 billion) and Q4’s growth rate (30%). However, Google Cloud is still playing catch-up to rivals such as Amazon Web Services (AMZN-1.08%) and Microsoft Azure (MSFT+0.24%). Google has positioned Google Cloud as an AI-first platform, so as more businesses adopt AI technologies, Google hopes to position its software as the go-to provider. If this quarter’s earnings show significant cloud growth, it could signal a breakthrough moment. Analysts will be closely watching for any signs that this strategy has begun to pay off. And analysts will be looking at AI search competition, too, which JPMorgan Chase (JPM-0.63%) analyst Doug Anmuth said in a report “remains front and center given the rapidly growing scale of OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s more measured pace in disrupting its own search ecosystem.” Google’s advertising business remains the biggest component of the company’s revenue, so investors will look at those numbers to shed light on the current state of the digital advertising market. YouTube and Google Search, the pillars of the company’s ad revenue, are expected to show growth. Analysts predict YouTube’s ad revenue will rise nearly 11% to almost $8 billion. But the company has big hopes for expansion in YouTube Shorts monetization. If it becomes a significant revenue stream, it could help offset any potential slowdown in traditional ad revenue. Analysts remain cautious. Legal challenges, including the recent ruling in federal court that found Google guilty of illegally dominating the market in ad servers and exchanges, could have big implications.

April 23, 2025 14:22 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, April 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ: RKLB) between November 12, 2024 and February 25, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important April 28, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Rocket Lab securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Rocket Lab class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=36018 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 28, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Rocket Lab’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about Rocket Lab’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Rocket Lab class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=36018 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume.

Appointment as lead plaintiff is not required to partake in any recovery. CONTACT US HERE: https://securitiesclasslaw.com/securities/applovin-corporation-loss-submission-form/?id=144432&from=3 CLASS PERIOD: May 10, 2023 to February 25, 2025 ALLEGATIONS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures.

Title: Amazon Stock’s $200 Billion Tariff Hit
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/04/23/amazon-stocks-200-billion-tariff-hit/
Time Published: 2025-04-23T16:52:07Z

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. HANOVER, GERMANY - MARCH 31: The AWS Amazon Web Services pavilion stands are seen at the 2025 ... More Hannover Messe industrial trade fair on March 31, 2025 in Hanover, Germany. (Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images) Think AI spending is Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) biggest risk? Think again. The real time bomb is tariffs - and it’s already ticking. Amazon hauls in over $400 billion in retail-related revenue every year. And here’s the kicker: roughly 25% of its cost of goods sold comes from China. Now layer on Trump’s renewed tariffs and suddenly you’re staring at a $6.5 billion operating income hit that could erase almost $200 billion in market cap, based on Amazon’s current 30x multiple. Tariffs will hit Amazon where it hurts most: razor-thin retail margins. And it doesn’t stop there. If consumers balk at price hikes, Amazon’s pricing power erodes. If sellers bail, Prime loses its edge. If margins compress further - while the company pours billions into AI with no proven ROI - the entire bull case starts to wobble. We warned about this in our recent piece: Amazon Stock to Crash to $120? Tariffs are the spark. AI overspend is the fuel. And if you’re still all-in on Amazon stock, it might be time to rethink. That’s why our High-Quality portfolio, designed to sidestep these stock-specific shocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. Let’s unpack the damage by the numbers. Amazon sells everything but it doesn’t make everything. It sources much of its inventory and enables a third-party ecosystem that’s deeply reliant on Chinese manufacturing. With the tariff war escalating with China, Amazon’s cost base is now exposed in a major way. Amazon lives and dies by its value proposition. That makes it terrible at passing on cost increases. But it has to, to some degree. CEO Andy Jassy himself admitted that “Prices will likely rise” due to tariffs - a rare public concession of pricing pressure. But let’s be clear: Amazon will eat much of these costs. Unlike niche DTC brands or retailers with premium margins, Amazon competes on price, and every dollar it fails to pass through is a direct hit to margins. Let’s do the math based on Amazon’s 2024 financials Now assume: Does it look small? Think again. That’s a $200 billion decline in stock value. Market Cap Hit > $200 Billion Just 1% decline in operating margin reduces Amazon’s value by $200 billion based on prevailing P/EBIT multiple of almost 30x. That’s >10% of current market cap. Just double that margin hit, which is quite possible (remember reciprocal tariffs are at a ridiculous number now) and you are easily looking at 20-25% downside. But that’s not all. Guess what? When expectations fall, multiples shrink. Amazon’s current market multiples inherently imply that investors expect margin expansion. And when that does not happen - and in fact margins go down - what do you think is going to happen? Big funds will dump Amazon, and multiples will contract. The actual downside could be much higher! It is not outrageous to say that Amazon can fall even as low as $120. Just look at the history - market doesn’t care how good the business is. This is why we diversify away stock-specific risks with Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: What’s Going On With Netflix Stock?

More Martin, Matt Duffer, Kate Trefry, Sonia Friedman, Bela Bajaria, Ross Duffer, Shawn Levy and Blair Fetter attend Stranger Things: The First Shadow - Broadway Opening Night at Marquis Theatre on April 22, 2025 in New York City. (Photo by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images for Netflix) The market is a mess. April has already seen the S&P 500 tumble nearly 6%, and most high-flying tech names are getting dragged down with it. Except one. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) is up a jaw-dropping 11.6% this month. Yes, you read that right. While the broader market is coughing up gains, Netflix is popping champagne. And this kind of divergence is exactly why we don’t bet the farm on any one stock. Because when single names zig while everything else zags, the upside can be thrilling - but the risk? Blistering. That’s why our High-Quality portfolio, designed to sidestep these exact stock-specific shocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception So what’s going on? Let’s dig in and check whether this red-hot rally is actually justified or is it about to hit the pause button? Call it earnings magic or just really good timing, but Netflix did well in Q1 2025. Here are the numbers that got Wall Street giddy: And all this as the rest of tech stumbles around blaming tariffs and macro gloom. Netflix? They’re cruising. The company pulled this off by raising prices (again), expanding its advertising tier with in-house tech, and - believe it or not - finally making live content and sports work. This is the part where people start whispering about Netflix being a “tariff-proof haven.” They’re not entirely wrong - Netflix doesn’t sell sneakers or iPhones. No China imports. No tariff drama. Just subscription dollars rolling in. Let’s not sugarcoat this: Netflix stock is expensive at a P/E ratio of 45 and P/EBIT ratio of just under 40. That’s certainly above where most value investors feel cozy. If you are saying - “well that’s fine, Netflix has been a high PE stock for years” - you’d be half right. Think again. In 2022 when inflation hit - guess where Netflix P/E landed? It hit rock bottom of 15x! That’s even lower than what most mature companies get. Simply put - there is ample room for multiple contraction. When that happens, stocks crater. PE is a sensitive metric. It is fueled by expectations. Sure things look good for now because Netflix is executing. Margins are up. Growth is still good. And it’s one of the few mega-cap names that doesn’t have to worry about tariffs, supply chains, or China risk. Investors are looking for safe havens in a shaky macro environment. Right now, Netflix is playing the part equivalent to gold. But you can’t ignore the price tag. This is a stock that assumes Netflix will keep crushing it. Is that possible? Sure. Is it guaranteed? Absolutely not. And here is some data as caution: Netflix is a rare beast in today’s market: a growth stock that’s not just surviving but thriving. But thriving doesn’t come cheap. With a P/E of 45 and little room for missteps, Netflix may be one earnings miss or subscriber slip away from a sharp reality check. The risk here isn’t about Netflix falling apart - it's about the market’s sky-high expectations crashing down to earth. And that’s the problem with chasing single-stock hype: when they win, it’s exhilarating. But when they stumble? Painful. Considering multiples in context of growth is one of the factors we look at in Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: What’s Happening With Palantir Stock?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. POLAND - 2024/11/21: In this photo illustration, the Palantir company logo is seen displayed on a ... More smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Piotr Swat/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) S&P is down 6% in April. Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR) is up 11%? That’s not bullish. That’s bizarre, considering the numbers you see when you lift the curtain. Tariffs are hammering tech, semiconductors are shaking, growth stocks are bleeding, and Palantir - a stock trading at PE multiple of 700 is rising? Either we’re witnessing brilliance or a bubble inflating before our eyes. And bubbles pop. When they do, you don’t want to be left holding nothing. This is why investing in a single stock, no matter how lucrative, can be very risky. We diversify away that risk while being exposed to upside in our High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. Let’s break Palantir down. It’s not fundamentals driving this. It’s euphoria supercharged by three powerful story lines: [1] AI Buzz = Investor Sugar High Palantir calls itself an “AI company” now. That label alone triggers algos and retail fear-of-missing-out. Still, AI hype alone can send any ticker vertical. Just ask C3.ai - that reached highs of $180+ before falling to a mere $10. [2] Insane Momentum: The Stock is Up Almost 700% in 3 Years Palantir has returned 686% in the past 3 years. That’s the kind of move that breaks valuation anchors. People stop asking “what’s it worth?” and start asking “how high can it go?” [3] Retail Crowd Favorite Palantir is a retail darling - with a CEO (Alex Karp) who talks like a philosopher and a cult-like following that sees it as the next Palantir-for-planet-earth operating system. But sentiment isn’t a moat. And it isn’t a reason to buy. Palantir bulls love to talk about potential. But here’s what the data actually says: There are times to ride such momentum, but in the case of Palantir, that time is gone. Valuation multiples mean something. Evaluating multiples in the context of growth and margin expansion is one of the factors we consider in Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Update font size. Reset Wall Street’s major indexes surged to one-week highs on Wednesday, driven by optimism for a thaw in the U.S.-China trade war and President Donald Trump’s softened stance on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Hopes of talks between Washington and Beijing, amid the tariff conflict, boosted market sentiment following a Wall Street Journal report quoting a senior White House official, who suggested U.S. tariffs on China could drop to around 50%-60%. President Trump said on Tuesday of China, “We’re going to live together very happily and ideally work together,” and that tariffs on goods from China will “come down substantially, but it won’t be zero.” He also told reporters he would be “very nice” in negotiations with Beijing and that if China does not agree to a trade deal, “the U.S. will set the terms.” Reuters: ‎ Stocks extended gains after the report, building on early momentum after Trump said on Tuesday he had “no intention” of firing Powell, walking back on his comment that the Fed chair’s termination could not come “fast enough” that had drawn heavy criticism. Markets welcomed the change in the president’s tone. Trump’s criticism of the Fed chair had fueled concerns about the central bank’s autonomy, leading to sharp losses in U.S. assets, including stocks and the dollar, earlier in the week. Megacap tech stocks rose broadly, with Nvidia gaining 5.1%. Apple and Meta Platforms rose 3.6% and 6.7%, respectively… The S&P 500 posted one new 52-week high and two new lows, while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 25 new highs and 12 new lows. ‎ MacDailyNews Take: Axing Jerome “Months Late” Powell, Mr. Transitory, before his end date on May 15, 2026 would be a good thing for Wall Street, but the economy and the stock market will survive 12 months of yet another feckless, often-wrong Fed Chair. As we wrote in February 2023, “When certain quarters, including the Fed, delude themselves and others that ‘inflation is transitory’ and waste at least a year before doing a mere portion of what is necessary* (interest rate hikes), the price will be paid for being delusional and late.” ‘Tis best to get a handle on inflation, if you know how, while you still can. – MacDailyNews, May 11, 2021 *Stop the misguided crusade against domestic energy production and profligate federal spending and inflation will be stopped dead in its tracks. It’s not difficult. – MacDailyNews, May 11, 2022 For new generations, sometimes tough lessons have to be retaught and learned the hard way. As we go through this, remember: It’s always darkest before the dawn. – MacDailyNews, July 14, 2022 After drifting around aimlessly for far too long on the U.S.S. Transitory, the delusional Fed is laughably too little, too late.

Title: Nvidia investors should watch out for this key risk that could trigger a double-digit semiconductor stock plunge in the next 12 months

It's been a rough few months for investors who bought into the AI trade last year. If general recession fears and a trade war stifling the chip industry weren't enough bad news, investment research company BCA Research is ringing the alarm bell on an even bigger risk: a full-blown war between the US and China over Taiwan. In a recent report by two of the firm's strategists, Marko Papic and Matt Gertken, BCA Research doubled the odds of a full-scale conflict between the two countries in the next 12 months from 5% to 10%. While most Liberation Day reciprocal tariffs have been paused, the tariff rate on Chinese goods remains at a whopping 145%. And while Trump on Wednesday announced plans to soften his stance against China, no concrete details about deescalating tariffs have been released. "President Trump has just raised tariffs to levels that, if sustained, will halt US-China trade. Combined with export controls, looming investment restrictions, and various other existing or threatened sanctions, the US strategy will start to look like an all-out economic war against Beijing," Papic and Gertken wrote. "That would give Chinese policymakers significant domestic cover for retaliation that goes beyond trade." Essentially, Trump's tough negotiating tactics have put the US at an elevated risk of war by backing China into an economic corner, and China might have enough at stake to incite a military conflict, BCA Research believes. US GDP growth is highly dependent on consumer activity, but that's not the case for China. While roughly two-thirds of the US economy consists of consumption expenditures, China's is 39%, making it more reliant on exports to grow its economy. Ed Yardeni, the president of Yardeni Research, recently echoed similar concerns around a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. "The Chinese economy is much more vulnerable than is the US economy to a trade war between the two superpowers," Yardeni wrote in a note last week. "President Xi might conclude that now is a good time to invade Taiwan since Trump has played his tariff card and Xi needs a diversion from the calamity about to befall his economy." BCA Research sees another 25% chance of a small-scale proxy war breaking out, for a cumulative 35% probability of some sort of geopolitical conflict playing out in the next 12 months. Taiwan plays a critical role in manufacturing advanced semiconductor chips that tech giants like Nvidia, Apple, and AMD depend on. If China feels threatened by Trump's tariff policy, it could retaliate by either blockading or invading Taiwan, cutting off vital resources for American companies. In the worst-case scenario, which BCA Research has dubbed "WWIII," expect to see a severe economic impact from a military conflict between the US and China. The firm predicts the S&P 500 would take a 40% hit in such a situation, led by plunges in semiconductor giants like Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor. "Much of Taiwan's most precious fixed asset investments — including its prized semiconductor fabs — would be destroyed by Taiwan itself or the US as Chinese forces approached, thus defeating the technological benefit of unification," Papic and Gertken wrote. In the case of a proxy war, such as if China launches a partial invasion on Taiwan, BCA Research predicts a 10% drawdown to the S&P 500. Investors shouldn't worry too much over the possibility of an all-out military conflict — BCA Research estimates there's a 65% chance that the status quo will prevail. But the fringe case's impact on markets is highly devastating and worth hedging against, Papic and Gertken believe. "Investors should consider deep out-of-the-money insurance against a calamitous event," wrote Papic and Gertken. "For example, bets on large double-digit declines in Taiwanese stocks, or TSMC or NVDA share prices." As an example, let's say Nvidia stock is trading at $100. If you're concerned about a military escalation that would seriously disrupt the company's business model, you could buy a put option with a strike price of $70 that expires in 12 months. Since $70 is far below the current price, the option will be deep out-of-the-money and cheap. In the worst-case scenario, you'll be able to sell Nvidia for $70 if the stock price dips below that level. The option itself also becomes more valuable, and can be sold for a profit. If the stock doesn't plunge, your options will expire and you'll forfeit the cost of the options, but it's a small price to pay for insurance, Papic and Gertken said. "Investors should buy insurance against this tail risk while it is cheap," they wrote. Another way to hedge against the US-China trade war is to increase your allocation to emerging market manufacturing companies, BCA recommended. Examples of emerging market funds include the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM) and the Schwab Emerging Markets Equity ETF (SCHE). Unsurprisingly, gold is another trusty hedge against geopolitical risk. BCA predicts the yellow metal will see a 40% boost in the case a full military conflict breaks out, and 10% in the case of a proxy war. Investors can get exposure to gold through funds like the Goldman Sachs Physical Gold ETF (AAAU). Get the latest Gold price here. Jump to

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, April 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RKLB) and reminds investors of the April 28, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Rocket Lab’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inglate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. Then, on March 26, 2025, Muddy Waters Research published a report (the “Muddy Waters Report”) concluding that AppLovin systematically used proprietary third-party data in ways that violated the terms of service of Facebook, Google, Snap, Reddit, as well as other platforms, potentially leading to backlash and service blocking and threatening the sustainability of AppLovin’s revenue growth. On this news, AppLovin’s stock price plummeted 20.1 percent, dropping from $327.62 to $261.70 per share on March 27, 2025.

Title: Tesla: A Long-Term Growth Play But Short-Term Challenges Remain

ByGuruFocus ByGuruFocus, Contributor. By Nabeel Bukhari Tesla, Inc. is surely a roller coaster for the weak of the heart. Despite the ups and downs in its stock price and some risks down the road, Tesla's long-term outlook remains intact. Its financial strength enables it to expand by investing in new technology. In fact, the company is working on some interesting prospects including but not limited to fully self-driving cars, robotaxis and humanoid robots. Tesla's smart innovations have some serious potential to revolutionize industries. At the same time, its energy business is also booming as more and more homes and businesses are adopting battery storage to ensure reliable power. That said, Tesla is way ahead in terms of valuation compared to its peers and to be honest, the stock is way too expensive. Speculation drives most of the company's current growth. The stock has already priced in a lot of future success and expectations are sky high. For now, it is be prudent to sit tight and see if Tesla can truly execute it's grand vision before jumping in. Tesla has essentially become a world in itself, and 2025 is about to be a year that defines its future. This is evident through its investments in areas including artificial intelligence (AI), self-driving technology and energy storage. It is doing so while managing vehicle margins via cost efficiencies. However, the amount of money spent on these innovations might become a barrier to short-term profitability. TSLA stock jumped 92% last year between November and December. Since then, it has plummeted 38%, as a reminder that hype alone won't keep up growth. Tesla Inc Share Price Chart Nonetheless, Tesla's robust track record is a testament that it has been resilient in the long haul. Its stock has multiplied more than 16 times in the past decade. This reinforces that it is capable enough to push boundaries. The real challenge now is to convert its vision into reality. Investors should allow it some time to fulfill its overly ambitious vision, before taking any major steps. An AI empire beyond just cars: Tesla has injected almost $5 billion in AI and intends to continue the efforts. A significant advancement for the company is Cortex which is a 50,000 GPU training cluster. It will be used to speed up Tesla's neural networks as it nears true autonomy. In actual fact, Tesla intends to debut an unsupervised version of its Full Self-Driving in California this year. This means that no human driver would be required. Tesla already applied for a TCP Permit in November 2024 and has officially received approval from California (though this is the first approval in the series of approvals). Moreover, the big moves for Tesla involve fully autonomous Cybercab and Robovan. Both were revealed in October last year by the company. It is still not sure whether they will operate on FSD or any new technology. Yet, I think that we are getting close to a major shift and it would be amazing if Tesla pulls it off and makes it mainstream. It would surely be a high margin, software driven business. Unlike Lyft and Uber, which are still dependent on human drivers, Tesla's approach will remove that cost entirely. It means vehicles would operate non-stop and generate revenue around the clock. Humanoids and the future of automation: Of course, there is Optimus. Tesla already has two Optimus humanoid robots working on its factory floor. Meanwhile, an improved version will be launched later this year. The Mass production of the technology is targeted to reach 10,000 units by 2025. Optimus is designed for use on both industrial and home fronts, with plans to bring costs down below $20,000 over time. Elon Musk believes that it has the potential to generate a staggering $10 trillion in the long run. Still, challenges remain. In the past, humanoid robots have constantly faced the problem of both flexibility and affordability. Tesla's AI expertise and production scale give it a real shot at making Optimus real in the coming years. So, even though Musk's vision of Optimus helping on Mars is a long way away, automation will be critical to the colonization of space. Promising growth ahead, but supply challenges still loom: While car production remains the backbone of the business, energy is turning into a formidable growth engine. Tesla's energy division just completed 113% YOY revenue growth. Its revenue grew from $1.44 billion to $3.06 billion, thus surpassing $10 billion in total for 2024. Energy storage is the real force behind this surge. Megapack's skyrocketing demand led to a record 11 gigawatt-hours deployment by Tesla in 2024. The Megapacks are manufactured at dedicated facilities known as Megafactory (Lathrop, CA, Shanghai, China, and Houston, TX in 2025). The target is around 100 GWh by 2026, and each Megafactory produces 40 GWh. The business expects at least 50% growth this year as demand for grid-scale storage solutions develops. However, the battery supply constraints, indeed, continue to be a critical bottleneck for Tesla in 2025. At the same time, battery demand is outstripping supply as the company scales up production of Megapacks and next generation vehicles. That would be a handicap to Tesla as production growth can slowdown due to this. It can result in delays in major projects like CyberCab and Optimus. The end of Q4 2024 brought Tesla both difficult situations and major developments. Revenue growth remained slow while costs mounted as the company maintained its forward momentum. Without further ado, let's get into the nitty-gritty. Strong balance sheet and smart growth: The increase of assets at a faster rate than liabilities leads to higher equity. It is a positive sign for investors. Tesla maintains an impressive standing on its balance sheet report. It has a mind-boggling $37 billion in cash and marketable securities which creates a net cash balance of about $30 billion. This big reserve allows Tesla to constantly put efforts into pursuing its visionary initiatives. Tesla Balance Sheet Breakdown Chart But certainly, there is another important factor which is debt. Tesla has $8.2 billion in debt but only $4.3 billion of it is in the form of asset-backed notes. Instead of using its core business as the source of its liquidity, Tesla tapped its lease portfolio to issue debt. This made the company convert future lease payments into immediately available cash. As such, the lease cash flows fully support this debt and hence reduce financial strain. Meanwhile, the retained earnings kept on growing. They rose 116% from 2022 to 2023 and 26% more in 2024. This leads to them being over $35 billion now. This is different from most companies that distribute profits to shareholders in the form of dividends or buybacks. This goes to show how Tesla is dedicated to reinvesting for lasting growth. Takeaway? Tesla has ample cash reserves and a well-managed debt structure. It is also growing retained earnings to have the best financial stability and future expansion. Growth Under Cost Pressures: Tesla's total revenue only grew 2% to $25.7 billion from $23.35 billion in Q4 2024. Meanwhile, it was up just 1% to $97.6 billion from $96.7 billion for the full year. Most of this sluggish growth was a result of a lower average selling price for the S3XY lineup and more attractive financing options to help keep demand. These strategies enhanced the unit sales but at the cost of squeezing margins. On the cost side, it was able to achieve all-time lows in the cost of goods sold (COGS) per vehicle, coming in at $35,000 in Q4 2024. That said, high operating expenses wiped this out since the company continued to pour hefty investments into AI and R&D projects. While these initiatives are important for long-term innovation, they also bring near-term pressure on profitability. In addition, a one-time charge of $624 million for restructuring further reduced earnings. It is pertinent to mention here that a $5.9 billion deferred tax asset benefit artificially inflated the company's net income in 2023. Thus, the YOY comparison would not be fair in this regard. Spending big and building for the future: Tesla's net cash from operations has surged significantly over the past half-decade. Nevertheless, the growth in 2023 and 2024 has flatlined, mainly because of growing capital expenditures and inventory buildup. In the past 12 months, the company has been spending heavily on innovations already mentioned above. The spending has boomed from $1.3 billion in 2019 to $11.6 billion in 2025. These heavy investments have not hindered Tesla from producing a strong free cash flow of $3.6 billion in 2023 and $3.5 billion in 2024. Though this indicates a leveling off of cash generation. The positive aspect is that Tesla can sustain cash generation as costs go up. This stability implies that the company is in the early days of high burn growth, and is now moving into a more self-sustaining model. Meanwhile, Tesla is cutting debt and is heading toward financial stability instead of relying on external funding. Cutting cash from external funding is evident as net cash from financing decreased from $9.9 billion in 2020 to a mere $3.8 billion in 2024. This shift of capital represents increasing financial independence towards a long-term stable existence. Additionally, Tesla has seen over $40 billion in proceeds from investments between 2022 and 2024. It is a significant surplus of cash. Such a large cash influx shows that Tesla does not solely rely on operating cash flow to fuel its aggressive expansion. That said, the seemingly attractive financial figures do not show how timing elements fuel most of Tesla's operational cash flow growth. If things turn unfavorable in terms of working capital such as inventory accumulation or slower payments collection. It would have the potential to create strain on its future cash flow situation. Additionally, Tesla maintains significant investments in new battery facilities and gigafactories that drive net cash used for investing to stay high, especially during the fourth quarter. The trend of high capital expenditures will continue in the near term because its expansion activities depend on ongoing spending. The premium valuation of Tesla reflects a massive disconnect from its peers. TSLA stock trades at a significant premium to its tech and auto industry peers given its forward P/E of 98.89x. Microsoft and Apple trade at 29.46x and 27.89x respectively. With a strong leadership in AI, Nvidia trades at 24.45x. Despite strong fundamentals, Meta trades at only 21.21x and Amazon trades at 28.85x. Last but not least, Alphabet trades at a modest 17.74x, making it the most affordable stock in the group. It signals that Tesla is actually valued more like a high-growth tech company rather than a traditional automaker. Tesla Valuation Metrics Subsequently, Tesla's potential for execution of what it is betting on will finally decide whether it was ever worth what it's been valued at. Tesla's success would lead to the company even outperforming Nvidia's AI level growth. However, accepting its premium pricing is valid for those who believe in its anticipated transformation. According to GuruFocus, the average price target for Tesla is $296.76 based on the one-year price targets offered by 44 analysis, an upside of approximately 20.28%. The estimates vary widely from $19.01 to $465.70 which indicate the speculative potential of the stock. Based on GuruFocus estimates, the estimated GF Value for Tesla Inc in one year is $289.51, suggesting a upside of +17.34% from the current price of $246.73. Tesla 12 Month Price Targets Tesla's expansion into energy, pushing AI, and self-driving are nice growth drivers to unlock plenty of value. However, the margins are still under pressure and the demand is still fluctuating. In my point of view, Tesla is a long-term growth story centered around AI, self-driving and energy expansion. Within a year, I expect Tesla to range between $280 and $320. Meanwhile, if full self-driving gets approved for regulatory use and energy storage scales faster than expected, the stock would be able to break through the $350 barrier. Potential investors should exercise caution when investing at Tesla's current high market price because of existing uncertainties. Tesla remains a battleground stock, between not only retail investors, but also among guru investors and insiders. Latest guru trades display a split view. At the end of 2024, Ken Fisher , Jefferies Group, and Ray Dalio all increased their TSLA positions, with Jefferies’ position jumping to over a solid 1,700% to show strong belief in the story behind Tesla’s innovation. However, leading investors such as Baillie Gifford, Cathie Wood, and Ron Baron reduced their holding, presumably to cash in on the stock's quick spike. The divergence reflects other uncertainty around the company's short-term performance and long-term strategy, especially after geopolitical tensions and tariff shocks that knocked billions off its market cap in recent months. Tesla Number of Guru Trades The absence of insider activity, or the lack thereof, is what adds a note of caution. As it can be seen in the chart below, Tesla has not experienced a single insider buy in the past three years. On the contrary, about 61 million shares have been sold. The sheer volume and total lack of purchases raises questions. This may indicate that those closest to the business think the stock is fairly valued or even stretched at today's levels. Tesla Insider Buys and Sells Volume That said, Tesla is a long-term story, but this combination of guru hesitation and insider selling suggests that for now, investors are better off simply hanging onto any current position than jumping in and buying at the current levels. More prudent path right now would be waiting for greater clarity around margins, AI execution, and demand stabilization. The growth story of Tesla remains intact because the company continues advancing its AI systems and self-driving technology and energy sector expansion initiatives. The current stock valuation requires you to exercise caution because multiple short-term uncertainties exist concerning future demands together with profit margins and operational execution. Tesla presents significant potential across several sectors but premium price points and conflicting signals between insiders and analysts suggest that one should hold the current positions at this time.

ByGuruFocus ByGuruFocus, Contributor. By Nabeel Bukhari Tesla, Inc. is surely a roller coaster for the weak of the heart. Despite the ups and downs in its stock price and some risks down the road, Tesla's long-term outlook remains intact. Its financial strength enables it to expand by investing in new technology. In fact, the company is working on some interesting prospects including but not limited to fully self-driving cars, robotaxis and humanoid robots. Tesla's smart innovations have some serious potential to revolutionize industries. At the same time, its energy business is also booming as more and more homes and businesses are adopting battery storage to ensure reliable power. That said, Tesla is way ahead in terms of valuation compared to its peers and to be honest, the stock is way too expensive. Speculation drives most of the company's current growth. The stock has already priced in a lot of future success and expectations are sky high. For now, it is be prudent to sit tight and see if Tesla can truly execute it's grand vision before jumping in. Tesla has essentially become a world in itself, and 2025 is about to be a year that defines its future. This is evident through its investments in areas including artificial intelligence (AI), self-driving technology and energy storage. It is doing so while managing vehicle margins via cost efficiencies. However, the amount of money spent on these innovations might become a barrier to short-term profitability. TSLA stock jumped 92% last year between November and December. Since then, it has plummeted 38%, as a reminder that hype alone won't keep up growth. Tesla Inc Share Price Chart Nonetheless, Tesla's robust track record is a testament that it has been resilient in the long haul. Its stock has multiplied more than 16 times in the past decade. This reinforces that it is capable enough to push boundaries. The real challenge now is to convert its vision into reality. Investors should allow it some time to fulfill its overly ambitious vision, before taking any major steps. An AI empire beyond just cars: Tesla has injected almost $5 billion in AI and intends to continue the efforts. A significant advancement for the company is Cortex which is a 50,000 GPU training cluster. It will be used to speed up Tesla's neural networks as it nears true autonomy. In actual fact, Tesla intends to debut an unsupervised version of its Full Self-Driving in California this year. This means that no human driver would be required. Tesla already applied for a TCP Permit in November 2024 and has officially received approval from California (though this is the first approval in the series of approvals). Moreover, the big moves for Tesla involve fully autonomous Cybercab and Robovan. Both were revealed in October last year by the company. It is still not sure whether they will operate on FSD or any new technology. Yet, I think that we are getting close to a major shift and it would be amazing if Tesla pulls it off and makes it mainstream. It would surely be a high margin, software driven business. Unlike Lyft and Uber, which are still dependent on human drivers, Tesla's approach will remove that cost entirely. It means vehicles would operate non-stop and generate revenue around the clock. Humanoids and the future of automation: Of course, there is Optimus. Tesla already has two Optimus humanoid robots working on its factory floor. Meanwhile, an improved version will be launched later this year. The Mass production of the technology is targeted to reach 10,000 units by 2025. Optimus is designed for use on both industrial and home fronts, with plans to bring costs down below $20,000 over time. Elon Musk believes that it has the potential to generate a staggering $10 trillion in the long run. Still, challenges remain. In the past, humanoid robots have constantly faced the problem of both flexibility and affordability. Tesla's AI expertise and production scale give it a real shot at making Optimus real in the coming years. So, even though Musk's vision of Optimus helping on Mars is a long way away, automation will be critical to the colonization of space. Promising growth ahead, but supply challenges still loom: While car production remains the backbone of the business, energy is turning into a formidable growth engine. Tesla's energy division just completed 113% YOY revenue growth. Its revenue grew from $1.44 billion to $3.06 billion, thus surpassing $10 billion in total for 2024. Energy storage is the real force behind this surge. Megapack's skyrocketing demand led to a record 11 gigawatt-hours deployment by Tesla in 2024. The Megapacks are manufactured at dedicated facilities known as Megafactory (Lathrop, CA, Shanghai, China, and Houston, TX in 2025). The target is around 100 GWh by 2026, and each Megafactory produces 40 GWh. The business expects at least 50% growth this year as demand for grid-scale storage solutions develops. However, the battery supply constraints, indeed, continue to be a critical bottleneck for Tesla in 2025. At the same time, battery demand is outstripping supply as the company scales up production of Megapacks and next generation vehicles. That would be a handicap to Tesla as production growth can slowdown due to this. It can result in delays in major projects like CyberCab and Optimus. The end of Q4 2024 brought Tesla both difficult situations and major developments. Revenue growth remained slow while costs mounted as the company maintained its forward momentum. Without further ado, let's get into the nitty-gritty. Strong balance sheet and smart growth: The increase of assets at a faster rate than liabilities leads to higher equity. It is a positive sign for investors. Tesla maintains an impressive standing on its balance sheet report. It has a mind-boggling $37 billion in cash and marketable securities which creates a net cash balance of about $30 billion. This big reserve allows Tesla to constantly put efforts into pursuing its visionary initiatives. Tesla Balance Sheet Breakdown Chart But certainly, there is another important factor which is debt. Tesla has $8.2 billion in debt but only $4.3 billion of it is in the form of asset-backed notes. Instead of using its core business as the source of its liquidity, Tesla tapped its lease portfolio to issue debt. This made the company convert future lease payments into immediately available cash. As such, the lease cash flows fully support this debt and hence reduce financial strain. Meanwhile, the retained earnings kept on growing. They rose 116% from 2022 to 2023 and 26% more in 2024. This leads to them being over $35 billion now. This is different from most companies that distribute profits to shareholders in the form of dividends or buybacks. This goes to show how Tesla is dedicated to reinvesting for lasting growth. Takeaway? Tesla has ample cash reserves and a well-managed debt structure. It is also growing retained earnings to have the best financial stability and future expansion. Growth Under Cost Pressures: Tesla's total revenue only grew 2% to $25.7 billion from $23.35 billion in Q4 2024. Meanwhile, it was up just 1% to $97.6 billion from $96.7 billion for the full year. Most of this sluggish growth was a result of a lower average selling price for the S3XY lineup and more attractive financing options to help keep demand. These strategies enhanced the unit sales but at the cost of squeezing margins. On the cost side, it was able to achieve all-time lows in the cost of goods sold (COGS) per vehicle, coming in at $35,000 in Q4 2024. That said, high operating expenses wiped this out since the company continued to pour hefty investments into AI and R&D projects. While these initiatives are important for long-term innovation, they also bring near-term pressure on profitability. In addition, a one-time charge of $624 million for restructuring further reduced earnings. It is pertinent to mention here that a $5.9 billion deferred tax asset benefit artificially inflated the company's net income in 2023. Thus, the YOY comparison would not be fair in this regard. Spending big and building for the future: Tesla's net cash from operations has surged significantly over the past half-decade. Nevertheless, the growth in 2023 and 2024 has flatlined, mainly because of growing capital expenditures and inventory buildup. In the past 12 months, the company has been spending heavily on innovations already mentioned above. The spending has boomed from $1.3 billion in 2019 to $11.6 billion in 2025. These heavy investments have not hindered Tesla from producing a strong free cash flow of $3.6 billion in 2023 and $3.5 billion in 2024. Though this indicates a leveling off of cash generation. The positive aspect is that Tesla can sustain cash generation as costs go up. This stability implies that the company is in the early days of high burn growth, and is now moving into a more self-sustaining model. Meanwhile, Tesla is cutting debt and is heading toward financial stability instead of relying on external funding. Cutting cash from external funding is evident as net cash from financing decreased from $9.9 billion in 2020 to a mere $3.8 billion in 2024. This shift of capital represents increasing financial independence towards a long-term stable existence. Additionally, Tesla has seen over $40 billion in proceeds from investments between 2022 and 2024. It is a significant surplus of cash. Such a large cash influx shows that Tesla does not solely rely on operating cash flow to fuel its aggressive expansion. That said, the seemingly attractive financial figures do not show how timing elements fuel most of Tesla's operational cash flow growth. If things turn unfavorable in terms of working capital such as inventory accumulation or slower payments collection. It would have the potential to create strain on its future cash flow situation. Additionally, Tesla maintains significant investments in new battery facilities and gigafactories that drive net cash used for investing to stay high, especially during the fourth quarter. The trend of high capital expenditures will continue in the near term because its expansion activities depend on ongoing spending. The premium valuation of Tesla reflects a massive disconnect from its peers. TSLA stock trades at a significant premium to its tech and auto industry peers given its forward P/E of 98.89x. Microsoft and Apple trade at 29.46x and 27.89x respectively. With a strong leadership in AI, Nvidia trades at 24.45x. Despite strong fundamentals, Meta trades at only 21.21x and Amazon trades at 28.85x. Last but not least, Alphabet trades at a modest 17.74x, making it the most affordable stock in the group. It signals that Tesla is actually valued more like a high-growth tech company rather than a traditional automaker. Tesla Valuation Metrics Subsequently, Tesla's potential for execution of what it is betting on will finally decide whether it was ever worth what it's been valued at. Tesla's success would lead to the company even outperforming Nvidia's AI level growth. However, accepting its premium pricing is valid for those who believe in its anticipated transformation. According to GuruFocus, the average price target for Tesla is $296.76 based on the one-year price targets offered by 44 analysis, an upside of approximately 20.28%. The estimates vary widely from $19.01 to $465.70 which indicate the speculative potential of the stock. Based on GuruFocus estimates, the estimated GF Value for Tesla Inc in one year is $289.51, suggesting a upside of +17.34% from the current price of $246.73. Tesla 12 Month Price Targets Tesla's expansion into energy, pushing AI, and self-driving are nice growth drivers to unlock plenty of value. However, the margins are still under pressure and the demand is still fluctuating. In my point of view, Tesla is a long-term growth story centered around AI, self-driving and energy expansion. Within a year, I expect Tesla to range between $280 and $320. Meanwhile, if full self-driving gets approved for regulatory use and energy storage scales faster than expected, the stock would be able to break through the $350 barrier. Potential investors should exercise caution when investing at Tesla's current high market price because of existing uncertainties. Tesla remains a battleground stock, between not only retail investors, but also among guru investors and insiders. Latest guru trades display a split view. At the end of 2024, Ken Fisher , Jefferies Group, and Ray Dalio all increased their TSLA positions, with Jefferies’ position jumping to over a solid 1,700% to show strong belief in the story behind Tesla’s innovation. However, leading investors such as Baillie Gifford, Cathie Wood, and Ron Baron reduced their holding, presumably to cash in on the stock's quick spike. The divergence reflects other uncertainty around the company's short-term performance and long-term strategy, especially after geopolitical tensions and tariff shocks that knocked billions off its market cap in recent months. Tesla Number of Guru Trades The absence of insider activity, or the lack thereof, is what adds a note of caution. As it can be seen in the chart below, Tesla has not experienced a single insider buy in the past three years. On the contrary, about 61 million shares have been sold. The sheer volume and total lack of purchases raises questions. This may indicate that those closest to the business think the stock is fairly valued or even stretched at today's levels. Tesla Insider Buys and Sells Volume That said, Tesla is a long-term story, but this combination of guru hesitation and insider selling suggests that for now, investors are better off simply hanging onto any current position than jumping in and buying at the current levels. More prudent path right now would be waiting for greater clarity around margins, AI execution, and demand stabilization. The growth story of Tesla remains intact because the company continues advancing its AI systems and self-driving technology and energy sector expansion initiatives. The current stock valuation requires you to exercise caution because multiple short-term uncertainties exist concerning future demands together with profit margins and operational execution. Tesla presents significant potential across several sectors but premium price points and conflicting signals between insiders and analysts suggest that one should hold the current positions at this time.

Title: Elon Musk Gets $10 Billion Richer As Tesla Stock Rallies On ‘Mea Culpa’ —Despite Brutal Earnings

Full Content:
The world’s richest person got much richer Wednesday as shares of Elon Musk’s car company Tesla soared following the company’s first-quarter earnings update—which offered little encouragement in its traditional financial results, but gave investors what they long yearned for: Musk recommitting to Tesla after months of paying his near undivided attention to the White House. Elon Musk attends a White House cabinet meeting in February. Musk’s net worth climbed $7.5 billion to $369.2 billion Wednesday, according to our latest calculations, extending his lead over the next wealthiest person, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, to $170 billion. The spike came as shares of Tesla shot up 5% to $251 in response to its late Tuesday Q1 report, which was ugly by most metrics, as profits and revenues both came in below consensus forecasts at multiyear lows. Tesla certainly got a boost from a broader rally tied to President Donald Trump’s relenting on his China trade standoff and his threats to fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell – the tech-heavy Nasdaq soared 3% – but the rally largely came as Musk confirmed his dedication to Tesla. “Mea culpa Elon” was the tone struck by the Tesla chief on the earnings call, remarked Evercore ISI analysts led by Chris McNally, as Musk said he’ll be “allocating far more” of his time to the company starting next month. That was music to the ears of many investors and analysts who had expressed concerns about the extensive time Musk spent as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) – and the associated damage to Tesla’s brand as Musk’s outspoken politics rubbed many potential customers the wrong way. In addition to Musk’s rededication to Tesla, also helping catalyze the stock rally were the confirmation of June launch plans for the driverless “robotaxi” and the beginning of production of lower-cost electric vehicles during the first half of this year, according to Guggenheim analyst Ronald Jewsikow. “I'll continue to spend a day or two per week on government matters for as long as the President would like me to do so,” Musk said during Tuesday’s earnings call. Musk described Tesla as the “least affected car company” by Trump’s tariffs, but the senior advisor to the president again made clear he disagrees with Trump on his signature trade policy. “I've been on the record many times saying that I believe lower tariffs are generally a good idea for prosperity,” said Musk, continuing the tariff “decision is fundamentally up to” Trump. “So I'll continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs, but that's all I can do,” shrugged Musk. Tesla stock is still down almost 40% year-to-date, far worse than the S&P 500’s 8% decline as Trump’s oft-changing tariffs led to increased concerns of a recession. Musk donated $288 million toward Trump election causes, making him the largest political donor of the 2024 election cycle. Musk’s role as the head of DOGE, in which he oversaw cost-cutting efforts including mass federal government layoffs, brought significant backlash to Tesla, as sales slumped globally as protests and vandalism spread. In addition to his roles at DOGE and Tesla, Musk is also the CEO of aerospace giant SpaceX, generative AI startup xAI and several other companies. Tesla faced a “code red” situation if Musk didn’t recommit to the company, warned Wedbush analyst Dan Ives ahead of earnings. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: The UK’s Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women

Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access Even the self-described feminists celebrating the Supreme Court’s attempt to banish trans people from womanhood will pay a heavy price. Trans rights supporters march in London after the UK Supreme Court’s anti-trans ruling. The UK Supreme Court’s transphobic ruling on the definition of “woman” last week is a defeat for all women—even, ultimately, the self-described feminists celebrating it, and the women who will gain in the short term from their alliance with the carceral state. Following the ruling, J.K. Rowling, the world’s richest author and perhaps its most prominent transphobe, tweeted a photo of herself enjoying a cigar and a bourbon on her $15 million superyacht, toasting what she called “TERF VE Day,” in reference to the acronym “trans-exclusionary radical feminism” and the surrender of German military operations that heralded “Victory in Europe” 80 years ago. “I love it when a plan comes together,” Rowling added. Rowling had a very particular reason to celebrate; she personally bankrolled the legal campaign by the anti-trans group For Women Scotland that led to the Supreme Court decision. But she was not alone; all over the world, Rowling’s fellow cisfeminist activists popped champagne and congratulated themselves on “reality winning,” imagining themselves, too, perhaps, to be victorious powers in World War II, triumphant over fascism. Try as they might to wrap themselves in the antifascist flag, though, these activists are hailing a decision that represents a ghoulish culmination of fascistic “family values” agitation in women’s name—something it achieves by stomping on a tiny, ultra-vulnerable minority. This is nothing new, either; for over two decades, at the highest levels of Britain’s state and cultural establishment, the articulation of cissexist policy has flowed not only from antifeminist politicians’ lips but also from trans-exclusionary radical feminists (TERFs), who have used every conceivable queerphobic and fascist trope against trans women—pervert, groomer, pedophile, fetishist, rapist, barbarian, deceiver, interloper, parasite—to achieve their end. The Supreme Court’s 88-page judgment declares that trans women whose affirmed gender had been legally recognized by the UK government will no longer be considered women under existing equality laws. Suddenly, in other words, the document that someone living in that country has used for the past 21 years to secure the state’s recognition of their (changed) sex—“for all purposes”—no longer applies in many segregated contexts such as sports, hospital wards, and university accommodation. It no longer protects trans dignity on public boards, either, which is what the For Women Scotland appeal was originally about: The court, in its own words, was considering “whether the appointment of a trans woman with a GRC [Gender Recognition Certificate] counts as the appointment of a woman.” Last Wednesday, Lord Patrick Hodge, deputy president of the Supreme Court, announced that no, trans women don’t count. Trans people make up roughly half a percent of Britain’s population, and only a tiny fraction of them—about 9,000—have acquired the aforementioned certificate since it was made available in 2004 following the passage of the country’s Gender Recognition Act. But the ruling now elevates them to the status of an existential threat. Astonishingly, the ruling specifies that what it calls “women living in the male gender”—i.e., trans men, and cis women whose appearance is deemed masculine—“could also be excluded” alongside cis men, from women’s spaces. “Not being allowed into the mens by rule does not mean you have the right to go into the ladies,” clarified the leading anti-trans campaigner Maya Forstater; “That may seem unfair, but these are life choices people make. If you make extreme efforts to look like a man don’t be surprised if you are denied entrance to ladies.” Forstater’s comments underscore the ultimate goal of TERFs and other transphobes: to expunge trans people from public life. Predictably, the all-white, majority-male panel of judges, who heard from no trans people or groups at all in connection with the case, insist that their destruction of trans women’s legal standing qua women vis-à-vis the UK Equality Act is not a defeat for the trans community at all. Trans people in Britain are still protected as trans people by a separate provision in the Equality Act, so the apologists argue; thus, no one loses. But given that institutions are already scrambling to impose penalties on all and any persons suspected of trespassing on the “wrong” side of sex-segregated facilities—if for whatever reason they cannot, or will not, provide proof of assigned sex at birth—it’s unclear to me if anyone really believes this. The fact, already now, is this: If I am perceived not to be what I say I am, and I don’t have the relevant documents, I can be strip-searched by male transport police, and legally barred from single-sex spaces. Trans people will, of course, continue to live lives of authenticity, but make no mistake: Everyone’s bodily autonomy is curtailed (especially those of us who, cis or trans, are poor, undocumented, racialized, intersex, gender non-conforming) by the cisfeminist diktat against non-cis humanity’s existence in public. The decades-long coordinated attack on trans rights paves the way for the unraveling of the Equality Act as a whole, and the dismantling of every (limited but important) legislative gain for social justice achieved since 1998’s explosive “Lawrence Inquiry” into institutional and police racism in the UK. The playbook is now all set to merge with the American one “defending women against gender ideology extremism” (per the White House’s executive order of January, which seeks to make human sexuation, as it were, great again). Hitherto, to suggest as much has typically incurred incandescent indignation on the part of feminism’s Brexiteers—the self-styled anti-woke left-liberal single-issue cissexists whose reactionary brand has long been hegemonic in the UK. This camp has long promoted itself as profoundly un-American. But, increasingly, its hatred of the Black, abolitionist, gender-abundant, utopian international left supersedes its patriotism, leading it to align itself with MAGA (unlikely inheritor of the “true” feminism the left abandoned) without shame. The rationale offered for the retraction of trans people’s right to be men and women in society (rather than un-men and un-women) boils down to the word “biology.” Yet the word does not appear in the Equality Act, and the judge explicitly declines to define it, declaring that the “biological characteristics” corresponding to the “plain and unambiguous words [‘man’ and ‘woman’] are assumed to be self-explanatory and to require no further explanation.” As the archivist Morgan Page summarized it acidly, “apparently the UK Supreme Court will know women when they see them,” this being the litmus test for pornography put forward by the US Supreme Court in the 1960s. The comparison to obscenity law is no idle one. “Deep in the judgment,” noted the barrister Dave Renton, “is an idea of trans people as moral contaminants.” For half a century, the drive to purify womanhood of perversity has indeed undergirded the minority branch of Anglo American women’s liberationism that, in 2008, was dubbed “TERF.” (A better label than “TERFism,” in my view, would have been “cisfeminism” or “cultural feminism,” since there really is nothing radical about the ideology, even though it is feminist.) One lurid antecedent of the feminist misogyny—yes!—at the heart of TERFism is the ecofeminist theologian Mary Daly’s femmephobic 1978 screed Gyn/Ecology: the Meta-Ethics of Radical Feminism, which pours infinitely more contempt on femininity and “artificiality” than it does on patriarchy. Expounded via lynch mob–esque interventions in lesbian spaces by figures like Sheila Jeffreys in England and Robin Morgan in the United States, this fringe feminism was considered reactionary by most radical feminists already in 1973. Preferring the term “gender-critical,” 21st-century TERFs have protested for years that TERF is a misogynistic slur; still, the more of British society they’ve captured, the more they’ve grown content with the moniker. “Welcome to Team TERF,” gloats UnHerd every time an A-lister turns transphobe. “2023 is the year of the TERF,” declares the far-right rally Let Women Speak. “We will fight,” jokes Rowling in another revealing effort to claim Churchillian glory for her cause, “on the beaches of TERF Island.” The copious “strong borders” imagery readily reveals TERFism to be a female cultural nationalism or sexual nationalism, premised—Brexit-style—on the securitization of the tacitly white and innocent body politic against dysgenic gender “refugees.” The pogrom-inciting tenor of what has been called “the trans debate” was normalized from the get-go by feminism’s moral alibi and the nepotism of Britain’s commentariat class. The hyper-respectability of many of its ringleaders surely didn’t hurt, either. Helen Joyce, one of the most influential trans-annihilationists currently heralding the Supreme Court decision as a personal win, is a former editor at The Economist. Her buddy the celebrity anti-trans philosopher Kathleen Stock is a royally honored academic. Rowling, of course, is a national treasure. Meanwhile, the publishing industry has glutted itself on trans-“skeptic” books just asking questions—not just by Joyce and Stock—and these all receive rave reviews in the UK Guardian. (Back in 2018, the US office of that newspaper was even moved to denounce its British counterpart over its participation in the self-styled “feminist” moral panic.) The riddle of “TERF Island” continues to intrigue those international onlookers who intuit feminism and transphobia to be opposites. Unlike the supposedly very different—crassly “polarized” and “partisan”—makeup of the American fight for trans rights, in Britain it’s a point of pride that genteelly genocidal anti-gender-ism cuts across Conservative, Labour, and feminist milieus. (Right on cue, the Labour government hailed the Supreme Court decision, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer saying he was “really pleased” with the “clarity” it provided, and his spokesperson saying that Starmer no longer believes that trans women are women.) Hearteningly, on Saturday, the UK also saw widespread gigantic anti-TERF protests of the Supreme Court decision, suggesting some degree of popular rejection of the cissexist “common sense” that was explicitly deployed in the court. This epistemic pseudo-realism that we nowadays so often see violently invoked by figures as superficially disparate as J.K. Rowling and D.J. Trump—on matters ranging from woman-definition to immigration—is, to borrow from the historian Ann Stoler, a colonial common sense. This is also paradoxically why TERFism, like all fascist discourses and all imperial and settler-colonial horizons, imagines itself upside-down, as somehow preyed-upon, bullied, colonized, and at risk of genocidal erasure at the hands of the subjugated group it dehumanizes. More pressing matters than metaphysical and/or state recognition of one’s sex often preoccupy individuals in the trans community. The core scourges of trans life in the UK include: poverty, medical under-service, labor market exclusions, sexual violence, housing discrimination, and a media climate of brutal mockery, scapegoating, and stigma. Conversely, in the baseless narrative propagated via the British establishment’s long-standing hate fest around trans-ness, trans women constitute a powerful, sinister sexual threat to ladies, lesbians, and little boys and girls, all of whom are at the mercy of this phantasmic social plague of predatory and fetishistic “men” brandishing pieces of paper that falsely declare them female so as to access “single-sex spaces” where they don’t belong and carry out all manner of evil. (Trans men were usually, until now, an afterthought in TERF politics: harmless at best, traitors to womankind at worst. Thanks to For Women Scotland, though, they might not be able to legally pee in public at all.) In the multifaceted fight against fascism ahead of us, many voices will be raised to re-explain at length, again and again, why trans women are women and trans men are men. Debunking the bad sexological science that well-spoken eugenicists like Helen Joyce propound is certainly a worthwhile task, since it often dazzles the uninitiated and gives pause to the uncertain. But the more important priority, for my money, remains the refusal of TERFs’ very terrain of argument. John Nichols Greg Grandin Jeet Heer Sophie Lewis Feminism does not, and has never, in fact, required a definition of “woman.” To the contrary, while “enemy feminisms” (as I call them) have repeatedly attempted to ontologize and naturalize sex, other feminisms, over the centuries, have pursued the struggle against sexual hierarchy as an all-encompassing utopian endeavor whose present and future constituencies are necessarily moot: Much of revolutionary feminism, for example, remains agnostic about whether “women” will definitely exist after patriarchy, especially given how many female subjects—Indigenous, enslaved, disabled, queer, sex-working—have been excluded from womanhood in the past. Cisness brutalizes us all. The border guards of sex are the enemies of human liberation, and we fight them best by refusing to debate the fairness, let alone the accuracy, of their borders in the first place. “Womanhood is not assigned. It is lived, sacred, and sovereign,” as the joint statement by the Muslim-led feminist Transfuturist and Ad’iyah collectives following the Supreme Court ruling reminds us. “We do not and will never recognize the authority of any government court or institution to determine our legitimacy. They do not know us—and they can never name us.” Update: This piece originally said that the Supreme Court panel that issued the ruling was all-male. In fact, it was majority-male. The chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week. Trump’s catastrophic “Liberation Day” has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called “enemy aliens” are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire. At a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump’s intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account. In just the last month, we’ve published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration’s appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities. We also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections—like Wisconsin’s recent state Supreme Court race—that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can’t buy our democracy.

Title: Stock market today: Markets bounce after Trump says he won’t try to fire Fed Chair Powell

By STAN CHOE, AP Writer NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks rose Wednesday as a worldwide rally came back around to Wall Street after President Donald Trump appeared to back off his criticism of the Federal Reserve and his tough talk in his trade war. The S&P 500 climbed 1.7% and added to its big gain from Tuesday that more than made up for a steep loss on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 419 points, or 1.1%, and the Nasdaq composite gained 2.5%. Wall Street’s gains followed strong moves higher for stocks across much of Europe and Asia. They also continued a dizzying, up-and-down run for financial markets as investors struggle with how to react to so much uncertainty about what Trump will do with his economic policies. The market’s latest move was up in part because Trump said late Tuesday that he has “no intention” to fire the head of the Federal Reserve. Trump had been angry with Jerome Powell, whom Trump had called “a major loser,” because of the Fed’s hesitance to cut interest rates. Trump’s tough talk had frightened investors because the Fed is supposed to act independently, without pressure from politicians, so that it can make decisions that may be painful in the short term but are best for the long term. While a cut to interest rates by the Fed could give the economy a boost, it could also put upward pressure on inflation. Economists say Trump’s tariffs are likely both to slow the economy and to raise inflation, at least briefly. Trump may have recognized the market’s fear about a move against Powell. He may also be looking to keep someone around whom Trump could blame later if the economy does fall into a recession, according to Thierry Wizman, a strategist at Macquarie. “Indeed, if the Fed cuts its policy interest rates aggressively, Trump would have little excuse for a recession apart from the pugnacity of his tariff policies,” Wizman said. Markets also rose after Trump said late Tuesday that U.S. tariffs on imports coming from China could come down “substantially” from the current 145%. “It won’t be that high, not going to be that high,” Trump said. The hope along Wall Street has been that Trump would lower his tariffs after negotiating trade deals with other countries, and Trump said Tuesday he would be “very nice” to the world’s second-largest economy and not play hardball with Chinese President Xi Jinping. “There is an opportunity for a big deal here,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Wednesday. If Trump brings his tariffs down enough, investors believe a recession could be averted. U.S. businesses say they’re already feeling the effects of the trade war. A preliminary reading of U.S. business activity fell to a 16-month low, as the threat of tariffs helped push up prices charged for goods and services, according to S&P Global’s latest survey released Wednesday. All the uncertainty means one of the few predictions many along Wall Street are willing to make is that sharp swings for financial markets will continue for a while. The market will “more likely than not continue to be dictated by Trump’s latest whims regarding tariffs and trade,” said Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at KCM Trade. The S&P 500 remains 12.5% below its record set earlier this year after briefly dropping roughly 20% below the mark. Its swings have been coming not just day to day but also hour to hour as Trump and his administration’s officials continue to surprise markets. On Wednesday alone, the S&P 500 charged to a 3.4% gain in the morning, only to more than halve that rise as the day progressed. Trump’s latest comments had a relaxing effect on the bond market, where Treasury yields eased. It’s a turnaround from earlier this month, when spiking Treasury yields raised fears that Trump’s actions were scaring investors away from the United States and weakening the U.S. bond market’s reputation as one of the safest places to keep cash. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.38% from 4.41% late Tuesday. It dropped as low as 4.26% earlier in the morning. On Wall Street, Big Tech helped lead stock indexes higher. Nvidia rose 3.9% to claw back more of the sharp losses it took last week, when it said U.S. restrictions on exports of its H20 chips to China could hurt its first-quarter results by $5.5 billion. The chip company’s stock was the strongest single force lifting the S&P 500. Other stocks in the artificial-intelligence technology ecosystem also drove higher. Vertiv Holdings, which traces its roots to the industry’s first manufacturer of computer room air conditioning, jumped 8.5% after reporting stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It said it’s continuing to see accelerated demand from AI data centers. Super Micro Computer, a company that makes servers used in AI, rose 7.6%. Palantir Technologies, which offers an AI platform for customers, climbed 7.3%. Tesla revved 5.4% higher after CEO Elon Musk said he’ll spend less time in Washington and more time running his electric vehicle company after Tesla on late Tuesday reported a big drop in profits. It’s been struggling because of backlash against Musk’s efforts to lead cost-cutting efforts by the U.S. government. All told, the S&P 500 rose 88.10 points to 5,375.86. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 419.59 to 39,606.57, and the Nasdaq composite gained 407.63 to 16,708.05. In stock markets abroad, indexes jumped 2.1% in France, 2.4% in Hong Kong and 1.9% in Japan. Stocks in Shanghai were an exception, where they dipped 0.1%.

Title: US FTC Sues Uber For Charging Its Customers Without Consent
URL: https://www.medianama.com/2025/04/223-us-ftc-uber-customers-consent/
Time Published: 2025-04-23T12:30:27Z
Full Content:
MEDIANAMA Technology and policy in India The United States (US) Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed a lawsuit against ride-hailing application Uber on April 21 for allegedly charging customers for its Uber One subscription service, without their consent. The regulator has also argued that Uber failed to deliver on its promise of discounts and savings as part of Uber One. The ride-hailing app also allegedly made cancellation difficult despite stating that users can cancel the subscription anytime. To cancel Uber One, customers have to go through 12 different actions and go through âa maze of at least seven screens, if they guess the right paths to use, despite there being no mention of cancellation until the fourth screen.â FTC details that Uber auto-renews Uber One subscriptions and removes the cancellation button for the first 48 hours of the billing period. Even if the customer contacts customer service, the companyâs representatives take too long to process cancellation requests. This leads to the customer incurring a subscription renewal charge once again. The company enrolled customers into Uber One through a variety of ways, including push notifications, pop-ups in the Uber App and the Uber Eats App, and so on. Through push notifications, it offers people savings on their next ride or food delivery. FTC claims that one such offer the company often presents to its customers is 50% off a one-year membership, and when a customer tries to claim the offer, the company offers the service for free. âOnce consumers click the ‘Try for free’ button, they are immediately enrolled in Uber One and will be charged within four weeks, and on a recurring basis thereafter,â the FTC says. It emphasises that in none of these situations does the customer actively provide billing information for this subscription; instead, the company relies on the details it has stored if the customer has ever taken a ride with Uber. The FTC mentions that even before the four-week trial period ends, the company charges customers for the Uber One subscription. Further, if a customer is able to successfully cancel their free trial during the trial period, they immediately lose access to Uber One instead of losing access on the end date of the trial period. When the customer gets to the screen where they can cancel their subscription, Uber requires them to fill out a survey about the reason for cancellation. Till the customer clicks on one of the pre-specified answers to the survey question, it does not allow them to continue to cancel. If the customer clicks an answer and presses continue, a screen appears asking the customer if they want to consider pausing the membership instead. On this page, at the bottom of the page, a button labeled âPause Uber Oneâ appears prominently in a bright gray textbox, while beneath it is a button labeled âNo thanksâ in a subdued black textbox with white font. FTC specifies that neither of these buttons mention cancellation.Â âFurther, these buttons are flipped from their placement on the previous screen: On the previous screen, the button to click to proceed with cancellation is on the top, whereas, on this screen, the button to click to proceed with cancellation is now on the bottom. This design interface steers the consumer who wishes to cancel away from the action they are trying to take,â the FTC emphasises. Just like the US, in India as well, customers are facing the menace of dealing with allegedly deceptive practices. According to a survey by the consumer community platform LocalCircles, eight out of ten users have encountered dark patterns on ride-hailing services like Ola and Uber. These are deceptive practices that mislead customers into doing things they did not intend to do. Local Circles found that 78% of customers face higher waiting times than what the ride-hailing apps state on their service.Â âWe are glad to learn that the FTC has come down against the use of Dark Patterns by Uber. CCPA [Central Consumer Protection Agency] must take action on similar dark patterns concerns raised by consumers in India against taxi aggregators,â Sachin Taparia, Founder of LocalCircles, told MediaNama. Notably, in December last year, the Union Minister of Consumer Affairs, Pralhad Joshi, took stock of the reports surrounding ride-hailing apps charging people differently based on whether they booked rides through an Android or Apple device. He said that such differential pricing was prima facie an unfair trade practice, and that he has instructed the CCPA to examine price discrepancies in ride-hailing as well as other sectors.

Title: Rural Trump Voters Won’t Regret Their Vote Until Democrats Fight for Them

Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access Trump promised to address the opioid epidemic and restore small towns to health and prosperity. The president has betrayed those who placed their trust in him. The damage done just in the Trump administration’s first three months could fill the National Archives—assuming that department still exists. Many of those moves, including the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to a Salvadoran gulag, have been cruel and utterly unjust. Yet public support for Trump, though declining, remains stubbornly high among rural and working-class people. Some part of that support comes from his ability to couch everything he does as retaliation against liberal elites and a blow against the “rigged system” those elites helped create—a system that has undermined the values and livelihoods of ordinary working people. What will it take to stop Trump? It’s hard to predict how many of the people who supported Trump will turn against him because of the deportation of Garcia, student activists, and others. Those fights absolutely must continue and, we hope, will awaken more and more Americans to the dismantling of democracy. But there will always be those who are moved more by negative impacts to their daily lives. Job loss, hospital and school closures, a huge spike in the cost of essential goods—these are perennial deal-breakers that outlive the daily news cycle. As we suggested in our February column, reacting negatively to every radical idea Trump tosses out only solidifies the left’s position as defenders of the establishment—the very system tens of millions of Americans blame for their woes. We also believe that protesting the bad stuff only gets us so far, and that a positive vision for bettering the lives of rural and working people must be front and center. That said, when it does come to complaining loudly about the impact of Trump’s chaotic nihilism, we should focus on actions that have hurt large numbers of people, many of whom voted for Trump. We need to empathize with and acknowledge their struggles and help channel it into buyers’ remorse: “Trump has betrayed us” gets to the heart of the matter, whereas “Hands off!” smacks of a desire to restore the status quo. To stop Trump and reverse the assault on our economy and democracy, we need to redeploy some of our outrage to highlight how Trump’s actions are actually making the rigged system worse for the folks who put him in office: farmers, small businesses, coal miners, factory and blue-collar workers, consumers struggling with high prices and debt. Until our protest routinely includes the betrayal of folks like these, we have almost no chance of building the broad resistance coalition needed to reverse the disastrous course we’re on. With that in mind, we offer a few examples of Trump’s betrayals of rural and working-class people that we urge the left to prioritize, while also highlighting policies that will reverse those betrayals. Farmers, a core constituency for Trump, have been among the worst hit by his actions since taking office. For midsize and larger farmers, tariffs have prompted widespread anxiety that they are being squeezed from both ends: They’re facing higher costs on inputs like Canadian potash and steel for agricultural equipment, combined with a potentially dramatic loss of markets for soybeans, pork, and other commodities. On top of that, the dismantling of USAID amounts to nearly $2 billion in lost sales for US farmers. For smaller farmers, the termination of the Farm to School program and the Local Food Purchase Program for food banks have eliminated more than $1 billion in markets for fresh produce, while undermining the effort to provide healthy food to kids and people in need. And for farmers of all sizes, the suspension of contractual payments to farmers who’ve undertaken conservation, soil building, renewable energy, and other improvements to their farms is devastating. At least 30,000 of these farmers, who each expended tens of thousands of dollars based on USDA commitments, now find themselves in debt, unclear whether the promised reimbursements will ever materialize. But farmers aren’t the only rural folks getting screwed. Workers and small-business owners are increasingly worried about their livelihoods. Even before the latest round of tariffs, small-business confidence had declined for all three months of Trump’s presidency, with just one in five small business owners saying they expect sales and business conditions to improve in the near future. That uncertainty translates to less investment and hiring on the part of existing small businesses, and fewer new business start-ups. For workers in bigger companies, the surge in union organizing seen under the Biden administration is running into a wall of anti-worker actions from Trump. These include the firing of pro-worker members of the NLRB such as Jennifer Abruzzo, replaced by Crystal Carey, a lawyer whose firm represents notoriously anti-union Tesla and Amazon. Trump has also eliminated the $17 hourly minimum-wage requirement for federal contractors while working to completely dismantle unions representing federal workers. Sophie Lewis Elie Mystal John Nichols Books & the Arts / Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins Veterans, who are more likely to live in rural areas, will be hurt especially hard by the double kneecapping of Medicaid and Veterans Affairs (VA). The New York Times reports that, in addition to layoffs, the VA has been rocked by DOGE’s abrupt return-to-work policy. VA psychiatrists who have, for decades, counseled veterans remotely, now suddenly have to conduct their sessions in open cubicles that lack privacy. Many of them are quitting in protest. Fourteen million (nearly one in five) rural adults rely on Medicaid, a program Republicans aim to cut by $880 billion (roughly 20 percent of the program) over the next decade. Already struggling rural hospitals and clinics rely on Medicaid funds to stay afloat. Over the past 10 years, nearly 200 rural hospitals have closed, leaving their patients stranded a hundred or more miles from the nearest emergency room. Most of the rural hospitals that do remain open have eliminated their maternity wards. Slashing Medicaid spending will trigger further hospital closures and strain already paltry substance abuse, mental health, and Indian health services. And then there are the millions of consumers just struggling to make ends meet. They’ve been hit not only by continued rising prices—the inflation rate has been between 2.4 and 3 percent since Trump took office—but by the elimination of protections from junk fees from banks and credit card companies. Joined by the Republican-controlled Senate, the Trump administration is eliminating the $8 late-fee cap instituted toward the end of Biden’s term, allowing companies to once again charge exorbitant fees to people who don’t pay on time. The lower average incomes of rural and working-class people make high prices and junk banking fees all the more difficult to manage. Donald Trump carried rural America by a 40-point margin. He promised forgotten Americans he would unrig the system, address the opioid epidemic, and restore small towns to health and prosperity. Even more than most of his predecessors, Trump has betrayed those who placed their trust in him. Reversing the tidal wave of destruction he has unleashed requires that we on the left do something we should have done a long time ago: open our doors wide to the farmers, miners, truckers, house cleaners, automakers, and working folks—white, brown, and Black—who picked him over us. We don’t just need them to regain Congress in 2026. We need them to save our country. The chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week. Trump’s catastrophic “Liberation Day” has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called “enemy aliens” are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire. At a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump’s intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account. In just the last month, we’ve published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration’s appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities. We also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections—like Wisconsin’s recent state Supreme Court race—that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can’t buy our democracy.

Title: Elon Musk made big promises for Tesla, but 2 products are key to a rebound

Time Published: 2025-04-23T09:18:54Z
Full Content:
Elon Musk made some big, exciting promises to Tesla investors on the company's first-quarter earnings call Tuesday — but he said they won't start paying off until mid-2026 or later. In the hours after Tesla reported, analysts said they were waiting for two things: a highly anticipated cheaper car and for Tesla's robotaxi to hit the market. Tesla's robotaxi, which was unveiled in October, is a fully autonomous vehicle that could be hailed on a ride-sharing app like a cab. Tesla has also been teasing a cheaper car — without disclosing its model or features — since 2020. Tesla missed expectations for the first quarter, reporting a 71% drop in profits and a 9% drop in revenue. Vehicle sales in particular suffered, with auto revenues down 20% year over year and vehicle deliveries down 13%. The EV maker has faced protests, boycotts, and attacks in recent months over Musk's work with the White House DOGE office. Musk announced on the earnings call that he'd be stepping back from DOGE in May, good news to investors who had been concerned that Tesla wasn't getting enough of the billionaire's attention. Tesla stock jumped about 7% after hours, but it is down 41% this year. Cantor Fitzgerald analysts led by Andres Sheppard highlighted the robotaxi and cheaper model in a note following earnings. They added that regulatory approval for full self-driving and robotaxi remains a key risk for Tesla's stock price. A more affordable model could open up Tesla's potential customer base and help the company compete internationally against low-cost Chinese EVs. Thomas Monteiro, an analyst at Investing.com, said, "Tesla has room for significant improvement." "If this is the worst it gets for Tesla, then certainly there must be some upside for the stock once tailwinds, such as the highly-awaited cheaper model and the Robotaxi, finally hit the market later this year," he said in a note following the earnings call. Yun Mei, an EV analyst at China Great Wall Securities, emphasized the robotaxi business in an appearance on Bloomberg TV on Wednesday. She said that she has "strong faith" in Tesla's ability to launch robotaxis because Musk's ownership of xAI gives Tesla a "first mover advantage" in the physical AI space. But she estimated that robotaxis would take around three years to pay off. Tesla has declined offers to pair up with existing ride-hailing platforms like Uber to market its Cybercab business, which could delay its robotaxis becoming mainstream. In a note published on the day the Cybercab was unveiled in October, Jefferies analysts wrote that Tesla may struggle without a partner like Uber or Lyft. Tesla's biggest cheerleader said that these product launches require Musk's focus, which has recently been on DOGE. "This quarter was a disaster," Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a Tuesday appearance on CNBC after Tesla's earnings. "Everything that's going on here in terms of the opportunities around autonomous, lower cost vehicles, Cybercab, everything else — Musk needs to drive that," he added. Ives was more positive about Musk's decision to spend less time on DOGE. In a research note published after Tesla's analysts call, he hailed the move as a "turning point" for the company. "Musk recommitting as CEO at Tesla and basically leaving his DOGE role over the next month is the biggest and best possible news Tesla investors could have heard last night," Ives wrote, adding that Tesla had got its "biggest asset" back ahead of the crucial robotaxi and affordable EV launches. Musk also set some lofty goals for Tesla's autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots. Tesla is trying to diversify as EV sales have struggled. Slowing EV sales were an issue for Tesla even before Musk's work with DOGE, in part because of increased competition and consumers opting for hybrids over fully electric vehicles. Musk said he expects Tesla to have millions of fully autonomous Teslas on America's streets by the second half of next year. Musk added that Tesla would "start to see the prosperity of autonomy take effect in a material way around the middle of next year" or the second half of next year. The company has often missed target dates in the past, and Musk has previously acknowledged being overly optimistic about timelines. Musk also said Tesla was making good progress on Optimus, its humanoid robot, and it expected to have thousands of Optimus robots working in Tesla factories by the end of the year. He said the company could be producing one million robots a year by 2029 or 2030. Jump to

As Tesla (TSLA+1.13%) prepares to report its first-quarter 2025 earnings after the bell Tuesday, investors are watching closely for updates on two long-delayed projects: the company’s affordable EV and its autonomous robotaxi platform. The two initiatives once were expected to define Tesla’s next chapter — but concerns about CEO Elon Musk’s political entanglements are clouding the outlook. Analysts, including Wedbush’s Dan Ives, have voiced worries that Musk’s leadership focus has splintered. Since accepting his controversial role in the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency, Musk has faced protests and backlash that analysts say may be affecting the brand. Tesla’s stock has plunged 40% year-to-date, impacted by falling deliveries, fierce competition from Chinese EV giants like BYD (BYDDY+2.70%), and political headwinds. But there’s one group of investors that’s thriving: short sellers. According to S3 Partners, traders betting against Tesla have made an estimated $11.5 billion in profits so far this year — making it the most profitable short globally, surpassing Nvidia (NVDA+0.54%). Short interest has climbed 15% as bearish sentiment builds. Public perception is also shifting. A recent CNBC (CMCSA+1.99%) All-America Economic Survey found that 47% of Americans now hold a negative view of Tesla, indicating significant potential challenges for the brand’s image. Shares rose about 5% Tuesday amid a pre-earnings and larger market bounce. But with investor nerves fraying, Tesla’s Q1 report could be a decisive moment in the company’s 2025 story — for bulls and bears alike.

Title: Google's next move shows us why cozying up to leaders is a bad idea!

Summary: A new report states that Google might move Pixel production over to India. This is a move to avoid the harsh 46% tariffs placed on Taiwan, which is where most of Google’s devices are built. In India, the tariffs are only 26%, which is significantly lower. Do you remember hearing the news of wealthy tech figures donating money to Donald Trump’s inauguration by the millions? We saw Tim Cook do it along with Mark Zuckerberg and others. Well, Sundar Pichai, Google’s CEO, also donated money to the inauguration. That’s what makes this new report all the more tragic. The very man they donated to is wreaking havoc on the global economy. He’s also playing chicken with countries that build many of the products we use every day, and this has caused huge vibrations throughout the stock market. Google is now starting to feel the pressure from the situation, and its next move should be a cautionary tale. As you may know, President Donald Trump is dealing out tariffs like he’s at a poker game. As such, importing goods from many countries around the world will become much more expensive. These taxes will result in higher prices for consumers, but it will also result in high prices for companies providing goods and services. Google’s Pixel devices are built in Taiwan, but that country was hit with a 46% tariff. This means that importing its Pixel devices from Taiwan over to the U.S. will cost the company more. Raising the import cost could result in much more expensive devices for the consumers. Pixel phones aren’t exactly the budget-friendly option it once was. A new report hints that Google is in talks with Dixon Technologies and Foxconn at the moment. It could be planning on moving Pixel production over to India. As it stands, India was hit with a 26% tariff, which is much lower than Taiwan’s tariff. The situation is extremely fluid at the moment. Vice President Vance flew over to India to speak with Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. The talks were over potentially reaching a trade deal later this year. If that happens, then things might be better for Google if it moves production to India. We’re sure that the executives over at Apple have been pulling their hair out over the drama. The sky-high tariffs placed on Chinese goods have been threatening to triple the price of the iPhone. As such, Apple has been asking the president to exempt it from the tariffs. Even though there was an exemption, the company could still be in trouble. Well, it looks like the folks at Google are in a similar boat. We all know that Trump favors big business, so we’re sure that’s why they donated to his inaugural fund. We’re also sure that it’s because he relaxed the regulations on AI technology, which companies like Google, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI were happy about. However, now they’re regretting their choice at the moment. We’re seeing turmoil across several industries, and companies are having to uproot their operations. While the trade deal might help Google if it moves to India, it’s still ridiculous that the company now has to move its production to an entirely different country just to deal with a decision from the man that its CEO helped get re-elected.

Title: A software engineer's success often depends on their relationship with their manager, says ex-Amazon technical director
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/software-engineer-success-can-depend-manager-relationship-former-amazon-director-2025-4
Time Published: 2025-04-22T17:41:33Z
Full Content:
A large part of an engineer's success is often tied to how they navigate their relationship with their manager, a former Amazon engineering director, Dave Anderson, said. "I would actually say, as a manager, even, like 50% of that performance, frequently, is your relationship with your manager and your team. How will you fit in with the team, with your peers, with your manager?" he said on a recent episode of "The Pragmatic Engineer," a podcast. Underestimating your supervisor's influence can be particularly dangerous at a company like Amazon, he added. As can be the case at other companies, a manager's decisions can shape the future of their direct report, from determining how much they're compensated to how far up the career ladder they climb. The influence a manager can have over an engineer's trajectory isn't something to shrug off, Anderson said. "I think the mistake that people will sometimes make is like, 'My manager doesn't influence my job that much because I can work independently,' or, you know, 'I don't need to figure this out with my manager because I can, you know, work with my peers, or I have this great engineer on my team I can work with,'" Anderson said. But if your manager doesn't like you, he added, you're "never ever" going to be able to snag a promotion. It's also important to remember that managers are often asked to point out a number of team members "who are not doing great," Anderson said. If you are, when compared with other members of your team, the "least effective," he added, you could be on the chopping block. "If you look around the room and you're thinking, 'Yep, I'm the worst one here' — that's not a great situation to ever be in. It's just never safe," Anderson said. "And at Amazon, it's definitely not safe. Some other companies where they just might do layoffs once every four years, you might be safe for quite a while. But Amazon has this sort of regular cycle." In response to a request for comment from Business Insider, Margaret Callahan, an Amazon spokesperson, said Anderson's experiences were his alone. "These claims reflect the opinion of one individual who worked at Amazon years ago. They're not based in fact, and aren't indicative of what it was like to work here then or what it's like today," Callahan said. "We're proud to be one of the most sought-after employers in the world and to have ranked in the top three in LinkedIn's Top Companies for eight years running." Anderson said that if an engineer's relationship with their manager isn't good, there can be an escape hatch of sorts: moving teams before being managed out. "So many times I've had someone who was either doing amazing on one team, they moved to the next team, and they're, like, actually not doing well at all, or someone who was not doing well escapes to another team before they get fired — and they do well," he said. If you start to hear rumblings from further up the chain of command, Anderson thinks it could be in your best interest to make a change, and swiftly. "This is, like, my sneaky recommendation for anyone is like — if you start to hear performance feedback whatsoever from your management chain, if you have any opportunity at all, get off your team fast as possible," he said. In a follow-up email, Anderson told BI that in a "great number of situations," he'd seen success prove itself to be at least partially dependent on team fit. "I've seen poor performers turn into great performers, and great performers turn into poor performers — and the only factor was them switching teams," he said. "In particular, switching teams to a place where they didn't know their manager. I don't think people fundamentally changed — so the only reasonable conclusion is that team fit (in particular, their relationship with their manager) is the deciding factor." Anderson doesn't suggest disavowing any negative feedback you receive and bailing out into a different section of the company on a whim. It depends, he said, on the relationship you've formed with your supervisor and whether you have faith in their advice. "Now, if you trust your manager, they might be actually just giving you honest feedback, which you'd like to be able to receive," he said. "But for the most part, if you've been working for someone for three years and suddenly they start giving you performance feedback, that's a really bad sign." Anderson added: "If you run for the hills fast enough, it's possible you'll get away before they flag you in the system as non-transferable." Jump to

IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR ROCKET LAB INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Rocket Lab securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than April 28, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Title: Elon Musk news: What happens to Tesla stock if index funds stop buying it?

Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily. I invest in Tesla every month when I make my 401(k) contribution. You may as well, along with plenty of people you know who may despise Elon Musk. My contribution to Musk’s biggest company is about $26 of the roughly $2,000 per month I aim to send to an index fund that tracks more or less the entire U.S. stock market. Tesla is one of the biggest companies in the market, and so it accounts for 1.31 percent of my investment. (As a proper adherent to the Boglehead strategy I also get my little piece of 3,561 other companies.) Twenty-six bucks a month adds up in eye-watering fashion when millions of people send their investment dollars into this type of fund. Tesla has lots of retail investors who just like owning Tesla stock. (I once sat in an Uber and watched my driver monitor Tesla’s intraday movements on a mounted phone while the car was moving, a scene I wish I was making up for this story.) Even still, institutions hold most of Tesla’s stock. Three huge ones—Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street—collectively own more than 17 percent of the company. Together, those three have more of the stock than Musk does. Their stakes are worth well over $100 billion of a $700 billion company. They invest the money of retirees and pensioners and who knows who else. All of those people are pumping Tesla’s stock, a few dollars at a time. Even so, Tesla’s stock is bleeding out this year, as Musk gets negative attention for his practically limitless reign over much of the federal government. The S&P 500 has lost 12 percent on the year, but Tesla has lost a much grislier 40 percent. People are fleeing Tesla’s stock at rates that far exceed other stocks or the index funds that track that whole kit and caboodle. The effort to rein in Musk by crushing Tesla’s stock is now a major cultural movement. Its tactics are demonstrations at Tesla showrooms, flyers on windshields, posts on social media, and, for a tiny minority, property damage. The movement hasn’t yet arrived at what could be one of its most effective tools. Probably, this is because “the movement” is not a coordinated front between run-of-the-mill Musk opponents and financial professionals who would like to make some money off them while also maybe fighting Musk for sincere reasons. But eventually, it will get there. The biggest unturned stone in the battle against Musk is the one around exchange-traded funds—baskets of stocks that you buy in a package, with the price updating all day unlike mutual funds, which for now give Tesla’s stock a useful insurance policy. JPMorgan counts about 3,500 ETFs listed in the United States, holding more than $9 trillion in assets as of last October. There are only 4,300 publicly traded American companies, and that number has fallen hard since the mid-1990s as companies have gotten bought up, failed, or gone private. Just domestically, before accounting for thousands of non-U.S. ETFs, we are verging on becoming a country that has more ETFs offering various baskets of stocks than we have actual stocks. There are ETFs for pretty much any concept a financial professional could dream up and sell to investors. The biggest ones track the whole stock market or the S&P 500 and have roughly half a trillion dollars in assets under management each. The market then gets much more targeted. There are countless industry ETFs, tracking health care companies or industrials or consumer staples or semiconductor or electric vehicle companies, or whatever else. Eventually it gets downright bespoke. You want the whole S&P 500 except for the “Magnificent 7” companies that account for about a third of the S&P 500’s value? A fund for that launched last year. Lately it’s losing much less than the broad market, in substantial part because Tesla is one of the seven companies it doesn’t buy. The ETF market can also be mean, picking on specific people. One ETF just shorts stocks that famous investor Cathie Wood likes. For a few glorious moments, there was an “Inverse Jim Cramer” fund, long may it live. The idea seems so obvious that it’s head-scratching nobody with a big platform has so much as called for it yet: One of the best ways to sting Tesla’s stock, and Musk by extension, would be to create broad index funds that exclude Tesla and thus don’t put their investors’ money into the stock. Ideally, all Americans who have the good fortune to have extra money or a retirement fund match should be encouraged to put away what they can, and specifically to put it in broad market index funds. Those funds are a crucial source of demand for Tesla’s stock, though. If you’d like to put your money to work for your future but think Musk is a threat to your country’s future, you might be taking some contradictory steps all the time. What is to be done about this conflict? The most aggressive option for Tesla Takedown proponents would be to mount a campaign demanding that the Vanguards and BlackRocks of the world remove Tesla from their major index funds. That would be a bad and doomed option. The companies would not do it, nor should they, because they are offering index funds that track the stock market, and Tesla is one of the biggest companies on the stock market. Also, in less noble reasoning, these enormous asset managers are not going to pick an overt fight with Musk and by extension the entire Republican Party. (They are already on the back foot over “woke” investing, and this would get that party going again.) There is another option, though: Find a financial firm that wants to make tons of money by selling an investment product to millions of furious liberals while charging a reasonable fee, and demand that Trump’s Securities and Exchange Commission stop them. It would not be hard, or counter to the rules that typically govern the ETF market, for an enterprising issuer to launch a fund that includes the whole stock market except Tesla. There’s already the one that excludes seven mega-companies including Tesla. It’s not clear that there would be any legal problem with launching an explicitly anti-Tesla ETF and marketing it as such. But perhaps you, a financial professional attuned to risk, want to be safe. You could launch the Properly Valued Companies ETF, which does not buy the stock of car companies that have regularly traded at a price of more than 200 times their earnings per share. Who knows how many companies that would cover? Perhaps you could launch the Focused Bosses Fund (ticker: $FBF), which buys the whole S&P 500 except for companies whose CEOs also run other multibillion-dollar companies and hold government posts. Who could blame you for catering to investors who want disciplined management? The ETF market will find a way to develop pretty much any product that people want to buy, even if that product is financially dubious. This one would not be financially dubious, and if marketed well, I suspect many, many people would want to buy it. If an ETF issuer gets more than $50 million into its fund, and quite possibly less than that, it should be making money by charging a fee of much less than 1 percent per year on its invested dollars. There are more than 50 million American dollars out there that are poised to find their way into a non-Tesla, broad-market ETF. It would take some time for an offering like this to affect Tesla’s share price to an extent we would notice. But stocks go up when people (or index funds) buy them, and they go down when people sell them. Offering a break in the link between investing in the whole stock market and boosting Tesla’s share price would have the latter effect. It’s also the sort of thing that you could imagine Musk spinning out over, causing him to go on late-night X tirades about. He seems like a pretty distractible fellow. Some of the second-order problems with this approach are clear. The clearest is that in the current version of the U.S. government, one that finds fresh ways all the time to enrich Musk, the SEC might never approve a fund that positioned itself so overtly against the world’s richest person. That’s no reason not to make the government say no, though. The opportunity is there for Musk’s opponents, the sort of people who don’t already own Tesla stock or cars, to vote with their portfolios. The chance is also there for an investment business to profit, even cynically, from that desire. Isn’t this just a matter of time? Slate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.

Title: Four Value Stock Picks From Two Top Managers For Q2 2025

ByJacob Wolinsky ByJacob Wolinsky, Contributor. NEW YORK, NY - JANUARY 16: A sign hangs on the BlackRock offices on January 16, 2014 in New York ... More City. (Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images) Value stocks bounced in the second half of last year, and several experts are saying the day of value is returning. However, BlackRock is warning that investors might be underweight value stocks at a time when the markets could start shifting. Additionally, history has shown that savvy stock picking is a better way to gain access to value stocks rather than by tracking one of the value indexes. Here are four value stock picks from two leading managers as the second quarter goes into full swing. In a recent interview, Judson Traphagen of Plough Penny Partners chose Lesaka Technologies (NASDAQ:LSAK) and Veon (NASDAQ:VEON), which are trading at around $4.50 and $45 a share, respectively. Meanwhile, Alyx Wood of Kernow Asset Management selected Card Factory (LON:CARD) and Kistos (LON:KIST), which are trading at around GBX90 and GBX129 a share. Plough Penny Partners is a long-biased, fundamental growth fund that prefers to target holding periods of between three to five years. The fund typically holds a concentrated portfolio of 10 to 20 long positions with a handful of opportunistic shorts. Plough Penny specifically targets high-growth technology companies, investing globally in fintech, software and internet companies. Kernow Asset Management uses a long-short equity strategy in search of contrarian alpha from U.K. equities. The firm pairs fundamental analysis with catalyst-driven mean reversion investments. Kernow seeks market inefficiencies and tries to determine how they work and how valuation gaps might be closed. Traphagen describes Lesaka as an under-the-radar small-cap fintech company undergoing secular growth and in the early stages of a multi-year trajectory. The company’s business is largely in southern Africa. Comparing Lesaka to StoneCo and Nubank in Latin America, Traphagen believes it’s perhaps the best way for U.S. investors to target Africa’s largely untapped growth market for fintech. In the same way Square serves U.S. customers, Lesaka provides digital financial solutions to consumers and merchants in southern Africa. Traphagen was initially drawn to Lesaka Technologies because he’s always seeking companies with great management, rapid revenue growth, and expanding margins that are operating in massive total addressable markets. He also seeks companies with solid unit economics and that have “barely penetrated their target markets.” “We have made money in emerging markets fintech stocks like Nubank and StoneCo in Latin America and had read that Africa was the next big market in fintech, so we looked for a stock to benefit from that trend,” Traphagen explained. “LSAK is that stock.” In the short term, he believes Lesaka Technologies is worth $7.50 a share, but he suspects it might end up being a multi-bagger in the long term. Veon is a telecommunications company that operates in frontier markets, providing traditional telco services and newer digital products and services. In recent years, it has sped up its digital products and services and now generates a sizable share of its revenues from digital products and services. Like with Lesaka, Traphagen believes the opportunity in Veon exists because it’s still largely unknown to U.S. investors, operating in markets that are essentially alien to U.S. investors, although it trades on the Nasdaq. Traphagen was initially attracted to Veon because of its valuation, but then he discovered its “compelling” total addressable market and opportunity for digital products in an area where competition by U.S. technology companies is lacking. He also was attracted to Veon because the company is ambitiously de-levering, selling off non-core assets and repurchasing shares. Card Factory is a top greeting card retailer in the U.K. that also sells gifts, party supplies and related products. The company was founded based on the opportunity to sell greeting cards at much lower price points than competitors via a vertically integrated business model that includes manufacturing cards in-house. Interestingly, Wood was initially drawn to Card Factory as a potential short position during the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time, the company had high debt and was facing the possibility of bankruptcy. However, after Wood ran the fundamentals and conducted the people and strategy work, he found the company to be of higher quality than he had expected. “This made it a long idea as soon as they started growing profits and the debt was cleared by cashflow,” Wood explained. “The business is trading at a distressed price. This is at odds to the great balance sheet, and profits are set to double. It’s a hidden quality growth stock. So we did more work and linked our trade journey to the partnerships, which are free growth centers.” Management expects to double their profits over the next three years, although Wood said the market is skeptical because of the seemingly untested partnerships and international expansion. However, he added that they’re “comfortable with being paid to take the risk for free.” Those partnerships are basically new places where Card Factory’s cards are being sold on stands within stores rather than just on the High Street. Kistos is an independent, integrated energy company that has both upstream and midstream operations that span international markets. Wood was initially drawn to the stock by the 350% gap with their valuation in the Kernow Valuation Framework, which begins with valuing companies using their proprietary fundamental bottom-up process. He feels Kistos has a clear edge over other oil and gas companies because it extracts value from overlooked assets “more efficiently than almost anyone else.” Wood estimates the company’s intrinsic value at £350 million, although its market cap is only a mere £100 million currently. He said the company’s production is set to almost double this year to 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and the market is ignoring this potential. According to BlackRock, growth stocks accounted for 37% of the S&P 500 as of the end of November, versus the historical average of 24%. This was due to the heavy favoritism assigned to growth stocks in the first half of 2024 as investors widely preferred mega-cap technology stocks. However, that high concentration could unintentionally leave many investor portfolios coming up short in the diversification department, meaning a greater chance of missing out on the upside from rallies in value stocks like the one that started in July 2024. Thus, investors might want to take a closer look at their portfolios to see where they stand in the value-versus-growth.

Intel Agencies Caught in Massive Voter Fraud USAWatchdog.com ^ | 4FEB2025 | Greg Hunter Posted on 2/5/2025, 10:19:32 AM by Tom Tetroxide Dr. Jerome Corsi has a Harvard PhD in political science. He has written more than 30 books with many of them becoming best-sellers. Dr. Corsi’s latest project is about voter fraud. Corsi says he can prove Donald Trump really did win in 2020. There were also countless down-ballot thefts in 2020 and in 2024. Dr. Corsi and others have uncovered a grand scam that dates back to the early 2000’s that has cheated people into office that actually lost. The architects of the steal can be traced back to U.S. intel agencies. Dr. Corsi created a website for this project called GodsFiveStones.com and explains, “GodsFiveStones.com is named after the David and Goliath Bible story. This is when David picks up five smooth stones from the brook, and they are the exact ones needed to kill Goliath. That’s what we are aiming to do is to kill this Goliath of voter fraud.” The voter fraud is hidden in the voter rolls that every state government maintains. Corsi says, “You look at state records, and there might be 12 million records and there might be 2 million false records. They look legitimate until you really analyze them, and then you realize they are duplicates or clones. If you send out people to canvas them, there is nobody there. They are falsified and hidden in the data base. It’s like a card marking scheme. . . . They did not use the algorithms in the 2024 Election for President because we were on the lookout for it. The down-ballot elections (House, Governor and Senate) used these algorithms, and they cheated.” Corsi estimates they cheated 20 House Democrats and 5 Democrat Senators into office in 2024. snip I recommend “The nVidia Way” book. It’s an interesting read, much of the success is around their culture. Jensen just outworks everyone, requiring it of everyone. They behave as though the next breakthrough in tech will kill the company, so be first and never get complacent. That said, it seems he sacrifices his life to just work. I was in a company bought by Intel. They were constantly distracted by different ideas. They seemed to have no focus. They also didn’t listen, there was a certain arrogance about the Intel employees. They’re way behind in AI hardware and software. It’s not just the hardware. The CUDA software opened doors into unanticipated markets. That said, from a stock point of view, imho...they’re going to enter the ‘trough of disillusionment’ on the Gartner Hype Cycle. The possibilities hit regulatory aspects. The recent market performance may be reflecting this but it’s hard to see due to the other volatility (e.g. tariffs). Long term buy, looking for another dip - over 30% down since start of the year. I used to work for Intel, but I was in and out before Pat came to power. But a good friend who worked there for a LONG time used to work for Pat and says that he’s a very smart engineer, and he thought the right person for the job as CEO. When things didn’t go so well under his leadership my friend said he believed the issue was that Pat was an engineer, and that the board of directors (who make all the decisions ANYWAY), didn’t WANT an engineer to lead the company, they wanted more of a finance guy. So here we are. A different world but when I was supporting government development projects the two big leaders would be Program Manager (focusing on Cost and Schedule) and Chief Engineer (focusing on technical requirements). I never worked with a Chief Engineer who gave a fig about technical requirements. The Chief Engineers always focused on Cost and Schedule. Always the money. Never the engineering. I know a bunch of former Intel people who now work at AMD they say Intel is in a death spiral and while AMD needs to spend and upgrade their Server lab spaces they are poised to kick some Intel ass. The only thing the new CEO brings is customer feedback on fabless design needs. True something very missing from Intel but it might not be enough. DEI has destroyed the inner workings of Intel started by Obama. It has not been the same place since Paul Otellini retired. Intel had a long track record of forcing out experienced people and replacing them with Indian workers. Those experienced engineers went to AMD, Nvidia, Apple and IBM. I went to IBM where for the first time after 30 years, felt like I was being treated like a professional. You were just a number at Intel.

ByBrendan Ahern ByBrendan Ahern, Senior Contributor. CLN Asian equities were mixed despite a stronger U.S. dollar overnight, gold surging, and yesterday’s U.S. equity downdraft, as Taiwan underperformed. The Yen was resilient, giving some validation to today’s Financial Times article on Japanese institutions selling U.S. Treasuries, though it is hard to say for sure. The U.S. dollar’s decline, stock market decline, and asset flow out of the U.S. were topics in Chinese media, though likely being repeated globally. The positions of star active fund managers, revealing their positions, garnered attention on a light economic data and policy day. One manager’s top positions were revealed as Tencent, Alibaba, Kweichow Moutai, Meituan, Wuliangye, Yum China, and CNOOC. Another manager focused solely on Mainland China A shares revealed holdings in Sokon, Eve, Naura, and Trina Solar. After the close, Central Huijin Investment Ltd., the financial arm of China’s sovereign wealth fund, updated its positions in four Mainland equity ETFs with increases of 363 million shares, 501 million shares, 117 million shares, and 157 million shares. The SWF’s positions are in the tens of billions, so the Q1 increases aren’t massive in my opinion. Coincidentally, Reuters published an article on retail investors and the National Team buying during market hours that garnered attention. There continues to be coverage of the government’s rare statements on stabilizing the stock market. Hong Kong’s volumes were strong on a positive day. JD.com was down -6.32% and Meituan was down -4.62%, as they battle for restaurant delivery, which weighed on both stocks as investors fear margin compression. The outcome of these pyrrhic victories has been painful to watch, as firms undercut one another to garner market share, as profitability falls to the wayside. This reminds me of the battle between Uber and Didi. Mainland investors bought a very large net $2.753 billion of Hong Kong stocks and ETFs via Southbound Stock Connect, as the Hong Kong Tracker ETF, the Hang Seng China Enterprise ETF, Tencent, and Alibaba were the largest beneficiaries of inflows. 50% of Hong Kong turnover was from Mainland investors via Southbound Stock Connect. Healthcare was the top-performing sector in Hong Kong, up +6.52%, and Mainland China, up +0.49%, on the belief that the sector will be resilient to the U.S.-China trade war. Mainland technology and growth stocks, including electronic equipment, semiconductors, software, and electrical equipment, underperformed. A sell-side economist dropped their 2025 China GDP target to 4% from 4.5%. Hong Kong and Mainland China’s resilience has garnered shockingly little attention from global investors. The CEOs of Walmart, Home Depot, and Target visited President Donald Trump at the White House yesterday. While the companies’ statements called the meeting “productive” and “constructive,” the companies and their customers will unfortunately be adversely impacted by tariffs. Hopefully, the U.S. and China can make some progress, as some have speculated that Nvidia’s Jensen Huang’s visit to Beijing could be his attempt to act as a bridge between the two sides.

Title: Tesla wants to bring the Cybertruck down to earth

Good morning. A new research paper co-authored by Google's David Silver is the talk of the tech industry. It boldly announces a radical new era for AI — it also reads as a "dis" of OpenAI, BI's Alistair Barr writes. In today's big story, Tesla's highly anticipated earnings report comes after the bell. We're breaking down what Wall Street will be watching — and why Tesla really wants the Cybertruck to be a working man's truck. What's on deck Markets: President Trump escalated his feud with the Fed, and investors are nervous. Tech: Internal Microsoft email to managers details new policies aimed at culling low performers. Business: The FTC is arguing that Uber's subscription service is too deceptive in a new suit. But first, bringing the Cybertruck back to earth. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. The big story Think less DeLorean, more F-150. The Cybertruck is ditching its otherworldly aesthetic to reposition itself as a working man's vehicle, BI's Grace Kay writes. Less than two years after release, Cybertrucks are now piling up in sales lots, fewer than 50,000 vehicles have been delivered, and some owners have become political targets over CEO Elon Musk's association with President Donald Trump. So, what's a car company to do? Enter the quiet rebrand. Tesla sales workers told BI the vehicle needs to appeal to the traditional truck buyer. In mid-April, Tesla redesigned its product page for the first time since the truck's release. Gone are the futuristic aesthetics and allusions to Mars. Now, the vehicle is fit for construction work or a family outing. Tesla is preparing to deliver first-quarter earnings. It faces sluggish delivery numbers, a brand crisis, and a stock price down over 43% this year. It's looking for a boost. Here are a few things that Wall Street will be watching: Impact of Trump tariffs. Tesla's chief financial officer said on the company's last earnings call that, if implemented, tariffs would affect the automaker's business and profitability. He said that while the company had tried to localize its supply chain, it's still "very reliant on parts from across the world" for all its businesses. 1. The "sell America" trade is in full swing. On Monday, stocks, bonds, and the dollar all dropped sharply. This followed Trump's criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell for taking too long to lower interest rates, which is rattling investor confidence. 2. Politically meddling with the Fed is a bad idea, top official says. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee underscored the importance of the central bank's independence on Monday. He cautioned that political interference could result in hotter inflation and higher unemployment. 3. Companies are cutting earnings outlooks. Trade war uncertainty, interest rate jitters, and recession fears are causing the revisions, which are approaching downside extremes. 1. Inside Amazon's Project Greenland. Last year, Amazon struggled to keep its retail business on track when faced with an AI chip shortage. Its response was Project Greenland: an effort to tightly approve and monitor which projects get GPU access, according to documents obtained by BI. 2. Microsoft is raising the bar. It has created new policies and tools to dial up performance pressure on employees, including a two-year rehire ban for those found to be underperforming, according to an internal email viewed by BI. 3. AI isn't ready to do your job. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University staffed a fake company with AI agents, and the results were disastrous. See the tasks AI failed the most — and where the next development phase is likely headed. 1. Are you stuck with Uber One? You're probably not alone. An FTC lawsuit accuses Uber of overpromising customers how much the paid subscription service will save them, making it too hard to cancel, and, in some cases, signing them up without consent. Uber denies the allegations. 2. Walmart's taking a page from the honeybee playbook. The retail giant is ditching zip codes for a honeycomb-style segmented map in search of speedier grocery delivery. It says the goal is to understand what customers want, where they are, and which stores have what they need. 3. How CEOs are staying calm. As uncertainty swirls over tariffs, many CEOs are turning to their wellness routines to reduce stress. Business leaders shared their tips with BI, from "purposeful scrolling" to finding balance outdoors.

Title: AMD Stock To $60?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Lisa Su, chairwoman and CEO of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), arrives at the prime minister's ... More official residence ahead of her meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba in Tokyo on April 17, 2025. (Photo by Franck ROBICHON / POOL / AFP) (Photo by FRANCK ROBICHON/POOL/AFP via Getty Images) Imagine waking up to see AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) down 30%. Sounds ridiculous? It’s not. We aren’t talking about a single day drop - but sustained selling triggered by risks that are piling up leading to a big reset in valuation. If this stock reverts to anything close to a sane multiples, we’re talking a drop to $60 or even lower - and that’s without a full-blown tech meltdown. That’s the kind of risk that exists with individual stocks, or if your portfolio is too concentrated. We minimize this risk while giving exposure to upside in our High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. Let’s pull back the curtain on AMD. Just from the numbers that matter, AMD looks a lot like Google at first glance. But PE multiples? Different like night and day. AMD is trading almost at 85 PE while Google is sitting below 19. Why such a massive difference? The answer: margins! AMD has a very low net margin of 6.4% compared to Google’s 28.6% (last 12 months) - which means low income and exceptionally high PE. In other words, the market is expecting significant margin expansion from AMD - but that dream might blow up. Here is what the numbers really mean. So what’s propping it up? Expectations. And those are starting to wobble. Sure, earnings might look “fine” on the surface. But watch the guidance like a hawk. That’s where the truth slips out. If AMD blinks even a little in forward guidance, Wall Street’s love affair could end fast. The semiconductor industry isn’t new to booms and busts. We’ve seen this movie before. AMD is not immune. Remember 2022? AMD dropped from $160 to under $60 in just months. And it wasn’t because AMD failed - it was because the expectations collapsed. That wasn’t the only time this happened. In 2018, AMD dropped nearly 50% in < 1.5 months as the market corrected in October. All we are saying is - stay cautious! Does it mean you shouldn’t invest in stocks like AMD? No, we aren’t saying that. AMD has provided excellent returns for investors. But stocks like AMD should be just a small part of the portfolio. There is much more to long-term money compounding. Consider Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: L.A. Mayor Karen Bass Cuts 400 Police Department Jobs in 'State of the City'

LOS ANGELES, California — Mayor Karen Bass tried to strike an upbeat tone as she delivered the bad news Monday in her “State of the City” speech, cutting 400 civilian jobs in the L.A. Police Department next year. The Los Angeles Times reported: Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass released a proposed budget on Monday that would eliminate a nearly $1 billion financial gap by cutting more than 2,700 city positions — about 1,650 of them through layoffs. … The $14 billion spending plan, which covers the 2025-26 fiscal year, would provide funding for scores of new hires at the fire department, three months after the Palisades fire destroyed thousands of homes and killed 12 people. … At the Los Angeles Police Department, more than 400 workers would be targeted for layoffs, all of them civilians, according to figures prepared by city budget officials. The number of police officers would continue on its gradual downward trajectory, with new hires failing to keep pace with attrition. Bass also claimed that the process of recovery and building after the Palisades Fire was the fastest in the history of the state: Today, in reporting on the State of our City, I report to Los Angeles that the recovery in the Palisades is on track to be the fastest in California history. We’re not just moving fast to move fast. We know that the faster we can rebuild, the faster we can heal. We still have a long way to go, and for those who have lost a home, each and every day is a day too long. We want to be fast, we want to be safe and we want to be resilient. We have issued permits to rebuild twice as fast as after the Camp and Woolsey fires, we restored water nearly a year and a half faster than after the Camp Fire, and we restored power in just two months. Los Angeles, I assure you, rebuilding is underway. Many residents, frustrated by delays in debris removal, building permits, and insurance company payouts, would disagree. Bass said the city would start using AI technology to speed up the process of approving building permits, and called on the City Council “to pass an ordinance to waive all plan check and permit fees so that Angelenos can get home.” However, skeptical residents are running out of time. And many refuse to forget that she was out of the country when the fires broke out in January, breaking a campaign promise to refuse international travel. Joel B.

Title: Stocks look to rebound as earnings roll in — but confusion still rules

Time Published: 2025-04-22T12:22:00Z

U.S. stocks rallied Tuesday, capping off a dramatic comeback fueled by hopes of easing trade tensions and a softer stance on tariffs. The Dow surged 1,017 points, or 2.7%, while the S&P 500 jumped 2.5% and the Nasdaq soared 2.7%. The Russell 2000 outpaced them all, up nearly 2.8%, signaling broad-based enthusiasm — at least for now. Volatility retreated, with the VIX dropping over 9%, and investors rotated out of safe havens. After rising to fresh highs overnight, gold fell 1.2% to $3,383 an ounce, snapping a record-setting streak even as JPMorgan (JPM-0.63%) analysts said they still see a path to $4,000 an ounce in the months ahead. Meanwhile, Bitcoin popped 5% to break above $90,000 for the first time since March, with some traders viewing crypto as a hedge against ongoing policy whiplash. Not all stocks participated in the rally. Defense contractors took a hit after earnings reports showed margin compression and rising tariff risks. Northrop Grumman plunged 12.5% — the worst performer in the S&P 500 — after reporting a steep drop in profit tied to cost overruns on the B-21 bomber program. RTX slid over 9% after warning that tariffs could slash up to $850 million from its 2025 profits. The rest of the market took a more optimistic view. Tesla gained almost 5% ahead of earnings, Netflix (NFLX+2.09%) jumped over 5%, and GE Aerospace (GE+2.38%) rallied 6% following a strong report. Still, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent scheduled to speak Wednesday on the financial system — and the political backdrop still wildly unpredictable — few believe today’s rally settles the score. Stocks climbed on Tuesday after U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reportedly told a private gathering that the ongoing trade war with China is “unsustainable” and likely to “de-escalate.” The S&P 500 and Nasdaq rose just over 2% by late afternoon, buoyed by optimism over potential relief from steep tariffs that have weighed on global markets. However, analysts caution that the rally may be premature. Despite Bessent’s comments, there have been no formal negotiations between the U.S. and China to date, and much of social media greeted these latest deal hints with skepticism. The Trump administration’s recent tariff hikes remain in effect, including a baseline 10% tariff on all imports and additional levies pushing some Chinese goods to a 145% tariff rate. The International Monetary Fund has also weighed in, warning that the current tariff policies have delivered a significant negative shock to the global economy, prompting a downgrade in growth forecasts. While the market’s reaction reflects hope for a resolution, the situation underscores the volatility and uncertainty that continue to characterize U.S.-China trade relations. U.S. stocks rebounded strongly Tuesday after a brutal start to the week, even as investors remain rattled by a barrage of conflicting signals on recession risks — and by President Donald Trump’s escalating pressure campaign against the Federal Reserve. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1,035 points, or 2.7%, while the S&P 500 also added 2.7% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped 3%. The VIX, Wall Street’s fear gauge, dropped almost 10%, signaling a cooldown in volatility. Gold continued its climb, up 0.4% to $3,439. The International Monetary Fund downgraded its global economic growth forecast for 2025 to 2.8%, a decrease from the previous estimate of 3.3%, citing the impact of widespread tariffs and escalating trade tensions under President Donald Trump. The U.S. economy is now projected to grow at 1.8%, down from 2.7%, with the IMF raising the probability of a U.S. recession this year to 37%, up from 25%. The IMF attributes the slowdown to increased uncertainty, reduced investment, and tighter credit conditions resulting from the tariffs, which affect nearly 60 countries. Gold extended its historic rally overnight, climbing above $3,500 for the first time. The surge likely reflects a dual concern: Investors are chasing safety amid political and market chaos, while bracing for a potential resurgence in inflation fueled by Trump’s tariffs. Last week, investors poured $8 billion into gold funds — double the peak weekly inflows seen during the pandemic — pushing the four-week average to $4 billion, according to Bank of America Global Research (BAC+2.46%). Meanwhile, traders on Kalshi, a CFTC-regulated prediction market, continue to price in elevated odds of a U.S. recession by the end of 2025. Also on Monday, the U.S. dollar plunged to a three-year low after Trump ramped up attacks on Fed Chair Jerome Powell, intensifying calls for interest rate cuts and deepening fears over the central bank’s independence. “The market no longer knows what to believe,” wrote The Kobeissi Letter, pointing to a swirl of conflicting cues: gold rising like cuts are coming, stocks falling like a recession is near, and Treasury yields climbing like the economy is booming. Tesla (TSLA+1.13%) reports earnings after the bell on Tuesday, with Wall Street bracing for more bad news. Wells Fargo (WFC+1.74%) expects a Q1 miss, citing weak deliveries, shrinking margins, and fading enthusiasm for the Cybertruck. The firm also slashed its 2025 outlook by 16%, pointing to soft demand for the refreshed Model Y and mounting doubts around speculative bets like the Cybercab and Optimus. Tesla stock rose more than 6% in Tuesday afternoon trading after slumping on Monday. Its shares are down about 36% so far this year. Shares of Google (GOOGL+1.23%) parent Alphabet rose 3% Tuesday. The stock had slipped more than 2% on Monday after the Justice Department asked a federal judge to break up the company, possibly by forcing it to sell off its Chrome browser. Beyond Tesla, a wave of major earnings Tuesday will offer a broader pulse check on the industrial and healthcare sectors. Results from Intuitive Surgical (ISRG-0.70%), Danaher (DHR+2.50%), and Novartis (NVS+1.90%) will provide fresh reads on medical tech and pharma trends. SAP (SAP+0.45%) and Verizon (VZ+1.98%) add visibility into enterprise tech and telecom, while Chubb’s (CB+2.17%) results could shed light on how insurers are navigating a climate of rising risk and uncertainty. Defense is also in focus in a big way on Tuesday, with Lockheed Martin (LMT+0.09%), Northrop Grumman (NOC+0.38%), and RTX (RTX+0.93%) (formerly Raytheon Technologies) all reporting earings — offering investors a rare, same-day snapshot of the U.S. military-industrial complex. Together, the three giants cover everything from missile systems to fighter jet engines to battlefield surveillance, making their earnings a bellwether for how rising global tensions and Pentagon budgets are filtering into the sector.

A Huawei store in Beijing, 2024. America’s political and economic elites were once unruffled by the rise of China. Yes, Chinese GDP was growing fast, and yes, China’s share of global trade was growing equally rapidly. But this did not—or, at least, did not seem to—challenge America’s ongoing economic dominance. After all, the dollar was still king. The size and depth of China’s stock market continued to be dwarfed by the United States’. GDP per capita still weighed heavily in America’s favor. And the acknowledged global heavyweights of Big Tech—Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft—were American companies one and all. The basic posture vis-à-vis China was the following: You keep producing all that cheap stuff, we’ll keep on buying it, and you keep on financing the deficits that we accrue in the process. Over the last decade, all of this has unraveled. During his first term in the White House, Donald Trump introduced a series of tariffs on Chinese imports, which sparked retaliatory measures from China and growing talk of a “trade war.” Under Joe Biden, the inflammatory language of the Trump 1.0 era became less conspicuous. Rather, in a break with the hegemony of neoliberalism, the Biden White House hailed a renaissance in “industrial policy”; his flacks talked about no longer being able to rely on market mechanisms to guide investment. But even if the tone had changed, the policy content was not much different: China was in the crosshairs. If anything, Biden’s China tariffs were more severe than those he inherited. In mid-2024, tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum were raised to 25 percent, on solar cells and panels to 50 percent, on electric vehicles to 100 percent; and in a parting gift to his successor, in January 2025, just as Biden was leaving office, a 50 percent tariff on Chinese semiconductors went into effect. Notably, green technology was at the heart of Biden’s trade and China policy. In explaining his tariff hikes and their sectoral concentration, the Biden team repeatedly invoked the climate crisis and the energy transition, arguing that the only successful and sustainable global transition would be one where green technologies were not monopolized by a single country. US officials were well aware that monopolization was something that China was close to actually achieving. By 2023, China controlled the production of around 90 percent of the world’s rare-earth elements used in clean-energy products and at least 80 percent of the global solar-panel supply chain, with only slightly lower shares in wind turbines and EV batteries. Washington also looked with something like awe at China’s build-out of solar and wind power: The year after Biden’s historic “climate bill,” the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, was passed to great domestic fanfare, China installed 10 times as much net new renewable capacity as America did. Under Trump 2.0, all emphasis on green technology has of course been buried (at least rhetorically, since the tariffs on China’s green tech were retained). But the tariff saber-rattling has nonetheless escalated into all-out trade warfare. In February, a 10 percent tariff was imposed on Chinese imports across the board, and in March, this was increased to 20 percent. Trump was just getting started, however: April 2, his “Liberation Day,” saw the blanket tariff rate on China raised to 54 percent; and at the time of this writing, after retaliatory Chinese measures, the US tariff rate on Chinese imports effectively totals 145 percent. What is increasingly clear is that after decades of cautious sparring, the rivalry between America and China—as the US regards it, at any rate—has become a battle for global economic supremacy. Certainly, the Trump administration has targeted many other countries too, but China is plainly the main antagonist. Not for nothing has the Chinese government accused the United States of “unilateral bullying.” What is also clear, though, is that underneath America’s bluster lurks a very real and very understandable fear: namely, that this is a battle that America might not win. In fact, more than that, this is a battle that America might have already lost; all the joking on social media that the United States has entered its own “Century of Humiliation”— China’s lasted from the mid-19th to the mid-20th century—cuts to the quick precisely because it expresses very real anxieties. If one company symbolizes the ongoing struggle between America and China, that company, arguably, is Huawei. In its early years, after it was founded in 1987, Huawei—a Chinese tech firm that focuses on telecommunications—was largely ignored in the US, to the extent that it was even acknowledged. In the 2000s and early 2010s, as the company grew and expanded, including in the United States itself, American business and policy elites generally tolerated Huawei, perceiving it, at worst, as an irritant. But since Trump’s first term as president, a new era has begun. Endlessly challenged and vitriolically attacked, Huawei has ascended to the status of Public Enemy No. 1, the very apotheosis of the Chinese “threat.” So why is Huawei treated with such hostility by US policymakers? Partly it’s about geopolitics. Though Huawei is an increasingly diversified enterprise, its main business, generating over half of total revenue, is the design, manufacture, and sale of telecom equipment such as networking infrastructure and the provision of ancillary services. Communications networks, of course, are integral to the ways in which states eavesdrop and spy on one another. America’s fear is that Huawei could or already does allow its products to be used to nefarious ends by the Chinese government. Ergo, it is deemed a threat to US national security. It is with this aspect of Huawei’s role in US-China relations that Eva Dou, a reporter for The Washington Post, is principally concerned in her new book, House of Huawei: The Secret History of China’s Most Powerful Company. It has never been a secret that Huawei’s technologies are widely embedded in the contemporary surveillance state. The company has, for instance, been a major player since the 2000s in the international market for the chips used in surveillance cameras; Huawei was one of eight companies selected by Beijing in 1996 for a $1 billion national semiconductor development program. In China itself, what proved an especially lucrative opportunity for Huawei was President Xi Jinping’s launch in 2015 of a program—dubbed “Sharp Eyes”—aimed, Dou writes, at “blanketing the country with a network of security cameras.” In 2020, it was announced that China’s capital had no more blind spots: “Electronic eyes were watching over 100 percent of Beijing.” The same year, the Post revealed that Huawei had knowingly countenanced the use of its technology to track members of the Uyghur ethnic minority, prompting the French soccer star Antoine Griezmann to terminate his sponsorship deal with the company. While the Uyghur revelations certainly hardened what by that point was a growing US-led international turn against Huawei, policymakers in America and other Western markets have always been much more concerned about the security-related and political implications of Huawei’s presence in their own territories. Could Huawei’s gear be hacked, leading to network disruption? Could the Chinese government listen in on international network users? From the American perspective, the biographic details of Huawei’s legendary founder and CEO, Ren Zhengfei—a background in the military (the Engineering Corps) and a member of the Chinese Communist Party since 1978—only redoubled the grounds for suspicion. “With Huawei increasingly integrated into global networks,” Dou writes of developments in the mid-2000s, “it was being watched closely by spy agencies.” Statements along these lines pepper the book; by the end, the reader may wonder why Dou spends quite so much time on the cloak-and-dagger stuff, given that she never does unearth a smoking gun of any kind. Nonetheless, she is quite right to highlight the staggering hypocrisy of the US government’s moral grandstanding about alleged Chinese espionage machinations. As the 2013–14 Snowden leaks demonstrated, America’s own National Security Agency had successfully infiltrated Huawei several years previously and was using its infrastructure to spy not just on the company but on a range of other public- and private-sector entities, both in China and around the world. “The irony,” as Huawei’s US spokesman, William Plummer, put it at the time, “is that exactly what they are doing to us is what they have always charged that the Chinese are doing through us.” No wonder, remarks Dou, that Washington had been “so confident that Beijing could use Huawei’s gear for snooping: the NSA had been doing exactly that for years.” For all the security concerns, however, the fact that Huawei is regarded as such a threat has to do with much more than “just” geopolitics. Equally important, and perhaps even more so, is the brute fact of Huawei’s staggering commercial success. One suspects that, consciously or otherwise, anxiety about Huawei’s competitive accomplishments is sometimes dressed up as a concern with “safety”: Far easier for the American mind to invoke a surveillance bogeyman than to admit to trepidatious reverence at Chinese business prowess. As late as the turn of the millennium, the international telecommunications hardware market—Huawei’s home turf—continued to be dominated by Western firms such as Alcatel, Ericsson, Lucent, and Nortel. But the first decade of the new millennium began to see a changing of the guard. A seminal moment, as Dou tells it, came with Huawei’s first major breakthrough in the West, when, in 2005, the company won a lucrative bid to upgrade the network of BT, Britain’s largest supplier of telephony services. Opening the door to, among others, the French and Spanish markets, the BT deal was the “beginning of the end for several of Huawei’s Western rivals,” who simply couldn’t compete with the company at its “budget price points.” By 2012, Huawei was the world’s largest vendor of telecommunications networking hardware. Having also successfully made the move into consumer electronics—branded household gadgets “could help Huawei soften its image overseas,” Dou notes—the Chinese firm was, for good measure, now the world’s third-largest smartphone maker, behind only Apple and Samsung. John Nichols Greg Grandin Jeet Heer Sophie Lewis Huawei has succeeded internationally despite America’s best efforts, especially in the past decade, to prevent it from doing so. The company had been on Washington’s radar since the late 1990s, not least because of its expansion in those years into markets presided over by what the US deemed “rogue” regimes, among them Iraq and Russia. The result was that, even after Huawei successfully made big sales in other Western territories after establishing its foothold in Britain, America would remain the one major market in which it failed to make significant inroads, having to satisfy itself there with sales to second- or third-tier network operators. As a potential supplier, the Chinese company was simply beyond the pale for America’s telephony market leaders, for whom political optics and relationships are considered just as important as capital costs and network quality. During the first Trump administration, the US expanded its campaign against Huawei on two new fronts. It imposed export controls, specifically by banning US companies from supplying Huawei with critical components, as they had been doing since as early as 1993, when Huawei established its first US subsidiary in California. And, with some notable successes, the US government also began applying substantial pressure on countries like Australia, Britain, and Canada to follow its lead in blackballing Huawei in their domestic markets, focusing on those countries’ tendering of contracts to build 5G networks. Huawei, however, has prevailed nonetheless, even as there is no doubt that America’s resistance has crimped the scope of its achievements. “The West was continuing to grow more inhospitable toward Huawei,” Dou says by way of bringing her story up to the time of her writing, in 2024. “Yet—almost incredibly—Huawei was still number one in the world in 5G gear sales.” Huawei’s prevailing in the face of the United States’ concerted opposition shows that America is not as powerful or persuasive as it certainly likes to imagine that it is: Not everyone, even its (erstwhile) “friends,” kowtows to its demands. Furthermore, and perhaps more significantly still, the Huawei story demonstrates that in the 21st century, non-Western companies are able to be enormous commercial successes—to be, in fact, world leaders in their chosen industry sectors—while having the US and several other leading Western markets essentially closed off to them. That, in itself, is a profound statement on the shifting of the world economic order, and one that Trump and his cronies evidently seem to be ignoring—or perhaps are unable to understand—as they set about alienating long-time commercial and political allies, in addition to the list of long-time adversaries, by unleashing an all-encompassing trade war the likes of which the world has not seen since the early 20th century. In the postwar era, it would have been unthinkable that a company could have ascended to global market leadership in any area of the economy without a major presence in the United States, Europe, or (more likely) both. That is no longer true. Alongside East Asia and Africa, it is the Middle East, with all its natural-resource-based riches, that represents, in Dou’s words, “the beating heart of Huawei’s global empire.” What is also maddening to Huawei’s American critics is that it has done all this while thumbing its nose at American-style capitalism. For many years, there was widespread expectation around the world, and among many in China itself, that Huawei would proceed to an IPO. This was assumed to be its “natural” evolutionary terminus, the inevitable result of the company’s inculcating, and eventually adopting, the Western gospel of shareholder value. But Huawei never did become a public company, and it never prioritized shareholder value to the exclusion of all else. It was, and is, something else entirely—and that something else has proved a great commercial success. What do we know about the model? Huawei began life as a contract manufacturer. That is, at the start, it did not have its own products, but manufactured those of others—including, most notably, simple analog telephone switches capable of routing and connecting, at most, a few dozen phone calls, which were sold to the likes of small offices and hotels. Huawei was initially a private company, controlled top to bottom by Ren Zhengfei himself and capitalized with the princely sum of 21,000 yuan provided by Ren and five private investors. Five years after its founding, by which time it had developed and begun to sell a first switch of its own (the BH-03), Huawei converted in 1992 to a “collectively owned enterprise,” a company structure that furnished both a degree of political patronage and a set of broader financing opportunities—and which, in Huawei’s case, appeared to entail a more democratic form of management in the shape, in particular, of a powerful workers’ committee. A stimulus for further change came in 1994, a landmark year for China’s corporate landscape, when the country’s new Company Law introduced limited-liability companies (LLCs) with the aims of encouraging greater investment, aligning China’s corporate governance with international standards, and facilitating an accelerated transition to a market economy. Ren was intrigued but not immediately convinced, electing to hire a team of Beijing business professors to help him strategize restructuring opportunities and map out a new future for the firm. Huawei did become an LLC (and remains one today), but only in 1997, at which point the existing employee shareholdings, of which there were a large number, were consolidated into a single “trade union” holding. Meanwhile, the professors’ much-anticipated blueprint, the “Huawei Basic Law,” was adopted the following year. Profit would be just one objective among many; more important was the reinvestment of that profit to drive growth—fully 10 percent of sales were to go into R&D. Dou argues that Huawei is ultimately best understood as a company made in the image of the nation. Its goal is not to increase shareholder value so much as “to ensure its own long-term survival,” as is also true, she points out, of the ruling Communist Party. The secret of Huawei’s success, Dou writes, is its “ability to accomplish titanic tasks at almost impossible speeds by getting everyone to pull in unison.” Reading these words, one can’t help but think, yet again, of China’s titanic ongoing achievements in rolling out renewable energy capacity on a gargantuan scale and at almost impossible speeds. But Dou is also forthright about the considerable downsides of this business approach. Success achieved in the manner of Huawei, she observes, “can come at crushing costs for the individuals involved.” Huawei “fetishized long work hours”—the company’s engineers were accustomed to keeping mats by their desks so they could nap on the floor rather than going home at night. Perhaps worse was that an aggressive, survival-of-the-fittest “wolf culture” was encouraged not just externally, in the rivalry with competitors, but internally, among colleagues. And it surely did not help employees’ mental health to know that the prospect of involuntary redundancy constantly hovered in the background: Huawei, Dou notes, “repeatedly pressured its staff into mass resignations.” In any case, enough is known about the psychological effects to leave the reader in no doubt about the sheer corrosiveness of the Huawei model from a social perspective. Dou reports a “string of ‘unnatural’ deaths,” including suicides, among employees. She also cites the finding of a scholarly study that some two-thirds of Huawei’s senior management were suffering from a stress-related illness. Such figures hint at a milieu beside which even Wall Street’s famously pitiless working culture would likely look positively tranquil. Huawei is a creature of Shenzhen, a city in the coastal province of Guangdong in South China. After the decommissioning of his military unit, the Engineering Corps, a thirtysomething Ren Zhengfei moved to Shenzhen in the early 1980s, initially assigned a job there at a subsidiary of the state-owned South Sea Oil Corporation, which was building a harbor to support offshore oil production. Following a “short and undistinguished” time in this position, Ren—who had made something of a name for himself in the military by building a precision air-pressure generator that he subsequently worked to commercialize—established Huawei. He was 42. He is still the company’s CEO today. It is possible, perhaps even probable, that Huawei could not have become what it did except in Shenzhen. Abutting Hong Kong to its immediate south, Shenzhen was designated as China’s first-ever “special economic zone” in 1980. At the time, it had a population of around 30,000. Physically walled off from the rest of China by barbed-wire fences, it was also walled off figuratively: While the post-Mao reformism of Deng Xiaoping initially proceeded slowly in the country at large, everything was on fast forward in the “wild west” that was late-20th-century Shenzhen, where the normal rules did not apply and an “anything goes” approach prevailed. The city was “ground zero,” Dou writes, for China’s “grand experiment with capitalism.” Ren and Huawei exploited this business environment maximally, as did many others. In the 1980s through the 2010s, Shenzhen was one of the fastest-growing cities in the world: By 2020, its 30,000 inhabitants had become 17.4 million, making the city by then China’s third-largest. Of course, the Chinese “capitalism” with which Ren and others experimented in booming Shenzhen was and is a very special version, and Dou does a wonderful job of picturing its sheer foreignness and oddness, when seen through Western eyes. In no respect, perhaps, is the foreignness of Chinese capitalism more striking than in terms of the relation between firms and the Chinese Communist Party. All companies with a certain proportion of employees who are party members are required to establish an internal party “committee” that gives the CCP a formal role in the company. Huawei set up its committee in 1996, with Ren himself serving as the first secretary. Huawei’s committee infused the company with the CCP’s signature themes of “patriotism, struggle for the greater cause, and self-sacrifice”—no doubt the mats by the engineers’ desks and the surging mental health problems were justified accordingly—and its influence appears only to have grown with time. In 2007, the committee was granted veto power over Huawei’s executive appointments. Indeed, as Western observers have never tired of remarking, Huawei’s fortunes were bound up with the party, and with the state more generally, from the start. The mistake that those observers have made, however, is to think about the Chinese state primarily, and sometimes only, in terms of Beijing, which is to say the central government. To do so, Dou shows us, is to miss one of the most important parts of the Huawei story. The specific products that were key to making Huawei a major commercial force both nationally and internationally were digital telephone switches. Able to route and connect thousands (or even millions) of calls at once compared with the mere dozens handled by analog versions, digital switches constitute the nerve centers of modern public communications networks, directing and managing the flow of data as well as voice packets. When Huawei began working in the early 1990s on the development of digital switches, that work was financed by a joint-venture company called Mobeco, established in 1993. The money behind Mobeco was provided by Huawei’s equity partners in the venture—namely, 17 provincial and municipal (that is, public) telecom bureaus. When Huawei’s first proprietary digital switch (C&C08) went into production in 1995, the same public telecom bureaus that had helped finance its development were now in charge of buying it for their local telephone exchanges. Not only that, but, indirectly at least, they also found themselves manufacturing it: Huawei outsourced the production of C&C08 to Mobeco. In short, what Western observers might understand as conflicts of interest abounded. And Huawei then doubled down, as the success of Mobeco prompted it to expand the model: It set up more such joint ventures with local governments around the country. Dou characterizes these as “Huawei’s ‘marriage’ to the state.” This is not to say that Huawei didn’t have close and efficacious relationships with other arms of the state—for example, “in 2005,” Dou writes, “the China Development Bank, a Beijing-controlled policy bank, allocated a whopping $10 billion to fund Huawei’s overseas expansion.” Despite documenting these various linkages between the company and the state, this is also, paradoxically, where House of Huawei is at its weakest. As Dou observes, amid the 1990s ferment of productive innovation in China, Huawei was one of four major domestic producers of telecom equipment to come to the fore, the others being Datang, Great Dragon, and ZTE. Why, out of these four, did Huawei emerge as the undisputed leader both domestically and, ultimately, internationally? Dou doesn’t—and arguably can’t—answer that question, because despite hinting that Huawei won simply by virtue of outcompeting its rivals, she never actually gets at the question of what “competition” means in the context of Chinese capitalism, saturated as that system is in political influence. Scholars, however, have been exploring this question. The sociologist Kyle Chan, for instance, has examined the nature of competition in sectors of the Chinese economy in which state-owned enterprises (SOEs) play a significant role. His research is highly relevant to the case at hand: Datang, Great Dragon, and ZTE are all owned wholly or mainly by the state. Chan found that industries with a substantial SOE presence, telecommunications included, are characterized by what he calls “managed competition,” representing a blend of state oversight and competitive forces and combining innovation and efficiency, on the one hand, with control and planning on the other. In order to maintain a balance of competitive capabilities among industry actors and thus prevent the formation of monopolies, the state intervenes where necessary, Chan argues, to redistribute resources, personnel, and contracts. There is very little analysis of this kind in House of Huawei. Dou has written a book that is much more interested in personalities, subterfuge, and geopolitics than it is in economics and competitive practice. She helps us understand why Huawei vaulted to the top of US policymakers’ fearful protectionist agenda, but less about how and why it vaulted to the top of the telecommunications industry against both national and international competitors. We are left with much still to understand about Huawei as a particular corporate embodiment of what is, in the Chinese case, a very particular type of capitalist social formation. The chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week. Trump’s catastrophic “Liberation Day” has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called “enemy aliens” are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire. At a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump’s intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account. In just the last month, we’ve published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration’s appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities. We also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections—like Wisconsin’s recent state Supreme Court race—that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can’t buy our democracy.

Title: There’s method in King Donald’s ‘madness’ on China

Skip to comments. Posted on 04/21/2025 8:14:14 PM PDT by cold start Don’t go by the defiant rhetoric, China is hurting and in deep trouble over Trump’s tariffsFor the purpose of writing this column, I had to do some research as I always do. What struck me was how effortlessly China is winning the battle of narratives. It’s all a little confusing. We are apparently in the middle of a trade war, caught in the crossfire as the world’s two largest economies slap each other with tariffs in an escalatory spiral with the Donald Trump administration imposing 145% levies on most Chinese goods this month. That’s more than a little concerning for China, the trade surplus nation that has everything to lose if it is denied access to the American market. Conversely, the United States, the considerably larger and stronger economy that ran a $295.4 billion deficit with China in 2024, is in possession of a whole toolbox of options that it may deploy to increase China’s pain point. That’s economics 101. Countries that enjoy trade surplus, and most certainly China that sends more than $400 billion in goods to the US each year, are vulnerable during trade wars.And yet since the past few weeks western media is chock-full with reports, articles and analyses on China’s ‘impregnable’ economy, its unbeatable resilience, the madness of ‘King Donald’, Xi Jinping’s ‘courage’, ‘moral integrity’ and the fearsome retribution that awaits American economy owing to Trump’s ‘folly’. We are told that China is ‘winning’, Americans are losing, and tottering Trump’s tariff tantrums have presented Xi with a ‘gift’. Portentous pundits pontificate that this is not a trade war, but American economy’s stunning act of suicide led by a dimwit dolt who occupies the Oval Office. China, not one to let go of opportunity, has mounted a meticulously calibrated narrative attack on American social media networks – that are inaccessible to the Chinese – to spread worry and panic over Trump’s decision, and going by the engagements such posts are getting, it would seem the tactic is succeeding. This piece is essentially about setting the record straight. Make no mistake, China is hurting. Trump’s tariffs, that now stand at a staggering 145%, going up to even 245% on certain goods, present an unprecedented challenge for the exports-dependent Chinese economy that is caught in a deflationary loop, and unless the challenge is mitigated there will be punishing job cuts and very little bandwidth for debt-ridden local governments to bail out the struggling sectors. The one thing China cannot afford to do, however, is blink. The Chinese system, led by ‘chairman of everything’ Xi Jinping, is built for stability. It is not meant for adjustments, pliability or conflict. Xi, for all his power, cannot let slip even a hint of weakness. Trump can take unlimited punches, suffer being called a clown, and still stand in the ring. Xi cannot yield even if he’s haemorrhaging. In this piece, I shall strive to explain my position, and elucidate that China’s fire and brimstone rhetoric conceals its deep anxiety and fear underneath. I posit that Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs, that have now been paused against every other nation except China, is in essence an attempt at a systemic reset. It is, of course, done in a very Trumpian fashion with all the trappings of a reality TV show. That is why despite all available evidence to the contrary of the inherent strength of the American economy, most pundits suffering from ‘Trump Derangement Syndrome’ are writing off America’s chances in this trade war, and media’s unbalanced coverage is hinging on an axiomatic position that China can do no wrong. Trump, albeit crudely, is trying to decouple American economy from China’s. He understands perhaps intuitively that China has perfected the art of gaming the system of open trade authored by America to such an extent that while China’s export-driven economy achieved uber-efficiency in a matter of decades – trading with 145 countries in 2023, a rise of almost 50% since 2008 – its economy by and large remained inaccessible to the world. Successive American administrations have identified the problem but have been unable to deal with it. China manipulates the WTO-led open trade order, knows how to exploit the loopholes, and has grown immeasurably prosperous by building a sprawling manufacturing base in a relatively short time at the cost of its peer competitors. Trump considers the trajectory deeply unfair and is ready to take drastic steps. To quote researcher Zineb Riboua of Hudson Institute from her blog, “Trump’s trade war is a reconfiguration. His repeated attacks on the World Trade Organization, threats to withdraw, and efforts to bypass multilateral forums all signal a deeper strategy: to reset the rules of global trade in ways that constrain China’s model. For decades, China used the WTO system to scale its export economy while shielding its domestic market. That asymmetric advantage is now being challenged at the foundation.” Look beyond the sweeping tariffs, and you’ll find a conscious attempt to isolate China by striking deals with America’s trading partners. Whether or not the policy will be successful is moot, what we are watching now is the application of the strategy. Some of the trade negotiations the Trump administrations are involved in right now with a bevy of trading partners are aimed at clamping down on transshipment of Chinese goods that are rerouted through third countries to conceal origins, synchronized taxes, or going after Chinese raw materials meant for the American market. The brain behind this step, according to the Wall Street Journal, is US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who apparently pitched the idea to Trump. It involves systematically removing China from the American economy despite the heavy integration and even potentially delisting Chinese stocks from US exchanges to tackle the “the biggest offender in the global trading system”. Wall Street Journal reports that US officials “plan to use negotiations with more than 70 nations to ask them to disallow China to ship goods through their countries, prevent Chinese firms from locating in their territories to avoid US tariffs, and not absorb China’s cheap industrial goods into their economies.” The Trump White House reckons that if executed, the moves will considerably weaken China’s hand, dent further its already plagued economy and force Beijing to sit across the table with little leverage. It won’t be easy, of course. UK, for example, has dismissed the idea of cutting trade ties with China despite heavy American pressure. However, if the US succeeds in extracting concessions from even some of them – such as Mexico where Chinese firms have invested billions in hundreds of Mexican factories to make millions of products for the American market tariff-free by taking advantage of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement – then the noose will tighten around China. Largely due to China’s machinations – its firms exploiting the Mexican loophole – US trade deficit with Mexico shot up to nearly $172 billion in 2024 from about $78 billion in 2018. (Read the WSJ report here). Or take Vietnam, another favourite destination for Chinese firms to relocate their production. Just like Mexico, that has reportedly offered to match American levies on China to strike a deal with Trump, Vietnam, faced with the prospect of 46% US tariffs, sent a team to Washington and promised to crack down on “trade fraud”, a reference to millions of Chinese goods routed to the US through its territory to avoid American taxes. Chinese tactics range from establishing factories in Vietnam, using Vietnamese workers to process goods for the ‘made in Vietnam’ label, or as Reuters reports, making ships carrying Chinese-made goods dwell in Vietnamese ports “just long enough to obtain documents certifying that the products were made in Vietnam before leaving.” Little wonder that Vietnam now has the fourth-highest trade surplus with the US, next only to China, Mexico and the EU. If these routes are blocked, China would obviously be in deeper trouble. China manufactures far more products than its consumers can absorb, making exports imperative for the wheels of its economy to run. The deflation loop that it suffers from owing to its crisis-ridden real estate sector, where most of the middle-class wealth is parked, is exacerbated by the fact that its export volume far outstrips prices, adding to deflationary pressure. This is exactly where Trump is stress-testing the Chinese economy by levying eye-watering taxes on exports, attempting to shift the entire global trade architecture from ‘open’ to one based on bilateral ‘deals’ and collective coercive mechanisms. China finds Trump difficult to tackle owing to his unpredictability and refusal to play by the established rules, rules that China has spent decades in manipulating. China also finds it discomfiting that for the leader of a democracy, Trump has a higher threshold of pain and is driven by a sense of manifest destiny. This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down. 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/vPgifasYmI — Mao Ning 毛宁 (@SpoxCHN_MaoNing) April 10, 2025 The shrillness can barely conceal the nervousness beneath.

It’s part of a deliberate policy choice that’s fundamental to their strategy for remaining in power. And as such, it puts limits on their ability to respond to a loss of export markets. The Chinese policy of keeping its wealth under the control of the state rather than allowing it to be controlled or shared by the private sector is the basis for the CCP’s tight grip on power. Their control of the government is dependent on an economically dependent populace. Their model for maintaining power is to provide their people with just enough prosperity to keep them compliant, but not enough for them to be in a position to challenge the CCP’s authority. 5 posted on 04/21/2025 10:08:25 PM PDT by mbrfl [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Rockingham One hopes. 6 posted on 04/22/2025 1:14:15 AM PDT by sauropod (Make sure Satan has to climb over a lot of Scripture to get to you.

What struck me was how effortlessly China is winning the battle of narratives. It’s all a little confusing. We are apparently in the middle of a trade war, caught in the crossfire as the world’s two largest economies slap each other with tariffs in an escalatory spiral with the Donald Trump administration imposing 145% levies on most Chinese goods this month. That’s more than a little concerning for China, the trade surplus nation that has everything to lose if it is denied access to the American market. Conversely, the United States, the considerably larger and stronger economy that ran a $295.4 billion deficit with China in 2024, is in possession of a whole toolbox of options that it may deploy to increase China’s pain point. That’s economics 101. Countries that enjoy trade surplus, and most certainly China that sends more than $400 billion in goods to the US each year, are vulnerable during trade wars.And yet since the past few weeks western media is chock-full with reports, articles and analyses on China’s ‘impregnable’ economy, its unbeatable resilience, the madness of ‘King Donald’, Xi Jinping’s ‘courage’, ‘moral integrity’ and the fearsome retribution that awaits American economy owing to Trump’s ‘folly’. We are told that China is ‘winning’, Americans are losing, and tottering Trump’s tariff tantrums have presented Xi with a ‘gift’. Portentous pundits pontificate that this is not a trade war, but American economy’s stunning act of suicide led by a dimwit dolt who occupies the Oval Office. China, not one to let go of opportunity, has mounted a meticulously calibrated narrative attack on American social media networks – that are inaccessible to the Chinese – to spread worry and panic over Trump’s decision, and going by the engagements such posts are getting, it would seem the tactic is succeeding. This piece is essentially about setting the record straight. Make no mistake, China is hurting. Trump’s tariffs, that now stand at a staggering 145%, going up to even 245% on certain goods, present an unprecedented challenge for the exports-dependent Chinese economy that is caught in a deflationary loop, and unless the challenge is mitigated there will be punishing job cuts and very little bandwidth for debt-ridden local governments to bail out the struggling sectors. The one thing China cannot afford to do, however, is blink. The Chinese system, led by ‘chairman of everything’ Xi Jinping, is built for stability. It is not meant for adjustments, pliability or conflict. Xi, for all his power, cannot let slip even a hint of weakness. Trump can take unlimited punches, suffer being called a clown, and still stand in the ring. Xi cannot yield even if he’s haemorrhaging. In this piece, I shall strive to explain my position, and elucidate that China’s fire and brimstone rhetoric conceals its deep anxiety and fear underneath. I posit that Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs, that have now been paused against every other nation except China, is in essence an attempt at a systemic reset. It is, of course, done in a very Trumpian fashion with all the trappings of a reality TV show.

It won’t be easy, of course. UK, for example, has dismissed the idea of cutting trade ties with China despite heavy American pressure. However, if the US succeeds in extracting concessions from even some of them – such as Mexico where Chinese firms have invested billions in hundreds of Mexican factories to make millions of products for the American market tariff-free by taking advantage of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement – then the noose will tighten around China. Largely due to China’s machinations – its firms exploiting the Mexican loophole – US trade deficit with Mexico shot up to nearly $172 billion in 2024 from about $78 billion in 2018.

Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products.

It’s part of a deliberate policy choice that’s fundamental to their strategy for remaining in power. And as such, it puts limits on their ability to respond to a loss of export markets. The Chinese policy of keeping its wealth under the control of the state rather than allowing it to be controlled or shared by the private sector is the basis for the CCP’s tight grip on power. Their control of the government is dependent on an economically dependent populace. Their model for maintaining power is to provide their people with just enough prosperity to keep them compliant, but not enough for them to be in a position to challenge the CCP’s authority. 5 posted on 04/21/2025 10:08:25 PM PDT by mbrfl [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Rockingham One hopes. 6 posted on 04/22/2025 1:14:15 AM PDT by sauropod (Make sure Satan has to climb over a lot of Scripture to get to you.

We are apparently in the middle of a trade war, caught in the crossfire as the world’s two largest economies slap each other with tariffs in an escalatory spiral with the Donald Trump administration imposing 145% levies on most Chinese goods this month. That’s more than a little concerning for China, the trade surplus nation that has everything to lose if it is denied access to the American market. Conversely, the United States, the considerably larger and stronger economy that ran a $295.4 billion deficit with China in 2024, is in possession of a whole toolbox of options that it may deploy to increase China’s pain point. That’s economics 101. Countries that enjoy trade surplus, and most certainly China that sends more than $400 billion in goods to the US each year, are vulnerable during trade wars.And yet since the past few weeks western media is chock-full with reports, articles and analyses on China’s ‘impregnable’ economy, its unbeatable resilience, the madness of ‘King Donald’, Xi Jinping’s ‘courage’, ‘moral integrity’ and the fearsome retribution that awaits American economy owing to Trump’s ‘folly’. We are told that China is ‘winning’, Americans are losing, and tottering Trump’s tariff tantrums have presented Xi with a ‘gift’. Portentous pundits pontificate that this is not a trade war, but American economy’s stunning act of suicide led by a dimwit dolt who occupies the Oval Office. China, not one to let go of opportunity, has mounted a meticulously calibrated narrative attack on American social media networks – that are inaccessible to the Chinese – to spread worry and panic over Trump’s decision, and going by the engagements such posts are getting, it would seem the tactic is succeeding. This piece is essentially about setting the record straight. Make no mistake, China is hurting. Trump’s tariffs, that now stand at a staggering 145%, going up to even 245% on certain goods, present an unprecedented challenge for the exports-dependent Chinese economy that is caught in a deflationary loop, and unless the challenge is mitigated there will be punishing job cuts and very little bandwidth for debt-ridden local governments to bail out the struggling sectors. The one thing China cannot afford to do, however, is blink. The Chinese system, led by ‘chairman of everything’ Xi Jinping, is built for stability. It is not meant for adjustments, pliability or conflict. Xi, for all his power, cannot let slip even a hint of weakness. Trump can take unlimited punches, suffer being called a clown, and still stand in the ring. Xi cannot yield even if he’s haemorrhaging. In this piece, I shall strive to explain my position, and elucidate that China’s fire and brimstone rhetoric conceals its deep anxiety and fear underneath. I posit that Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs, that have now been paused against every other nation except China, is in essence an attempt at a systemic reset. It is, of course, done in a very Trumpian fashion with all the trappings of a reality TV show. That is why despite all available evidence to the contrary of the inherent strength of the American economy, most pundits suffering from ‘Trump Derangement Syndrome’ are writing off America’s chances in this trade war, and media’s unbalanced coverage is hinging on an axiomatic position that China can do no wrong. Trump, albeit crudely, is trying to decouple American economy from China’s. He understands perhaps intuitively that China has perfected the art of gaming the system of open trade authored by America to such an extent that while China’s export-driven economy achieved uber-efficiency in a matter of decades – trading with 145 countries in 2023, a rise of almost 50% since 2008 – its economy by and large remained inaccessible to the world. Successive American administrations have identified the problem but have been unable to deal with it. China manipulates the WTO-led open trade order, knows how to exploit the loopholes, and has grown immeasurably prosperous by building a sprawling manufacturing base in a relatively short time at the cost of its peer competitors. Trump considers the trajectory deeply unfair and is ready to take drastic steps. To quote researcher Zineb Riboua of Hudson Institute from her blog, “Trump’s trade war is a reconfiguration. His repeated attacks on the World Trade Organization, threats to withdraw, and efforts to bypass multilateral forums all signal a deeper strategy: to reset the rules of global trade in ways that constrain China’s model. For decades, China used the WTO system to scale its export economy while shielding its domestic market. That asymmetric advantage is now being challenged at the foundation.” Look beyond the sweeping tariffs, and you’ll find a conscious attempt to isolate China by striking deals with America’s trading partners. Whether or not the policy will be successful is moot, what we are watching now is the application of the strategy. Some of the trade negotiations the Trump administrations are involved in right now with a bevy of trading partners are aimed at clamping down on transshipment of Chinese goods that are rerouted through third countries to conceal origins, synchronized taxes, or going after Chinese raw materials meant for the American market. The brain behind this step, according to the Wall Street Journal, is US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who apparently pitched the idea to Trump. It involves systematically removing China from the American economy despite the heavy integration and even potentially delisting Chinese stocks from US exchanges to tackle the “the biggest offender in the global trading system”. Wall Street Journal reports that US officials “plan to use negotiations with more than 70 nations to ask them to disallow China to ship goods through their countries, prevent Chinese firms from locating in their territories to avoid US tariffs, and not absorb China’s cheap industrial goods into their economies.” The Trump White House reckons that if executed, the moves will considerably weaken China’s hand, dent further its already plagued economy and force Beijing to sit across the table with little leverage. It won’t be easy, of course. UK, for example, has dismissed the idea of cutting trade ties with China despite heavy American pressure. However, if the US succeeds in extracting concessions from even some of them – such as Mexico where Chinese firms have invested billions in hundreds of Mexican factories to make millions of products for the American market tariff-free by taking advantage of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement – then the noose will tighten around China. Largely due to China’s machinations – its firms exploiting the Mexican loophole – US trade deficit with Mexico shot up to nearly $172 billion in 2024 from about $78 billion in 2018. (Read the WSJ report here). Or take Vietnam, another favourite destination for Chinese firms to relocate their production. Just like Mexico, that has reportedly offered to match American levies on China to strike a deal with Trump, Vietnam, faced with the prospect of 46% US tariffs, sent a team to Washington and promised to crack down on “trade fraud”, a reference to millions of Chinese goods routed to the US through its territory to avoid American taxes. Chinese tactics range from establishing factories in Vietnam, using Vietnamese workers to process goods for the ‘made in Vietnam’ label, or as Reuters reports, making ships carrying Chinese-made goods dwell in Vietnamese ports “just long enough to obtain documents certifying that the products were made in Vietnam before leaving.” Little wonder that Vietnam now has the fourth-highest trade surplus with the US, next only to China, Mexico and the EU. If these routes are blocked, China would obviously be in deeper trouble. China manufactures far more products than its consumers can absorb, making exports imperative for the wheels of its economy to run. The deflation loop that it suffers from owing to its crisis-ridden real estate sector, where most of the middle-class wealth is parked, is exacerbated by the fact that its export volume far outstrips prices, adding to deflationary pressure. This is exactly where Trump is stress-testing the Chinese economy by levying eye-watering taxes on exports, attempting to shift the entire global trade architecture from ‘open’ to one based on bilateral ‘deals’ and collective coercive mechanisms. China finds Trump difficult to tackle owing to his unpredictability and refusal to play by the established rules, rules that China has spent decades in manipulating. China also finds it discomfiting that for the leader of a democracy, Trump has a higher threshold of pain and is driven by a sense of manifest destiny. This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down. 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/vPgifasYmI — Mao Ning 毛宁 (@SpoxCHN_MaoNing) April 10, 2025 The shrillness can barely conceal the nervousness beneath.

If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down. 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/vPgifasYmI — Mao Ning 毛宁 (@SpoxCHN_MaoNing) April 10, 2025 The shrillness can barely conceal the nervousness beneath.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson This piece is essentially about setting the record straight. Make no mistake, China is hurting. Trump’s tariffs, that now stand at a staggering 145%, going up to even 245% on certain goods, present an unprecedented challenge for the exports-dependent Chinese economy that is caught in a deflationary loop, and unless the challenge is mitigated there will be punishing job cuts and very little bandwidth for debt-ridden local governments to bail out the struggling sectors. The one thing China cannot afford to do, however, is blink. The Chinese system, led by ‘chairman of everything’ Xi Jinping, is built for stability. It is not meant for adjustments, pliability or conflict. Xi, for all his power, cannot let slip even a hint of weakness. Trump can take unlimited punches, suffer being called a clown, and still stand in the ring. Xi cannot yield even if he’s haemorrhaging. In this piece, I shall strive to explain my position, and elucidate that China’s fire and brimstone rhetoric conceals its deep anxiety and fear underneath. I posit that Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs, that have now been paused against every other nation except China, is in essence an attempt at a systemic reset. It is, of course, done in a very Trumpian fashion with all the trappings of a reality TV show. That is why despite all available evidence to the contrary of the inherent strength of the American economy, most pundits suffering from ‘Trump Derangement Syndrome’ are writing off America’s chances in this trade war, and media’s unbalanced coverage is hinging on an axiomatic position that China can do no wrong. Trump, albeit crudely, is trying to decouple American economy from China’s. He understands perhaps intuitively that China has perfected the art of gaming the system of open trade authored by America to such an extent that while China’s export-driven economy achieved uber-efficiency in a matter of decades – trading with 145 countries in 2023, a rise of almost 50% since 2008 – its economy by and large remained inaccessible to the world. Successive American administrations have identified the problem but have been unable to deal with it. China manipulates the WTO-led open trade order, knows how to exploit the loopholes, and has grown immeasurably prosperous by building a sprawling manufacturing base in a relatively short time at the cost of its peer competitors. Trump considers the trajectory deeply unfair and is ready to take drastic steps. To quote researcher Zineb Riboua of Hudson Institute from her blog, “Trump’s trade war is a reconfiguration. His repeated attacks on the World Trade Organization, threats to withdraw, and efforts to bypass multilateral forums all signal a deeper strategy: to reset the rules of global trade in ways that constrain China’s model. For decades, China used the WTO system to scale its export economy while shielding its domestic market. That asymmetric advantage is now being challenged at the foundation.” Look beyond the sweeping tariffs, and you’ll find a conscious attempt to isolate China by striking deals with America’s trading partners. Whether or not the policy will be successful is moot, what we are watching now is the application of the strategy. Some of the trade negotiations the Trump administrations are involved in right now with a bevy of trading partners are aimed at clamping down on transshipment of Chinese goods that are rerouted through third countries to conceal origins, synchronized taxes, or going after Chinese raw materials meant for the American market. The brain behind this step, according to the Wall Street Journal, is US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who apparently pitched the idea to Trump. It involves systematically removing China from the American economy despite the heavy integration and even potentially delisting Chinese stocks from US exchanges to tackle the “the biggest offender in the global trading system”. Wall Street Journal reports that US officials “plan to use negotiations with more than 70 nations to ask them to disallow China to ship goods through their countries, prevent Chinese firms from locating in their territories to avoid US tariffs, and not absorb China’s cheap industrial goods into their economies.” The Trump White House reckons that if executed, the moves will considerably weaken China’s hand, dent further its already plagued economy and force Beijing to sit across the table with little leverage. It won’t be easy, of course. UK, for example, has dismissed the idea of cutting trade ties with China despite heavy American pressure. However, if the US succeeds in extracting concessions from even some of them – such as Mexico where Chinese firms have invested billions in hundreds of Mexican factories to make millions of products for the American market tariff-free by taking advantage of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement – then the noose will tighten around China. Largely due to China’s machinations – its firms exploiting the Mexican loophole – US trade deficit with Mexico shot up to nearly $172 billion in 2024 from about $78 billion in 2018. (Read the WSJ report here). Or take Vietnam, another favourite destination for Chinese firms to relocate their production. Just like Mexico, that has reportedly offered to match American levies on China to strike a deal with Trump, Vietnam, faced with the prospect of 46% US tariffs, sent a team to Washington and promised to crack down on “trade fraud”, a reference to millions of Chinese goods routed to the US through its territory to avoid American taxes. Chinese tactics range from establishing factories in Vietnam, using Vietnamese workers to process goods for the ‘made in Vietnam’ label, or as Reuters reports, making ships carrying Chinese-made goods dwell in Vietnamese ports “just long enough to obtain documents certifying that the products were made in Vietnam before leaving.” Little wonder that Vietnam now has the fourth-highest trade surplus with the US, next only to China, Mexico and the EU. If these routes are blocked, China would obviously be in deeper trouble. China manufactures far more products than its consumers can absorb, making exports imperative for the wheels of its economy to run. The deflation loop that it suffers from owing to its crisis-ridden real estate sector, where most of the middle-class wealth is parked, is exacerbated by the fact that its export volume far outstrips prices, adding to deflationary pressure. This is exactly where Trump is stress-testing the Chinese economy by levying eye-watering taxes on exports, attempting to shift the entire global trade architecture from ‘open’ to one based on bilateral ‘deals’ and collective coercive mechanisms. China finds Trump difficult to tackle owing to his unpredictability and refusal to play by the established rules, rules that China has spent decades in manipulating. China also finds it discomfiting that for the leader of a democracy, Trump has a higher threshold of pain and is driven by a sense of manifest destiny. This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people.

He understands perhaps intuitively that China has perfected the art of gaming the system of open trade authored by America to such an extent that while China’s export-driven economy achieved uber-efficiency in a matter of decades – trading with 145 countries in 2023, a rise of almost 50% since 2008 – its economy by and large remained inaccessible to the world. Successive American administrations have identified the problem but have been unable to deal with it. China manipulates the WTO-led open trade order, knows how to exploit the loopholes, and has grown immeasurably prosperous by building a sprawling manufacturing base in a relatively short time at the cost of its peer competitors. Trump considers the trajectory deeply unfair and is ready to take drastic steps. To quote researcher Zineb Riboua of Hudson Institute from her blog, “Trump’s trade war is a reconfiguration. His repeated attacks on the World Trade Organization, threats to withdraw, and efforts to bypass multilateral forums all signal a deeper strategy: to reset the rules of global trade in ways that constrain China’s model. For decades, China used the WTO system to scale its export economy while shielding its domestic market. That asymmetric advantage is now being challenged at the foundation.” Look beyond the sweeping tariffs, and you’ll find a conscious attempt to isolate China by striking deals with America’s trading partners. Whether or not the policy will be successful is moot, what we are watching now is the application of the strategy. Some of the trade negotiations the Trump administrations are involved in right now with a bevy of trading partners are aimed at clamping down on transshipment of Chinese goods that are rerouted through third countries to conceal origins, synchronized taxes, or going after Chinese raw materials meant for the American market. The brain behind this step, according to the Wall Street Journal, is US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who apparently pitched the idea to Trump. It involves systematically removing China from the American economy despite the heavy integration and even potentially delisting Chinese stocks from US exchanges to tackle the “the biggest offender in the global trading system”. Wall Street Journal reports that US officials “plan to use negotiations with more than 70 nations to ask them to disallow China to ship goods through their countries, prevent Chinese firms from locating in their territories to avoid US tariffs, and not absorb China’s cheap industrial goods into their economies.” The Trump White House reckons that if executed, the moves will considerably weaken China’s hand, dent further its already plagued economy and force Beijing to sit across the table with little leverage. It won’t be easy, of course. UK, for example, has dismissed the idea of cutting trade ties with China despite heavy American pressure. However, if the US succeeds in extracting concessions from even some of them – such as Mexico where Chinese firms have invested billions in hundreds of Mexican factories to make millions of products for the American market tariff-free by taking advantage of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement – then the noose will tighten around China. Largely due to China’s machinations – its firms exploiting the Mexican loophole – US trade deficit with Mexico shot up to nearly $172 billion in 2024 from about $78 billion in 2018. (Read the WSJ report here). Or take Vietnam, another favourite destination for Chinese firms to relocate their production. Just like Mexico, that has reportedly offered to match American levies on China to strike a deal with Trump, Vietnam, faced with the prospect of 46% US tariffs, sent a team to Washington and promised to crack down on “trade fraud”, a reference to millions of Chinese goods routed to the US through its territory to avoid American taxes. Chinese tactics range from establishing factories in Vietnam, using Vietnamese workers to process goods for the ‘made in Vietnam’ label, or as Reuters reports, making ships carrying Chinese-made goods dwell in Vietnamese ports “just long enough to obtain documents certifying that the products were made in Vietnam before leaving.” Little wonder that Vietnam now has the fourth-highest trade surplus with the US, next only to China, Mexico and the EU. If these routes are blocked, China would obviously be in deeper trouble. China manufactures far more products than its consumers can absorb, making exports imperative for the wheels of its economy to run. The deflation loop that it suffers from owing to its crisis-ridden real estate sector, where most of the middle-class wealth is parked, is exacerbated by the fact that its export volume far outstrips prices, adding to deflationary pressure. This is exactly where Trump is stress-testing the Chinese economy by levying eye-watering taxes on exports, attempting to shift the entire global trade architecture from ‘open’ to one based on bilateral ‘deals’ and collective coercive mechanisms. China finds Trump difficult to tackle owing to his unpredictability and refusal to play by the established rules, rules that China has spent decades in manipulating. China also finds it discomfiting that for the leader of a democracy, Trump has a higher threshold of pain and is driven by a sense of manifest destiny. This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down. 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/vPgifasYmI — Mao Ning 毛宁 (@SpoxCHN_MaoNing) April 10, 2025 The shrillness can barely conceal the nervousness beneath.

I posit that Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs, that have now been paused against every other nation except China, is in essence an attempt at a systemic reset. It is, of course, done in a very Trumpian fashion with all the trappings of a reality TV show. That is why despite all available evidence to the contrary of the inherent strength of the American economy, most pundits suffering from ‘Trump Derangement Syndrome’ are writing off America’s chances in this trade war, and media’s unbalanced coverage is hinging on an axiomatic position that China can do no wrong. Trump, albeit crudely, is trying to decouple American economy from China’s. He understands perhaps intuitively that China has perfected the art of gaming the system of open trade authored by America to such an extent that while China’s export-driven economy achieved uber-efficiency in a matter of decades – trading with 145 countries in 2023, a rise of almost 50% since 2008 – its economy by and large remained inaccessible to the world. Successive American administrations have identified the problem but have been unable to deal with it. China manipulates the WTO-led open trade order, knows how to exploit the loopholes, and has grown immeasurably prosperous by building a sprawling manufacturing base in a relatively short time at the cost of its peer competitors. Trump considers the trajectory deeply unfair and is ready to take drastic steps. To quote researcher Zineb Riboua of Hudson Institute from her blog, “Trump’s trade war is a reconfiguration. His repeated attacks on the World Trade Organization, threats to withdraw, and efforts to bypass multilateral forums all signal a deeper strategy: to reset the rules of global trade in ways that constrain China’s model. For decades, China used the WTO system to scale its export economy while shielding its domestic market. That asymmetric advantage is now being challenged at the foundation.” Look beyond the sweeping tariffs, and you’ll find a conscious attempt to isolate China by striking deals with America’s trading partners. Whether or not the policy will be successful is moot, what we are watching now is the application of the strategy. Some of the trade negotiations the Trump administrations are involved in right now with a bevy of trading partners are aimed at clamping down on transshipment of Chinese goods that are rerouted through third countries to conceal origins, synchronized taxes, or going after Chinese raw materials meant for the American market. The brain behind this step, according to the Wall Street Journal, is US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who apparently pitched the idea to Trump. It involves systematically removing China from the American economy despite the heavy integration and even potentially delisting Chinese stocks from US exchanges to tackle the “the biggest offender in the global trading system”.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson I posit that Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs, that have now been paused against every other nation except China, is in essence an attempt at a systemic reset. It is, of course, done in a very Trumpian fashion with all the trappings of a reality TV show. That is why despite all available evidence to the contrary of the inherent strength of the American economy, most pundits suffering from ‘Trump Derangement Syndrome’ are writing off America’s chances in this trade war, and media’s unbalanced coverage is hinging on an axiomatic position that China can do no wrong. Trump, albeit crudely, is trying to decouple American economy from China’s. He understands perhaps intuitively that China has perfected the art of gaming the system of open trade authored by America to such an extent that while China’s export-driven economy achieved uber-efficiency in a matter of decades – trading with 145 countries in 2023, a rise of almost 50% since 2008 – its economy by and large remained inaccessible to the world. Successive American administrations have identified the problem but have been unable to deal with it. China manipulates the WTO-led open trade order, knows how to exploit the loopholes, and has grown immeasurably prosperous by building a sprawling manufacturing base in a relatively short time at the cost of its peer competitors. Trump considers the trajectory deeply unfair and is ready to take drastic steps. To quote researcher Zineb Riboua of Hudson Institute from her blog, “Trump’s trade war is a reconfiguration. His repeated attacks on the World Trade Organization, threats to withdraw, and efforts to bypass multilateral forums all signal a deeper strategy: to reset the rules of global trade in ways that constrain China’s model. For decades, China used the WTO system to scale its export economy while shielding its domestic market. That asymmetric advantage is now being challenged at the foundation.” Look beyond the sweeping tariffs, and you’ll find a conscious attempt to isolate China by striking deals with America’s trading partners. Whether or not the policy will be successful is moot, what we are watching now is the application of the strategy. Some of the trade negotiations the Trump administrations are involved in right now with a bevy of trading partners are aimed at clamping down on transshipment of Chinese goods that are rerouted through third countries to conceal origins, synchronized taxes, or going after Chinese raw materials meant for the American market. The brain behind this step, according to the Wall Street Journal, is US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who apparently pitched the idea to Trump. It involves systematically removing China from the American economy despite the heavy integration and even potentially delisting Chinese stocks from US exchanges to tackle the “the biggest offender in the global trading system”. Wall Street Journal reports that US officials “plan to use negotiations with more than 70 nations to ask them to disallow China to ship goods through their countries, prevent Chinese firms from locating in their territories to avoid US tariffs, and not absorb China’s cheap industrial goods into their economies.” The Trump White House reckons that if executed, the moves will considerably weaken China’s hand, dent further its already plagued economy and force Beijing to sit across the table with little leverage. It won’t be easy, of course. UK, for example, has dismissed the idea of cutting trade ties with China despite heavy American pressure. However, if the US succeeds in extracting concessions from even some of them – such as Mexico where Chinese firms have invested billions in hundreds of Mexican factories to make millions of products for the American market tariff-free by taking advantage of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement – then the noose will tighten around China. Largely due to China’s machinations – its firms exploiting the Mexican loophole – US trade deficit with Mexico shot up to nearly $172 billion in 2024 from about $78 billion in 2018. (Read the WSJ report here). Or take Vietnam, another favourite destination for Chinese firms to relocate their production. Just like Mexico, that has reportedly offered to match American levies on China to strike a deal with Trump, Vietnam, faced with the prospect of 46% US tariffs, sent a team to Washington and promised to crack down on “trade fraud”, a reference to millions of Chinese goods routed to the US through its territory to avoid American taxes. Chinese tactics range from establishing factories in Vietnam, using Vietnamese workers to process goods for the ‘made in Vietnam’ label, or as Reuters reports, making ships carrying Chinese-made goods dwell in Vietnamese ports “just long enough to obtain documents certifying that the products were made in Vietnam before leaving.” Little wonder that Vietnam now has the fourth-highest trade surplus with the US, next only to China, Mexico and the EU. If these routes are blocked, China would obviously be in deeper trouble. China manufactures far more products than its consumers can absorb, making exports imperative for the wheels of its economy to run. The deflation loop that it suffers from owing to its crisis-ridden real estate sector, where most of the middle-class wealth is parked, is exacerbated by the fact that its export volume far outstrips prices, adding to deflationary pressure. This is exactly where Trump is stress-testing the Chinese economy by levying eye-watering taxes on exports, attempting to shift the entire global trade architecture from ‘open’ to one based on bilateral ‘deals’ and collective coercive mechanisms. China finds Trump difficult to tackle owing to his unpredictability and refusal to play by the established rules, rules that China has spent decades in manipulating. China also finds it discomfiting that for the leader of a democracy, Trump has a higher threshold of pain and is driven by a sense of manifest destiny. This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down. 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/vPgifasYmI — Mao Ning 毛宁 (@SpoxCHN_MaoNing) April 10, 2025 The shrillness can barely conceal the nervousness beneath.

It’s part of a deliberate policy choice that’s fundamental to their strategy for remaining in power. And as such, it puts limits on their ability to respond to a loss of export markets. The Chinese policy of keeping its wealth under the control of the state rather than allowing it to be controlled or shared by the private sector is the basis for the CCP’s tight grip on power. Their control of the government is dependent on an economically dependent populace. Their model for maintaining power is to provide their people with just enough prosperity to keep them compliant, but not enough for them to be in a position to challenge the CCP’s authority. 5 posted on 04/21/2025 10:08:25 PM PDT by mbrfl [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Rockingham One hopes. 6 posted on 04/22/2025 1:14:15 AM PDT by sauropod (Make sure Satan has to climb over a lot of Scripture to get to you.

China manipulates the WTO-led open trade order, knows how to exploit the loopholes, and has grown immeasurably prosperous by building a sprawling manufacturing base in a relatively short time at the cost of its peer competitors. Trump considers the trajectory deeply unfair and is ready to take drastic steps. To quote researcher Zineb Riboua of Hudson Institute from her blog, “Trump’s trade war is a reconfiguration. His repeated attacks on the World Trade Organization, threats to withdraw, and efforts to bypass multilateral forums all signal a deeper strategy: to reset the rules of global trade in ways that constrain China’s model. For decades, China used the WTO system to scale its export economy while shielding its domestic market. That asymmetric advantage is now being challenged at the foundation.” Look beyond the sweeping tariffs, and you’ll find a conscious attempt to isolate China by striking deals with America’s trading partners. Whether or not the policy will be successful is moot, what we are watching now is the application of the strategy. Some of the trade negotiations the Trump administrations are involved in right now with a bevy of trading partners are aimed at clamping down on transshipment of Chinese goods that are rerouted through third countries to conceal origins, synchronized taxes, or going after Chinese raw materials meant for the American market. The brain behind this step, according to the Wall Street Journal, is US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who apparently pitched the idea to Trump. It involves systematically removing China from the American economy despite the heavy integration and even potentially delisting Chinese stocks from US exchanges to tackle the “the biggest offender in the global trading system”. Wall Street Journal reports that US officials “plan to use negotiations with more than 70 nations to ask them to disallow China to ship goods through their countries, prevent Chinese firms from locating in their territories to avoid US tariffs, and not absorb China’s cheap industrial goods into their economies.” The Trump White House reckons that if executed, the moves will considerably weaken China’s hand, dent further its already plagued economy and force Beijing to sit across the table with little leverage. It won’t be easy, of course. UK, for example, has dismissed the idea of cutting trade ties with China despite heavy American pressure. However, if the US succeeds in extracting concessions from even some of them – such as Mexico where Chinese firms have invested billions in hundreds of Mexican factories to make millions of products for the American market tariff-free by taking advantage of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement – then the noose will tighten around China. Largely due to China’s machinations – its firms exploiting the Mexican loophole – US trade deficit with Mexico shot up to nearly $172 billion in 2024 from about $78 billion in 2018. (Read the WSJ report here). Or take Vietnam, another favourite destination for Chinese firms to relocate their production. Just like Mexico, that has reportedly offered to match American levies on China to strike a deal with Trump, Vietnam, faced with the prospect of 46% US tariffs, sent a team to Washington and promised to crack down on “trade fraud”, a reference to millions of Chinese goods routed to the US through its territory to avoid American taxes. Chinese tactics range from establishing factories in Vietnam, using Vietnamese workers to process goods for the ‘made in Vietnam’ label, or as Reuters reports, making ships carrying Chinese-made goods dwell in Vietnamese ports “just long enough to obtain documents certifying that the products were made in Vietnam before leaving.” Little wonder that Vietnam now has the fourth-highest trade surplus with the US, next only to China, Mexico and the EU. If these routes are blocked, China would obviously be in deeper trouble. China manufactures far more products than its consumers can absorb, making exports imperative for the wheels of its economy to run. The deflation loop that it suffers from owing to its crisis-ridden real estate sector, where most of the middle-class wealth is parked, is exacerbated by the fact that its export volume far outstrips prices, adding to deflationary pressure. This is exactly where Trump is stress-testing the Chinese economy by levying eye-watering taxes on exports, attempting to shift the entire global trade architecture from ‘open’ to one based on bilateral ‘deals’ and collective coercive mechanisms. China finds Trump difficult to tackle owing to his unpredictability and refusal to play by the established rules, rules that China has spent decades in manipulating. China also finds it discomfiting that for the leader of a democracy, Trump has a higher threshold of pain and is driven by a sense of manifest destiny. This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down. 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/vPgifasYmI — Mao Ning 毛宁 (@SpoxCHN_MaoNing) April 10, 2025 The shrillness can barely conceal the nervousness beneath.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The brain behind this step, according to the Wall Street Journal, is US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who apparently pitched the idea to Trump. It involves systematically removing China from the American economy despite the heavy integration and even potentially delisting Chinese stocks from US exchanges to tackle the “the biggest offender in the global trading system”. Wall Street Journal reports that US officials “plan to use negotiations with more than 70 nations to ask them to disallow China to ship goods through their countries, prevent Chinese firms from locating in their territories to avoid US tariffs, and not absorb China’s cheap industrial goods into their economies.” The Trump White House reckons that if executed, the moves will considerably weaken China’s hand, dent further its already plagued economy and force Beijing to sit across the table with little leverage. It won’t be easy, of course. UK, for example, has dismissed the idea of cutting trade ties with China despite heavy American pressure. However, if the US succeeds in extracting concessions from even some of them – such as Mexico where Chinese firms have invested billions in hundreds of Mexican factories to make millions of products for the American market tariff-free by taking advantage of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement – then the noose will tighten around China. Largely due to China’s machinations – its firms exploiting the Mexican loophole – US trade deficit with Mexico shot up to nearly $172 billion in 2024 from about $78 billion in 2018. (Read the WSJ report here). Or take Vietnam, another favourite destination for Chinese firms to relocate their production. Just like Mexico, that has reportedly offered to match American levies on China to strike a deal with Trump, Vietnam, faced with the prospect of 46% US tariffs, sent a team to Washington and promised to crack down on “trade fraud”, a reference to millions of Chinese goods routed to the US through its territory to avoid American taxes. Chinese tactics range from establishing factories in Vietnam, using Vietnamese workers to process goods for the ‘made in Vietnam’ label, or as Reuters reports, making ships carrying Chinese-made goods dwell in Vietnamese ports “just long enough to obtain documents certifying that the products were made in Vietnam before leaving.” Little wonder that Vietnam now has the fourth-highest trade surplus with the US, next only to China, Mexico and the EU. If these routes are blocked, China would obviously be in deeper trouble. China manufactures far more products than its consumers can absorb, making exports imperative for the wheels of its economy to run. The deflation loop that it suffers from owing to its crisis-ridden real estate sector, where most of the middle-class wealth is parked, is exacerbated by the fact that its export volume far outstrips prices, adding to deflationary pressure. This is exactly where Trump is stress-testing the Chinese economy by levying eye-watering taxes on exports, attempting to shift the entire global trade architecture from ‘open’ to one based on bilateral ‘deals’ and collective coercive mechanisms. China finds Trump difficult to tackle owing to his unpredictability and refusal to play by the established rules, rules that China has spent decades in manipulating. China also finds it discomfiting that for the leader of a democracy, Trump has a higher threshold of pain and is driven by a sense of manifest destiny. This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese.

UK, for example, has dismissed the idea of cutting trade ties with China despite heavy American pressure. However, if the US succeeds in extracting concessions from even some of them – such as Mexico where Chinese firms have invested billions in hundreds of Mexican factories to make millions of products for the American market tariff-free by taking advantage of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement – then the noose will tighten around China. Largely due to China’s machinations – its firms exploiting the Mexican loophole – US trade deficit with Mexico shot up to nearly $172 billion in 2024 from about $78 billion in 2018. (Read the WSJ report here). Or take Vietnam, another favourite destination for Chinese firms to relocate their production. Just like Mexico, that has reportedly offered to match American levies on China to strike a deal with Trump, Vietnam, faced with the prospect of 46% US tariffs, sent a team to Washington and promised to crack down on “trade fraud”, a reference to millions of Chinese goods routed to the US through its territory to avoid American taxes. Chinese tactics range from establishing factories in Vietnam, using Vietnamese workers to process goods for the ‘made in Vietnam’ label, or as Reuters reports, making ships carrying Chinese-made goods dwell in Vietnamese ports “just long enough to obtain documents certifying that the products were made in Vietnam before leaving.” Little wonder that Vietnam now has the fourth-highest trade surplus with the US, next only to China, Mexico and the EU. If these routes are blocked, China would obviously be in deeper trouble. China manufactures far more products than its consumers can absorb, making exports imperative for the wheels of its economy to run. The deflation loop that it suffers from owing to its crisis-ridden real estate sector, where most of the middle-class wealth is parked, is exacerbated by the fact that its export volume far outstrips prices, adding to deflationary pressure. This is exactly where Trump is stress-testing the Chinese economy by levying eye-watering taxes on exports, attempting to shift the entire global trade architecture from ‘open’ to one based on bilateral ‘deals’ and collective coercive mechanisms. China finds Trump difficult to tackle owing to his unpredictability and refusal to play by the established rules, rules that China has spent decades in manipulating. China also finds it discomfiting that for the leader of a democracy, Trump has a higher threshold of pain and is driven by a sense of manifest destiny. This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down. 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/vPgifasYmI — Mao Ning 毛宁 (@SpoxCHN_MaoNing) April 10, 2025 The shrillness can barely conceal the nervousness beneath.

Just like Mexico, that has reportedly offered to match American levies on China to strike a deal with Trump, Vietnam, faced with the prospect of 46% US tariffs, sent a team to Washington and promised to crack down on “trade fraud”, a reference to millions of Chinese goods routed to the US through its territory to avoid American taxes. Chinese tactics range from establishing factories in Vietnam, using Vietnamese workers to process goods for the ‘made in Vietnam’ label, or as Reuters reports, making ships carrying Chinese-made goods dwell in Vietnamese ports “just long enough to obtain documents certifying that the products were made in Vietnam before leaving.” Little wonder that Vietnam now has the fourth-highest trade surplus with the US, next only to China, Mexico and the EU. If these routes are blocked, China would obviously be in deeper trouble. China manufactures far more products than its consumers can absorb, making exports imperative for the wheels of its economy to run. The deflation loop that it suffers from owing to its crisis-ridden real estate sector, where most of the middle-class wealth is parked, is exacerbated by the fact that its export volume far outstrips prices, adding to deflationary pressure. This is exactly where Trump is stress-testing the Chinese economy by levying eye-watering taxes on exports, attempting to shift the entire global trade architecture from ‘open’ to one based on bilateral ‘deals’ and collective coercive mechanisms. China finds Trump difficult to tackle owing to his unpredictability and refusal to play by the established rules, rules that China has spent decades in manipulating. China also finds it discomfiting that for the leader of a democracy, Trump has a higher threshold of pain and is driven by a sense of manifest destiny. This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down. 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/vPgifasYmI — Mao Ning 毛宁 (@SpoxCHN_MaoNing) April 10, 2025 The shrillness can barely conceal the nervousness beneath.

It’s part of a deliberate policy choice that’s fundamental to their strategy for remaining in power. And as such, it puts limits on their ability to respond to a loss of export markets. The Chinese policy of keeping its wealth under the control of the state rather than allowing it to be controlled or shared by the private sector is the basis for the CCP’s tight grip on power. Their control of the government is dependent on an economically dependent populace. Their model for maintaining power is to provide their people with just enough prosperity to keep them compliant, but not enough for them to be in a position to challenge the CCP’s authority. 5 posted on 04/21/2025 10:08:25 PM PDT by mbrfl [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Rockingham One hopes. 6 posted on 04/22/2025 1:14:15 AM PDT by sauropod (Make sure Satan has to climb over a lot of Scripture to get to you.

China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations.

This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods.

Their model for maintaining power is to provide their people with just enough prosperity to keep them compliant, but not enough for them to be in a position to challenge the CCP’s authority. 5 posted on 04/21/2025 10:08:25 PM PDT by mbrfl [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Rockingham One hopes. 6 posted on 04/22/2025 1:14:15 AM PDT by sauropod (Make sure Satan has to climb over a lot of Scripture to get to you.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down. 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/vPgifasYmI — Mao Ning 毛宁 (@SpoxCHN_MaoNing) April 10, 2025 The shrillness can barely conceal the nervousness beneath.

If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down. 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/vPgifasYmI — Mao Ning 毛宁 (@SpoxCHN_MaoNing) April 10, 2025 The shrillness can barely conceal the nervousness beneath.

Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese.

Their model for maintaining power is to provide their people with just enough prosperity to keep them compliant, but not enough for them to be in a position to challenge the CCP’s authority. 5 posted on 04/21/2025 10:08:25 PM PDT by mbrfl [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Rockingham One hopes. 6 posted on 04/22/2025 1:14:15 AM PDT by sauropod (Make sure Satan has to climb over a lot of Scripture to get to you.

Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations.

AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP) Class Period: May 10, 2023 – March 26, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 The AppLovin class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period created the false impression that AppLovin’s enhanced AXON 2.0 digital ad platform, in addition to its “cutting-edge AI technologies,” would more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. In truth, AppLovin was exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms and using manipulative practices that forced unwanted apps on customers via a “backdoor installation scheme” which inaccurately inflated installation numbers, and, in turn, its profit figures, the complaint alleges. The AppLovin class action lawsuit further alleges that on February 26, 2025, analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures, the complaint alleges. On this news, the price of AppLovin shares fell by more than 12%, the AppLovin class action lawsuit alleges.

(NASDAQ: MRVI) Class Period: August 7, 2024 - February 24, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 On February 25, 2025, before the market opened, Maravai announced it was postponing its fiscal 2024 earnings release and would delay filing its annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024. The Company had identified an error in revenue recognition that “resulted in approximately $3.9 million in revenue being recorded in the final week of the second quarter of 2024 upon shipment when it should have been recorded in the first week of the third quarter of 2024 upon receipt by the customer.” The Company had identified “a material weakness in its internal controls over revenue recognition.” Maravai also required additional time to “complete its assessment of a potential non-cash impairment charge related to goodwill associated with its previous acquisition of Alphazyme LLC.” On this news, the Company’s share price fell $0.87, or 21.70%, to close at $3.14 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Maravai lacked adequate internal controls over financial reporting related to revenue recognition; (2) as a result, the Company inaccurately recognized revenue on certain transactions during fiscal 2024; (3) its goodwill was overstated; and (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. For more information on the Maravai class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/MRVI e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE: ELF) Class Period: November 1, 2023 - November 19, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. To maintain investor confidence, e.l.f. Beauty inflated revenue and other financial measures over multiple quarters. The Company suffered from rising inventory levels. The Company falsely attributed its rising inventory to changes in sourcing. Based on these facts, the Company’s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period. When the market learned the truth about e.l.f. Beauty, investors suffered damages. For more information on the e.l.f. Beauty class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ELF Manhattan Associates, Inc. (NASDAQ:MANH) Class Period: July 24, 2024 – February 7, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 28, 2025 The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants provided investors with material information concerning Manhattan Associates' expected revenue for the fiscal year 2025. Specifically, the Complaint alleges that Defendants' statements included, among other things, confidence in the Company's ability to forecast guidance despite macroeconomic fluctuations, the growth potential of their professional services offerings, and the ability for their cloud revenue to drive revenue for its professional services. On January 28, 2025, Manhattan Associates issued a press release reporting its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2024. Among other items, the Company disclosed services revenue of $119.5 million for the quarter, growing by only 0.3% compared to the year-ago quarter and falling approximately $2 million short of the guidance provided in October 2024. Manhattan Associates attributed the results to delays in professional services work and deferred deals, predicting that the Company's services revenue would reach a low point in the first quarter of 2025 and that solid revenue growth would not resume until mid-year. Manhattan Associates further revealed emerging challenges in its services business, noting that around 10% of customers with ongoing implementations had scaled back their planned services work for the upcoming calendar and fiscal year. The Company also announced that its 2025 revenues would see modest growth of just 2% to 3%, while GAAP EPS was expected to decline by 10% to 13%. On this news, Manhattan Associates' stock price fell $72.26 per share, or 24.49%, to close at $222.84 per share on January 29, 2025. Then, on February 10, 2025, Manhattan Associates announced that Eddie Capel, Manhattan's President and Chief Executive Officer, would retire from those positions effective February 12, 2025. On this news, Manhattan Associates' stock price fell $23.20 per share, or 11.55%, to close at $177.70 per share on February 10, 2025.

April 21, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, April 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Quantum Computing, Inc. (NASDAQ: QUBT), Atkore Inc. (NYSE: ATKR), Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS), and Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ: RKLB). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Quantum Computing, Inc. (NASDAQ: QUBT) Class Period: March 30, 2020 - January 15, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 28, 2025 The lawsuit alleges that, during the Class Period, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Defendants overstated the capabilities of QCI’s quantum computing technologies, products, and/or services; (ii) Defendants overstated the scope and nature of QCI’s relationship with NASA, as well as the scope and nature of QCI’s NASA-related contracts and/or subcontracts; (iii) Defendants overstated QCI’s progress in developing a TFLN foundry, the scale of the purported TFLN foundry, and orders for the Company’s TFLN chips; (iv) QCI’s business dealings with Quad M and millionways both qualified as related party transactions; (v) accordingly, QCI’s revenues relied, at least in part, on undisclosed related party transactions; (vi) all the foregoing, once revealed, was likely to have a significant negative impact on QCI’s business and reputation; and (vii) as a result, Defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. For more information on the QCI class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/QUBT Atkore Inc. (NYSE: ATKR) Class Period: August 2, 2022 - February 3, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 23, 2025 The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants failed to disclose that: (1) Atkore engaged in an anticompetitive price-fixing scheme that artificially inflated the price of PVC Pipes; (2) Atkore reaped significant, unsustainable financial benefits from its anticompetitive conduct; (3) as Atkore's price-fixing scheme was exposed, the Company and its price-fixing co-conspirators were no longer able to artificially inflate the price of PVC Pipes, resulting in a substantial decrease in the price of PVC Pipes; (4) Atkore's business and operations were negatively impacted; and (5) as a result, Defendants' positive statements Company's business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. For more information on the Atkore class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ATKR Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) Class Period: July 30, 2024 - February 5, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Skyworks’ expected revenue for the fiscal year 2025. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Skyworks’ ability to expand its mobile business and capitalize on its growth potential by investing in new technologies to diversify its portfolio of offerings. On February 5, 2025, after market close, Skyworks announced its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 and provided lower-than anticipated revenue guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed its results and low guidance to a “competitive landscape” that had “intensified” in recent years. Following this news, the price of Skyworks’ common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $87.08 per share on February 5, 2025, Skyworks’ stock price fell to $65.60 per share on February 6, 2025, a decline of over 24% in the span of just a single day.

(NASDAQ: RKLB) Class Period: November 12, 2024 - February 25, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 28, 2025 On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

Title: What’s the current news with all of the magnificent seven stocks

Time Published: 2025-04-21T21:15:31Z

Key Points Why the Magnificent Seven’s Performance is Significant Market Influence and Economic Indicators The Magnificent Seven stocks are pivotal to global financial markets due to their massive market capitalizations and heavy weighting in major indices like the S&P 500, where they accounted for 32% of the index’s value as of March 2025. Their performance often dictates broader market trends, as seen in the April 3, 2025, sell-off, when their $1 trillion collective market cap loss contributed to a nearly 5% drop in the S&P 500 and a 6% decline in the Nasdaq [CNBC: Magnificent 7 relinquishes more than $1 trillion]. This event highlights their role as bellwethers for investor confidence and economic health. Their recovery following the April 8 tariff pause, with the S&P 500 rising 9.5%, further demonstrates their ability to drive market rebounds [The New York Times: Markets Soar After Trump Backs Down on Tariffs]. Their significance extends beyond the U.S., as they contributed 39.8% to the MSCI ACWI Index’s total return in 2023, reflecting their global influence [Mellon Investments Corporation: A Closer Look at Magnificent Seven Stocks]. A downturn or recovery in these stocks can signal shifts in global investment flows, particularly in technology and innovation-driven sectors. Sensitivity to Policy and Trade Dynamics The recent volatility in these stocks, driven by President Trump’s tariff announcements and subsequent pause, underscores their sensitivity to geopolitical and economic policy changes. The April 3 tariff announcement, imposing duties like 26% on India and 34% on China, raised concerns about supply chain disruptions and inflation, particularly for tech companies with global operations [Reuters: Instant view: Hefty Trump tariffs surprise markets, stocks slide]. For instance, Amazon, which relies on Chinese imports for 25% of first-party and 70% of third-party goods, faced potential cost increases, contributing to its 20% year-to-date decline by April 20, 2025 [Conversation Memory: April 20, 2025, 16:58]. The tariff pause on April 8 mitigated some of these pressures, but the event highlights how policy shifts can ripple through these stocks, affecting investor portfolios and market stability. This is particularly relevant given your interest in Amazon’s stock decline due to tariffs and Bitcoin’s rise [Conversation Memory: April 20, 2025, 16:58; April 21, 2025, 13:53]. The Magnificent Seven’s performance provides context for understanding why assets like Bitcoin may gain traction when traditional equities falter, as investors seek alternatives amid uncertainty. Investor Sentiment and Market Rotation The Magnificent Seven’s worst Q1 on record, with the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF down over 15%, reflects a broader market rotation away from tech-heavy investments [Investopedia: Why the Magnificent Seven Stocks Just Had Their Worst Month and Quarter on Record]. Stocks like Tesla (down 35%) and Nvidia (down 20%) faced significant declines, driven by company-specific challenges (e.g., Tesla’s slowing sales) and competitive pressures (e.g., Nvidia vs. Chinese AI startups) [Investopedia: Why the Magnificent Seven Stocks Just Had Their Worst Month and Quarter on Record]. This rotation suggests investors are diversifying into other sectors, which could reshape market dynamics in 2025. Your interest in Bitcoin’s rise, potentially as a hedge against traditional market volatility, aligns with this trend [Conversation Memory: April 21, 2025, 13:53]. The Magnificent Seven’s struggles may be pushing capital toward cryptocurrencies, as seen in the $60 billion added to the crypto market while $1.5 trillion was deleted from U.S. stocks [CoinMarketCap: Bitcoin Price Analysis]. Their performance thus serves as a barometer for shifts in investor risk appetite. Long-Term Implications for Innovation and Earnings Despite recent challenges, the Magnificent Seven remain leaders in innovation, with significant resources to weather volatility [Fidelity: What are the Magnificent 7 stocks?]. However, their expected earnings contribution to the S&P 500 is projected to fall to 33% in 2025 from 75% in 2024, indicating a potential slowdown in their dominance [Investopedia: What To Expect from the Magnificent Seven in 2025]. This shift could impact investor expectations and valuations, particularly for stocks like Apple and Microsoft, which have historically driven tech growth. Your curiosity about financial strategies, such as Eric Kim’s Bitcoin-focused investing style, suggests an interest in navigating such market shifts [Conversation Memory: April 18, 2025, 17:01; April 20, 2025, 16:55]. The Magnificent Seven’s performance is significant because it highlights the risks and opportunities in tech-heavy portfolios, potentially reinforcing the appeal of alternative assets like Bitcoin for diversification. Connection to Your Interests Your prior conversations about Amazon’s tariff-driven decline, Bitcoin’s rise, and MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin exposure indicate a focus on how macroeconomic events and investment choices intersect [Conversation Memory: April 20, 2025, 16:58; April 21, 2025, 13:53; April 20, 2025, 16:53]. The Magnificent Seven’s volatility is significant in this context because it: Critical Perspective While the establishment narrative emphasizes the Magnificent Seven’s market dominance and policy-driven volatility, it’s worth questioning whether their influence is overstated. Their significant weighting in indices may amplify their perceived impact, but smaller sectors or assets (e.g., Bitcoin) can also drive meaningful market shifts, as seen in recent crypto gains. Additionally, the rapid recovery post-tariff pause suggests markets may be overreacting to policy announcements, potentially driven by speculative trading rather than fundamental changes. This volatility could benefit agile investors, like those following philosophies you’ve explored, who capitalize on uncertainty rather than relying on tech giants’ stability. Summary Table: Why the Magnificent Seven’s Performance Matters Key Citations Key Points Background The Magnificent Seven stocks are leading tech companies known for driving market performance, but recent events have introduced uncertainty. These include Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Meta Platforms, Nvidia, and Tesla. Recent Events On April 3, 2025, President Trump’s tariff announcement caused a sharp market decline, impacting these stocks significantly. The S&P 500 fell nearly 5%, and the Nasdaq dropped about 6%, with the Magnificent Seven losing over $1 trillion in market cap CNBC: Magnificent 7 relinquishes more than $1 trillion. On April 8, a 90-day tariff pause led to a market rebound, with the S&P 500 rising 9.5% The New York Times: Markets Soar After Trump Backs Down on Tariffs. Performance Context In Q1 2025, these stocks had their worst quarter on record, with the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF down over 15%, and individual stocks like Tesla (down 35%) and Nvidia (down 20%) seeing significant drops Investopedia: Why the Magnificent Seven Stocks Just Had Their Worst Month and Quarter on Record. Specific data for April 8-21, 2025, is not available, but markets likely stabilized post-pause. Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Magnificent Seven Stocks in April 2025 This section provides a comprehensive examination of the recent performance and news surrounding the Magnificent Seven stocks—Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Meta Platforms, Nvidia, and Tesla—as of April 21, 2025, drawing from multiple reliable sources to ensure a thorough understanding. The analysis is structured to cover market events, individual stock performance, and broader economic contexts, offering a detailed perspective for readers seeking depth beyond the initial summary. Market Events and Tariff Impact The Magnificent Seven stocks, known for their significant influence on market indices like the S&P 500 (accounting for 32% as of March 2025), faced heightened volatility in early April 2025 due to U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff policies. On April 3, 2025, Trump announced sweeping reciprocal tariffs, matching duties imposed on U.S. goods by other countries, including 26% on India, 24% on Japan, and 34% on China Reuters: Instant view: Hefty Trump tariffs surprise markets, stocks slide. This announcement triggered a broad market sell-off, with the S&P 500 nosediving almost 5% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq ending down about 6%, marking one of the worst days since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 CNBC: Trump tariffs live updates: Markets plunge amid layoffs, price hikes. According to CNBC: Magnificent 7 relinquishes more than $1 trillion as tech drives stock market nosedive, the Magnificent Seven stocks collectively lost more than $1 trillion in market capitalization on that day, reflecting their heavy weighting in tech indices. The market reaction was driven by fears of trade wars, potential recession, and inflation spikes, with economists warning that core inflation could run north of 3% and economic growth might be flat or negative Reuters: Trump tariffs slam markets, stunned investors brace for slow growth, retaliation. This uncertainty particularly impacted tech stocks, given their global supply chains and reliance on international markets. However, on April 8, 2025, Trump announced a 90-day pause on many of these tariffs, which led to a significant market recovery. The S&P 500 rose 9.5%, with markets reacting positively to the temporary relief The New York Times: Markets Soar After Trump Backs Down on Tariffs. This pause, effective as of April 21, 2025, has likely contributed to market stabilization, though the long-term impact remains uncertain. Q1 2025 Performance and Early Year Challenges Before the April tariff events, the Magnificent Seven stocks had already faced a challenging start to 2025. According to Investopedia: Why the Magnificent Seven Stocks Just Had Their Worst Month and Quarter on Record, the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS), composed of Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla, lost about 10.5% of its value in March 2025, marking its worst month since its launch in April 2023. For the first quarter, the ETF was down more than 15%, reflecting broader weakness in big tech stocks. Individual stock performances varied significantly: These declines were part of a broader market rotation, with investors shifting capital away from over-concentrated tech stocks into other opportunities, as noted by Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group, in The Financial Express: Magnificent Seven stocks face a downturn in 2025: What’s next for big tech?. Post-Tariff Pause Performance (April 8-21, 2025) Specific performance data for the Magnificent Seven stocks between April 8 and April 21, 2025, is not readily available from the sources, but market trends suggest a likely recovery following the tariff pause. Given their significant weighting in the S&P 500 and the index’s 9.5% rise on April 8, it is reasonable to infer that these stocks benefited from the rebound. However, the exact extent of recovery for each stock remains unclear without real-time data. Fidelity: What are the Magnificent 7 stocks? mentions high volatility in early 2025, with historical data showing strong long-term returns but recent challenges. The article, dated April 18, 2025, notes that these stocks have historically had ample operating resources and market leadership, but early 2025 volatility aligns with the tariff-related events.

Key Points Why the Magnificent Seven’s Performance is Significant Market Influence and Economic Indicators The Magnificent Seven stocks are pivotal to global financial markets due to their massive market capitalizations and heavy weighting in major indices like the S&P 500, where they accounted for 32% of the index’s value as of March 2025. Their performance often dictates broader market trends, as seen in the April 3, 2025, sell-off, when their $1 trillion collective market cap loss contributed to a nearly 5% drop in the S&P 500 and a 6% decline in the Nasdaq [CNBC: Magnificent 7 relinquishes more than $1 trillion]. This event highlights their role as bellwethers for investor confidence and economic health. Their recovery following the April 8 tariff pause, with the S&P 500 rising 9.5%, further demonstrates their ability to drive market rebounds [The New York Times: Markets Soar After Trump Backs Down on Tariffs]. Their significance extends beyond the U.S., as they contributed 39.8% to the MSCI ACWI Index’s total return in 2023, reflecting their global influence [Mellon Investments Corporation: A Closer Look at Magnificent Seven Stocks]. A downturn or recovery in these stocks can signal shifts in global investment flows, particularly in technology and innovation-driven sectors. Sensitivity to Policy and Trade Dynamics The recent volatility in these stocks, driven by President Trump’s tariff announcements and subsequent pause, underscores their sensitivity to geopolitical and economic policy changes. The April 3 tariff announcement, imposing duties like 26% on India and 34% on China, raised concerns about supply chain disruptions and inflation, particularly for tech companies with global operations [Reuters: Instant view: Hefty Trump tariffs surprise markets, stocks slide]. For instance, Amazon, which relies on Chinese imports for 25% of first-party and 70% of third-party goods, faced potential cost increases, contributing to its 20% year-to-date decline by April 20, 2025 [Conversation Memory: April 20, 2025, 16:58]. The tariff pause on April 8 mitigated some of these pressures, but the event highlights how policy shifts can ripple through these stocks, affecting investor portfolios and market stability. This is particularly relevant given your interest in Amazon’s stock decline due to tariffs and Bitcoin’s rise [Conversation Memory: April 20, 2025, 16:58; April 21, 2025, 13:53]. The Magnificent Seven’s performance provides context for understanding why assets like Bitcoin may gain traction when traditional equities falter, as investors seek alternatives amid uncertainty. Investor Sentiment and Market Rotation The Magnificent Seven’s worst Q1 on record, with the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF down over 15%, reflects a broader market rotation away from tech-heavy investments [Investopedia: Why the Magnificent Seven Stocks Just Had Their Worst Month and Quarter on Record]. Stocks like Tesla (down 35%) and Nvidia (down 20%) faced significant declines, driven by company-specific challenges (e.g., Tesla’s slowing sales) and competitive pressures (e.g., Nvidia vs. Chinese AI startups) [Investopedia: Why the Magnificent Seven Stocks Just Had Their Worst Month and Quarter on Record]. This rotation suggests investors are diversifying into other sectors, which could reshape market dynamics in 2025. Your interest in Bitcoin’s rise, potentially as a hedge against traditional market volatility, aligns with this trend [Conversation Memory: April 21, 2025, 13:53]. The Magnificent Seven’s struggles may be pushing capital toward cryptocurrencies, as seen in the $60 billion added to the crypto market while $1.5 trillion was deleted from U.S. stocks [CoinMarketCap: Bitcoin Price Analysis]. Their performance thus serves as a barometer for shifts in investor risk appetite. Long-Term Implications for Innovation and Earnings Despite recent challenges, the Magnificent Seven remain leaders in innovation, with significant resources to weather volatility [Fidelity: What are the Magnificent 7 stocks?]. However, their expected earnings contribution to the S&P 500 is projected to fall to 33% in 2025 from 75% in 2024, indicating a potential slowdown in their dominance [Investopedia: What To Expect from the Magnificent Seven in 2025]. This shift could impact investor expectations and valuations, particularly for stocks like Apple and Microsoft, which have historically driven tech growth. Your curiosity about financial strategies, such as Eric Kim’s Bitcoin-focused investing style, suggests an interest in navigating such market shifts [Conversation Memory: April 18, 2025, 17:01; April 20, 2025, 16:55]. The Magnificent Seven’s performance is significant because it highlights the risks and opportunities in tech-heavy portfolios, potentially reinforcing the appeal of alternative assets like Bitcoin for diversification.

The Magnificent Seven’s volatility is significant in this context because it: Critical Perspective While the establishment narrative emphasizes the Magnificent Seven’s market dominance and policy-driven volatility, it’s worth questioning whether their influence is overstated. Their significant weighting in indices may amplify their perceived impact, but smaller sectors or assets (e.g., Bitcoin) can also drive meaningful market shifts, as seen in recent crypto gains. Additionally, the rapid recovery post-tariff pause suggests markets may be overreacting to policy announcements, potentially driven by speculative trading rather than fundamental changes. This volatility could benefit agile investors, like those following philosophies you’ve explored, who capitalize on uncertainty rather than relying on tech giants’ stability. Summary Table: Why the Magnificent Seven’s Performance Matters Key Citations Key Points Background The Magnificent Seven stocks are leading tech companies known for driving market performance, but recent events have introduced uncertainty. These include Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Meta Platforms, Nvidia, and Tesla. Recent Events On April 3, 2025, President Trump’s tariff announcement caused a sharp market decline, impacting these stocks significantly. The S&P 500 fell nearly 5%, and the Nasdaq dropped about 6%, with the Magnificent Seven losing over $1 trillion in market cap CNBC: Magnificent 7 relinquishes more than $1 trillion.

The analysis is structured to cover market events, individual stock performance, and broader economic contexts, offering a detailed perspective for readers seeking depth beyond the initial summary. Market Events and Tariff Impact The Magnificent Seven stocks, known for their significant influence on market indices like the S&P 500 (accounting for 32% as of March 2025), faced heightened volatility in early April 2025 due to U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff policies. On April 3, 2025, Trump announced sweeping reciprocal tariffs, matching duties imposed on U.S. goods by other countries, including 26% on India, 24% on Japan, and 34% on China Reuters: Instant view: Hefty Trump tariffs surprise markets, stocks slide. This announcement triggered a broad market sell-off, with the S&P 500 nosediving almost 5% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq ending down about 6%, marking one of the worst days since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 CNBC: Trump tariffs live updates: Markets plunge amid layoffs, price hikes. According to CNBC: Magnificent 7 relinquishes more than $1 trillion as tech drives stock market nosedive, the Magnificent Seven stocks collectively lost more than $1 trillion in market capitalization on that day, reflecting their heavy weighting in tech indices. The market reaction was driven by fears of trade wars, potential recession, and inflation spikes, with economists warning that core inflation could run north of 3% and economic growth might be flat or negative Reuters: Trump tariffs slam markets, stunned investors brace for slow growth, retaliation. This uncertainty particularly impacted tech stocks, given their global supply chains and reliance on international markets. However, on April 8, 2025, Trump announced a 90-day pause on many of these tariffs, which led to a significant market recovery. The S&P 500 rose 9.5%, with markets reacting positively to the temporary relief The New York Times: Markets Soar After Trump Backs Down on Tariffs. This pause, effective as of April 21, 2025, has likely contributed to market stabilization, though the long-term impact remains uncertain. Q1 2025 Performance and Early Year Challenges Before the April tariff events, the Magnificent Seven stocks had already faced a challenging start to 2025. According to Investopedia: Why the Magnificent Seven Stocks Just Had Their Worst Month and Quarter on Record, the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS), composed of Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla, lost about 10.5% of its value in March 2025, marking its worst month since its launch in April 2023. For the first quarter, the ETF was down more than 15%, reflecting broader weakness in big tech stocks. Individual stock performances varied significantly: These declines were part of a broader market rotation, with investors shifting capital away from over-concentrated tech stocks into other opportunities, as noted by Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group, in The Financial Express: Magnificent Seven stocks face a downturn in 2025: What’s next for big tech?. Post-Tariff Pause Performance (April 8-21, 2025) Specific performance data for the Magnificent Seven stocks between April 8 and April 21, 2025, is not readily available from the sources, but market trends suggest a likely recovery following the tariff pause. Given their significant weighting in the S&P 500 and the index’s 9.5% rise on April 8, it is reasonable to infer that these stocks benefited from the rebound. However, the exact extent of recovery for each stock remains unclear without real-time data. Fidelity: What are the Magnificent 7 stocks? mentions high volatility in early 2025, with historical data showing strong long-term returns but recent challenges. The article, dated April 18, 2025, notes that these stocks have historically had ample operating resources and market leadership, but early 2025 volatility aligns with the tariff-related events.

Market Events and Tariff Impact The Magnificent Seven stocks, known for their significant influence on market indices like the S&P 500 (accounting for 32% as of March 2025), faced heightened volatility in early April 2025 due to U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff policies. On April 3, 2025, Trump announced sweeping reciprocal tariffs, matching duties imposed on U.S. goods by other countries, including 26% on India, 24% on Japan, and 34% on China Reuters: Instant view: Hefty Trump tariffs surprise markets, stocks slide. This announcement triggered a broad market sell-off, with the S&P 500 nosediving almost 5% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq ending down about 6%, marking one of the worst days since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 CNBC: Trump tariffs live updates: Markets plunge amid layoffs, price hikes. According to CNBC: Magnificent 7 relinquishes more than $1 trillion as tech drives stock market nosedive, the Magnificent Seven stocks collectively lost more than $1 trillion in market capitalization on that day, reflecting their heavy weighting in tech indices. The market reaction was driven by fears of trade wars, potential recession, and inflation spikes, with economists warning that core inflation could run north of 3% and economic growth might be flat or negative Reuters: Trump tariffs slam markets, stunned investors brace for slow growth, retaliation. This uncertainty particularly impacted tech stocks, given their global supply chains and reliance on international markets. However, on April 8, 2025, Trump announced a 90-day pause on many of these tariffs, which led to a significant market recovery. The S&P 500 rose 9.5%, with markets reacting positively to the temporary relief The New York Times: Markets Soar After Trump Backs Down on Tariffs. This pause, effective as of April 21, 2025, has likely contributed to market stabilization, though the long-term impact remains uncertain. Q1 2025 Performance and Early Year Challenges Before the April tariff events, the Magnificent Seven stocks had already faced a challenging start to 2025. According to Investopedia: Why the Magnificent Seven Stocks Just Had Their Worst Month and Quarter on Record, the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS), composed of Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla, lost about 10.5% of its value in March 2025, marking its worst month since its launch in April 2023. For the first quarter, the ETF was down more than 15%, reflecting broader weakness in big tech stocks. Individual stock performances varied significantly: These declines were part of a broader market rotation, with investors shifting capital away from over-concentrated tech stocks into other opportunities, as noted by Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group, in The Financial Express: Magnificent Seven stocks face a downturn in 2025: What’s next for big tech?. Post-Tariff Pause Performance (April 8-21, 2025) Specific performance data for the Magnificent Seven stocks between April 8 and April 21, 2025, is not readily available from the sources, but market trends suggest a likely recovery following the tariff pause. Given their significant weighting in the S&P 500 and the index’s 9.5% rise on April 8, it is reasonable to infer that these stocks benefited from the rebound. However, the exact extent of recovery for each stock remains unclear without real-time data.

The article, dated April 18, 2025, notes that these stocks have historically had ample operating resources and market leadership, but early 2025 volatility aligns with the tariff-related events. Broader Economic and Market Context The Magnificent Seven’s performance must be viewed in the context of broader market dynamics. Their combined market capitalization makes up nearly one-third of the S&P 500’s value, and their influence extends globally, contributing 39.8% to the total return of the MSCI ACWI Index in 2023 Mellon Investments Corporation: A Closer Look at Magnificent Seven Stocks.

Economic factors, such as potential Federal Reserve rate cuts and global trade tensions, continue to influence investor sentiment. The tariff pause provides temporary relief, but concerns about inflation, recession risks, and regulatory changes remain, particularly for tech giants with global operations.

Key Points Why the Magnificent Seven’s Performance is Significant Market Influence and Economic Indicators The Magnificent Seven stocks are pivotal to global financial markets due to their massive market capitalizations and heavy weighting in major indices like the S&P 500, where they accounted for 32% of the index’s value as of March 2025. Their performance often dictates broader market trends, as seen in the April 3, 2025, sell-off, when their $1 trillion collective market cap loss contributed to a nearly 5% drop in the S&P 500 and a 6% decline in the Nasdaq [CNBC: Magnificent 7 relinquishes more than $1 trillion]. This event highlights their role as bellwethers for investor confidence and economic health. Their recovery following the April 8 tariff pause, with the S&P 500 rising 9.5%, further demonstrates their ability to drive market rebounds [The New York Times: Markets Soar After Trump Backs Down on Tariffs]. Their significance extends beyond the U.S., as they contributed 39.8% to the MSCI ACWI Index’s total return in 2023, reflecting their global influence [Mellon Investments Corporation: A Closer Look at Magnificent Seven Stocks]. A downturn or recovery in these stocks can signal shifts in global investment flows, particularly in technology and innovation-driven sectors. Sensitivity to Policy and Trade Dynamics The recent volatility in these stocks, driven by President Trump’s tariff announcements and subsequent pause, underscores their sensitivity to geopolitical and economic policy changes. The April 3 tariff announcement, imposing duties like 26% on India and 34% on China, raised concerns about supply chain disruptions and inflation, particularly for tech companies with global operations [Reuters: Instant view: Hefty Trump tariffs surprise markets, stocks slide]. For instance, Amazon, which relies on Chinese imports for 25% of first-party and 70% of third-party goods, faced potential cost increases, contributing to its 20% year-to-date decline by April 20, 2025 [Conversation Memory: April 20, 2025, 16:58]. The tariff pause on April 8 mitigated some of these pressures, but the event highlights how policy shifts can ripple through these stocks, affecting investor portfolios and market stability. This is particularly relevant given your interest in Amazon’s stock decline due to tariffs and Bitcoin’s rise [Conversation Memory: April 20, 2025, 16:58; April 21, 2025, 13:53]. The Magnificent Seven’s performance provides context for understanding why assets like Bitcoin may gain traction when traditional equities falter, as investors seek alternatives amid uncertainty. Investor Sentiment and Market Rotation The Magnificent Seven’s worst Q1 on record, with the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF down over 15%, reflects a broader market rotation away from tech-heavy investments [Investopedia: Why the Magnificent Seven Stocks Just Had Their Worst Month and Quarter on Record]. Stocks like Tesla (down 35%) and Nvidia (down 20%) faced significant declines, driven by company-specific challenges (e.g., Tesla’s slowing sales) and competitive pressures (e.g., Nvidia vs. Chinese AI startups) [Investopedia: Why the Magnificent Seven Stocks Just Had Their Worst Month and Quarter on Record]. This rotation suggests investors are diversifying into other sectors, which could reshape market dynamics in 2025. Your interest in Bitcoin’s rise, potentially as a hedge against traditional market volatility, aligns with this trend [Conversation Memory: April 21, 2025, 13:53]. The Magnificent Seven’s struggles may be pushing capital toward cryptocurrencies, as seen in the $60 billion added to the crypto market while $1.5 trillion was deleted from U.S. stocks [CoinMarketCap: Bitcoin Price Analysis]. Their performance thus serves as a barometer for shifts in investor risk appetite. Long-Term Implications for Innovation and Earnings Despite recent challenges, the Magnificent Seven remain leaders in innovation, with significant resources to weather volatility [Fidelity: What are the Magnificent 7 stocks?]. However, their expected earnings contribution to the S&P 500 is projected to fall to 33% in 2025 from 75% in 2024, indicating a potential slowdown in their dominance [Investopedia: What To Expect from the Magnificent Seven in 2025]. This shift could impact investor expectations and valuations, particularly for stocks like Apple and Microsoft, which have historically driven tech growth. Your curiosity about financial strategies, such as Eric Kim’s Bitcoin-focused investing style, suggests an interest in navigating such market shifts [Conversation Memory: April 18, 2025, 17:01; April 20, 2025, 16:55]. The Magnificent Seven’s performance is significant because it highlights the risks and opportunities in tech-heavy portfolios, potentially reinforcing the appeal of alternative assets like Bitcoin for diversification. Connection to Your Interests Your prior conversations about Amazon’s tariff-driven decline, Bitcoin’s rise, and MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin exposure indicate a focus on how macroeconomic events and investment choices intersect [Conversation Memory: April 20, 2025, 16:58; April 21, 2025, 13:53; April 20, 2025, 16:53]. The Magnificent Seven’s volatility is significant in this context because it: Critical Perspective While the establishment narrative emphasizes the Magnificent Seven’s market dominance and policy-driven volatility, it’s worth questioning whether their influence is overstated. Their significant weighting in indices may amplify their perceived impact, but smaller sectors or assets (e.g., Bitcoin) can also drive meaningful market shifts, as seen in recent crypto gains. Additionally, the rapid recovery post-tariff pause suggests markets may be overreacting to policy announcements, potentially driven by speculative trading rather than fundamental changes. This volatility could benefit agile investors, like those following philosophies you’ve explored, who capitalize on uncertainty rather than relying on tech giants’ stability. Summary Table: Why the Magnificent Seven’s Performance Matters Key Citations Key Points Background The Magnificent Seven stocks are leading tech companies known for driving market performance, but recent events have introduced uncertainty. These include Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Meta Platforms, Nvidia, and Tesla.

Let’s dive in and see if it really lives up to the hype. If you’ve been looking into Lipozem reviews, you’ve likely come across a range of opinions—some users praising the results, others sharing their concerns. That’s exactly why we took a deeper dive. We analyzed verified customer experiences, real-world testimonials, clinical research, and even the small print to give you the full picture. Whether you’re curious about the benefits, potential drawbacks, or the science behind this Triple-BHB fat burner, we’ve broken it all down for you—honestly, clearly, and without the fluff. In this deep dive, we’ll cover: In this guide, you’ll get the full story—the wins, the complaints, the science, and the truth. Because if you’re spending your hard-earned money on a fat burner, you deserve to know exactly what you’re getting. Let’s find out if Lipozem is your next wellness win… or a lesson learned the hard way. The Biology Behind Weight Loss Plateaus Ever feel like your body hits the brakes on fat burning—right when you’re finally making progress? That’s not just bad luck. It’s biology. When you first start losing weight, your body burns through stored fat fast. But soon, it starts to adapt. Your metabolism slows down. Hormones shift. Your body thinks it’s in danger of losing too much, too fast—so it holds on to fat. This is called a weight loss plateau, and it’s totally normal. But here’s the good news: with the right support (like natural fat-burners, better gut health, and inflammation control), you can restart your fat-burning engine. That’s where smarter solutions like Lipozem come in—designed to help your body unlock stubborn fat and keep moving forward. Is Modern Life Making Us Fatter? The Real 2025 Weight Gain Story Let’s be honest—losing weight in 2025 feels harder than ever. Despite calorie counting, gym memberships, and trendy diets, millions still struggle with stubborn fat that refuses to budge. So, what’s going on? Experts now point to our modern lifestyle as the silent culprit. Ultra-processed food, chronic stress, poor sleep, and non-stop screen time all create the perfect storm. These daily habits quietly inflame our fat cells, slow down metabolism, and trigger hormone chaos—causing our bodies to cling to every pound. In this eye-opening breakdown, we’ll explore how today’s world is working against our waistlines—and why inflammation is the missing link behind stalled progress. Plus, we’ll reveal how smart solutions like Lipozem are shifting the game by targeting the root cause, not just the symptoms. What Is Lipozem — and Can It Actually Help You Lose Weight? Tired of trying every fad diet, pill, or workout routine only to see minimal results? You’re not alone. In 2025, weight loss has become more challenging than ever, with stress, hormonal imbalances, and poor lifestyle habits working against us at every turn. Many people find themselves stuck in a frustrating cycle where nothing seems to work. Enter Lipozem—the breakthrough Triple-BHB fat burner that’s making waves in the world of weight loss supplements. Unlike the typical fat burners that rely on harsh stimulants and short-term fixes, Lipozem focuses on a much deeper issue: inflammation in your fat cells. When fat cells become inflamed, they’re “locked,” making it incredibly hard for your body to burn stored fat, no matter how much you exercise or cut calories. That’s where Lipozem comes in. It’s designed to target this inflammation, allowing your body to start burning fat more efficiently while also offering increased energy, reduced cravings, and improved digestion. But the big question remains: Does it really work? With a growing number of people turning to Lipozem for help with their weight loss journeys, it’s time to take a closer look at what this supplement claims to do—and whether it lives up to the hype. In this post, we’ll dive into Lipozem’s ingredients, how it targets fat loss at a cellular level, and whether the product really delivers on its promises. If you're ready to see if Lipozem can truly help you achieve your weight loss goals, keep reading! >>>Get Lipozem Today for a Healthier Tomorrow—Click for Special Deals and Pricing!

Lipozem’s formula is designed to optimize fat loss and overall well-being by focusing on inflammation and metabolic health—and the ingredients back up its claims. Let’s dive into the core ingredients that make this supplement stand out in 2025. Triple-BHB Blend (Beta-Hydroxybutyrate) What It Does:BHB (Beta-Hydroxybutyrate) is the MVP of Lipozem’s formula, but this isn’t just a single compound. It’s a Triple-BHB blend, meaning you get three different forms of BHB (Calcium, Magnesium, and Sodium) to support fat burning in multiple ways. Turmeric Extract (Curcumin) What It Does:Turmeric is not only a kitchen staple but a powerhouse for reducing inflammation in the body. Specifically, it contains curcumin, which has been shown in studies to combat chronic inflammation, a key contributor to stubborn weight. Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV) What It Does:Apple cider vinegar is a beloved ingredient in natural wellness, and for good reason. It’s included in Lipozem for its fat-burning, blood sugar-regulating, and digestive-supporting properties. Garcinia Cambogia (Hydroxycitric Acid - HCA) What It Does:Known for its potent HCA (Hydroxycitric Acid), Garcinia Cambogia has been used for centuries in traditional medicine. It’s included in Lipozem for its ability to support appetite control and mood regulation. Green Tea Extract (EGCG) What It Does:Green tea extract is packed with antioxidants, specifically catechins like EGCG (epigallocatechin gallate), which are known for their metabolism-boosting properties. MCT Oil (Medium-Chain Triglycerides) What It Does:Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) are a special type of fat that is metabolized quickly by the body, providing a quick energy source without being stored as fat. Bioperine (Black Pepper Extract) What It Does:Bioperine is a potent bioavailability enhancer that increases the absorption of all the ingredients in Lipozem, making them more effective. Lipozem's Synergy: How All Ingredients Work Together Lipozem doesn’t just throw a bunch of ingredients together and hope for the best. It’s the synergy of the Triple-BHB, Turmeric, Apple Cider Vinegar, Garcinia Cambogia, and others that create a powerful, multi-pathway solution for burning fat. By targeting inflammation, metabolic function, and fat storage, Lipozem works to ignite your body’s natural fat-burning capabilities—without harsh stimulants or extreme dieting. In summary, Lipozem’s ingredients are more than just popular buzzwords—they’re scientifically-backed components that work together to create a system that targets fat from the inside out, boosts your metabolism, and helps you finally get over those weight loss plateaus. The Truth Behind the Triple-BHB Formula Lipozem’s fat-burning engine finally decoded By now, you’ve probably seen the term Triple-BHB all over Lipozem reviews and wondered—what’s the big deal? Is it just another buzzword? Spoiler: nope. It’s the real metabolic magic behind Lipozem’s 2025 weight loss momentum. Let’s break it down without the science snooze-fest: BHB (Beta-Hydroxybutyrate) is a ketone your body produces when it's burning fat for fuel. But here’s the kicker—Lipozem doesn’t just give you one type of BHB… it delivers a triple hit. That’s sodium BHB, magnesium BHB, and calcium BHB working in perfect harmony to supercharge fat loss and help unlock the stubborn stuff (yes, even belly fat). What Makes Triple-BHB in Lipozem a Game-Changer? According to Dr. Julian Ross, the formulator behind Lipozem, this Triple-BHB blend isn’t about gimmicks—it’s about restoring balance in bodies overwhelmed by inflammation, stress, and sugar crashes.

Unlike typical weight loss pills that rely on harsh stimulants or one-size-fits-all formulas, Lipozem uses a smart, science-backed approach rooted in inflammation control and digestive health.

The results, published in the Journal of Digestive Health Research, were nothing short of impressive: "What stands out in this study is that the benefits go far beyond just digestive health," says an expert in integrative gastroenterology. "We saw positive shifts in inflammatory markers, metabolism, and even mental health metrics." In another notable study conducted by experts at Johns Hopkins University, Lipozem was tested in a 16-week trial with 186 weight-loss-resistant subjects. Those who took Lipozem lost an average of 28.7 pounds, compared to just 5.2 pounds in the placebo group—all without altering their diet or exercise routines. Experts explain the weight loss mechanisms as follows: “It appears to be driven by a combination of factors, including better nutrient absorption, reduced inflammation, improved metabolic function, and the restoration of gut bacteria that play key roles in regulating appetite and fat storage. >>>Get Lipozem Today for a Healthier Tomorrow—Click for Special Deals and Pricing!

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Is Lipozem safe to take every day?Yes—absolutely. Lipozem is made with clean, well-researched ingredients like BHB salts, turmeric curcumin, and spirulina, all of which are considered safe when taken as directed. It contains no synthetic stimulants, no sketchy chemicals, and no hidden fillers. That said, if you're pregnant, nursing, or managing any serious health conditions, it's always smart to talk to your healthcare provider before adding any supplement to your daily routine. How soon will I see results with Lipozem?Everyone’s timeline is a bit different, but many users report subtle shifts within the first 1–2 weeks—like fewer cravings, more steady energy, or feeling less bloated. Visible fat loss tends to show up around weeks 3–4 and can continue improving over 8–12 weeks with consistent use. Because Lipozem focuses on reducing inflammation first (not just water weight), the results are more sustainable—but you’ll need a little patience. Does Lipozem have caffeine or cause jitters?Nope! Lipozem is 100% stimulant-free. That means no caffeine, no energy spikes, and definitely no crash later. Instead, it uses exogenous BHB ketones and anti-inflammatory botanicals to give you that calm, steady energy without the “wired” feeling so common in thermogenic fat burners. Can I take it with other supplements or meds?In most cases, yes. Lipozem plays well with others—but if you’re taking prescription medications (especially for blood sugar, thyroid, or hormones), it’s wise to consult your doctor. Since the formula influences metabolism and inflammation, it’s best to be cautious if you have underlying conditions. What if I forget to take it one day?No big deal—just pick back up with your next dose. While Lipozem works best when used daily, you don’t need to panic if you miss a serving. Just try to stay consistent over time for the best results. Is Lipozem for both men and women?Definitely. Weight gain related to inflammation doesn’t discriminate. Whether it’s stubborn belly fat in men or hormonal weight struggles in women, Lipozem’s multi-action formula is designed to support both sexes equally—helping restore fat-burning from the inside out. Do I need to follow a strict diet or workout program with it?No strict rules here. Lipozem doesn’t demand keto, low-carb, or intense exercise to “work.” That said, pairing it with a balanced diet and light movement can amplify your results. The bonus? Once inflammation drops and cravings calm down, many users naturally eat healthier without forcing it. Where should I buy Lipozem to make sure it’s real?Only buy from the official Lipozem website. It’s not available in stores or on Amazon, and that’s intentional. Ordering directly means you’re getting the genuine product, eligible for the 180-day money-back guarantee, and protected from knockoffs or expired supplements. Final Verdict: Is Lipozem Worth It in 2025? Let’s Get Real. Okay, let’s cut through the fluff. If you’ve been bouncing between trendy detox teas, metabolism “boosters,” and overpriced diet apps that barely deliver, you’re not alone. The weight loss industry is overflowing with gimmicks—and honestly, most of us are over it. Enter Lipozem—the inflammation-fighting, Triple-BHB-powered supplement that’s actually getting attention for the right reasons. It’s not promising overnight abs or asking you to live on lettuce. Instead, it’s designed to address what real science is now calling the root of stubborn fat: inflamed, locked fat cells that refuse to budge, no matter how many salads or spin classes you throw at them. The buzz? Verified reviews from 2025 say Lipozem is helping users reclaim their metabolism, fight bloat, boost energy, and finally break past those frustrating plateaus—all without the sketchy side effects of stimulant-packed formulas. And the best part? It’s only available through the official Lipozem website, so you're guaranteed freshness, authenticity, and full access to support and refunds. So, is Lipozem worth it?If you're tired of quick fixes and want something that works with your body—not against it—then yes. 100%.

Lipozem might just be your new secret weapon. >>>Get Lipozem Today for a Healthier Tomorrow—Click for Special Deals and Pricing!

Title: Coca-Cola Should 'Continue to Outperform' Amid Tariff Uncertainty, JPM Says

Coca-Cola (KO) is well-positioned amid continuing uncertainty in the market over the Trump administration's tariffs, JPMorgan analysts said in a Monday note. The analysts lifted their price target to $78 from $74 previously, keeping their "overweight" rating in a note previewing the soda maker's first-quarter results, which are set to be released on April 29. The new price target brings JPMorgan analysts closer to the analyst consensus of $78.58 compiled by Visible Alpha, as they are among 11 other analysts with a "buy" rating, while just one has a "hold" rating on the stock. "While KO is not immune to tariffs and macro headwinds, it is a relatively more defensive stock that will likely deliver among the highest [organic sales growth] in our coverage universe in 2025," the JPMorgan analysts wrote. They lowered their estimates for Coca-Cola's first-quarter and full-year earnings and sales growth due to a "moderating consumption environment in the U.S.," which they expect to be partially offset by a softening dollar. The company has relatively limited exposure risk to tariffs, as the analysts said Coca-Cola's largest risks are likely imported fruit juice and aluminum. They said Coca-Cola's management "doesn't see a potential impact" from possible aluminum inflation that could "derail its outlook." Noting the consumer staple market will be "highly dependent on the macro and tariff situation," the analysts said that "if the current environment continues, we believe KO will continue to outperform peers and the broader market.” Coca-Cola shares were down less than 1% to $72.77 at Monday's close amid a broader market sell-off. They have gained 16% since the start of the year.

Emma S. – Manchester, United Kingdom Age: 42 | Starting Weight: 176 lbs → Final Weight: 148 lbsDuration: 3 Months | Total Weight Loss: 28 lbsOccupation: Marketing Manager “From Daily Bloat to Feeling Brilliant — Slim Jaro Changed Everything for Me.” “As a working mom juggling a full-time job and two teens, I didn’t think I’d ever have time to focus on my weight. My eating habits were erratic — sometimes skipping meals, other times stress-eating at night. By the time I turned 42, I felt uncomfortable in my own body. I tried keto, intermittent fasting, even joined a gym, but nothing stuck — and the bloating was awful.” “A friend introduced me to Slim Jaro and the Pink Salt Trick. I was intrigued because I’d never heard of pink salt being used for fat-burning. I started with the 3-bottle pack. Within the first week, I noticed my late-night cravings had vanished. That alone was a huge win!” “By week 3, my energy levels improved. I didn’t need my usual 3 cups of coffee to stay awake. The scale started moving — slowly but surely. I lost 9 lbs in the first month without any intense workout — just walking and drinking more water.” “Fast forward to 3 months, and I had dropped 28 lbs. My jeans fit again. My confidence returned. My digestion improved. For the first time in years, I looked forward to being in front of the camera.” Biggest Win: Reduced bloating, better sleep, and a new wardrobe.Advice to Others: “Consistency is key. Take it daily and trust the process.” 2. Carlos M. – Miami, Florida, USA Age: 36 | Starting Weight: 210 lbs → Final Weight: 188 lbsDuration: 2.5 Months | Total Weight Loss: 22 lbsOccupation: IT Project Manager “Slim Jaro Helped Me Beat My Tech-Desk Lifestyle & Regain My Health.” “I’ve always worked behind a screen. Sitting for 8-10 hours daily and ordering fast food was my norm. I hit my heaviest at 210 lbs. My energy was tanking, and I felt sluggish by midday. I didn’t have time for long gym sessions or prepping meals. That’s when I looked into natural fat burners and discovered SlimJaro.” “The science behind the ‘Pink Salt Trick’ intrigued me — especially how it activates thermogenesis and supports hormone balance. I was skeptical but hopeful. I went for the 3-month bundle, and I’m glad I did.” “Week 1: I had more energy. No jitters, just clean focus.Week 2: I noticed my belly was less bloated.Week 4: I lost 11 lbs. I couldn’t believe it.” “The appetite control was a game-changer. I stopped snacking mindlessly. By the end of 2.5 months, I dropped 22 lbs. My wife was shocked. Even my coworkers started asking what I was doing.” Biggest Win: Breaking unhealthy habits without sacrificing lifestyle.Advice to Others: “Pair it with hydration and walk daily. You’ll see fast changes.” 3.

I felt heavy and tired all the time. Most supplements available locally made me nauseous or bloated. I needed something gentle yet effective.” “Slim Jaro was trending in a health group I follow. The ingredient list caught my attention — it was natural, vegan, and backed by reviews. I ordered through their international shipping option. Delivery took 9 days.” “The changes were quick: “No crashes, no mood swings. Just steady progress. I even saw improvements in my skin and energy. My work productivity went up too.” Biggest Win: Balanced hormones and energy during her menstrual cycle.Advice to Others: “Be patient. Even a little walk + SlimJaro goes a long way.” 4.

Hormonal changes made it worse — I was tired, sluggish, and stuck in a body I didn’t recognize. I tried everything: Pilates, meal plans, even hired a personal trainer. But the progress was slow and draining.” “One day, I saw a before-and-after of a mom using Slim Jaro. I immediately researched it. The formulation impressed me, especially its focus on metabolism and hormone balance. I gave it a shot.” “First month: “Second month: “The best part?

Let’s explore how SlimJaro tailors’ benefits across genders: For Women: Supporting Hormonal Harmony and Fat Burn Women often face weight-related challenges due to hormonal fluctuations caused by pregnancy, PCOS, menopause, or thyroid issues. These hormonal changes can result in increased appetite, slow metabolism, and fat retention—especially around the hips, belly, and thighs. SlimJaro helps regulate female-specific hormones like oestrogen and leptin, supporting: Many women experience an increased sense of self-control around food, less bloating, and a leaner midsection within weeks of starting SlimJaro. For Men: Muscle Retention and Belly Fat Reduction Men typically store fat in the abdominal region and often experience reduced testosterone and slowed metabolism as they age. SlimJaro supports metabolic restoration and natural hormone production that helps men: Men often report noticeable waist reduction, improved athletic performance, and more energy to stay active after starting Slim Jaro. Unisex Performance: One Formula, Universal Results SlimJaro’s formula is not gender-biased. It is suitable for everyone aged 18+, regardless of gender identity, provided they are not pregnant or nursing. Its natural, inclusive formulation makes it ideal for couples trying to get healthier together. The Origin of SlimJaro: From Research to Real Results The story of Slim Jaro starts not in a marketing boardroom but in a clinical wellness research lab where scientists and nutritionists focused on the root causes of weight gain and metabolic dysfunction. Through years of trials and testing, they identified a critical issue shared by most overweight individuals: a sluggish metabolism and poor fat oxidation. What fascinated the creators of SlimJaro was a discovery based on mineral activation and hormonal stimulation using trace elements found in Himalayan pink salt. This finding was coined the “Pink Salt Trick” – a powerful method of supporting metabolic efficiency and controlling hunger through a natural mechanism. But rather than making people rely on pink salt alone, the team incorporated this trick into a holistic supplement that combines modern nutrition with ancient wisdom. Thus, Slim Jaro was born – a capsule-based product that’s easy to use, gentle on the system, and powerful enough to accelerate fat burn naturally. The product’s creators wanted SlimJaro to break boundaries – not just in terms of scientific innovation, but also in accessibility. That’s why Slim Jaro was formulated to suit people of all dietary backgrounds. It’s non-GMO, gluten-free, soy-free, and free from harsh chemicals or stimulants. Since its launch, SlimJaro has exploded in popularity due to word-of-mouth success stories. Users from diverse backgrounds began to see visible results within weeks, driving a surge in global demand. What began as a niche wellness innovation is now a multinational best-seller, with a loyal customer base in over 25 countries. In many ways, SlimJaro is more than just a product – it’s a movement, reshaping how people view weight loss. It doesn’t push starvation diets or endless hours at the gym. Instead, it offers real results through metabolic support, hormonal balance, and appetite control – all rooted in natural ingredients. How Slim Jaro Works: The Science Behind the Magic? At its core, SlimJaro addresses the three main barriers to weight loss: Each capsule of SlimJaro is infused with ingredients that trigger a chain reaction in the body, beginning with metabolic activation. The Pink Salt Trick acts as the ignition, helping to stimulate thermogenesis – the process by which your body burns calories to produce heat. Once thermogenesis is activated, the ingredients in Slim Jaro mobilize stored fat, converting it into usable energy. This not only reduces fat storage but also boosts vitality, so you feel more active, alert, and motivated throughout the day. SlimJaro also plays a role in balancing key weight-related hormones, particularly leptin and ghrelin. Leptin controls satiety (the feeling of fullness), while ghrelin triggers hunger. When these hormones are out of balance, it leads to overeating and emotional cravings. SlimJaro helps stabilize this hormonal interplay, which leads to better control over portion sizes and reduced emotional eating. In addition, the supplement contains antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents that improve digestion and reduce bloating. Many users report feeling lighter, less bloated, and more regular within days of starting Slim Jaro. Importantly, SlimJaro works with your body – not against it. There are no jittery side effects like those found in caffeine-heavy fat burners. Instead, it promotes steady, sustainable fat loss by enhancing your body’s natural ability to process fat and use it as fuel. SlimJaro Ingredients Breakdown: What’s Inside the Formula? Slim Jaro isn't just another trendy fat burner—it’s a scientifically crafted metabolic support formula based on natural, clinically reviewed ingredients that target fat burning, appetite control, hormonal balance, and energy enhancement.

Slim Jaro Benefits Explained: How It Transforms Your Body from the Inside Out Slim Jaro is more than a weight loss pill — it’s a holistic health enhancer designed to activate your body’s natural fat-burning systems, restore metabolic balance, suppress unhealthy cravings, and elevate daily energy levels. Let’s take a deep dive into the core benefits of SlimJaro, exploring how each one works, what makes it effective, and why it has become a global favorite for men and women seeking safe, natural transformation. 1. Accelerates Fat Burning Through Thermogenesis How It Works: Slim Jaro contains thermogenic agents like Green Tea Extract (EGCG), Cayenne Pepper (Capsaicin), and Black Pepper Extract (Piperine) that increase your core body temperature. This process, known as thermogenesis, forces your body to burn more calories—even when at rest. The Result: You experience faster calorie burning, even while sitting or doing light activities. Over time, this contributes to a significant reduction in stored body fat, particularly in the midsection. 2. Reduces Appetite and Controls Cravings How It Works: SlimJaro targets the hypothalamus, the part of the brain responsible for hunger, using natural appetite-suppressing ingredients like Garcinia Cambogia, Apple Cider Vinegar, and African Mango Extract. The Result: You naturally eat less without feeling deprived. This leads to a calorie deficit, the key to consistent weight loss. 3. Balances Hormones That Influence Weight Gain How It Works: SlimJaro addresses hormonal imbalances that are often the hidden culprits behind stubborn fat—especially belly and hip fat. Ingredients like Ashwagandha and Pink Himalayan Salt support adrenal function and hormonal harmony. The Result: By correcting hormonal disruptions, Slim Jaro helps the body return to a fat-burning state, making it easier to lose weight even after plateaus or menopause. 4. Boosts Energy Without Caffeine or Jitters How It Works: Unlike stimulant-based fat burners that cause energy crashes, SlimJaro uses a clean energy formula derived from metabolic enhancers like Green Tea Extract, Cayenne Pepper, and Chromium Picolinate. The Result: You feel awake, focused, and ready to move, without the highs and crashes of sugar or coffee. This energy boost also encourages physical activity, further enhancing weight loss. [Trusted by Thousands Worldwide] - Read SlimJaro Reviews & Real Customer Complaints! 5. Supports Healthy Digestion and Reduces Bloating How It Works: A sluggish digestive system can slow metabolism and promote bloating. Slim Jaro includes ingredients like Apple Cider Vinegar, Pink Himalayan Salt, and Piperine to improve digestive enzyme function. The Result: Better digestion = less bloating, smoother metabolism, and faster nutrient absorption, all of which contribute to a flatter stomach and enhanced fat-burning. 6. Improves Sleep and Reduces Stress-Eating How It Works: Emotional and late-night eating are often driven by high cortisol and poor sleep. SlimJaro addresses both with Ashwagandha, an adaptogen known to calm the nervous system and regulate stress hormones. The Result: You wake up refreshed and less prone to stress-based snacking, which can make or break a fat-loss journey. 7. Supports Cardiovascular and Metabolic Health How It Works: SlimJaro supports healthy heart function and metabolic performance by improving lipid profiles, reducing inflammation, and enhancing blood flow through ingredients like Garcinia, ACV, and Green Tea. The Result: Not only do you look better, but your heart, arteries, and metabolic system function better too, supporting long-term wellness. 8. Increases Insulin Sensitivity and Blood Sugar Control How It Works: Fat loss becomes difficult when insulin resistance is high. SlimJaro fights this with Chromium Picolinate, ACV, and African Mango, all of which help stabilize blood sugar and improve insulin response. The Result: You experience fewer sugar crashes, more stable energy, and a reduction in fat storage, especially around the waist. 9. Enhances Nutrient Absorption for Better Results How It Works: Even the best supplement won’t work if your body can’t absorb it. SlimJaro includes Piperine, which amplifies the bioavailability of other ingredients by as much as 2000%. The Result: You get the full benefits of every capsule, making Slim Jaro more effective than standalone extracts. 10. Works for All Body Types and Lifestyles How It Works: SlimJaro was created with universal metabolic triggers that don’t rely on gender, specific diets, or age groups.

Users across the world—ages 18 to 70+—have reported significant benefits. 11.

The ingredients are free from synthetic binders, preservatives, or toxic fillers. The Result: A clean formula you can take daily without fear of long-term health risks or side effects. 12.

Apple and Amazon have lost $1 trillion combined since the president’s “liberation day” tariff plan was announced earlier this month Wall Street is off to a brutal start to the week, with the Nasdaq dropping more than 3% a few hours into trading on Monday morning, as the markets continue to grapple with President Trump’s tariffs and his criticism of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 3.29%, the S&P 500 was down 2.97%, and the Dow Jones had dropped 2.84% by 12:15 E.T. on Monday. Several major media and tech companies like Apple and Disney have taken hits to their share price as part of the downturn — more on that in a minute — and from a macro standpoint, all three major indexes are down 10% or more since the president announced his “liberation day” tariff plan on Apr. 2. Since then, the markets have been compared innumerable times to riding a rollercoaster, with wild daily swings becoming the norm the past few weeks. The Trump Administration on Friday signaled it was getting closer to working out a trade deal with China, although nothing concrete has been announced. The markets appear to have wanted a bit more clarity by the time trading started on Monday, especially as earnings season has kicked off. Last week, Netflix reported sales of $10.5 billion in the first quarter — up 12% year-over-year. Netflix’s stock is up 2.15% on Monday to $994 per share. A number of other big tech and media companies, including Meta, Spotify, Comcast and Disney, are set to report their first quarter earnings over the next few weeks. Something else that likely did not boost investor confidence on Monday was the president slamming Powell as a “major loser” who should cut interest rates. Apple, the world’s most valuable company, is down 3.05% on Monday. Since Apr. 2, the tech giant has seen $700 billion shaved from its market cap, as investors have worried about the tariff on Chinese imports hitting Apple devices. Amazon is down 3.49% on Monday and has had its valuation drop from $2.07 trillion to $177 trillion since the start of April. And Google, which was found to have an illegal monopoly for the second time in less than a year last week, was down 2.88% a few hours into trading. Meta, meanwhile, is down 3.68%; The parent company of Facebook and Instagram is currently facing its own antitrust lawsuit from the government. Here is how a number of other media and tech stocks are performing: Comcast: -1.82% Roku: -0.74% Amazon: -3.49% Disney: -1.52% WB Discovery: -3.80% Snap Inc.: -2.84% Paramount: -0.87% Spotify: -1.80% Live Nation: -2.80% As for earnings, check TheWrap on Thursday morning for a look at how Comcast’s Q1 went, then check back on Thursday afternoon for a look at how Alphabet, Google and YouTube’s parent company, performed.

As markets swirl amid tariffs and trade war concerns, one company is looking rather recession-proof: Netflix (NFLX+2.09%). The company was one of the rare bright spots in trading Monday, rising almost 2% after delivering a blockbuster first quarter that had experts comparing the company with Big Tech instead of Big Media. Netflix posted nearly $3 billion in profit and a 31.7% operating margin on $10.5 billion in revenue. Netflix is outperforming both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices as of midday Monday, which had declines of 2.8% and 3.1%, respectively.​ The company is up 12% year-to-date, while the S&P and Nasdaq are down 12.5% and 18%. An analyst report from William Blair said Netflix is “currently not experiencing economic headwinds with stable retention” after its strong quarter. The financial services firm maintained its “outperform” rating for Netflix’s stock. “Netflix is relatively more insulated from the recent market turmoil because it is not overly exposed to tariffs and will be relatively resilient in any potential future economic downturn,” analysts Ralph Schackart and Jack Brenczewski wrote in the report. “Overall, Netflix remains well positioned to remain a secular streaming winner, in our view, and we believe longer term it will continue to have pricing power.” The report’s key takeaways included that price hikes are performing in line with expectations and retention is strong and stable; that the advertising business is successfully scaling; and that Netflix’s large, monetizable audience should allow the company to maintain its edge over competitors. “Netflix disclosed its audience is larger than 700 million people, with more than two-thirds of the audience outside the United States,” analysts wrote. “Given its content diversification strategy of making original content for global countries, this should allow the company to maintain its scaled competitive advantage.” Netflix expects its second quarter revenue to be slightly above Wall Street’s expectation at roughly $11 billion. Its 2025 revenue is still expected to be between $43.5 and $44.5 billion. Netflix does have areas where it can improve, however, according to the William Blair analysts. Namely: its advertising product. Earlier this month, the company rolled out its ads suite in the U.S. and will start rolling its product out to other advertising markets. “In our view, this is important because the advertisers we have spoken with suggest Netflix needed to improve its advertising platform. The new platform will provide advertisers with better measurement and targeting, new ad formats, and advanced programmatic capabilities,” the analysts wrote. The company is looking at other ways to expand, too. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said in an earnings call Thursday that video podcasts may be the next format to land on the platform, potentially pulling business from Spotify (SPOT+1.35%) and YouTube (GOOGL+1.23%). Other analysts shared William Blair’s optimism. JPMorgan Chase (JPM-0.63%) analyst Doug Anmuth wrote in a client note published Sunday that “Netflix [is] playing offense, while stock remains defensive.” And Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein called the company “the cleanest story in internet” following its first quarter results. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

The Tysons, Virginia-based firm now owns 538,000 Bitcoin worth $47.2 billion following Bitcoin’s climb above $88,000 on Sunday, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. The software firm said it scooped the asset up for an average price of $84,800 last week. Strategy said the acquisition was made using proceeds from two recent equity offerings: the firm received $548 million in proceeds by issuing Class A common shares, while Strategy also gained $8 million from the sale of its so-called perpetual “STRK” preferred stock. Uncertainty surrounding U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade war has weighed on risk assets in recent weeks, as economists pencil in slower growth and higher costs for consumers in the U.S., yet Strategy has bought Bitcoin fairly consistently since mid-March. Over the past six Mondays, Strategy has said that it bought Bitcoin on five of them. The size of Strategy’s recent Bitcoin purchases has varied, however. After buying $11 million worth of Bitcoin in mid-March, it spent $1.9 billion on Bitcoin two weeks later, per Saylor Tracker. Strategy’s shares were recently trading at about $322, up 1.6% on the day, according to Nasdaq. The stock changed hands as high as $328 during pre-market trading on Monday but plunged as low as $317 after the opening bell. On Sunday, Strategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor noted on X, formerly Twitter, that the company isn’t a niche option for gaining exposure to Bitcoin’s price anymore. Based on public data, 13,000 institutions hold Strategy’s stock directly, along with 814,000 accounts tied to retail investors, he said. In addition, Saylor said 55 million investors have “indirect exposure through ETFs, mutual funds, pensions, and insurance portfolios. Strategy was added to the Nasdaq 100 in December, a milestone placing it within the coveted ranks of tech giants like Apple and Meta. The company may also join the S&P 500 one day, but Strategy’s lack of consistent profits is currently a barrier, based on inclusion criteria.

Title: Verizon’s consumer chief: Net neutrality ‘went literally nowhere’

Sowmyanarayan Sampath on the 5G race with China and the challenges of standing up to the Trump administration. by Nilay Patel Sowmyanarayan Sampath on the 5G race with China and the challenges of standing up to the Trump administration. by Nilay Patel Today, I’m talking with Verizon consumer CEO Sowmyanarayan Sampath, who goes by “Sampath.” As CEO of Verizon’s consumer division, Sampath oversees the biggest part of the business: Verizon Wireless, which has more than 115 million wireless connections, and Fios, which adds another 10 million or so consumer broadband connections to the mix. That’s something like a solid third of the entire country in business with Sampath. As you’ll hear, Sampath is a longtime Verge reader, and in particular he’s been paying attention to my coverage of both 5G and the net neutrality debates for a long time. So we talked very directly about whether the huge 5G investment had actually paid off — whether the “race” we were supposedly in with China was actually worth it, and what kinds of new apps and services actually come to light. You’ll hear Sampath say that network capacity isn’t a small thing, and 5G really helped with the explosion of mobile data — although I was told we’d all be doing robot surgery in driverless cars by now. The mechanics of all that buildout are fascinating to me, regardless of the hype. Building network infrastructure takes years — everything from figuring out what spectrum to bid on to making deals for towers and running fiber to them is a huge process, and I wanted to ask Sampath how he balances all those very long-term, very tactical decisions against the decisions we all see and feel in very obvious ways, like consumer pricing. Sampath had one of the very clearest answers to the classic Decoder question about decision making here — like I said, you can tell he was very ready to be on this show. Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here! Sampath and I also spent a while talking about the push and pull of integrating content and applications directly into the network. That’s something that all the big wireless carriers flirted with in various ways, especially in and around the peak net neutrality debate. In 2018, AT&T bought HBO and CNN parent Time Warner, right after Verizon bought Yahoo and started something called go90. For one brief extremely weird moment there, Verizon even owned Tumblr. The goal of all these media plays was to differentiate the various networks from each other, and it basically didn’t work for anyone — even though Verizon in particular fought the various net neutrality regulations that would have prevented this sideshow in the first place. Sampath and I got pretty far into the weeds on that. You’ll hear him say he thinks no one cares about net neutrality, and, well — I disagreed with him. And while Verizon has always fought tooth and nail against the sort of “normal” regulations like net neutrality, the second Trump administration isn’t nearly as hands-off when it comes to things like holding up deals because of DEI policies — something that’s happening to Verizon right now. So I had to ask Sampath if he was going to push back on that kind of clear government overreach as hard as Verizon has pushed back in the past. This one is all kinds of wonky, because it’s two telecom nerds going at it, so some notes before we start. You’re going to hear me talk about local loop unbundling, which is when multiple internet providers can use the same fiber to reach consumers. We don’t really have it in the United States — there are not four different ISPs all competing to reach your house on the same mile of cable or fiber — but many other countries do, as a way to increase broadband competition. The other thing you’ll hear us get into is something called OpenRAN. That’s an initiative the US government committed some money to last year that’s supposed to open up competition in the broadband hardware space and get US providers off of Huawei components. It’s a little complicated, but it’s a big bet in the mobile industry, and I wanted to hear Sampath’s take on it. Okay: Verizon Consumer CEO Sowmyanarayan Sampath. Here we go. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Sowmyanarayan Sampath, you’re the CEO of Verizon Consumer Group. Welcome to Decoder. Good to see you, Nilay. I am very excited to talk to you. It’s a topsy-turvy time in America, but telco stocks are doing great. Everyone needs internet service, and there’s a really interesting dynamic there that I want to explore with you. But first, we don’t get a lot of telecom CEOs on the show. It’s hard to understand how telecom companies are structured. I want to start with the Decoder question because all of these companies have been built by mergers, spinoffs, sales, and recombinations. You were the CEO of Verizon’s business unit. Now you’re the CEO of the consumer group. Explain how all of this is structured and what the Verizon consumer actually is. The way we think about it is, we are customer-facing. We have a Verizon Business group, which takes care of all businesses — small businesses, government, large enterprises, anything from Walmart down to Joe’s Pizza. We take care of that. Then everyone else is a consumer. It’s you and me in our private lives. The wireless service, the fiber service, the broadband to the home — all that’s in consumer. The consumer business is a little north of $105 billion in revenue. I’m responsible for sales, marketing, product offering, customer care, and digital. It’s an end-to-end unit getting things done. Most telcos, at least Verizon, have a common network that serves all of us. We call it the Intelligent Edge Network. It’s a single network that serves different types of underlying networks and businesses, so we don’t multiply costs in it. That’s it. It’s a pretty simple structure. Go to market for business, go to market for consumer, and a common network that is a shared service that serves all of us. I’ve spent a lot of time covering telecom companies, and in particular, wireless and mobile companies. One thing that always feels opaque to me is the differentiation that you can do to a business or a customer based on the network. This was a big fight in the net neutrality days, that you’d want to differentiate the actual network for different customers in different ways, and that has waned. When you say you go to market for the customer, are you in charge of things like pricing and promotion, or do you actually get to say, “Here’s what the network can and cannot do?” Here’s what the network can and cannot do. It’s the whole end-to-end offering, including the product. The way we think about it is that a product is a network. Look, there will always be a good operator and a non-good operator. It’s historically always been the same. For a country as large as America, you’ll always... Look at the end of the day, we and my peers use the same steel to make the towers. We use common tower companies to take care of our tower business. We use pretty similar vendors. We use Ericsson and Samsung. Some may use Nokia. There’s a commonality there. But the secret sauce is in the operations. When you’re running a network this big, how do you take care of outages? How do you plan for it? And even small things like how you design your tower or the specs you put on your tower? For example, almost all our sites have generator backup. Whenever a hurricane falls or there’s a natural disaster, our sites are up and running because we have backups on our sites. Second, we like resiliency on our sites. There will always be a better operator and not a good operator. We know it. We’ve got 25 years of experience or 30 years, depending on how you count it in the space. There will always be a gap. Now, is the gap narrowing between us and the second network? Probably yes. But there’ll always be a gap, and that’s why people always choose us for the network. If you go and ask people who’s the better network, they’ll always end up saying Verizon. We have to stay on top of it by using more AI in our operations. Self-healing networks. Spectrum is another thing. We have to keep buying a lot of spectrum to put it... There is always a case for a better operator and a better network. I think that’s the heart of my question. Verizon, as a company, in a very reductive way, has to go to the government, lease a bunch of spectrum capacity, and go to a bunch of tower operators. I always think it’s funny that the biggest one is called TowerCo. It’s just a very literal name that no one except you has to consider. You have to go to a bunch of tower companies and site operators, give them the spectrum so they can operate the towers, and lease the capacity back from them to run your network. Your competitors might be on the same infrastructure or the same sites in many cases because it’s so hard to build a cell tower in many places. Then, somehow, at the end of that, the consumer perceives Verizon’s network as the best one. That is as much a function of consumer marketing and experience… When I moved to New York in the early 2010s, everybody had a Blackberry and Verizon, and that impression has stuck with me for all this time. Maybe that’s still the case that Verizon is the best, but what happened was I moved to New York in the 2010s, and Cingular had the best network in Chicago at that time (where I moved from). Then Verizon was the best on the East Coast. I spend a lot of time thinking, “Where does that impression actually come from?” Because no customer holds two phones in their hands and says, “This one has better service.” There are two ways. One is, is it a better network, and then the other is, how do people perceive it? We talk about national networks. We are the largest network because more customers are on us, but the end of the network is a very local thing. The vast majority of our customers, I would say 60 or 70 percent of our customers, never go outside a five-cell cell site travel zone for the year. Think about it, you may have a great network in Alaska, but 70 percent of your customers are not traveling within five or six-cell sites outside their home or their workplace. It’s a very local conversation about how good you are. Of course, there are some people who travel a lot. People like me who are on the road 150 days per year. It’s a different equation. But for most people, how good is the network at home? How good is the network at work? How good is the network during their commute? And that’s what makes the experience. You cannot have national standards to do these things. A lot of it is a local game. Getting access to sites locally. Getting access to better network technology at the local level. Having people who know the network topology at the local level. It’s a very local game, this network thing. And that’s why you see Verizon tends to do well when local networks come into play. How much impact do you have on the capital expenditure of building the network itself? You have a number of customers, and the business side has a number of customers. Do you jointly show up in front of the core network team and say, “You need to build more capacity in Connecticut”? The consumer group has 85 to 90 percent of all the usage on the network. Maybe it’s a slightly stilted conversation there, but the way it works is… Network is a little bit like scotch. It takes a long time to really become good. Decisions we make today on the network tend to show up three, four, five, or seven years later down the line because there’s a huge lead time to it. You’ve got to procure the fiber, backhaul the sites, and the spectrum to do that. The way we start is by asking, “What is the network I need to deliver my customer’s needs?” And it’s at a local level. In Philadelphia, by markets, what do I know? How much share do I have? What am I going to grow? Then we take that back to the network team and say, “Based on what assets you have, what’s available? Can you deliver this?” And 9 out of 10 times, they can deliver it. The one out of 10 times they can’t, then we move our marketing plans... If they don’t have capacity, they’re not going to get capacity in this market in the next few years. The second thing is having objective metrics of network performance. For a common person, if a call drops or a network data session goes down, it’s bad. But we track it a million different ways by design. Having that common nomenclature... Back in the day, it was dropped calls. Thinking, “How many drop calls did you have?” We used to measure every single one of them, and then if a drop call happened, we used to go and do root cause analysis. Now it’s data sessions. How many data sessions do you have? When did it drop? What were the speeds? How did the signal flow? Having really good instrumentation at the local level is really important. We’ve created basically a digital twin for every single customer. Every customer has a digital twin in the network where we measure the network 24/7, and we give them a score. Nilay had a score, it’s out of 10. You can say Nilay had a 9.7 score this morning on his commute from A to B. It’s a good score. If he had a score of five, we would go and understand why the score of five happened. Every single customer is monitored 24/7, from a network performance perspective, and then we track them through the system. When you look at that kind of data at scale, you obviously have lots of customers who, I’m guessing, have lots of different scores across the board. Where’s the median? Where do you want people to be? You want people to be in the eights and nines for the vast part of their lives. Now, one of the things with the network is... A bigger issue we have to face, as an industry, is that when things work well, nobody thinks of us. When things don’t... It’s a little bit like parenting sometimes. When the kids are happy, they don’t think of us. Then, when they’re less than happy, they think of us. It’s a little bit like that, because 90-something percent of the time, the network works flawlessly. Whether we’re discussing the fiber in the home or the wireless network. And we are largely forgotten, which is good. But when it doesn’t work, all the emotions come out in front. We are trying to solve for that one percent where the network doesn’t work, or we’ve disappointed the customer. Most of our work is isolating where it doesn’t work. Because where it works, we know it, and we just have to let the machine run its course. We’ve talked a lot about the mobile network. You also have oversight of Fios, right? The fiber buildout. Verizon has been up and down with Fios over the 15 years that I have covered this company. There are huge investments, huge government-backed investments, disinvestment, and reinvestment. Where are you with Fios now? We love fiber. Some of it is personal. Look, I built my career on fiber. In every role I’ve had at Verizon, we ended up building more fiber. Verizon was the first. In 2004, we created the Fios network. It was the first, probably in the world, to have fiber. We slowed down a bit in the middle; it was mostly a capital allocation issue for us. We always liked the business. We committed to it at an OPEX level, but we had to invest in 4G. We had to buy the spectrum to invest in 4G. Then we had to buy the spectrum for 5G. Some of the capital that we would’ve put into fiber then, we ended up moving to the wireless side of the business. Now that the 5G is towards the back end of its build, we are back in the fiber business. We bought Frontier, and we are going to close before the year’s end, or maybe in the first quarter of 2026. That’ll give us another 10 million homes. Nilay, we’re going to have a path to get to 40 million homes of fiber. And fiber is so resilient. The churn is very low. The customer satisfaction is crazy high. Then, when you put the two together, mobile and home, the economics are fabulous. We are really committed to a converged strategy on fiber plus mobility, and that’s the business we are in. We are not distracted as a company. It’s very simple. People ask me, “What do you do?” I say, “I connect things, I connect people.” Full stop. There’s no other business we want to be in, and fiber is part of that story. Well, I’m on a Fios connection now. So if this drops, it’s on you. Just letting you know. Nilay, it ain’t dropping. I’m on a Fios connection too, and it ain’t dropping. Describe the structure of Verizon broadly. You’ve laid it out in a big way, right? There’s the network, there’s business, and there’s consumer. How many people do you have in consumer, and how is that actually structured inside Verizon? We work with partners, as well as... A lot of our call centers have partners. Some of our stores have partners. We have probably around 30,000-ish people in the consumer unit broadly. I probably end up managing, directly or indirectly, the 30,000 people between our call center partners and our agents to do the work that Verizon consumer is tasked with. The way we are structured internally in Consumer is that we have a gentleman, Frank Boulben, who runs revenue for us. He has all the product offerings. The go-to-market sits with him. Then we have Kevin [Zavaglia], who runs our field. We are the sixth-largest retailer in America. We have 8,000 exclusive stores between our brands. Kevin runs all of that, plus our relationships on the distribution side. Then we have Nancy Clark, who runs our prepaid business. It’s a fully integrated business. We’ve turned around that business really well. We should touch on that at some point. She runs that. Monica Hammond runs all our customer service, customer care, and customer success organization. And Brian Higgins runs customer experience and digital. A very typical structure that we have. I think most telcos end up doing something quite similar to this. Is there any innovation in that structure? We have a lot of startup founders come on the show that have big ideas about structure, and then maybe they land in one of two or three different ones. But then you see some companies show up and say, “Okay, there’s actually efficiency from rethinking the structure.” Telcos are big, regulated companies. Obviously, that shapes how you would run a company like Verizon. But do you see any efficiency there compared to your big competitors like AT&T or T-Mobile? I was a management consultant. I was with a Boston Consulting Group for a very, very long time before this. We had a strong thesis on organization and structure. Then I became a day-to-day operator. I think as long as your structure is not crazy stupid, it works. It all comes down to people and taking friction out of the process. Because any structure will have a seam in it, otherwise the president of the country should be running every single thing on a single day-to-day basis. It doesn’t work. When you break it up into a company, break it up into divisions, you’ll have a seam everywhere. The question is, how do you manage the seam? Because every time you ship a product out, you ship your org structure. We know it. Okay? The question is, where are the seams, and how do you take the friction of those seams out? For example, customer care and digital. One is the digital channel. One is a human being getting called. When you call up, does the lady in customer care know what you did in digital five minutes ago? There’s a seam in the organization. You have to go and manage those seams, not get too bent about who reports to whom and what structure it is. And I think people tend to change structures a lot, hoping they’re going to get magic out of it. But I think the magic is in friction, seam management, and never ever shipping your org structure on your product. Your product should not look like your org. The other big Decoder question I ask everybody is about decisions. You have a lot of decisions to make. Everything from going to try to buy spectrum, to customer-facing decisions. How do you make decisions? What’s your framework? I have a framework for decision-making. It’s a two-by-two matrix. Of course, any recovering consultant has to tell you that. On the X axis, it’s what I call a one-way decision or a two-way decision. One-way decisions for me are really big and very difficult to unwind. It’s things like buying other companies. Even some big leadership decisions, long-term pricing decisions, and big product categories that you want to be in. These are one-way decisions. The cost to unwind is very high, very painful, and will take a toll on the company and its finances. That’s one. Then I have what I call two-way decisions. It’s a promotion. It’s moving a few people around in the markets. It’s trying different things with retailers, trying different compensation things. These are two-way decisions. They can be reversed. Damage can be limited. You could make a bad decision, but you can limit the damage. Then on the other axis, I have low dollars and high dollars. Low dollar, I have a certain threshold in my head. These are low-dollar decisions. And then you have high-dollar decisions. You never want to spend time with one-way, low-dollar decisions. They’re just bad. You should never even have one of those, but people spend time in companies on that. I work very hard not to make those decisions at all. Because if something is a one-way decision and big enough, it had better have a high impact. If it’s low impact, you shouldn’t do it because there’s risk in it, and it’s not worth it. Anything that is a two-way decision, that is also low-dollar, you should delegate it. Someone else can make the decision, you’ll be fine. And you have to trust the governance model, that there are checks and balances, so nothing bad happens. I try to spend 60 percent of my time on one-way decisions that are high-dollar value. Where to invest? What categories to do? Who are the big leadership positions I want to fill with talent? And I map every decision down to this framework, and I actively manage it. Just moving from a staff role into a large ops role, the best way to understand how a company runs is to follow the decision-making style. How do decisions get made? Who makes them? Who has the pocket vetoes? You can understand every single thing about a group you’ve inherited by just following decisions. Take five decisions, and track them end-to-end. That’s it. That’s all you need to know. You know about people. You know about pocket vetoes. You know who the naysayers are. You know who’s not ambitious, and you know about talent. For me, decision-making is a science and an art, and one that I practice really aggressively every time I can. That was the best answer to the decision-making question we’ve ever gotten, but that’s the thesis of the show, right? Inside the question about structure and decision-making, I can tell you about 80 percent of your company. I know it from the jump, and then we can go on to the actual specifics. But yours is an interesting answer because you’ve devalued the structure question, and you’ve raised the value of the decision question. Most folks do it the other way around. Why make the flip? Because I think organization is a people construct. When people like each other, when they feel like their work is well taken care of and appreciated, and they’re in a well-supported framework, they’ll give it their best. I think people use structure sometimes to pit people against each other and give conflicting priorities to different people, thinking they’re going to get the best answer. I do not believe in that. I strongly believe... I have extra time sometimes. Rare, but I do have extra time. This afternoon from 4PM to 6PM, I don’t have anything on my calendar. I will go back and say, “Where can I take the friction out of the organization?” Because when my role is... The best use of my time is when I take the friction out. For example, there may be friction between two groups. I go sit down with them, “Tell me, why is there friction? Oh, we have an issue with priorities. Let’s go sort it out.” The minute we take the friction out, people work well together. Organization gets devalued completely. Then it all comes back to decision-making. And second is… Organization is always a moment-in-time issue because priorities change, people change, and organizations change. You can’t use an org structure to drive performance in the field and priorities. I like decision-making as a more powerful tool to do that. And the second is, how much data is enough to make a decision? This is something, I think, a lot more material should be written about. I promise I will not write a book on this when I retire. People think there are some groups that think they need 100 percent of the data to make a decision. Some make it on a gut. I don’t think both are right or wrong, but we also need a good framework for that as well. Like, “When are you ready to pull the trigger on things?” It’s difficult in big companies, but it’s also very difficult in startups, and I think it’s a very different construct. Because in my business, I know the market, I know the customer. I have 100 years’ worth of customer experience and customer elasticity models to work with. It’s a very different thing. When in startup mode, you’re creating a category. TAM doesn’t exist. You’re stretching PowerPoint to make your TAM real. You have to rely more on the gut to make those calls. When it comes to people decisions, you can put them through evaluation, but you have to make decisions based on gut [feelings]. But when we’re making a pricing promotion, or product-fit decisions in my world, I think it’s a little more data-driven. That is another area where I think I’ll become a better manager if I practice more of that. Let’s put some of this into practice. Let’s just walk through an easy one here. Verizon just announced a three-year price lock for customers. This is right on top of the Trump tariffs. I always wonder how these decisions get made. A long, long time ago, I asked another network executive, “Why is this pricing like this?” And the answer — this is a real answer that I received from your other big competitor, but a decade ago — was, “Well, this is how the computer system works. To make it different, we would have to reprogram a bunch of billing systems, and that’s costly. This is how our pricing works.” It was a very honest answer. It was also somewhat disillusioning, in the moment, that the pricing of the network plan was more related to the structure of the computer system that ran the billing than anything customers could perceive. I’m assuming it’s been a decade. I’m assuming everyone has upgraded their billing systems. But you announced this three-year price lock right on top of the tariffs. The marketing is that you want to give customers predictability. Lots of people have lots of feelings about wireless pricing. I have lots of feelings about wireless pricing. But that decision, you’re going to lock rates for three years, that touches your marketing, revenue, and forecasting. How do you make that kind of decision? We are in the middle of a large turnaround in the consumer business. Verizon used to take the most share of the growth. We had the lowest churn in ‘21. In 2021 and ‘22, we lost our way a little bit. My chairman, Hans, spoke about it. We got sloppy. We know it. Since then, we have been back on the turnaround track to do that. It’s a three-step turnaround. Step one for me was to fix sales. Fix our stores, fix our compensation system. Become a local company. We came to national… Everything was decided in this building. It didn’t make sense for a company our size. Step two was to take care of a price premium. We had a 40 percent price premium to the market on our plans. I think that is unsustainable for us. Look, we had a better network, we knew it, but 40 percent was too much for us. So we tweaked it. We are now down to 10 percent, 10 to 15 percent, depending on how we look at it. I think it is sustainable. We are growing our non-connectivity business really well. The third journey for me was to get my churn back in shape. Churn is the number of customers who end up leaving us every single month. It’s still very low. It’s like 0.7 or 0.8. So think about it. Nine percent of our customers leave us every year, which means our average customer stays with us for 11 years, which is crazy, by the way. And in Fios, that number is close to 20 or 30 years, depending on how you look at it. It’s a loyal base, but you want churn to go down every single time because it’s expensive to acquire customers. We spend a lot of money upfront acquiring them. For me, it was how do you get churn in a much better place? We went and asked customers. For the last four quarters, we polled customers. Nilay, I’ll give you a great tool that we built with AI, where… It’s an internal tool we built. Every day, I get half a million calls coming into my customer care centers. Every single day, they come in. And we take every one of those calls, transcribe them, and put them in a generative AI machine. At 9AM, I get a sheet of paper that tells me the sentiments, key themes, and what happened with all of yesterday’s calls. It is mind-blowing because earlier [before this tool], I had to call people. We had analysts who used to listen to calls, transcribe them, and make notes. Now every single call is put in a machine, and I get a piece. We picked up two very clear themes when I did that. The first one for me was certainty. People are like, “Everything in my life is uncertain right now. There’s uncertainty about the economy. There’s uncertainty about my job. There’s uncertainty about work from home. There’s just a lot of tension. I want certainty with prices, especially with categories I cannot live without. And phone is one of those categories.” Certainty kept coming up again and again in our reads from the market. The second thing that came up was flexibility. I never want to pay for something I don’t use. That’s one of the reasons why we took out all those inclusions. You get this free, you get that free. And people are like, “I know Disney is good. My kids love Disney, but I don’t watch Disney. Why should I have to pay for it?” Those were the two really clear insights we got from customers. That’s one. Second, we’ve done a series of price increases over the last couple of years. We had a couple in January. We know elasticity. When we do a price up, we model it. I would say the last price up we did, the elasticity was a little more than what we had modeled. That, coupled with all the insights we got from the customer, we had to respond and tell the customers that we are going to lock prices for three years. Now, it gives customers certainty. It puts a little more pressure back on us because we have to drive revenue in other ways. We have clear ways to do that, but I think it’s an industry first, especially now. Look, we knew the tariffs were coming in the day before yesterday. It was announced... It’s on TV. We are very comfortable doing that because, at a time of uncertainty, we want to give our customers some certainty and some peace of mind. All right, I’m going to be pretty hard on you now. I have covered the telecom industry for a long time. I noticed yesterday [April 3] that every other stock in the world dropped, and telecoms went up. Because people have to have your service, right? It is a requirement of modernity to be connected to the internet and to have a phone. And it feels like one of the reasons fiber customers stick around for a long time is that there’s nowhere else to go, right? The switching costs are very high, or maybe infinite, because there’s literally no other competitor that can offer the service that Fios offers, in many places. That’s true for every residential broadband provider, as competition is generally low. In mobile, the competition is basically you and AT&T, and then T-Mobile is a very strong challenger that’s gotten bigger. But Verizon and AT&T are the biggest players still. There was supposed to be a fourth player, and the government created this Dish Network deal, which I will ask you about soon. That has gone nowhere, right? There’s not actually a fourth national carrier that competes with you. When you say customers stick around for a long time, what I see is, well, there’s nowhere else to go, right? How much does that come to your thinking that, actually, a Fios customer can’t leave? A Fios customer can leave tomorrow morning. Every single Fios customer today can move to cable broadband that afternoon. There are very few Fios customers who don’t have a cable competitor in play. I just think Fios is a better solution. It’s a significantly better solution than cable because of the pricing practices they’ve had and the quality of their network. But there is a full- I hear you, and I’m sorry to interrupt, but I’ve heard that line from many, many, many telco executives in the United States. I look at the United Kingdom, for example, where they’ve done local loop unbundling. And, actually, my colleagues who live in London have 15 fiber providers at much lower prices and much higher speeds because the presence of competition is so much higher, right? It’s not literally switching from fiber to cable, a different kind of network, it’s different providers within the same fiber network offering more competition. We’ve not done that here, but they’re always switching, and you can see the prices come down because of it. I think it’s a careful balance. Canada has moved to a local loop unbundling scenario as well. The UK has always had it. That’s why European telecom has one of the lowest investments in telecom ever, in any country, almost in any region of the world today, because they just don’t have enough of a profit pool and cash flow to reinvest back in their network. Think about 5G. We are going to get to 90 percent deployment in a country as large and diverse as us. Most European countries are not even at 40 to 50 percent deployment of 5G. I think one of the things, if America wants to be competitive, if America wants to compete with China, having high-quality broadband is super important for that. Whether it’s mobility or whether it’s that. And you want to create profit pools in the system to go back and reinvest. Think about it. I’m going to invest close to $18.5 billion in just capital. In the last seven years, we’ve invested $200 billion in the network. $200 billion between spectrum and fiber, and the mobility business. I don’t see any European carrier investing $200 billion in seven years. In fact, if they invest a 10th of that, they’re going to get an award. I think it’s super important for a country to be really at the cutting edge of technology, the cutting edge of fiber, the cutting edge of 5G. And look, when 6G comes, we will be the first. I’ll tell you that today. We were the first in 5G. We beat the Koreans by 12 hours. We will beat whoever else... And most likely it’s going to be China on 6G as well. I think it’s a national security issue. It’s a national competitive issue. We need to keep reinvesting in broadband every single time, and we are not going to stop. You’ll see us investing at the same rate for a very, very long time. And all our investment is in America, in LA. I’m not investing in other countries. I’m 100 percent invested in America, and I think the profit pool lets us do that. All right, we’re here at the end, right? 5G is done, it’s deployed. Everybody has the 5G phones. What were the stakes of losing the race to 5G? No one ever gave me an answer to this question. If China had somehow won the 5G race, what would they have gotten that we didn’t get? What does it mean to lose the race? I think the first thing is standards. You want a standard that... You don’t want a bifurcation of standards, and it may happen. It could happen in the chipset, it could happen in AI, or operating systems and handsets. You’re in an interesting phase where you could potentially see a bifurcation of standards between the Western world and China. On 5G, we aligned on a very similar standard, and I think it helped because you’re able to take the price of the technology down to do that. The second is to think of all the applications and the tech economy that you have today. The app ecosystem, the Amazons of the world, the Googles of the world, and the Metas. They rely on the mobility network more than anyone else. Think about Instagram, it is worth zero without the cell phone and the connectivity. In fact- No, but specifically 5G. Instagram was worth a lot on the LTE network, and most of the 5G networks we have today are not running on millimeter wave 5G or whatever. They’re running on LTE enhanced, right? We’re still running... The core of the network here in the United States is a hybrid of 4G and 5G. No, if we had stuck with just LTE, we would not be able to take care of the capacity that’s happened. Think about it, the pandemic happened, we all moved to working from home, people… We were able to take care of those networks immediately because we had 5G; we could scale up. So 5G adds capacity in a way 4G could never have added because it comes down to spectral efficiency to do that. And we also ended up adding... Look, at the end of the day, capacity is a very simple thing. You can either add more spectrum, which is expensive, but you can add it. We do it every X years, we do that. Or you can add more cell sites because you can reuse the spectrum, or you can get back to spectral efficiency. That’s the only three ways to add capacity. And 5G helps with one in three. It puts new spectrum bands into play, and it also helps with spectral efficiency. You got a lot more capacity out of 5G, and also took the cost of capacity down. Every incremental bit that abides, depending on how you put it up in the air, the cost goes down significantly. We saw a 30 to 40 percent reduction in cost per bit when you move from 4G to 5G. Without 5G, we could not have done that. The second is that we created a whole business around fixed wireless access, providing broadband by using wireless. It’s all on 5G. It ain’t on 4G, I’ll tell you that. It’s a multi-billion-dollar business for us. In a few years... Right now, probably 50 to 60 million homes could potentially get that. It’s another competitor to broadband. And what has happened is that cable has not been able to raise prices, and so it’s a lot more beneficial to customers because they have another competitor in the space to do that. The third thing, which I think has been a little underwhelming for me, personally, is new products and services using some of the 5G capabilities. And you never get this right because you have to get the network, the handset, and the apps all perfectly aligned. I don’t think that happened very well on 5G. I think the third leg of the stool still has more work to do. I think a lot of the AR/VR type new form factors that we are seeing are going to require really low latency, and that will require 5G. You definitely can’t do it on 4G. Sitting where I am, I’m so happy we did 5G. I wish we had done it two years earlier, but that’s always the scenario. And look, we’ll keep building our network, adding more capacity till 6G is up. I sat in all the demos of all the hyped 5G applications. I went on so many self-driving car rides at CES, powered by 5G, with the data center somewhere that was driving the car for me because the latency was low. I heard a lot about robot surgery — an infinite amount about robot surgery. Those were the applications that were promised. That was the vision of the war: that if we lose the war, China will own this set of industries that is built on the new network. It was not about network capacity in COVID, right? No one foresaw that what we would need is a more efficiently run network. It was not really about bringing prices down in any substantial way, because the only thing that ever happens is prices go up. That’s the spread, right? I’m just wondering, do you see the gap in how much hype there was for 5G and how oversold it was? And also the consumer reality of it, which is, yeah, everyone’s phones might have a little more network capacity. Yes, it’s great at the concert or the football game to have millimeter wave serving everyone really fast. I agree that that’s a great use case. But it actually didn’t pan out that the big set of applications we were promised, to justify this enormous cost and all of this literal war hype. It never came to pass. Yeah, I think wireless is one of the categories that has had negative inflation over the last 15 years. Think about it. When you had 300 minutes on your phone, you were allowed... Evenings and nights were free. You remember the time when you got maybe 300 texts. You were paying more for that than you’re paying today when you get a 5G phone with unlimited data, unlimited text, and satellite messaging included. There are very few categories... In fact, the only other category I can think of that has had negative inflation over the last 15 years is TVs. Flat-screen TVs have really crashed in price. TVs and us are probably the two biggest categories that have gone up. Everything else, prices have gone up significantly. All the way from eggs to others, everything has gone up. Our prices have actually come down for what we provide there. I think the industry is probably one of the most unique industries where we tend to give you a lot more for the same amount or a little less than we did 2, 3, 5, or 10 years ago to do that. The second thing is I do... Technology is interesting. For decades, nothing happens, and then in months, decades happen. You saw that with AI, right? You and I have been listening to AI ever since we were in college, and then suddenly, two years or a year and a half ago, the whole thing exploded. I think a lot of these special cases, new applications that we are working on, tend to be like that as well. It takes a while to work it. Look, I don’t think autonomous cars or robotic surgery are going to be the ones that are going to break the bank or are going to be the breakthrough services. But I see new form factors emerging. We may be in the last generation of phone form factor as we know it right now. I think you’re going to see a lot more control of the phones using LLM models. I think it’ll have huge implications for the operating system and huge implications on the app store. But I think this may be the last generation of smartphones that we see. And to power all of the other things, we just need a better network. The second thing is that we are doing a lot more work on 5G in the industrial space. It’s not something you and I end up using a lot, but in my old job, we used to do a lot of private networks, low-latency networks, running robotics, and factory automation based on a wireless network. There’s a lot more happening in that space. When you roll out such transformational technologies, you’ve got to play the long game. Look, Verizon is a company. We are committed to America. Look, we don’t do business in other parts of the world except for small business. We are committed to America, and we want Americans to have the best network, and we’ll keep deploying capital to make that happen. I think most consumers saw 5G as something that just sort of happened to them, right? They upgraded the phone, the network is there, and then I hear you on negative inflation and value over time, but the main thing that happened is you upgraded your iPhone. Now it’s 5G capable. You need a 5G plan, and that costs more than the plan you had yesterday. That is not true. But that was true for a vast majority of people across the vast majority of the industry. The plans did get more expensive. Actually, it didn’t. If you see phone ARPU, average revenue per user, which every carrier reports in some form or the other. ARPU has moved very little on a per-phone-line basis in the last 20 years that I’ve been in the space. And you’re getting a lot more now than you got many years ago. I think people have this notion that the phone bill is going up, but the phone bill is going up because they’re signing up for new services. For example, in my case, we are going to have a $2 billion business selling streaming services and entertainment services. Now, we give great savings. We give you a 40 percent discount when you buy Disney or Netflix, Max, and all the cool services from us. But the core phone service, as you know it, has really not gone up in price. And we’ve delivered more than pretty much any other industry for the price point that we do. And I’m very, very comfortable with that equation. It’s my job as the CEO of the business to ensure that we give more to our customers. Satellite messaging is one. It’s something… We found a way, we made it work, and we included it in our plans. You pay zero for it. I think we are adding significant value to customers, which is why our churn is so low. People can move wireless easily, but because of the value we bring to them every single day, they like us and they stay with us. One of the things that’s interesting there is the comparison to televisions, which you made. The reason televisions got so cheap is that the industry realized that putting a computer in the TV let them develop huge new revenue models, right? A $500 TCL TV is actually a revenue generator because there’s advertising baked into every layer of that TV now, or effectively a free Roku box. Roku owns the entire ad stack. That’s how they make all their revenue. It’s easy for them to subsidize the TVs in that way. That’s not really the case with mobile handsets, right? It might be the case on maybe the low end of Android phones. There’s some subsidy happening there. With the iPhone 16 Pro, Apple’s not going to let you monetize that device as directly as anybody wants to. The push has always been to go up the stack, right? To go into the application layer. A decade ago, we had a fight about net neutrality where the carriers really wanted to be in the application layer and modify the network to prefer some applications over others. That has petered out. I think it burbles up every now and again, but it’s mostly petered out. Now you’re saying the opportunity is to bundle Disney+, right? To bundle other applications. Is that settled now that that is the strategy? Or is the push into developing custom applications for your network, or the push to prefer bandwidth for some applications? Is that incentive still there? I think what does Verizon bring to the table? We bring distribution. We bring billing and customer care. We know how to manage subscriptions. We bring a brand that has got unaided awareness of close to 100 percent. Those are the big things we bring. And I think what we’ve decided is that we want to build our non-connectivity. My non-connectivity business is almost $15 billion. It’s the size of Hilton Hotels. My non-connectivity business is a standalone company. And we partner with the best in the world to do that. I partner with Netflix. I partner with Disney. We have an insurance protection product inside that. We partner with other folks to do that piece. I think we want to use our distribution, our ability to scale subscriptions, our ability to lower the cost of acquisition, and partner with the best. But second, the more people use my network, the more excited I get. We are working very, very closely with the likes of Amazon, Meta, Google, and Apple to ensure that they use our network more to develop more services because we will monetize it at the network layer really well. Then, on top of the network, we’ll find adjacencies to sell in. But if people don’t use my network more, all the cool services I build ain’t going to matter much. I think we’ve pivoted to a strategy, which is single network, scaled network, put as much traffic on it as people can, and we’ll find ways to monetize it in a pricing construct if we do that. On top of that, we have adjacencies. We have six categories we sell into, and there we use our scale distribution, and some integration back with our network to make it real to do that. I think, in a way, we are probably the largest incubator in the world today because we work closely with companies for them to go and innovate services. It’s a pretty cool position to be in. And as we finish deploying 5G, we’ll start seeing more and more of those cool services come out. One of the things that I think about is that there was just an explosion of big carriers buying media, right? Because you have the distribution, you have the billing. It made sense to vertically integrate all the way up to the top. At one point, Verizon owned Yahoo, which was very confusing. You started what was like a prototype of TikTok called Go90, which failed almost immediately. It’s a long-running joke in our other show, The Vergecast. You owned HuffPost. You had Tumblr for a second. On the business side, you bought BlueJeans, which is a video conferencing solution. That notion that you need to actually own the icon that the user is pushing on or the media they’re consuming on the phone. AT&T bought Time Warner, another obvious disaster that collapsed almost immediately. Where did those incentives come from to do that? And do you think that they’ve gone away? Has everyone learned their lesson? Yeah, and look, it happens in every industry. Look, at the end of the day, you can either grow horizontally or you can go vertically. There are only two ways to grow. We went through a phase... Look, I was on the leadership team of Yahoo and AOL. I was sent from Verizon to help run those assets and eventually sell them. And part of the thesis was that we create data in the telco world, whether it’s clickstream data, location data, or other network data, that, if matched with online data, could create a better targeting engine for advertisers. That was a thesis going in all the way. But then we realized that customers trust us because we don’t share data. And it was a deep, insightful conversation we had within ourselves, and we realized that we should not be in a business sphere, so we sold that business. But, again, for a company our size, if you look at our enterprise value, it was still a rounding error for us. Fine, it was something we should not have done, but it was still a rounding error for us. At the end of the day, we are focused on our core. Our core tends to be mobility. Our core is fiber, and our core is cloud/AI, enabling those things. That’s it. Those are the only three businesses we are in right now. Carriers around the world have sort of come to a similar place, but we are probably, I would say, the most focused of carriers anywhere in the world right now. Verizon fights the hardest against any net neutrality rules that appear at the state level and at the federal level. We can set a watch on the Verizon lawsuit against those rules. It happens every time. You’re saying you don’t need those rules, right? If I’m listening to you correctly, you’re saying, “We’ve learned our lesson. We’re not going to monkey with the network. We’re not going to prioritize our own services or someone else’s services. We just want volume,” right? Pure volume is what will drive your growth. Why fight against the rules if you’ve already come to the same conclusion? I don’t know what net neutrality does. I’ve been in this business for a little north of 20 years. Before that, I was in college, having fun. And I still don’t know what problem we are trying to solve with net neutrality. I actually don’t understand that, because at the end of the day, if there are 300 people using a congested road, and if a firefighter needs to go through, people are going to move aside and let him go through. That’s all we are saying. For traffic management purposes, we need to have some controls in the network. Otherwise, when in New York City, when the traffic core or the emergency services want access and it’s congested, I’m going to have to move people off so they get priority service. That’s all it is. And we need traffic management tools. Or you have one person in your town who’s sucking up all the bandwidth, and we have places like that where they use 100 or 200 times the average bandwidth. And because of that, 99 percent of the people are getting a shitty experience. We’ve got to manage the traffic. That’s all we are saying about it. I think this was a little bit of drama about nothing. And at the end of the day, we want to build networks and we want people to use them. We just want the ability to manage network management in a way that’s good for the broad set of people. I don’t think we really care about making one group better versus one group worse, which is why I think it got no traction, because I don’t know what problem it was trying to solve. To be clear, it did get traction. It passed through the FCC under Title II in one administration. It was undone by another administration. I have never encountered a net neutrality rule at the federal or state level that hasn’t allowed for reasonable network management practices, right? That’s always the heart of the rule. It’s really: can you prefer some content and services over others, right? No blocking, no throttling. It’s the heart of the rules, and Verizon has fought against those. I have seen your competitors do things like sponsor data, right? I’ll let you off the hook for one second. AT&T, when they owned Max, exempted Max from their own data caps, which was just openly unfair, right? It’s just straightforwardly unfair that using Netflix would cost a customer money, and using AT&T’s owned and operated service would not. And that was an advantage that AT&T wanted to give to Max at that time. And that is the sort of thing that isn’t a firefighter on the road, that isn’t one person using all the bandwidth. That is a distortion in the market. That’s what the rule is supposed to correct. What good did it do for AT&T or for any customer in that scenario? Look, I don’t know what AT&T did, but I think at the end of the day... I don’t think a lot of these folks understand how networks work. Because at the core of these networks is a very complex set of technologies. You have the access network, you have the core, you have peering points, and you have the backbone of the network. Congestion can happen anywhere in the network. For example, if someone doesn’t come and peer with me, they’re going to get congested, but it has nothing to do with me. They’re congested because they chose not to peer with me, and they chose not to peer with me because they didn’t want to pay the $3 or three cents it needed to go and get a port in a particular porting hotel that was needed. I think the network is a very complex thing. It’s not a single pipe that starts at one end and ends at the other. There are a lot of different interfaces and other things. I think this whole concept that you’re going to unfairly manage someone’s network or give someone an unfair advantage, I don’t think it works that way. The second is an economic incentive piece. Look, in the case of AT&T, again, I’m being an academic here, which is that they bought Max, or whatever it was called back then, and they were willing to give up their dollars because network costs something. They’re able to give that up to drive sales of content. That’s a decision they made. In the end, it didn’t work out that well because it didn’t matter. I think there are economic incentives in place to manage all of this. That’s why I think net neutrality has gone literally nowhere because it doesn’t solve any problem that I think is a problem. Again, I want to be clear that it’s the law in New York. It’s the law in California. It was the law at the federal level, and it was rolled back. So, it did go somewhere at one point. And the most instructive thing I ever heard about net neutrality was that it was just the arc that Netflix went on. Netflix was once the loudest proponent of these rules. And then several years later, I saw Reed Hastings at the Code conference, he said, I believe it was to Peter Kafka, “Oh, we don’t need to have this fight anymore because we’re so big it doesn’t matter.” All that indicated to me was they needed the rule and they needed the fight when they were small, to preserve the access. And then they got so big that they didn’t need the rule to give them access because they were so big that taking access away wouldn’t be a problem. That’s the competitive playing field that I think you want at the application layer as well. It’s really hard for people to perceive. I think they didn’t realize it was a problem because it was not a problem. I think it had nothing to do with size. Well, that’s what Reed Hastings said. He said, “I am so big it doesn’t matter.” I know, but I think he probably said that to cover up something where he made a big to-do about nothing. In the end, it didn’t change anything. If customers want Netflix, they’ll get Netflix. We make shitty content, no one’s going to watch it. I think it’s the core of that issue. He very soon realized... I remember that conference. He realized this was a fight about nothing. At the end of the day, if you make good content, customers want it, they’ll appear, and you’ll get access to it. If you make poor content that nobody wants to watch, nobody’s going to watch it. Irrespective of all the so-called net neutrality rules you have. I think that was the perfect example of how it had nothing to do with size. It just had to do with the fact that they were chasing something that made no sense at that point, and he was the first to admit it, so he could focus his efforts on putting on new shows. By the way, I like their new show, The Residence. It’s a good show. You live in a different regulatory environment now. You have Brendan Carr, who’s the chair of the FCC. I’m not a fan of Brendan Carr. I think he’s wielding his power irresponsibly, and he knows that I think that. You mentioned earlier your deal with Frontier, that’s going to go through, and Brendan has been very clear that he will not allow these deals to go through unless you get rid of all your diversity initiatives. And he says there’s an investigation against Verizon on these initiatives. That feels like straight coercion. If Verizon wants to go body up and file lawsuits against the FCC imposing regulatory requirements, this would be where you do it. Are you going to fight that fight, or are you going to roll over? For Verizon, there are a couple of things. Internally, as a company, certain things are non-negotiable for us. How we treat human beings, human dignity, and ensure that we have the best talent pool when we build and operate the largest consumer telco company in the world. We ain’t walking away from that. I think that’s there. At the end of the day, we have to follow the rules and regulations of the land, and we will work constructively. We have a constructive dialogue with the FCC to ensure that we follow the rules and regulations of the land. That’s exactly the piece we are in right now with them. We got the letter from them. We are working closely with the staffers out there. Whatever the regulations or rules of the land are, we’ll follow them. Do you think that you’ll fight that as vociferously as you fought net neutrality? It goes down to the rule of law. Whatever the rule is. Do you think the FCC commissioner has the authority to tell you how to hire and fire inside your company? It goes back to the rules and regulations that the administration puts in place. They have certain rules, they work through it, and we have to follow the rules of the way it lays itself out. That’s all we are going to work towards: a constructive dialogue with Chairman Carr on that piece, and we’ll continue to deliver that. But at the end of the day, I want the best talent pool for my company. I will do anything that is needed to get the best operators, the best marketers, and the best network operators in the world for Verizon to do that piece. I’m walking away from that. I’m going to follow that. In the process, I have to follow rules and regulations — we’ll do that. And if there are some changes that have to be made, we will make those changes. But let’s not forget, this is about getting the best talent from us, and we are not walking away one minute from that mission. Literally, just a few days before we’re talking, I think T-Mobile closed the deal to do a JV on some fiber initiative. But to get there, they had to delete the word diversity from a bunch of its web pages. Is that the level of meddling that you’re willing to accept? We are still working with the FCC on what the rules are. How we develop the rules. How we execute the rules on that. It’s a work in progress right now. We are still working through that. But look, at the end of the day, we’re going to have to follow the rules of the land. We did that before, we’ve done that. We’re going to do that after that. This is just one of those pieces, we’re going to have to follow the rules that are there. I want to be very clear, I’m being very explicit about this. When the government passed net neutrality rules, it wasn’t, “We have to follow the rules of the land.” It was, “We are going to file lawsuits for a decade to get out of these rules because we think they’re dumb.” And in this case, you’re saying Brendan Carr, who has been openly censorious, openly chilling of speech, openly hostile to companies because they have diversity initiatives — you’re saying you just have to follow his rules? We have to follow the rules of the land. I don’t think those are his rules. They are the rules of the land and administration — Are you going to file a decade’s worth of lawsuits about these rules? We don’t know. We’re going to work constructively with them to follow the rules that are needed. But at the end of the day... Look, our role is to the stakeholders that we have. My stakeholders are my shareholders, my customers, my employees, and society at large. We have to manage, and we are going to deliver to those stakeholders what’s needed for us, and we will do whatever is needed with the administration to deliver to all the stakeholders. When you run a large company our size, you have to balance the different stakeholders, and we will balance those stakeholders. We’ve done it extremely well in the last 25 years that we’ve been Verizon, and we’ll continue to do that going forward. Can you put this in your decision matrix? When you look at an administration that shows up and says, “We’re going to start meddling with your deals.” From an agency that traditionally has not done this specific kind of meddling in how you hire and fire, how do you think about that decision in your two-by-two matrix? This is not the first deal we’ve taken through administrations. We worked with Democrats, we worked with Republicans, we worked with both sets of the administration. We’ve had good success working with both of them on that piece. Every time we take a deal through, there are trade-offs that have to be made. When we bought TracFone, we had trade-offs we had to make with California that were probably not perfect for us as well. I do think there are trade-offs that need to be made in any large transaction. But at the end of the day, you have to follow the rules of the land. I think that’s the most important thing, and we’ve got to manage the stakeholders. And that’s pretty much all we are going to do here. All right. I want to wrap up by asking you about a very silly thing from the first Trump administration. In the first Trump administration, T-Mobile bought Sprint. And at the time, that set of players in Trump one concocted a deal where Sprint would sell some assets to Dish Network, and we would invest in a thing called Open RAN to get away from Huawei and have more competition at the tower level. These are all good ideas in theory. Have you spent one minute thinking about the competition posed by Dish Network? Look, we have three large wireless carriers in a very, very competitive market. We have Dish with its Boost network, which is competitive in the prepaid space. They’re a pretty large player in the prepaid space. They’re starting to build postpaid. Then you have the cable companies today, Comcast, Charter, and Cox, all offer wireless services at very competitive prices. In fact, in many cases, the first line is free, and their average ARPU is significantly lower than ours. It is one of the most competitive telco markets in the world today. Three full players, a fourth facility player who is building up, and then a cable company that has 100 percent coverage of the country, which is able to offer wireless. It’s a pretty competitive market that we have in this space right now. No, but I’m asking you specifically about Dish, right? That was five years ago. I think June or July of 2020. That deal was completed. They had access to T-Mobile’s network for seven years. We’re coming to the end of that. They are supposed to have a next-generation 5G Open RAN that is a national competitor to you by now. Do you think they have a national, competitive Open RAN that causes you to lose any sleep? They’re a competitor to us. They have, I think, a little less than... The Boost network creates millions and tens of millions of customers — But that’s just what they bought from Sprint. That was the existing asset they bought from Sprint. That’s not the thing they were meant to build. They’ve built local networks. And do we compete with them? We compete with them in the space. But think about it, we have three full networks that are building up, and then we have competition. This is one of the most competitive markets. Look, Open RAN is a completely different animal. We should definitely talk about that. Look, over a period of time, Open RAN is a good thing, because it deconstructs the network a little bit. You can have multiple players in a stack. And for folks who are not close to this, today, when we buy equipment from a partner, we end up buying almost the whole stack. The head end that goes on to the tower, all the equipment at the bottom of the tower, is from a single provider. And Open RAN says, “Make those interfaces more standardized so that you can mix and match operators more easily.” I think philosophically, Open RAN is a good concept. I think more work is needed to get to the performance that makes us comfortable using it at scale. But what we’ve done is we’ve virtualized our networks more than any other carrier in the world. What does that mean? We’ve put generic hardware in our sites, and then the equipment providers have to load their software on it. We think that’s actually a more powerful tool in mix and match, scaling, and loading cost than sometimes de-standardizing or standardizing these interfaces. But over a period of time, it’s important to have more diversity of vendors and have more people play in this space. It’s good for us, it’s good for the economy. I think we are very supportive of O-RAN. We are part of the Alliance. We spend a lot of time, energy, and money on R&D and making those interfaces stable. But I feel it has a little more to go before they’re standardized, and they give you the performance that I get to put on my network. Well, Sampath, you’ve given us a lot of time. I feel like you should come back and we should talk about Open RAN for a full hour, because I can. I think it is fascinating. We’ll have to have you back soon. Thank you so much for being on Decoder.

Title: What’s So Special About Nancy Pelosi’s Stock Trading Activities?

Time Published: 2025-04-21T14:46:30Z

One of the most interesting investors over the past few years isn’t some hedge fund manager or Wall St veteran, it’s congressional representative Nancy Pelosi. Her investing disclosures include early bets on Nvidia and Tempus AI before both companies had a massive run-up in valuation, along with many other profitable trades. While insider trading is illegal for everyone, including members of congress, many people believe that she could be using confidential information from her insights into laws before they’re made public. That doesn’t mean that people can’t also benefit from her trades, however. How are people taking advantage? While the obvious best-case-scenario would be for this kind of political trading to be banned, one company decided that regular people should be able to get similar exposure to her trades. That’s where Dub, and their affiliate Dub Advisors comes in. They’ve built an app that has access to a model portfolio that tracks her trading strategies and automatically rebalances whenever her moves are publicly announced. Since their $PELOSI portfolio launched on September 27, 2023, it’s returned 77.34% as of April 1, 2025. Why follow politician trades? Politicians may have access to information or insights that are not readily available to the public. For example, they may have insights into how upcoming legislation or regulations will impact specific industries and companies. In some cases, they might even anticipate global events through sensitive briefings or influence a company’s prospects through their legislative power. Dub Advisors’ $PELOSI portfolio aims to capitalize on these potential information advantages by purchasing stocks that Pelosi has bought. How is the $PELOSI portfolio constructed? Dub Advisors built the $PELOSI portfolio using public financial disclosures required by the STOCK Act. These disclosures provide information about securities transactions made by members of Congress and other senior government officials. While the portfolio is constructed from these disclosures, it isn’t an exact replica of Pelosi’s investments. Due to reporting and technical limitations, that’s not feasible. Instead, they apply proprietary techniques used by hedge funds to design a portfolio with the most potential to outperform the market. Their strategy for creating politician portfolios focuses on two key factors: While their exact methods are proprietary, some concrete ways that Dub Advisors find stocks with high conviction and information asymmetry are: While past performance does not guarantee future results, PELOSI’s excellent performance thus far has boosted their confidence in this methodology. Doesn’t the 45-day reporting delay hurt returns? Politicians have 45 days to report their stock transactions, meaning that we find out about their trades well after they happen. While it would be ideal to know about trades instantly, the 45-day reporting lag does not render their strategy ineffective. Most politicians buy and hold for long periods of time. For example, Dub Advisors’ $PELOSI portfolio has continuously held a position in NVDA since inception in September 2023, so a 45 day delay doesn’t affect overall performance much. Moreover, politicians often report trades well before the 45-day limit since there is no benefit to delaying. For example, Pelosi’s most recent buy of NVDA occurred on July 25, 2024, and was reported on July 31, 2024. How to invest in the $PELOSI portfolio Want to invest?

Title: Nvidia stock slips as U.S. curbs backfire, boosting China’s chip ambitions
URL: https://qz.com/nvidia-nvda-stock-nasdaq-sp500-huawei-china-chips-1851777025
Time Published: 2025-04-21T13:48:00Z
Full Content:
Nvidia (NVDA+0.54%) stock fell more than 6% Monday as investors digested growing fallout from the Biden and Trump administrations’ efforts to curb the company’s chip sales to China. The latest restrictions — announced last week by the White House — tighten the noose on Nvidia’s ability to sell its advanced AI chips abroad. Now Chinese competitors appear ready to fill the gap. A sharp blow came Monday from reports that Huawei plans to begin mass shipments of its own advanced AI chip — the 910C — as early as next month. The move underscores China’s accelerating effort to sidestep U.S. technology restrictions, and positions Huawei, one of China’s largest tech companies, as a potential beneficiary of the crackdown on Nvidia. Analysts at Jefferies (JEF+2.36%) told CNBC (CMCSA+1.99%) the new export rules may ultimately “do more to help Chinese chip companies than hurt them,” by forcing domestic buyers to pivot away from U.S. suppliers. Meanwhile, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang traveled to China last week for damage control, attempting to reassure partners and regulators that the company still wants to do business there. The White House’s tighter restrictions — part of a tech containment strategy and one more front in the administration’s trade war — specifically target Nvidia’s H20 chip, a product originally designed to comply with earlier export rules. The decision marks a strategic shift: a U.S. willingness to inflict damage on its own most valuable semiconductor company to prevent China from gaining access to leading-edge AI tools. Beijing, for its part, has slammed the U.S. approach and President Donald Trump’s attempts to pressure other countries to cut their own trade with China. On Monday, China’s foreign ministry said it firmly opposes any trade agreements between the U.S. and third-party countries “at the expense of China,” framing the moves as aggressive rather than defensive. Shares of Nvidia are down about 19% in the last month. The Nasdaq has fallen 12% over the same period, while the S&P 500 is down almost 10%. Nvidia’s global significance helps explain the U.S. market’s swift reaction. With a market cap approaching $2.5 trillion, it’s not only the world’s most valuable chipmaker, but the foundational force in AI infrastructure — powering data centers, large language models, and emerging technologies across sectors. Analysts estimate Nvidia controls more than 80% of the AI training chip market, making it a linchpin in the global tech arms race. Its dominance also means Nvidia’s stock movements can sway the entire U.S. market. The company now makes up more than 6% of the Nasdaq 100 and about 5.5% of the S&P 500. As a result, Washington’s deepening trade war with China isn’t just geopolitical theater — it’s triggering real volatility and wiping out investor value across indexes, with Nvidia squarely in the middle of the storm.

Title: Cybersecurity’s Red Alert Moment: Hyperscalers Are Consolidating Power

ByEmil Sayegh ByEmil Sayegh, Contributor. Hyperscalers are absorbing cybersecurity into their platforms — just as they did with storage, ... More compute and databases. Cybersecurity is no longer a standalone industry — it is becoming a native function of cloud infrastructure as evidenced by Google’s recent purchase of Wiz for a staggering $32B. As hyperscalers like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud embed AI-powered security features into their platforms, the $30 billion Managed Detection and Response market faces an existential threat. This isn’t just vendor jostling — it has deep implications for enterprise IT budgets, private equity-backed investments and even national security. For years, hyperscalers operated as neutral enablers — providing compute and storage while security vendors built the intelligence layer. But history tells us what happens next. First it was storage, then compute, then databases. Now it is security. The same pattern is unfolding again — and this time, they are not just partners. They are poised to be predators. History is the roadmap — and it shows exactly how they plan to attack and absorb this vulnerable, fragmented security services market. What was once outsourced — threat detection, endpoint protection, identity access management and data loss prevention — is now being baked directly into the core of their platforms. Embedded, automated and bundled — not sold as a product, but delivered as a feature. The original relationship was symbiotic. Security vendors brought innovation, the clouds brought scale. But now that balance has collapsed. The hyperscalers are no longer just competing — they are outpacing. They are building security into every layer of their platforms — from AI-powered identity controls to default encryption and automated threat intelligence. And because they control the infrastructure, they control the data. They have access to platform-native telemetry, logs and behaviors that no third party can match. The use of artificial intelligence gives them yet another advantage — one measured not in features but in speed, integration and insight. While independent providers race to keep up, the clouds are already embedding adaptive security into the very foundation of modern IT. MDR vendors like eSentire, Arctic Wolf, Expel, ReliaQuest and Rapid7 have grown fast by investing in automation and extended detection capabilities. But they are running uphill. These firms must build, market and sell their platforms to survive — all while hyperscalers quietly integrate competing capabilities into enterprise agreements. Look at Rapid7 — one of the only publicly traded players in this space. In 2024, it reported $844 million in revenue, up 9 percent year over year, with a 19 percent operating margin. But its stock fell 41 percent. Activist investor Jana Partners, holding a 5.8 percent stake, forced board changes and is now demanding a sale or strategic overhaul. Why? Because markets can smell what’s coming — margin compression and disruption from the inside out. Consider Microsoft Defender, Amazon GuardDuty, Google Chronicle and Microsoft Sentinel. These tools are not sold — they are embedded. They are often activated by default and subsidized through broader infrastructure contracts. They do not need to generate standalone profit — they exist to increase stickiness, lower churn and lock in the customer. In 2024 alone, Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Meta spent over $250 billion in capital expenditures — much of it directed at embedding AI and security across their platforms. That figure is larger than the entire combined valuation of independent cybersecurity vendors. This is not competition. It is gravitational collapse, and it is exactly what happened in the last decade to smaller infrastructure providers. Artificial intelligence is the core disruptor. Hyperscalers are not merely building smarter tools — they are reinventing the security stack from the inside. AI is being trained on massive datasets, with full access to platform behaviors, identity systems and telemetry that no outsider can replicate. The result is security that is real-time, adaptive and invisible — not bolted on, but built in. That is not incremental innovation. That is systemic displacement. Regulators are waking up, but the question is whether it too late before the damage is done. In April 2025, Google lost its second antitrust case in less than a year. Meta is under scrutiny for monopolistic bundling. The hypercalers strategy is familiar — extend the platform, entrench the offering, exclude the competition. Cybersecurity is next. When hyperscalers start bundling endpoint detection and response, policy enforcement and threat management into their infrastructure deals — while underpricing or disabling competitive solutions — regulators will ask whether these behaviors mirror the extend-and-entrench tactics already flagged in other sectors. The questions now on the table in Washington and Brussels: This is not just a shift in architecture — it is a realignment of power. As cybersecurity collapses inward into the cloud platform itself, the ripple effects are being felt across the entire ecosystem. Every stakeholder — from service providers to financial sponsors to national defense agencies — must now reassess assumptions, business models and risk profiles. Managed Service Providers and Managed Security Service Providers built their business models on integrating best-of-breed, third-party cybersecurity tools — layering value through orchestration, visibility and incident response. But that stack is being flattened. Hyperscalers are disintermediating this layer by offering native tools that are cheaper, easier to deploy and pre-integrated with the infrastructure itself. Margins are under pressure. Many MSSPs rely on licensing arbitrage and volume-based resale models that are collapsing as cloud-native security offerings become bundled and commoditized. According to Canalys, spending on MSSPs is growing at just 8 percent annually — a slowdown from prior years — even as demand for cybersecurity services remains strong. That delta reflects erosion in value capture. Differentiation is also eroding. When every enterprise workload sits on a platform that already includes threat detection, identity and log correlation, MSSPs must go deeper — into vertical-specific advisory, regulatory mapping, zero-trust strategy and response playbooks. Those that cannot evolve beyond tool management will become expendable. The next-generation MSSP must pivot away from being a product stack integrator and toward being a trusted advisor. That means investing in proprietary frameworks, industry depth and human-led services that the hyperscalers — by design — cannot replicate. The private equity community has invested tens of billions into roll-ups, platform plays and specialty MSSPs under a common thesis: scale drives efficiency, and efficiency drives margins. But when hyperscalers remove the very foundation of third-party tool layers, that thesis begins to unravel. Multiples are already under pressure. Valuations that assumed sustainable 20 to 30 percent EBITDA on recurring security services may no longer hold. As bundled features reduce the need for outsourced detection or SIEM management, customer stickiness weakens — and churn risk increases. In several recent transactions, we’ve seen diligence processes stall or valuations renegotiated after cloud-native roadmap reviews showed major overlap with portfolio offerings. Even public market signals are clear — Rapid7’s steep stock price decline, despite revenue growth, reflects investor skepticism on long-term margin durability in this segment. Sponsors must now re-underwrite portfolios and exit timelines. The path forward lies in pushing platform companies into verticals or service layers that maintain pricing power — compliance-as-a-service, specialized forensics, incident response retainers — rather than assuming the old playbook of bundling tools will survive. There is no margin for error when it comes to national defense. Yet the same hyperscaler platforms that now power enterprise productivity are also hosting some of the most sensitive workloads in the world — from defense contractors and intelligence agencies to critical infrastructure providers. As cybersecurity becomes a native feature of these platforms, we are not just consolidating capabilities — we are consolidating control and amplifying systemic risk. This introduces a dangerous paradox: the cloud has become both the fortress and the attack surface. A single breach. A single rogue insider. A single software update gone wrong. That’s all it takes. The consequences could cascade across military logistics, energy grids, transportation systems and real-time battlefield surveillance. This is not a hypothetical scenario. The 2020 SolarWinds breach exposed how deeply embedded vulnerabilities can compromise trusted environments. In 2024, we saw how a single botched CrowdStrike update grounded flights, froze retailers and disabled hospital systems. The next time, it could be a compromised core service — not just a patch — and the damage could be exponential. Even more concerning is the opacity of the platforms themselves. When detection, prevention and response functions are all owned, operated and monitored by the same cloud provider, transparency disappears. Federal agencies are left with limited visibility and reduced oversight — unable to independently validate the integrity of the systems they now depend on. At the very moment when national cybersecurity defense should be distributed and resilient, we are centralizing it into a small number of hyperscaler environments. That may be efficient — but it is not safe. And it is certainly not sustainable. The same fate that befell private cloud hosting companies — disintermediated by the public cloud — now threatens MDR and MSSP vendors. This is not theoretical. This is déjà vu. And it is already underway. The industry has five years — maybe less — to adapt. That means redefining value, moving up the stack and delivering what the hyperscalers cannot: trust, objectivity, service and independence. If not, the industry will consolidate further — and this time, the collapse will be silent. This is not just a technology trend. It is a restructuring of the cybersecurity marketplace. And it is happening in real time. The only question is — will vendors, investors and regulators respond before it is too late?

U.S. stocks are set to open sharply lower Monday as Wall Street braces for a high-stakes week of earnings and mounting geopolitical uncertainty. The S&P 500 was down 1.3%, the Nasdaq fell 1.5%, and the Dow was off more than 400 points. The VIX surged nearly 10%, while gold spiked 2.65% to $3,416.70 — its highest level ever. Nvidia (NVDA+0.54%) shares were down about 4% premarket following reports that Huawei plans to begin mass shipments of a new AI chip to Chinese customers as early as next month. The move signals China’s accelerating push to replace U.S. technology in sensitive sectors and adds pressure on Nvidia, already under fire from new White House restrictions on chip sales. Analysts warn that Nvidia’s role as a strategic asset in the U.S.-China trade standoff could make it especially vulnerable — with powerful knock-on effects for overall U.S. markets, given Nvidia’s position as one of the largest American companies by market cap. Netflix (NFLX+2.09%) is one of the rare bright spots in early trading, rising roughly 2% after delivering a blockbuster Q1. The company posted nearly $3 billion in profit and a 31.7% operating margin on $10.54 billion in revenue. Its $7.99 ad-supported tier is seen as more resilient in a tightening economy. UnitedHealth Group (UNH-1.96%) remains in focus after last week’s rout, when the stock lost more than 20% on a forecast cut and earnings miss. Shares were slightly lower again Monday morning. This week also brings earnings from Tesla (TSLA+1.13%), Alphabet (GOOGL+1.23%), IBM (IBM+1.52%), Boeing (BA+2.21%), and Procter & Gamble (PG+1.60%), setting the tone for Q2 amid rising fears of a “self-inflicted” recession. In a Sunday memo, analysts at Wedbush said: “The markets and tech world needs to find a path forward quickly and know what the rules of the game are looking ahead. The White House needs trade deals done quick with a negotiation path established with China.” The alternative was grim: “Otherwise the markets, 10-year yield, USD, gold, and the economy will head down their own divergent paths over the coming weeks and months ahead. We view this as a key week ahead to get some trade deals on the board as the Street does not care anymore about words and ‘deal progress’ comments.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: AppLovin (APP) Under Pressure: Analyst Downgrades Follow Short Seller Barrage, Investor Lawsuit – Hagens Berman

April 21, 2025 08:42 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, April 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Just months after basking in the glow of a meteoric 700% stock surge, fueled by investor enthusiasm for its artificial intelligence technology and burgeoning ad business, AppLovin Corp. (NASDAQ: APP) is facing a shift in sentiment on Wall Street. Several prominent investment banks have significantly lowered their expectations for the stock following the release of multiple critical reports from short-selling firms about the mobile advertising technology firm. Adding to its woes, AppLovin is now facing a securities class action lawsuit. Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Analysts Downgrade APP Shares The latest blow came on Friday, April 11, when The Goldman Sachs Group slashed its price target for AppLovin from a lofty $500.00 to a more sobering $335.00. This downgrade followed a similar move by UBS Group earlier in the week, when the firm reduced its price target on AppLovin from $630.00 to $450.00. Short Seller Onslaught: Allegations of Data Exploitation and Inflated Metrics These downward revisions follow a barrage of critical reports from short sellers. Most recently, on March 28, Muddy Waters Research alleged that AppLovin's ad technology "systematically" violates app store rules by "impermissibly extracting proprietary IDs" from major platforms to deliver targeted ads without user consent. The report also claimed a significant churn rate among e-commerce advertisers, contradicting company statements. Earlier, in February, Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research had also critiqued AppLovin's AXON software, with Fuzzy Panda later urging the S&P 500 committee to exclude the company due to alleged "data theft" and "revenue fraud." Securities Class Action Alleges Misleading Statements Adding to AppLovin's challenges, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed against the company. The lawsuit alleges that AppLovin misled investors about the capabilities of its enhanced AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and its "cutting-edge AI technologies." Specifically, the lawsuit claims that AppLovin created a false impression that its technology would efficiently match advertisements to mobile games and expand into web-based marketing and e-commerce. However, the suit alleges that AppLovin was instead exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms and using manipulative practices, including a "backdoor installation scheme," to force unwanted apps on customers. This allegedly inflated installation numbers and, consequently, the company's profit figures. The class action lawsuit further points to the short seller reports released on February 26, 2025, which detailed AppLovin's alleged reverse engineering and exploitation of advertising data from Meta Platforms. These reports also claimed that AppLovin utilized manipulative practices to artificially inflate ad click-through and app download rates, such as self-clicking ads and employing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads. Following the release of these reports, the price of AppLovin shares reportedly fell by more than 12%. Hagens Berman’s Investigation Prominent shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the claims. “The allegations detailed in the short reports and outlined in the recently filed class action complaint, detailing the purported exploitation of user data and manipulative installation schemes, raise serious questions about the integrity of AppLovin's reported growth and the accuracy of its disclosures to the investing public,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

U.S. stocks dropped sharply Monday, continuing a volatile stretch for Wall Street as geopolitical tensions, earnings anxiety, and Federal Reserve uncertainty continue to collide. The tech-heavy Nasdaq led the losses, down 2.6% at the closing bell, with the S&P 500 off 2.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 972 points, or 2.5%. The VIX jumped more than 12% as gold surged to a record $3,432 per ounce. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar fell to a three-year low, and stocks fell further after President Donald Trump again fiercely criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell, escalating his pressure campaign on the central bank to cut interest rates. “‘Preemptive Cuts’ in Interest Rates are being called for by many,” Trump said on his social media site Truth Social. “With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden’s egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other ‘things’ trending down, there is virtually No Inflation. With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.” Trump’s latest salvo against Powell came days after he said the central bank chief’s “termination cannot come fast enough.” The attacks have deepened investor fears over the Fed’s independence and added to the broader sense of policy unpredictability driving market volatility. It’s no mystery: Long-term investors and operators alike know that trust and stability are core to functioning markets. When leadership injects chaos or undermines institutional credibility, the costs show up everywhere — from higher borrowing rates to delayed investment decisions. Nvidia stock dropped 4.5% after new White House export restrictions on its AI chips appeared to hand a competitive edge to Chinese rivals such as Huawei, which reportedly plans to ship its own advanced chip to local customers as soon as next month. Tesla (TSLA+1.13%) stock fell 6% ahead of Tuesday’s earnings as investors brace for lackluster results and look for any sign of stabilization in demand or margins. With more than 100 companies reporting earnings this week — including Tesla, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL+1.23%), IBM (IBM+1.52%), Boeing (BA+2.21%), and Procter & Gamble (PG+1.60%) — traders are looking for any signs of resilience, or at least clarity, as a chaotic second quarter kicks into gear. Nvidia (NVDA+0.54%) stock was down after reports that Huawei will begin mass shipments of a new AI chip to Chinese customers as soon as next month. The move highlights Beijing’s push to reduce reliance on U.S. technology — and deepens investor anxiety around Nvidia’s access to the massive Chinese market after the White House imposed additional rules on the company’s chip sales. It’s been a whiplash month for equities, with intraday swings as large as 5% and every major index well off its pre-“Liberation Day” levels. The coming week may determine whether that trend deepens... or finally breaks. Earnings from tech giants, including Tesla and Google, will be scrutinized not just for growth but for signs of stability in a market that’s grown more erratic by the day. With so many companies reporting this week, the next few days could set the tone for the rest of the second quarter. “The Street does not care anymore about words and ‘deal progress’ comments,” Wedbush analysts said in a Sunday note. “The economic damage done from this Trump back and forth tariff plan has likely pushed the economy towards a recession path already as cap ex [has been] halted across the board, hiring plans paused, price increase worries, and supply chain shock/chaos has sparked a level of uncertainty in the US not seen since Covid days.” The difference, Wedbush noted, is that this time the damage is “self-inflicted,” concluding bluntly: “We are heading into a tech earnings season that we expect minimal/no guidance as C-level executives are playing darts blindfolded with gauging the growth and spending plans of their customers.” One bright spot? Netflix (NFLX+2.09%). In the first quarter of 2025, the company posted an almost-$3-billion profit on $10.54 billion in revenue — with an eye-popping 31.7% operating margin. Wall Street seems especially approving of Netflix’s ad-supported $7.99 monthly membership, which appears less vulnerable to recession-driven household savings measures.

Title: Should You Buy The Current Dip In Novo Nordisk Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/04/21/should-you-buy-the-current-dip-in-novo-nordisk-stock/

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. BAGSVæRD, DENMARK - 2025/03/27: A view of the logo of Novo Nordisk A/S at the headquarters in ... More Bagsværd. Novo Nordisk A/S is a Danish multinational pharmaceutical company headquartered in Bagsværd. (Photo by Kristian Tuxen Ladegaard Berg/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) stock has experienced a significant decline, dropping 35% from over $90 in early March to around $58 currently. Several factors have contributed to this downward trend. The most recent impact stems from Eli Lilly meeting the primary goals in a late-stage trial for its daily diabetes pill. If approved, this pill's convenience could pose a competitive threat to Novo Nordisk's Ozempic injection, potentially leading to market share shifts. Additionally, concerns about Novo Nordisk's pipeline, which is perceived as less diversified than some competitors, alongside rising market competition, have also weighed on the stock. However, we believe that these concerns are now largely reflected in the current stock price. In fact, we consider NVO stock at around $58 to be extremely attractive, making it a compelling buying opportunity. Our view is that there is minimal fundamental cause for concern with Novo Nordisk; its current valuation appears exceptionally low, contributing significantly to its attractiveness. This conclusion is based on a thorough analysis comparing NVO’s current valuation with its operating performance over recent years, as well as its present and historical financial condition. Our assessment of Novo Nordisk across key parameters including Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience indicates that the company maintains very strong operating performance and financial health, as will be detailed further. However, for investors who seek lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, NVO stock’s valuation looks moderate compared to the broader market. Novo Nordisk’s Revenues have grown considerably over recent years. Novo Nordisk’s profit margins are much higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. Novo Nordisk's balance sheet looks strong. NVO stock has been much more resilient than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. In summary, Novo Nordisk's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: Based on Novo Nordisk’s exceptionally strong performance across key metrics and its current moderate valuation, we believe the stock is highly attractive at its current price of $58. While past performance is strong, future prospects are also compelling. Novo Nordisk’s sales are forecast to achieve high-teen average growth over the next three years. Coupled with its robust profit margin exceeding 40%, a significant portion of this top-line growth is expected to translate directly into shareholder value. Although challenges such as increasing competition and the potential impact of the Inflation Reduction Act on drug pricing exist, we believe these risks are adequately reflected in the stock’s current moderate valuation. Therefore, we believe that NVO represents a very good buying opportunity at this level. While NVO stock looks promising, investing in a single stock can be risky. On the other hand, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

The Trump administration’s trade war with the world has roiled the stock market and threatens to plunge the country into a recession while jacking up the price of basic supplies. But instead of taking on the financial issues dominating the headlines, the House and Senate are racing to bring stablecoins — a cryptocurrency sector few Americans have even heard of — out from the shadows. The $230 billion stablecoin industry could be the first to benefit from Donald Trump’s promise to make the U.S. the world’s “crypto capital of the planet.” “Passing legislation gives them a first-mover advantage to profits that are to be gained.” Industry advocates say the legislation will clear up uncertainty around the regulation of their cryptocurrencies, unleashing a new era of financial innovation. Critics of the bipartisan push warn that the legislation risks another financial crash while enriching Trump, whose family is launching a stablecoin of their own. “Passing legislation gives them a first-mover advantage to profits that are to be gained. We saw that with the Trump meme coin, where a lot of people lost out but it didn’t matter because Trump’s platform was making fees,” said Mark Hays, of the group Americans for Financial Reform. “It just seems like a witches’ brew of problematic things that could lead to another crash.” To their proponents, stablecoins offer all the benefits of crypto without the downsides. They are pegged to real-world currencies, such as the U.S. dollar. The idea is that one dollar-denominated stablecoin can always be redeemed for one dollar. Stablecoin issuers use real-world assets, such as U.S. Treasury bonds, to back their offerings. Stablecoins live on blockchains — cryptographically protected digital ledgers — just like more famous tokens like bitcoin or Ether. Unlike bitcoins, they are supposed to be insulated from wild price swings by their currency pegs. That hasn’t stopped some stablecoins from collapsing. Boosters say that stablecoins can make payments faster, cheaper, and more efficient. They argue that stablecoins will make it easier to send money across international borders and create opportunities for the unbanked by cutting out traditional financial institutions. So far, however, they’re mostly used to buy other cryptocurrencies. Crypto traders use them to cash in and cash out of more speculative tokens without paying repeated fees. Former Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler has likened them to “poker chips at the casino.” Critics say that even though the biggest stablecoin was launched in 2014, the high-minded talk of improving the payment system has yet to produce results, and the only major users so far have been crypto traders, criminals seeking to evade money laundering laws, and people in the developing world whose own currencies face runaway inflation. “They have been around for a decade. There is no doubt people have been trying to turn them into a general-purpose payment instrument,” said Arthur Wilmarth, a professor emeritus at the George Washington University law school. “And it really hasn’t worked out.” That’s what their promoters would have you believe. In reality, stablecoins have “depegged” from the dollar dozens of times. As Sam Bankman-Fried’s fraudulent FTX exchange collapsed in late 2022, leading stablecoin issuer Tether saw its titular offering drop from the dollar by more than 2 cents. The second-biggest stablecoin, Circle’s USD Coin, dropped more than 13 cents amid revelations that many of its cash assets were jeopardized by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023. Then there was the notorious TerraUSD coin, an “algorithmic” stablecoin that was not backed by real-world assets. Its collapse took the token’s supposed value of $40 billion down to zero. Despite the promise of more concrete assets backing today’s leading stablecoins, even crypto boosters have questions about Tether. The El Salvador-based stablecoin keeps only 82 percent of its reserves in cash or cash-like instruments, dividing up the rest in more volatile investments such as bitcoin. Moreover, it has never subjected its reserve to a full financial audit. Tether is closely aligned with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, whose former firm Cantor Fitzgerald holds much of the Tether’s U.S. Treasury bonds. The very promise of stability can lead to runs on stablecoins, experts say. “If people think that even a few pennies of their dollar are at risk, they are going to run,” Wilmarth said. “They are not thinking, ‘I’ve put this money in the S&P 500, and I’ll ride it up and down.’” Trump has said he wants to sign a stablecoin bill by August. If it does, the legislation would be one of a handful of signature initiatives he approves this year — raising the question of why this niche topic is so important to Congress and the White House. Even supporters of the idea of passing stablecoin legislation say the urgency seems to be motivated in large part by the industry’s torrent of campaign spending. “That has had an effect,” said Tim Massad, the director of the Digital Assets Policy Project at the Harvard Kennedy School, who served as the chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission under Barack Obama. “There’s a valid substantive reason to prioritize it, in that stablecoins exist and we have been talking about it for a while, and I think there’s also some political reason why it’s being prioritized.” Two bills pending in Congress, the STABLE Act in the House and the GENIUS Act in the Senate, would largely accomplish the same industry-friendly goals if passed. Both bills would carve stablecoins out from securities law and the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission. And both would allow some stablecoin issuers to opt for state-level regulation instead of federal, potentially letting them to shop for friendlier jurisdictions. The bills would also create reserve requirements limiting what stablecoins can use as collateral, prohibiting them from investing in riskier assets such as bitcoins. That is also where critics start to see problems: The Senate bill would allow stablecoins to use money market funds, which had to be bailed out by the federal government in 2008 and 2020, as collateral. Meanwhile, both bills would ban regulators from imposing tighter reserve requirements designed to protect against market crashes. Original reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you.

Neither bill goes far enough to outlaw foreign issuers of dollar-denominated stablecoins, potentially creating an incentive for issuers to move offshore and outside of U.S. regulation, according to Massad. And neither provides the Treasury Department with broad-enough authority to crack down on illicit finance, he said. Moreover, both bills would allow non-banks to enter the stablecoin market, Wilmarth said, opening the door for Big Tech companies such as Meta or Amazon to get in on the action. “Not only Big Tech but Big Finance,” he said. “They would have every piece of information about you if they could run all your basic financial transactions through their systems. I think that creates enormous concerns and problems.” If Big Tech does enter the stablecoin market, critics warn, a run on their coins could lead to a larger financial contagion. “You’re linking the commercial sector of our economy to our financial sector,” Wilmarth said. “Mark Twain supposedly said, ‘You can put all your eggs in one basket, but you better watch that basket.’” Last month, members of the Trump family announced that they were getting in on the stablecoin game themselves through their World Liberty Financial venture. The firm is helmed by the sons of Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. Like other stablecoins, it promises to be backed by assets such as U.S. Treasury bonds, with regular audits of its reserves. Massad said he could think of no similar move by other presidents. “Jimmy Carter put his peanut farm in a trust, but peanut farm regulation wasn’t exactly a big issue back then,” Massad said. “I think it’s totally inappropriate for the president or members of his family to be launching a stablecoin or otherwise engaging in crypto businesses.” The announcement of the Trump stablecoin didn’t just add another potential conflict of interest to the mountain of existing ones. It also alarmed crypto industry figures, who had been counting on stablecoin legislation as a surefire win this Congress after spending hundreds of millions of dollars on politicians in both major parties during last year’s election cycle. Both bills seemed destined to attract widespread, bipartisan support until the Trumps entered the picture. Instead, at a House Financial Services Committee meeting earlier this month, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., the ranking member of the committee, denounced the Trumps and said she could not be involved in passing a bill that would further enrich them. The House bill still passed out of committee with support from six Democrats, giving it a bipartisan sheen. The Senate’s stablecoin bill is co-sponsored by Republican Sens. Bill Hagerty, Cynthia Lummis, and Tim Scott, along with Democratic Sens. Angela Alsobrooks and Kirsten Gillibrand. WAIT!

Title: Tesla’s caught in a trade war trap. Blame Elon Musk

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Like many American manufacturers, Tesla is caught in a bind thanks to President Donald Trump’s trade war. Unlike most of those other companies, though, Tesla has an added wrinkle – its CEO, Elon Musk, sometimes called the First Buddy for the close relationship he’s cultivated with the president. On Tuesday, Tesla reports earnings; that afternoon, Musk will take questions from investors. But there is a catch-22: If Musk continues his close ties to Trump, the company could alienate potential customers, both at home and overseas, who dislike Trump’s policies. If he distances himself from Trump, though, he risks the ire of the White House. It’s a lose-lose situation, and it’s a trap of Musk’s own making. The first quarter saw the company’s largest drop in sales after virtually nonstop double-digit sales growth. But the automaker’s finances are only part of what investors will want to know. Reassuring responses on any these topics could help reverse the slide that has wiped out about half of Tesla’s share value (TSLA) since mid-December — and perhaps restore some faith in the company. Dan Ives, an analyst for Wedbush Securities and longtime Tesla bull who nonetheless recently slashed his price target for Tesla shares, said Musk is facing a “code red situation” if he continues his high profile role in the Trump administration. Blaming brand damage for falling sales, Ives said in a note to clients on Sunday that “Musk needs to leave the government, take a major step back on DOGE, and get back to being CEO of Tesla full-time.” Beyond the Musk backlash, Tesla is also facing growing competition from other EV automakers, especially in China. Bad news on any of these fronts could cause a new downward spiral for the shares. “It’s turned into a nightmare for Tesla and for investors,” Ives told CNN. “The tariffs, the DOGE controversies, the brand damage — it’s been a perfect storm.” In some ways, Tesla is less exposed than other automakers to Trump’s auto tariffs. It does not import cars from its two overseas factories, and it uses fewer foreign parts in its US-built vehicles than other automakers. All other major automakers also have at least some imported vehicles in their American dealerships. It has stopped taking new orders in China for its higher-priced Model S and Model X cars, which are built in California, due to China’s 125% retaliatory tariffs, but those models are only a small fraction of its overall sales. But Musk has said that the cost to Tesla will be “not trivial.” “Important to note that Tesla is NOT unscathed here. The tariff impact on Tesla is still significant,” he said on his social media platform, X, the day after Trump’s auto tariff plans were announced. But too much criticism of tariffs during Tuesday’s call could harm his bromance with Trump. Musk became Trump’s largest financial donor last year and has been among his closest advisors since the inauguration. Tesla shares nearly doubled in value in the two months after the election as some investors and analysts hoped Musk would influence Trump to implement Tesla-friendly policies, most notably on self-driving vehicles. Conversely, strong support for Trump’s tariff policies could anger Chinese authorities and EV buyers. China is the world’s largest auto market and EV market, but its consumers are increasingly turning to rivals such as China’s own BYD. Tesla booked $20.9 billion in sales in 2024 in China, about 21% of its revenue, its second-largest market after the United States. Ives called China “the linchpin to the future success of Tesla.” He warned that “the backlash from Trump tariff policies in China and Musk’s association will be hard to understate.” Protests outside Tesla showrooms and vandalism at its facilities underscore the backlash the company and its CEO are facing. Some of the most popular investor questions on Tesla’s site touch on that issue. “Did Tesla experience any meaningful changes in order inflow rate in Q1 relating to all of the rumors of ‘brand damage’?” read one question endorsed by more than 1,000 investors. “How is the company planning to deal with the impact of Elon’s partnership with the current administration?” asked another popular investor question. Another asked: “Boycotts, protests, vandalism, negative headlines, and a stock slide have been sparked by Elon Musk’s participation in changes to U.S. gov’t services & employment. Is the Tesla board discussing whether their CEO should focus fully on Tesla and leave gov’t to elected politicians?” When Musk held an all-hands meeting for Tesla employees last month, it sparked a one-week rally in its battered shares. But the rally proved short-lived. On April 2, when Tesla reported its biggest-ever year-over-year drop in quarterly sales, shares fell sharply — until Politico ran a story later that morning that Musk would soon give up his role in the government. The news lifted shares. However, Musk and other members of the administration said the story wasn’t accurate. “Tesla’s first quarter sales and production report causes us to think that — if anything — we may have underestimated the degree of consumer reaction,” JPMorgan Chase analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote in a note to clients earlier this month. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment about its sales or the impact that Musk’s role in the administration had on those sales. Musk has made ambitious promises for a fleet of self-driving robotaxis and humanoid robots, claiming that they will make the company the most valuable in the world. He had touted plans for a driverless ride-hailing service in Austin, Texas, due to start in June. But there have been no updates. Meanwhile, Uber and Google’s own driverless car unit, Waymo, has beaten Tesla to the punch with the start of its own joint driverless taxi service in that city. “It would be a huge negative for the stock if he pushed back (the robotaxi plans),” Ives said. “We need to hear good news there, because there’s not going to be good news in terms of earnings or what the rest of the year will look like financially.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: CE 100 Index Slips 0.2% as United Healthcare Plunges After Earnings

The CE 100 Index barely budged in a holiday-shortened trading week, down 0.2%. Earnings continued to dominate the headlines, and six pillars were lower, while five gained marginal ground. United Healthcare Declines on Medicare Advantage Outlook Leading to the downside in the “Be Well” segment of the CE 100 Index, which lost 3.7%, United Healthcare shares plunged 24%. The company reported earnings that CEO Andrew Witty said, showed “overall performance that was frankly unusual and unacceptable,” according to remarks on the conference call with analysts. The company lowered its full-year adjusted earnings guidance to $26-$26.50 per share, down from $29.50-$30. Revised guidance was lower than the Street expected, and the outlook was driven in part by “heightened care activity indications within [its] Medicare Advantage businesses, which became visible as the quarter closed, far above the planned 2025 increase, which was consistent with the elevated levels in 2024,” the release said. “This activity was most notable within physician and outpatient services.” Nvidia shares lost more than 8%, taking the Enablers segment of the CE 100 Index 2.3% lower. Nvidia said Monday (April 14) that its artificial intelligence (AI) supercomputers will be built in the U.S. for the first time, starting in the next 12 to 15 months. The company is working with manufacturing partners to build two manufacturing plants in Texas — one in Houston with Foxconn and one in Dallas with Wistron — and expects to begin mass production within that timeframe. Also within the Enablers group, and as reported this week, the antitrust case against Meta Platforms in federal district court began with FTC attorney Daniel Matheson telling the judge Meta “decided that competition was too hard and it would be easier to buy out their rivals than to compete with them,” according to reports from inside the courtroom. The FTC is seeking to force Meta to unwind its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, which the commission originally had approved in 2012 and 2014, respectively. The tech giant has countered that the case is “weak” and that the case engages in “revisionist history.” Payments-related names countered some of these losses. BNPL stalwart Sezzle was 16% higher. FIS shares were 3.1%. Global Payments sold its issuer solutions business to FIS for $13.5 billion and bought Worldpay for a net price of $22.7 billion. Worldpay is co-owned by FIS and private equity firm GTCR. PayPal shares lost 2.5%. The company announced that it and TerraPay are teaming to promote cross-border payments in the Middle East and Africa. The partnership is designed to speed cross-border money movement, while making payments more accessible by connecting banks, mobile wallets and financial institutions. TerraPay — via secure PayPal account linking — will act as an enabler, allowing mobile wallet and bank users across the MENA region to transfer funds to their PayPal accounts. American Express shares were up a slight 0.1%. PYMNTS’ coverage of first quarter earnings indicated that FX-adjusted basis, revenue rose 8% year over year — or 9% when factoring out the leap year impact — to $17 billion. Total Card Member spending also grew at 7% excluding the extra day. The full-year forecast for 8% to 10% revenue growth and earnings per share between $15 and $15.50, the ranges first set in January. “Our millennial and Gen Zs are performing significantly better both from a FICO perspective and from a delinquency perspective than the industry,” CEO Stephen Squeri said on the conference call with analysts.

Title: POLL: 81% of Americans fear job loss amid surging layoffs and economic uncertainty

A survey reveals 81 percent of U.S. workers fear unemployment in 2025, with 20 percent feeling "much more worried" than in 2024, as layoffs rise and economic instability grows. The survey reveals that employees are having a pessimistic labor market outlook, with 76 percent predicting increased layoffs, 92 percent preparing for a recession, 63 percent expecting more business closures and 52 percent anticipating worsening burnout due to workload and job insecurity. With "The Great Stay" trend, employees hesitate to switch jobs due to uncertainty â only four percent feel completely secure, while 61 percent plan to upskill to stay competitive. There are also several key burnout drivers, including job insecurity (43 percent), increased workloads (29 percent) and poor work-life balance (23 percent). Analysts attribute worker anxiety to unpredictable layoffs, economic shifts and eroded trust in once-stable institutions, calling it a rational response to systemic instability.

Analysts attribute worker anxiety to unpredictable layoffs, economic shifts and eroded trust in once-stable institutions, calling it a rational response to systemic instability. A new survey has revealed that theÂ vast majority of U.S. workers are deeply concerned about losing their jobs in 2025, as layoffs continue to rise and economic instability looms. According to a report by My Perfect Resume,Â titled "The Great Stay: 2025 State of the Labor Market," 81 percent of workers fear job loss this year, with 20 percent feeling "much more worried" about unemployment than they did in 2024. The survey, conducted among 1,115 employees on December 2024, reveals staggering levels of anxiety, with 76 percent of respondents predicting an increase in layoffs this year, 92 percent preparing for a possible recession, 63 percent believing more business will shut down in 2025 compared to 2024 and 52 percent anticipating worsening burnout rates due to increased workloads and job insecurity. (Related: Layoff saga continues as 12 more companies announce mass employment terminations.) In line with this, the new trend of the "Great Stay" has emerged â a reluctance among employees to leave their current positions amid economic uncertainty. For instance, only four percent of workers reported feeling completely secure in their jobs, while 20 percent are "much more worried" about job loss than in 2024. Additionally, 61 percent of the respondents plan to upskill this year to remain competitive, while 31 percent are considering it. Moreover, the survey reveals that economic instability is fueling workplace stress, with 43 percent of respondents citing job insecurity as the top driver of burnout. Other contributing factors include increased workloads (29 percent), lack of work-life balance (23 percent) and poor management or workplace culture (three percent). Experts: Employees are not overreacting Experts who commented on the results claimed that employees are not overreacting; they're simply responding to an unpredictable job market that offers little reassurance. CEO Patrice Williams Lindo of Career Nomad stated that layoffs have been occurring "in an unpredictably regular fashion since the start of the year," leaving employees feeling uneasy. "The economy feels unpredictable. Tariffs are shifting. The news cycle is nonstop. Workers are tired of being caught off guard and the anxiety is palpable," Lindo said. "It's not just fear of job loss â it's fear of being forgotten, left behind or forced to start over without a safety-net income, financial security or health insurance, just to name a few. Even high performers are staying put in jobs they've outgrown, not because they want to, but because it feels safer than stepping into the unknown right now." Meanwhile, Adriana L. Cowdin, an entrepreneur and executive coach at Be Bold Executive Coaching, said the current turbulence does not compare to past crises but has still created a "uniquely destabilizing" atmosphere. Institutions once considered stable, including government jobs, are now signaling that "nothing is guaranteed." "I've seen how political and economic shifts shape job security perceptions â whether it was the dot-com crash in 2000, the ripple effects of 9/11, the 2008 financial collapse or the COVID disruptions," she said. "When that sense of predictability vanishes, people naturally start to wonder: If I can't count on the market, the government or long-tenured companies to stay steady, what can I count on? It's a logical emotional response. We're hardwired to spot patterns and protect ourselves from risk."

CEO Patrice Williams Lindo of Career Nomad stated that layoffs have been occurring "in an unpredictably regular fashion since the start of the year," leaving employees feeling uneasy. "The economy feels unpredictable. Tariffs are shifting. The news cycle is nonstop. Workers are tired of being caught off guard and the anxiety is palpable," Lindo said. "It's not just fear of job loss â it's fear of being forgotten, left behind or forced to start over without a safety-net income, financial security or health insurance, just to name a few. Even high performers are staying put in jobs they've outgrown, not because they want to, but because it feels safer than stepping into the unknown right now." Meanwhile, Adriana L. Cowdin, an entrepreneur and executive coach at Be Bold Executive Coaching, said the current turbulence does not compare to past crises but has still created a "uniquely destabilizing" atmosphere. Institutions once considered stable, including government jobs, are now signaling that "nothing is guaranteed." "I've seen how political and economic shifts shape job security perceptions â whether it was the dot-com crash in 2000, the ripple effects of 9/11, the 2008 financial collapse or the COVID disruptions," she said. "When that sense of predictability vanishes, people naturally start to wonder: If I can't count on the market, the government or long-tenured companies to stay steady, what can I count on? It's a logical emotional response. We're hardwired to spot patterns and protect ourselves from risk."

Sources include: YourNews.com MyPerfectResume.com Newsweek.com Brighteon.com According to a report by My Perfect Resume,Â titled "The Great Stay: 2025 State of the Labor Market," 81 percent of workers fear job loss this year, with 20 percent feeling "much more worried" about unemployment than they did in 2024. The survey, conducted among 1,115 employees on December 2024, reveals staggering levels of anxiety, with 76 percent of respondents predicting an increase in layoffs this year, 92 percent preparing for a possible recession, 63 percent believing more business will shut down in 2025 compared to 2024 and 52 percent anticipating worsening burnout rates due to increased workloads and job insecurity. (Related: Layoff saga continues as 12 more companies announce mass employment terminations.) In line with this, the new trend of the "Great Stay" has emerged â a reluctance among employees to leave their current positions amid economic uncertainty. For instance, only four percent of workers reported feeling completely secure in their jobs, while 20 percent are "much more worried" about job loss than in 2024. Additionally, 61 percent of the respondents plan to upskill this year to remain competitive, while 31 percent are considering it. Moreover, the survey reveals that economic instability is fueling workplace stress, with 43 percent of respondents citing job insecurity as the top driver of burnout. Other contributing factors include increased workloads (29 percent), lack of work-life balance (23 percent) and poor management or workplace culture (three percent).

April 20, 2025 20:47 ET | Source: Faruqi & Faruqi LLP Faruqi & Faruqi LLP Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP Securities Litigation Partner James (Josh) Wilson Encourages Investors Who Suffered Losses Exceeding $100,000 In Rocket Lab To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options If you suffered losses exceeding $100,000 in Rocket Lab between November 12, 2024 and February 25, 2025 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310). [You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, April 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RKLB) and reminds investors of the April 28, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Rocket Lab’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the Rocket Lab USA class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/RKLB or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).
