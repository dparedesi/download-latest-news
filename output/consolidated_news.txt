Beatrice Nolan is a London-based reporter at Fortune covering tech. Meta stock hit an all-time high on Monday following the news that CEO Mark Zuckerberg had recruited an all-star Superintelligence team that includes key architects of ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, and its image-gen tech. The company’s stock peaked at $747.90 during Monday trading, beating Meta’s previous record set in February this year. Shares closed Monday at a record $738.09, marking a 23% year-to-date gain. Investors cheered the company’s aggressive push into AI and its hiring spree of talent from major rivals in the space, including OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. Meta’s new Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang posted the list of new recruits on X. Wang recently joined the company as part of a deal that saw Meta investing up to $15 billion for a 49% stake in his training data company, ScaleAI. Zuckerberg reportedly told staff that former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman will co-lead the group with Wang. “I’m excited to be the Chief AI Officer, working alongside [Nat Friedman],” he wrote in a post. “We also have several strong new team members joining today or who have joined in the past few weeks that I’m excited to share as well.” The team includes several prominent former OpenAI researchers, including: Representatives for OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fortune, made outside normal working hours. Zuckerberg has reportedly been personally recruiting for Meta’s new 50-person “Superintelligence” AI team, reportedly offering $100m signing bonuses to woo top OpenAI researchers, according to CEO Sam Altman. OpenAI is reportedly scrambling to contain the fallout after a wave of high-profile researcher departures to Meta, with Chief Research Officer Mark Chen likening the exodus to a home invasion. In a memo obtained by Wired, Chen told employees that OpenAI’s leadership team, including Altman, had been working “around the clock” to retain the company’s top talent, urgently recalibrating compensation and seeking “creative” ways to reward top performers. While Altman publicly complained about rumored $100 million signing bonuses, Meta has internally disputed the figure. In a recent all-hands meeting shared with The Verge, Meta’s CTO Andrew Bosworth said the actual offers Meta was making were more complicated and implied that only a few very senior people may have been offered that kind of money. He clarified that “the actual terms of the offer” weren’t just “sign-on bonus” but rather “all these different things.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Stablecoin firm Circle has applied to create a national trust bank, moving further into the mainstream following its blockbuster IPO last month. 3 01 July 2025 Be the first to comment This content has been selected, created and edited by the Finextra editorial team based upon its relevance and interest to our community. The company has formally submitted an application to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to establish the new trust institution, which will operate under the name First National Digital Currency Bank, N.A. If the charter is approved, it would enable Circle to act as a custodian for its own reserves and hold crypto assets, such as tokenized stocks and bonds, on behalf of institutional clients. Currently, Circle's reserves are held in custody at BNY and managed by BlackRock.Circle co-founder, chairman and CEO Jeremy Allaire, states: “By applying for a national trust charter, Circle is taking proactive steps to further strengthen our USDC infrastructure. Further, we will align with emerging US regulation for the issuance and operation of dollar-denominated payment stablecoins, which we believe can enhance the reach and resilience of the US dollar, and support the development of crucial, market neutral infrastructure for the world’s leading institutions to build on.”

Title: Circle Moves To Establish National Trust Bank In US Following $18 Billion IPO

Time Published: 2025-07-01T11:00:06Z
Full Content:
Circle (CRCL), issuer of the market’s second largest stablecoin, USDC, is applying to establish a national trust bank in the United States. This announcement follows Circle’s recent Initital Public Offering (IPO), which valued the company at nearly $18 billion. If approved by the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the new entity, named First National Digital Currency Bank, N.A., will allow Circle to serve as a custodian for its reserves and manage crypto assets on behalf of institutional clients. Circle’s CEO, Jeremy Allaire, emphasized the company’s commitment to trust, transparency, and compliance during an interview with Reuters. He stated, “Becoming a publicly traded company is a significant part of that, and becoming a national trust company is again a continuation of that.” Unlike traditional banks, this new charter will not permit the stablecoin issuer to accept cash deposits or issue loans, marking a distinct approach to banking within the digital asset space. Currently, Circle’s reserves are managed at BNY Mellon and BlackRock, backed by a mix of short-term Treasury bills, cash, and other liquid assets. The proposed national trust bank would primarily focus on custody services for tokenized assets, such as stocks and bonds, rather than traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH). This initiative comes at a crucial time as Congress moves closer to enacting a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins. The recently passed stablecoin bill, the GENIUS Act, mandates that stablecoins be backed by liquid assets and requires issuers to disclose their reserve compositions monthly. With the House of Representatives poised to vote on the legislation soon, and US President Donald Trump expected to sign it into law, the regulatory environment for stablecoins is on the verge of significant change. Allaire remarked on the transformative potential of this regulatory shift, stating, “We’re going from the early-adopter phase of this technology into the mainstream.” He expressed optimism that securing approval for the national trust charter would provide a solid foundation for institutions to build upon, further legitimizing the role of stablecoins in the financial ecosystem. Per the report, Wall Street’s initial response to Circle’s growth has been largely positive, with several major brokerages, including Barclays and Bernstein, issuing “buy” ratings and setting price targets above $200 for the company’s stock. However, some analysts have expressed caution regarding the stock’s valuation, which has more than doubled since its market debut. As of press time, CRCL closed Monday’s trading session at $180, representing a nearly 40% drop from its $299 record achieved last week. Allaire concluded by highlighting Circle’s approach in aligning with emerging US regulations. He noted that the establishment of a national digital currency trust bank represents a significant milestone in the quest to create a transparent, efficient, and accessible internet financial system.

Title: Seagate Stock To $85?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/07/01/seagate-stock-to-85/
Time Published: 2025-07-01T10:30:15Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CANADA - 2025/05/07: In this photo illustration, the Seagate Technology logo is seen displayed on a ... More smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Question: How would you respond if you owned Seagate (NASDAQ: STX) and its value plummeted by 60% or more in the upcoming months? While this may seem extreme, it is not without precedent. Seagate's stock has experienced such severe declines previously, and based on its current valuation, history might repeat itself. Up to this point in 2025, Seagate has achieved an impressive 65% return year-to-date, significantly exceeding the S&P 500’s 5% increase. This rise has been driven by structural improvements in the company and a timely shift towards next-gen technologies like HAMR (Heat Assisted Magnetic Recording). Seagate is currently benefiting from a upswing in the data-storage market, which is being bolstered by the increasing demand for generative AI and cloud infrastructure. However, behind the AI enthusiasm and operational improvements lies a more cautionary narrative. Separately see, What’s Next For Nike Stock? Here’s the point: The main takeaway is that during a downturn, Seagate stock could suffer considerable losses. Data from 2020 shows that STX stock lost around 35% of its value within just a few quarters, experiencing a peak-to-trough drop of about 58% during the 2022 inflation crisis, underperforming significantly compared to the S&P 500. This raises the question: Could the stock see a sell-off and potentially fall to $85 if a similar scenario were to occur? As a rule, individual stocks tend to be more volatile than diversified portfolios. Consequently, if you seek growth with decreased volatility, you might want to investigate the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and yielded returns over 91% since its launch. Seagate produces high-capacity HDDs (hard disk drives)—essential infrastructure for storing the immense datasets necessary for training and deploying large language models (LLMs). While SSDs (solid-state drives) are the go-to choice for fast-access storage, HDDs remain dominant in cold storage and hyperscale cloud archives—key applications for companies such as Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon. Seagate introduced its Mozaic 3+ platform last year, which achieves 3 TB per platter through HAMR technology and incorporates it into its Exos 30 TB+ drives, which have already begun shipping to hyperscale cloud clients. At its June 2025 investor conference, Seagate announced that engineering samples of 40 TB HAMR drives (10×4 TB platters) have already been delivered, with mass production anticipated in the first half of FY 2026. The company intends to launch Mozaic 4+ with 40 TB+ capacity in 2026, followed by Mozaic 5+ providing 50 TB+ drives by 2028, and is aiming for 100 TB HDDs by 2030 as part of its larger HAMR roadmap. While this technological advancement positions Seagate for long-term growth, it also introduces execution risks if demand does not scale as expected. Seagate forecasts Q4 adjusted EPS (June fiscal year) to be between $2.20 and $2.60, with revenue expected between $2.25–$2.55 billion. Consensus is predicting 38% revenue growth in FY 2025 and 13% in FY 2026. Nevertheless, even solid growth expectations cannot safeguard the stock from macroeconomic shocks, valuation declines, or operational setbacks. With very little margin for error, any misstep could lead to a steep correction. STX stock has performed worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during several recent downturns. While investors remain hopeful for a soft landing for the U.S. economy, how severe could it get if another recession occurs? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash illustrates how key stocks performed during and after the last six market crashes. • STX stock decreased 58.2% from a high of $116.02 on 4 January 2022 to $48.49 on 3 November 2022, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 27 May 2025 • Since then, the stock has risen to a high of $141.44 on 29 June 2025 • STX stock fell 35.6% from a high of $63.23 on 24 January 2020 to $40.73 on 20 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 4 December 2020 • STX stock dropped 89.1% from a high of $28.60 on 2 November 2007 to $3.11 on 23 January 2009, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 18 April 2012 Currently, Seagate trades at 18x consensus 2025 earnings, significantly above its three-year average of only 5x. Its price-to-sales ratio has escalated to 3x, rising from 1.2x in FY 2022. Even its forward P/S of 3x surpasses the three-year average of 2.8x. In comparison, Western Digital (NASDAQ: WDC), a direct competitor, typically trades around 1x P/S during market downturns. Investor confidence is evidently reflected in the stock’s elevated valuation—but with greater height comes a steeper potential fall. The average analyst price target of $125 suggests an 11% downside, even without factoring in a market correction. Considering the wider economic uncertainties, ask yourself this: Do you plan to hold onto your Seagate stock now, or will you panic and sell if it starts to drop to $100, $90, or even lower? Hanging onto a declining stock is never an easy task. Trefis partners with Empirical Asset Management—an investment firm in the Boston area—whose asset allocation strategies produced positive returns during the 2008-09 period when the S&P lost over 40%. Empirical has integrated the Trefis HQ Portfolio into its asset allocation framework to offer clients better returns and less risk compared to the benchmark index—a smoother journey, as evidenced in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs add $2.9B in last week of June ending month strong
URL: https://cryptoslate.com/insights/bitcoin-etfs-add-2-9b-in-last-week-of-june-ending-month-strong/
Time Published: 2025-07-01T10:15:55Z

BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark lead ETF inflows, offsetting the outflows from Grayscale's GBTC. Spot Bitcoin ETFs added $2.92 billion in net inflows between June 23 and June 30, capping off the strongest eight-day streak since mid-May. After slowing inflows in early June, the market appears to have re-engaged with ETFs as geopolitical uncertainty flared again in the Middle East and broader risk appetite improved. The bulk of the inflows came on June 24 and June 25, when issuers saw a combined $1.14 billion enter products led by BlackRock’s IBIT, Fidelity’s FBTC, and Ark’s ARKB. ARKB saw an unusual $70.2 million on June 25, its second-largest daily inflow in June, suggesting revived institutional positioning after three weeks of weak flows. In the last week of June, Bitcoin moved up from $105,415 on June 23 to a closing high of $108,382 on June 29 before retreating slightly to $107,210 on June 30. The price advance was relatively steady, with low volatility and rising support around $107,000. That stability likely encouraged renewed confidence in ETF allocations, especially following the $1.7 billion weekly inflow reported by CoinShares across global crypto funds. US-based spot ETFs appear to have accounted for most of that figure. June 27 also stood out with a nearly $500 million haul, as BlackRock and Fidelity saw daily inflows above $150 million. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s GBTC continued to leak assets, but outflows were limited to $8 million or less per day compared to the hundreds of millions seen in previous months. The diminishing GBTC bleed further supports the narrative that ETF rebalancing may be reaching maturity, with capital now flowing more directly into low-fee issuers rather than migrating from legacy trusts. According to CoinShares, the inflows also came amid a broader 11-week streak of positive inflows across all digital asset investment products. That broader macro context, relatively calm funding rates, and a subdued derivatives market helped steer attention back to ETFs as the more straightforward proxy for directional bets. The combination of stable prices and strong flows reinforces the growing role of spot ETFs as a barometer of investor sentiment and macro positioning. With June now closed, July begins with ETFs holding over $48.9 billion in assets.

Title: How AI is speeding up the slow investing game

It took an AllianceBernstein healthcare analyst just one afternoon to analyze what would have once taken her months: the potential impact of President Donald Trump's "Big, Beautiful Bill" on specific drugs and insurance plans across state lines. Andrew Chin, the firm's chief artificial intelligence officer, said the analyst used one of the $790 billion asset manager's in-house tools to quickly interpret the legislation and identify which companies would be affected, allowing her to make a fast, confident investment call. "Because she was able to do that, she was able to make money for our client portfolios a lot faster," said Chin, adding that the analyst "locked in some of the alpha" in a way that was not previously possible. Fundamental investors take a slow and methodical approach to their investment decisions. Whether reviewing financial statements or talking to vendors and company executives, it can take months for a fundamental investor to reach a conclusion about what to invest in and at what price. Not anymore. Artificial intelligence is changing the slow investing game popularized by investors like Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Peter Lynch of Fidelity. While asset managers have long used machine learning to crunch spreadsheets and detect trading signals—especially in quant and systematic strategies— these tools can also quickly digest and analyze vast reams of unstructured information, like earnings call transcripts, regulatory filings, and even emails. It's allowing large asset managers to make fundamental investing decisions faster than ever before. Here are three firms that are using AI to transform their investment processes: Two and a half years ago, JPMorgan Asset Management AI strategist Dillon Edwards sat down with upward of 50 portfolio managers to understand what they needed. He asked them about the screens they use, the questions they ask themselves throughout the day, and the common thread was, "Just get our attention to the right data, at the right time, in the right place." That request led to the creation of Smart Monitor, which Edwards described as "Spotify for the investor." It scans mountains of data to surface timely, relevant insights for the firm's portfolio managers and analysts. Smart Monitor is part of JPMorgan's broader AI build-out for its $3.7 trillion asset management arm, which is hosted on a platform called Spectrum. Another tool within this platform is Moneyball, which helps portfolio managers identify and correct potential biases in their investment decisions by analyzing historical data and market behaviors. Rather than building something new for investors to learn, Edwards and his team focused on AI directly into the process that investors have spent years perfecting. The bottom-up approach has helped to minimize AI skeptics: A handful of "champion" PMs worked closely with engineers during development and became in-house unofficial salespeople who market it to their own teams. "No one wants another tool, another thing to do, something that the AI team somehow thinks is going to be helpful for an investor without empathizing with what they're doing today," he said. Kristian West, JPMorgan Asset Management's head of investment platform, said the firm is also developing similar tools with the goal of seeing if they can continue to scale the quantitative process, or data-driven systematic investing. "That's an area where we think it is just pretty obvious, whereas technology and data capabilities improve, those two worlds collide a lot more," he said. For fundamental investors—portfolio managers and analysts who base long-term decisions on a deep understanding of individual companies—this marks a turning point: a chance to move faster and dig deeper, but also a moment to rethink how they work. Chin calls this evolution the rise of the "iron person": a human investor enhanced by AI armor. Not a replacement, but an upgrade. AB has developed an internal chatbot called AB AI, along with several tools to help pull from internal data, prep for company meetings, or conduct research tailored to the manager's investment philosophy. Chin said that many AB analysts often develop their own AI agents using ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot with specific prompts to, for example, run an analysis on the companies in their sector after an earnings call. "They're able to then analyze companies the way they want to, so they get a more tailored or customized version of what the tool can provide them," he said. Chin said about 75% of the firm's over 500 investment professionals are using their tools. People sharing stories like "it takes me a day rather than a month to do something, or I was able to get this insight that I did not get before," have driven others to try it, said Chin. For the remaining 25% who haven't picked up AI, he believes they "will just naturally come when they see the performance of their counterparts has gotten better." A big reveal from BlackRock's investor day last month shows just how fast the field is moving. The $11 trillion investing behemoth has launched Asimov, an agentic AI platform for its fundamental equity business. Agentic AI doesn't just answer questions following prompts — it can take action on its own. "While everyone else is sleeping at night, we have these virtual AI agents, they're scanning research notes, company filings, emails to generate portfolio insights," the firm's chief operating officer, Robert Goldstein, said. He hopes Asimov will be deployed across the firm by the next investor day, offering investors at the world's biggest asset manager a powerful teammate. Raffaele Savi, its global head of systemic investing, underscored how significantly AI is affecting the investing world. The speed and power of having "real-time, millions of stimulations a day happening in the background, developing situational awareness" that helps ensure the portfolio reflects the manager's intentions are "profound." "The world has changed tremendously," he said. Jump to

Title: Banking Comes Full Circle with First National Digital Currency Bank: Best Crypto to Buy?

Circle, the company behind the $USDC stablecoin announced on June 30 that it has applied for a national trust bank charter. With a blockchain banking revolution on the horizon, which altcoins could be poised to benefit? Circle’s trust banking license aspirations follow its landmark IPO that valued the company at approximately $18B. Circle’s USDC reserves, currently held and managed by BNY Mellon and BlackRock, would now benefit from in-house oversight, increasing credibility with institutional players. Compliance with the license demands that it not cross into deposit-taking or lending. This could be subject to change, of course, as the regulatory environment in the US clarifies. So far, meeting compliance standards has led Circle to prioritize seeking licenses: CEO Jeremy Allaire emphasized Circle’s commitment to building ‘an internet financial system that is transparent, efficient, and accessible.’ The timing of the move isn’t just about the IPO; it also aligns well with US regulatory currents, including the GENIUS stablecoin bill now advancing through Congress. That bill mandates clear reserve structures and full transparency to help normalize stablecoin use within legacy financial institutions. TradFi is increasingly exploring blockchain as a remedy to its woes. Aave founder Stani Kulechov highlighted the benefits blockchain brings to TradFi: unmatched global reach, instant access to digital financial products, and a global customer base. Hurdles remain, of course. Fragmented interoperability between tokens and blockchains hampers liquidity and cross-chain transactions. There are proposed solutions, though, such as Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), which aims to knit together disparate blockchains as logically as the internet connects different networks. Kulechov envisions a future where DeFi protocols like Aave serve as global financial utilities, unhindered by siloed systems. Reports that a banking consortium including JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo is considering issuing its own stablecoin overlook a salient point: TradFi will also have to overcome an increasingly strong first-mover advantage wielded by Circle and others. As Todd Ruoff, CEO of Autonomys, said, ‘the rules were written by crypto natives.’ Circle is covered by licenses in 46 US states, plus by New York BitLicense, along with a $USDC market cap hovering around $61B. That’s a big hurdle for any new TradFi/crypto banks to overcome. While the banks plan their entry into blockchain, these three altcoins are poised to make big gains. The key to First National Digital Assets Bank could rest in your crypto wallet. That’s why you need the toughest crypto wallet around. Best Wallet provides a simple, secure, and straightforward way to store and use crypto. With MPC and biometric security and the ability to create multiple wallets, you can buy, store, and swap crypto securely, all within a single, powerful Web3 wallet. When you load it up with the native $BEST token, you get even more utility from your wallet, including: Select crypto presales are available directly within the Best Wallet app, making researching and purchasing the hottest crypto presales easier than ever. Learn how to buy Best Wallet Token and see why our own price prediction sees $BEST moving from its current $0.025265 to a potential $0.62 by 2026. Visit the presale page to buy or learn more. You want meme coins — the frenetic energy, crazy gains, and potential for wild swings that every degen craves. But you won’t find those on your mainstream CEXs – at least, not very often. Most of the time, the best action comes from low-cap tokens trading underground on sites like Telegram. But how do you find them? That’s where Snorter Bot and the $SNORT token come in. What is Snorter? It’s the best way to hunt down the best Solana meme coins, with all the tools you need to trade with confidence. This includes: And with the $SNORT token you’ll get lower trading fees and better access to new tokens. It’s one of the reasons our $SNORT price prediction sees the token climbing to $0.94 from its current $0.0967, delivering 872% gains by the end of 2026. Learn how to buy Snorter Token and visit the presale page. Donald Trump has gone big on crypto, both in his administration and personally. World Liberty Financial, his official crypto project, is one of his biggest moves. There was a World Liberty Financial presale for its governance token, $WLFI, a few months ago, but the biggest offering from the project so far has been $USD1, a dollar-based stablecoin. There’s no room for big gains with $USD1 itself, but the token could anchor a much more significant crypto ecosystem from a US president who already has a stablecoin and his own meme coin. In the meantime, $WLFI recently attracted a $100M investment from the UAE as international investors see the potential benefits of Trump’s global crypto aspirations. Circle’s trust bank charter application is under regulatory review; approval would mark a significant milestone in bridging the TradFi and blockchain worlds. With Circle’s bank charter bid, regulatory advances, DeFi’s global potential, and the rise of institutional stablecoins, all the elements are emerging for an intertwined financial ecosystem. These three altcoins could be in line to benefit, but always do your own research. This isn’t financial advice. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Bitcoin ETP With DeFi Yield Goes Live in Europe

A bitcoin BTC$107,874.48 exchange-traded product (ETP) that generates yield from decentralized finance (DeFi) markets has debuted on Tuesday, in what issuer Fineqia calls a first of its kind. The Fineqia Bitcoin Yield ETP (YBTC), listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange, targets a 6% annual yield by deploying investor capital into DeFi strategies. It is issued by Fineqia’s Liechtenstein-based subsidiary and advised by Psalion Yield, a digital asset investment firm focused on blockchain-based yield. Unlike existing crypto yield ETPs that rely on derivatives or structured notes, YBTC maintains one-to-one exposure to bitcoin while generating returns directly from DeFi protocols. “It allows investors to earn more BTC while they hold it, combining long-term conviction with compounding returns, all inside a regulated wrapper,” said Fineqia CEO, Bundeep Singh Rangar. The ETP also supports in-kind transfers, meaning that digital asset holders can contribute BTC directly to the product without the need to first convert into cash incurring a taxable event. YBTC arrives at a time when investor interest in crypto-focused investments is growing. These investment products has brought digital assets closer to traditional investors, allowing them to invest in digital assets in a familiar way through brokerage accounts without the need of crypto wallets and blockchain transactions. Bitcoin exchange-traded products enjoyed rapid growth over the past year and have gobbled up $150 billion of assets, Fineqia said.

Title: The Dollar Just Had Its Worst Start to a Year Since 1973

The US dollar has experienced its steepest decline at the start of a year since the early 1970s, sparking concerns about the nation's financial standing and the global economic order. The downward trend comes amid significant policy changes under President Trump, including aggressive tariffs and an increasingly isolationist approach, which have unsettled international investors and affected confidence in the US economy despite the strong stock market, the New York Times reports. The dollar's drop of more 10% against a basket of major international currencies over the past six months marks its worst first-half performance since 1973, and its worst half-year since the second half of 1991.

The dollar's drop of more 10% against a basket of major international currencies over the past six months marks its worst first-half performance since 1973, and its worst half-year since the second half of 1991. The weakening dollar makes overseas travel more expensive for Americans and discourages foreign investment in the US, while potentially benefiting exporters by making US goods cheaper abroad—though these effects are complicated by ongoing trade tensions, the Times notes. "Trump's tariffs, the fact that many investors view his administration as somewhat chaotic, along with concerns over US national debt have seen the dollar fall out of favor," Trade Nation market analyst David Morrison tells the Guardian. The dollar surged after Trump was re-elected but it peaked just before he took office and started to slide as hopes of a fully pro-business administration faded, the Times reports. Because the decline started when the dollar was at a relatively high level, it isn't especially weak by historical standards, but analysts say the "Big Beautiful Bill," which will add trillions to the deficit over the next decade, is likely to weaken it further. "Full-scale de-dollarization, if it ever comes, is still a long way away," according to Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock. "But there is one dynamic playing out that could significantly raise that risk: increasing government debt."

Title: Kroger announces massive STORE CLOSURES nationwide by 2026, signaling strategic shift

Kroger is closing over 60 underperforming stores (including Kroger, Harris Teeter and Pick 'n Save locations) across multiple states by 2026, marking one of its largest retractions ever. The closures reflect industry-wide challenges like inflation, competition from Walmart and Aldi, and shifting consumer habits, forcing Kroger to cut costs to remain competitive. Despite minor sales declines (from $45.3 billion to $45.1 billion year-over-year) and a drop in net income, Kroger plans to reinvest savings into customer experience and new store openings in high-growth markets. No layoffs are planned as workers will be offered transfers, but relocations may disrupt employees in rural areas. The UFCW union has not yet raised major objections. Kroger is focusing on fresh foods, private labels and digital growth while abandoning weaker markets. Critics question whether reinvestment will offset the loss of community access to groceries.

Kroger is focusing on fresh foods, private labels and digital growth while abandoning weaker markets. Critics question whether reinvestment will offset the loss of community access to groceries. Kroger, one of America's largest grocery chains, is shutting down more than 60 underperforming stores nationwide in a sweeping cost-cutting move. The closures affecting Kroger, Harris Teeter and Pick 'n Save locations mark one of the most significant retractions in the company's history. Stores in Texas, Wisconsin, Georgia, Illinois and several other states will vanish by 2026, with some closing as early as this summer. The decision, announced during Kroger's first-quarter earnings report, comes as the company faces minor sales declines. However, the company insists it will reinvest savings into improving customer experience without layoffs. Grocery chains nationwide are grappling with inflation, shifting consumer habits and fierce competition from discount retailers like Walmart and Aldi. Kroger's closures reflect a broader trend in corporate America: Businesses are trimming excess to survive in an uncertain economy. This isn't just about lost stores â it's about the survival tactics of an industry under siege. (Related: Kroger shoppers reporting "a lot of empty shelves" across supermarket chain locations.) Kroger operates nearly 2,800 stores, meaning these 60 closures represent roughly two percent of its footprint. While not catastrophic, the move signals a strategic retreat from weaker markets. The first confirmed closures included a location in Dickinson, Texas â with more set to follow between July and October. Wisconsin's affected stores remain unannounced, leaving employees and customers in limbo. Kroger's first-quarter earnings revealed a slight dip. Sales fell from $45.3 billion to $45.1 billion year-over-year, while net income dropped from $962 million to $866 million. Interim CEO Ron Sargent called the results "solid," crediting pharmacy, e-commerce and fresh food sales for keeping the company afloat. Yet the numbers suggest stagnation, forcing Kroger to shed dead weight. No layoffs, but what's next for workers? Kroger insists no jobs will be lost, as employees at closing stores will be offered transfers. But for workers in rural or underserved areas, a nearby store might mean longer commutes or upheaval. For towns losing their only grocery outlet, this is cold comfort. The United Food and Commercial Workers Union, representing many Kroger employees, has yet to raise major objections. But the human cost of corporate restructuring remains a quiet concern. Kroger claims savings from closures will fund customer experience upgrades. The company plans to spend up to $3.8 billion this year on new stores and renovations, targeting high-growth markets. This isn't Kroger's first downsizing. In 2018, it closed 40 stores after acquiring Harris Teeter. In 2021, it axed underperforming locations amid pandemic strains. Each time, the company framed cuts as necessary for long-term health. But with inflation squeezing household budgets, customers may see this as another sign of corporate America prioritizing profits over people. Kroger's raised sales forecast hinges on fresh foods, private-label brands and digital services â areas where it competes with Amazon and Walmart. The closure of Kroger Ship, its direct-to-consumer delivery service, suggests even digital strategies face ruthless evaluation. While Kroger refuses to release a full closure list, local reports and union disclosures confirm some casualties. Regardless, the message is clear: growth for some, abandonment for others. Whether this gamble pays off depends on whether reinvestment actually improves service or just shareholder returns. Visit Collapse.newsÂ for more similar stories.

Grocery chains nationwide are grappling with inflation, shifting consumer habits and fierce competition from discount retailers like Walmart and Aldi. Kroger's closures reflect a broader trend in corporate America: Businesses are trimming excess to survive in an uncertain economy. This isn't just about lost stores â it's about the survival tactics of an industry under siege. (Related: Kroger shoppers reporting "a lot of empty shelves" across supermarket chain locations.) Kroger operates nearly 2,800 stores, meaning these 60 closures represent roughly two percent of its footprint. While not catastrophic, the move signals a strategic retreat from weaker markets. The first confirmed closures included a location in Dickinson, Texas â with more set to follow between July and October. Wisconsin's affected stores remain unannounced, leaving employees and customers in limbo. Kroger's first-quarter earnings revealed a slight dip. Sales fell from $45.3 billion to $45.1 billion year-over-year, while net income dropped from $962 million to $866 million. Interim CEO Ron Sargent called the results "solid," crediting pharmacy, e-commerce and fresh food sales for keeping the company afloat. Yet the numbers suggest stagnation, forcing Kroger to shed dead weight. No layoffs, but what's next for workers? Kroger insists no jobs will be lost, as employees at closing stores will be offered transfers. But for workers in rural or underserved areas, a nearby store might mean longer commutes or upheaval. For towns losing their only grocery outlet, this is cold comfort. The United Food and Commercial Workers Union, representing many Kroger employees, has yet to raise major objections. But the human cost of corporate restructuring remains a quiet concern. Kroger claims savings from closures will fund customer experience upgrades. The company plans to spend up to $3.8 billion this year on new stores and renovations, targeting high-growth markets. This isn't Kroger's first downsizing. In 2018, it closed 40 stores after acquiring Harris Teeter. In 2021, it axed underperforming locations amid pandemic strains. Each time, the company framed cuts as necessary for long-term health. But with inflation squeezing household budgets, customers may see this as another sign of corporate America prioritizing profits over people. Kroger's raised sales forecast hinges on fresh foods, private-label brands and digital services â areas where it competes with Amazon and Walmart. The closure of Kroger Ship, its direct-to-consumer delivery service, suggests even digital strategies face ruthless evaluation. While Kroger refuses to release a full closure list, local reports and union disclosures confirm some casualties. Regardless, the message is clear: growth for some, abandonment for others. Whether this gamble pays off depends on whether reinvestment actually improves service or just shareholder returns. Visit Collapse.newsÂ for more similar stories.

But with inflation squeezing household budgets, customers may see this as another sign of corporate America prioritizing profits over people. Kroger's raised sales forecast hinges on fresh foods, private-label brands and digital services â areas where it competes with Amazon and Walmart. The closure of Kroger Ship, its direct-to-consumer delivery service, suggests even digital strategies face ruthless evaluation. While Kroger refuses to release a full closure list, local reports and union disclosures confirm some casualties. Regardless, the message is clear: growth for some, abandonment for others.

Dear friends, Welcome to the “Midsommar in Scandinavia” issue of the Mutual Fund Observer. Chip and I are enjoying a long-planned holiday in Sweden and Norway. We’re equally delighted that you’re here … and we’re there! Among other things (how would I know for sure? I’m in Gamla Stan), Lynn Bolin addresses the emerging threat of tariff-induced inflation with “Protecting Against Tariff Induced Inflation,” analyzing how widespread tariffs will likely be passed through to consumers and drive inflation to an estimated 3.4% peak next quarter. Drawing on five years of post-pandemic bond performance data, he demonstrates that shorter-duration and inflation-protected securities have significantly outperformed traditional intermediate-term bonds, leading him to rotate into funds like Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities Index (VTAPX), Fidelity Inflation-Protected Bond Index Fund (FIPDX), and PIMCO Inflation Response Multi-Asset Fund (PZRMX). Bolin has reduced his stock allocation from 65% to 50% and now maintains approximately 7% of his bond allocation in inflation-protected securities, with another 40% in shorter-duration bonds, while also incorporating target-maturity TIPS ETFs like iShares iBonds Oct 2030 Term Tips ETF (IBIG) into his bond ladders. America’s premier Asian investment boutique, Matthews Asia, has fallen on hard times. Former CEO and portfolio manager Mark Headley has returned from retirement, intent on fixing that. Our hour-long interview is summarized in “Good Bones There.” Without any doubt, the most successful small-cap value fund in existence is Scott Barbee’s Aegis Value Fund. We last shared a full profile of the fund in 2013, but it has appeared in eight data-driven articles since then. We decided it was high time to catch up with Mr. Barbee and correct our oversight in a profile of Aegis Value Fund (AVALX). Three years ago, in the midst of a market meltdown (do you even recall the ’22 crash now), we offered advice on how to cope with a … ummm “spanked portfolio.” The whimsical accompanying graphic generated a surprising amount of site traffic. This month, we offer a three-year retrospective on our 2022 advice: keep calm and consider small-value funds with high-quality portfolios. The performance numbers seem promising. We also share a Launch Alert for Stewart Investors Worldwide Leaders Fund, the US launch of a successful non-US strategy focusing on a concentrated portfolio of high-quality, sustainable businesses. The launch was seeded by a US foundation, so the initial share class is institution with retail in the pipeline! Hedge funds are shifting to Asia. Goldman Sachs reports that hedge fund trading in Asian markets have a five-year high in June. “Hedge funds bought equities in Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan and India last week, but were short selling onshore Chinese stocks,” Goldman said. Family offices are shifting to infrastructure and private debt. A BlackRock survey of 175 family offices, the investment manager for ultra-wealthy families, reports that one-third were planning to increase exposure to private debt this year and 30% were planning to commit more resources to infrastructure investments. Almost every smart beta (e.g., low volatility or fundamental valuation) strategy has failed to produce, according to new research from Research Affiliates (free registration required). The short version: RA has been tracking the performance of a series of factor-based portfolios since 2018, looking to see whether any provided the promised excess return. They did not. In every case, just investing in “the market” was a better bet. The good news: “the market” – defined by its large / growth / momentum subset, is now so egregiously overpriced that almost everything outside of that niche is dramatically underpriced. Source: Research Affiliates, 06/2025 The way to read that chart is to start by finding the little green diamonds. Those are the more-or-less current valuations of each strategy relative to its historic valuations. Green diamonds below the colored bar, which illustrates the historic range from 10th percentile to 90th, signals that the strategy is now cheaper than it has been 90% or 95% of the time. RA concludes that’s good news since valuation matters: … we believe there may be hope for all smart beta strategies. If markets receive a wake-up call and valuations revert, a multitude of systematic factor-based equity strategies could all have a field day. After eight years of going horribly wrong, smart beta investing may now go horribly right. AI is a lot dumber than we thought. A series of research reports, most recently from Apple, argue that while AI can execute certain tasks exceptionally well, reasoning is not among them. The researchers found that in simple reasoning tasks, including the Towers of Hanoi challenge, AIs underperform 7-year-olds. Their central argument is that even the most advanced LLMs do not think in any way that resembles us. Their conclusion is that AI “thinking” is not just different, it’s horrible. (Gary Marcus, “A Knockout Blow for LLMs? LLM ‘reasoning’ is so cooked, they turned my name into a verb,” Communications of the ACM, 6/16/2025). Source: Amazon.com As the complexity of demands rises, moving AI beyond its comfort zone, so does the frequency of hallucinations. One estimate is that 79% of responses from some of the newer AI contain hallucinated content (“A.I. Is Getting More Powerful, but Its Hallucinations Are Getting Worse,” New York Times, 5/6/2025, subscription required). A coda to that argument: ChatGPT just lost a chess match to an Atari 2600. If you’re, oh, under 50, you can be forgiven for the question “WTF is an Atari?” because the 2600 is a home video game console released in 1977. ChatGPT actually volunteered to play the old game system. Oops. One report of the match contained this summary: In fact, the Atari wiped the floor with ChatGPT when it came to chess. I don’t mean the near-half-century-old game console won. I mean that ChatGPT made blunders that would embarrass the greenest of beginners. On the upside, perhaps it thinks it won? “So I said ‘here, hold ma beer an’ gimme a knight an’ I kicked its little Atari keester all the way to …’”. AI is dirtier than we thought. Not “smutty dirt” (though that’s nice, too) but “energy- and water-gulping dirty.” MIT researchers found two troubling trends: AI data centers use more power and more power derived from fossil fuels than “normal” data centers: … more than half of the electricity going to data centers will be used for AI. At that point, AI alone could consume as much electricity annually as 22% of all US households. Meanwhile, data centers are expected to continue trending toward using dirtier, more carbon-intensive forms of energy (like gas) to fill immediate needs, leaving clouds of emissions in their wake. (“We did the math on AI’s energy footprint. Here’s the story you haven’t heard,” MIT Technology Review, 6/2025) Part of the challenge is that AI companies seem desperately concerned with obscuring the magnitude of their energy and water use, which some suspect sounds like a guilty conscience at work. AI users are stupider than we thought. Folks have casually and constantly observed the tendency of people to be lazy, turning to AI to do their work and thoughtlessly passing it along as their own. The underlying phenomenon is called “cognitive offloading.” It’s driven by two biological imperatives: humans have a limited supply of energy each day and thinking requires a lot of energy. Our survival response is to think as little as necessary to get through the day. The polite term for us is “cognitive misers.” We rely on tricks, shortcuts, and habits – none of which require much energy – to muddle through. But we also offload tasks – we delegate – whenever possible. As a quick test, how many telephone numbers can you recite off the top of your head? (No, 9-1-1 doesn’t count.) When I was young, the answer was probably “dozens.” Today, it’s probably two or three (my own, Chip’s, and my son’s). I count on my phone to keep track of the rest. That’s cognitive offloading. A second set of MIT researchers, the Brain on Large Language Models team, has been doing fairly rigorous research on how our brains respond to the availability of AI/LLMs as an offloading option. (Spoiler alert: not well.) Most recently, they gave three groups of students the same task. One group had access to ChatGPT, one had access to Google, and the other had to think for themselves. (Yikes.) The study ran over four months and included both brain activity monitors and direct observation. Their findings: Brain connectivity systematically scaled down with the amount of external support: the Brain‑only group exhibited the strongest, widest‑ranging networks, Search Engine group showed intermediate engagement, and LLM assistance elicited the weakest overall coupling … The reported ownership of LLM group’s essays in the interviews was low. The Search Engine group had strong ownership, but lesser than the Brain-only group. The LLM group also fell behind in their ability to quote from the essays they wrote just minutes prior. (Your Brain on ChatGPT, 6/2025) The short version: the brains of Chat-dependent students literally powered down and while the students nominally completed the work themselves, they had little belief in their own written conclusions and couldn’t quite remember what they’d just said. Rather as we can’t quite remember our sibling’s phone number five minutes after we called them. The White House apparently has an opening for a new Best Billionaire Friend (BBF) after a spectacular fallout between Mr. Trump and the previous holder of the position, Mr. Musk. Mr. Musk, who invested heavily in Mr. Trump’s election campaign, left government service, such as it was, denounced Mr. Trump’s signature legislative package as “a disgusting abomination” and endorsed a call for Mr. Trump’s impeachment. He nonetheless affirmed his “love for the guy.” Two of Mr. Musk’s associates attribute the fallout to Mr. Trump’s failure to give Musk and Tesla favorable treatment under the bill. “Elon was butthurt,” according to one source. Musk threatened to decommission his fleet of Dragon spacecraft. Trump threatened to “terminate Elon’s Government Subsidies and Contracts” and to investigate his business practices. Musk caved. We’ve written a fair amount about the history and enduring psychology of these alliances (“If you’re so rich, why aren’t you smart?” LinkedIn, 4/2025). Two things to remember: Fortunately, the BBF position is likely to be swiftly filled. UBS reports (6/2025) that there are now 31 people with wealth in excess of $50 billion dollars. Queue forms to the right! To all of the folks helping to make our Scandinavian sojourn amazing! We asked, you answered! Thanks so much to all the folks who shared good wishes and travel advice for our upcoming Scandinavian adventure: Stuart, Leah, Marjorie, DGH, and Roger. Thank you, thank you! Stuart: the Vasa Museum is one of our must-see sites! Gotland and Stumholmen are saved for our next trip. Leah: thanks for the sweater advice – we’re setting aside a budget for Bergen. And Chip might be booking a table at Bryggen Tracteursted as I write. DGH: Pending good weather, the Norse Folkemuseum and time to wander around Bygdøy are on the itinerary.

Title: Crypto Inflows Hit $2.7B in One Week, What Are Institutions Buying?

Crypto asset investment products saw continued momentum last week, with $2.7 billion in net inflows reported across major funds. According to data from CoinShares, this marks the 11th consecutive week of inflows, bringing the year-to-date total to $16.9 billion. The sustained interest has been led by institutional players such as BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Bitwise, ProShares, and 21Shares, all of which have seen growing demand for their crypto-related products. The majority of last week’s inflows originated from the United States, which accounted for $2.65 billion of the global total. Minor contributions also came from Switzerland and Germany, at $23 million and $19.8 million respectively. Meanwhile, other regions, including Canada, Hong Kong, and Brazil, saw modest outflows. Notably, Hong Kong registered total outflows of $132 million for the month of June, despite having previously recorded strong inflow activity during regional price rallies. Bitcoin remained the primary recipient of institutional interest, attracting $2.2 billion, or roughly 83% of the week’s inflows. Short-Bitcoin products, however, experienced $2.9 million in outflows, bringing total year-to-date outflows for bearish bets on BTC to $12 million. This inverse movement highlights a broader market leaning towards long exposure, reflecting positive sentiment around Bitcoin’s current price structure and potential future performance. James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, noted that the mid-year performance closely tracks that of 2024, which ended June with inflows totaling $18.3 billion. Butterfill attributed the ongoing trend to a combination of macroeconomic factors, including geopolitical instability and shifting expectations around central bank policies. He emphasized that uncertainty surrounding interest rate cuts and broader economic signals has likely driven investors to consider digital assets as part of a diversified strategy. Ethereum also recorded meaningful inflows last week, with $429 million added to institutional products tied to the asset. Year-to-date, Ethereum-focused funds have now accumulated $2.9 billion in net inflows, positioning it as the second-most favored digital asset among institutional investors. The rise in ETH inflows comes amid continued growing activity in Layer 2 networks, which have contributed to the platform’s expanding utility. Solana, by contrast, continues to lag in investor interest, with only $91 million in inflows reported for the year so far. While Solana has gained traction in areas such as DeFi and NFT issuance, it appears to be attracting more speculative capital rather than large-scale institutional flows at this stage. The disparity between Ethereum and Solana suggests that investor confidence is still largely tied to the more established networks when allocating capital to altcoins.

Title: What Happens To Work When AI Does The Easy Parts?

ByJim Euchner ByJim Euchner, Contributor. TOPSHOT - A robot using artificial intelligence is displayed at a stand during the International ... More Telecommunication Union (ITU) AI for Good Global Summit in Geneva, on May 30, 2024. Humanity is in a race against time to harness the colossal emerging power of artificial intelligence for the good of all, while averting dire risks, a top UN official said. (Photo by Fabrice COFFRINI / AFP) (Photo by FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP via Getty Images) A mantra in press releases about generative AI in corporations has been that it will ‘free up people to do more creative work.’ Satya Nadella, Microsoft CEO, claimed that “AI will do our drudge work, freeing us to do the creative tasks where humans excel.” But Microsoft also announced cuts of 6,000 jobs in May, partly attributed to AI automation. Andy Jassy, Amazon’s CEO, stated that “Agents will allow us to start almost everything from a more advanced starting point… focus less on rote work and more on thinking strategically about improving customer experiences and inventing new ones.” Amazon has announced 27,000 layoffs since 2022, for some of which AI efficiencies were explicitly cited. Similar patterns exist for other tech firms, including Meta and Duolingo. What’s going on? Is this just a mismatch between PR and the efficiency imperative? Is there any evidence that the jobs are being redesigned for increased creative content, or are we experiencing a straightforward substitution of people for AIs? Perhaps is neither of these, but rather that contradictory messages are natural as executives naviate the fog of transition to a radically new technology. AI certainly has the potential to free people to spend more time on creative tasks. It can create slack time for learning, innovation, or deep thinking about a design. It can also be used to create jobs with broader accountability or a richer work environment. But if any of these is happening, it isn’t being discussed. That is too bad. Businesses could be missing an opportunity, one that goes beyond task automation to rethinking the design of work and technology. They may be missing the chance to take true advantage of the expanding capabilities of generative AI. A narrow focus on efficiency can shift attention away from other important metrics, like customer satisfaction and employee engagement. The irony is that an efficiency mindset might not even maximize efficiency, at least in the long run. In an interview, Patricia Sachs, a workplace anthropologist, told me that "automation mechanizes the way things are supposed to happen. But they almost never happen as expected." The reason is that much work in the real world is invisible, involving workarounds, improvisations, and social networks. As Sachs noted, "none of these appear in the workflow diagram or org chart." This was true at Klarna, a leader in the deployment of generative AI. The company has claimed that AI handles about two-thirds of customer service chats, equivalent to the work of over 700 agents. Their initial results showed, in addition, a drop in resolution times and reduced repeat inquiries, all while maintaining customer satisfaction. But Klarna has started to recruit human agents again, acknowledging that automation led to declines in service quality, customer satisfaction, and trust. CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski acknowledged that "cost unfortunately seems to have been a too predominant evaluation factor" in the AI initiative, which led to reductions in quality, morale and trust. The company is now hiring human agents and seeking a more productive blend of AI efficiency and human empathy. Others are reaching similar conclusions. Ravin Jesuthasan, a senior partner at Mercer, cites lessons he learned from a large-scale case study of AI implementation at a financial services firm. The results were impressive, including a reduction in the work of the current staff by 50% and an 18% reduction in employee turnover. In the article, "Want AI-Driven Productivity? Redesign Work," he argues the key to lasting AI success is to start with the work, not the technology. These early experiences emphasize the importance of a focus the messy, human, frequently-changing work that is at the center of any good AI application. Starting with the technology risks missing something important that can erode financial benefits. So what should executives do? Success is more about mindset and taking an holistic approach than it is about technology. Moving beyond a narrow focus on efficiency will lead to more durable and customer-friendly technology and more productive workplaces.

Title: Equity Prices Rise To Record Levels Even As The Economy Slows
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/06/30/equity-prices-rise-to-record-levels-even-as-the-economy-slows/

ByRobert Barone ByRobert Barone, Contributor. On Friday (June 27th), both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq closed at record levels. This occurred despite growing evidence of a slowing economy and continued trade angst.1 Meanwhile, the DJIA is still -2.65% away from its 12/4/24 peak (45,014.04) and the small cap Russell 2000 remains off more than -11% from its 11/25/24 high (2,442.03).2 This isn’t a surprise to us as the industrial economy and especially small caps always feel an economic slowdown before it becomes mainstream. In addition, the DJIA and Russell 2000 have many fewer tech companies, the sector where the action is. The consolidated reporting charts are for informational purposes only and should not replace the ... More official reporting made available by each index, custodian, market and/or security. The table above shows that all the major indexes had a good week and month. For the year, the S&P 500 is up about 5% (about where is should be halfway through a typical 10% growth year), while the other three major indexes are lagging. The Nasdaq is up less than 1% while the DJIA (industrials) and the Russell 2000 (small cap) are underwater year to date (with the Russell 2000 off more than -5%). So, a mixed bag.1 2 Five of the Magnificent 7 (NVDA, MSFT, AMZN, META and GOOG) enjoyed a prosperous week. AAPL and TSLA were marginally positive. For the year to date, it is really a mixed bag. AAPL and TSLA are down nearly -20%, and GOOG is down more than -6%. Meanwhile META, NVDA and MSFT show substantial gains, while AMZN is just keeping its head above water. Nevertheless, on Friday, NVDA closed at a new record high.3 4 The consolidated reporting charts are for informational purposes only and should not replace the ... More official reporting made available by each index, custodian, market and/or security. The Consumer As the consumer goes, so goes the economy. So, when the consumers’ income falls, or inflation rises faster than that income, real consumption growth is negatively impacted. So, it isn’t good news to learn that personal earnings (excluding government transfers) fell in May (-0.1%) and have been negative in three of the past four months. Perhaps this is responsible for the -0.1% drop in consumer spending in May which, after including the effects of inflation, amounts to -0.3% in real terms. There was a fall in spending on durable goods of -1.8%, -0.3% for non-durables, and services were essentially flat (-0.03%).5 There are other signs of consumer discomfort. One such sign is the rise in the number of multiple job holders. This occurs when the income from a single job isn’t sufficient to maintain that worker’s lifestyle. Either live at a lower level or get a second job! The chart shows a steady upward trend in this statistic since the pandemic.6 Bureau of Labor Statistics Other such signs can be seen in the delinquency rates on consumer loans. Delinquencies on mortgages, auto loans and consumer credit are on the rise. The left-hand side of the chart below shows that credit card balances are at record levels as consumers try to maintain their standard of living (Charge it now – worry about paying for it later!). Note the rapid rise in delinquencies (right-hand side of the chart below) in the post-pandemic period. Note that while credit card delinquencies of 90+ days appear to have come down recently, this is most likely due to increased write-offs of such debt by the financial (bank) system.7 8 FRBNY Consumer Credit Panel, Equifax, Bloomberg Finally, a look at the major retailer reports reinforces the aggregate data. Best Buy, for example, recently cut its sales forecast for 2025. Kohl’s reported -3.9% sales growth in Q1, and went on to forecast -5% to -7% for 2025 as a whole. Foot Locker reported that sales fell -2.6% from year earlier levels, and Hormel trimmed its earnings outlook.5Housing As always, housing is a good indicator of the economy’s economic health. The left-hand side of the chart below shows the slowdown in Existing Home Sales over the past couple of years, and the right-hand side indicates the rapid rise in the months’ supply of inventory at current sales rates (now higher than the pandemic peak). This is a sign of growing weakness and inevitably leads to a slowdown in new home construction with spillover effects into the labor market. National Association of Realtors and Bureau of Labor Statistics Note in the New Home Sales chart below the horizontal trend since 2023 and the latest turndown in 2025. U.S. Census Bureau As demand stagnates, so do home prices. As seen from the chart below, the median sales price of new homes has stagnated for the past two years. Final Thoughts Equity markets continued their upward path the week ended June 27th with record highs for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. It was a good week and a good month for stocks. But this rising tide has put the P/E ratio significantly above its long-term mean. Investors beware! For 2025, the S&P 500 leads the pack, up nearly 5%, while small-caps also carry a “5” growth number, but with a negative sign.1 2 It was also a positive week for all of the Magnificent 7 (AAPL barely so). Year-to-date, the stock prices of four of the Mag 7 are positive and three are negative, with AAPL and TSLA each down nearly -20%!3 4 As the consumer goes, so does the economy. One can see the stress developing in the consumer sector by looking at the rising trend of multiple job holders and the rise in both credit card balances and 90+ day delinquencies.6 7 8 Housing is always a bellwether of the economy. The fact that Existing Home Sales have tanked and New Home Sales have flatlined tells an astute observer that the economy has entered rocky ground.

(NYSE:ELV), and West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. (NYSE:WST). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Compass Diversified (NYSE:CODI) Class Period: May 1, 2024 - May 7, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 8, 2025 According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) the Company's subsidiary, Lugano Holdings, Inc., maintained unrecorded financing arrangements and irregularities in its sales, cost of sales, inventory, and accounts receivable; (2) the irregularities and undisclosed details in Lugano Holdings, Inc.'s financial statements rendered the financial statements of the Company as a whole unreliable, and would require restatement; (3) the Company failed to maintain adequate internal controls related to its financial statements; and (4) as a result, defendants' public statements were materially false and/or misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. For more information on the Compass Diversified class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/CODI Digimarc Corporation (NASDAQ:DMRC) Class Period: May 3, 2024 - February 26, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 7, 2025 According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. A large commercial partner of Digimarc would not renew its contract on the same terms. As a result, the Company would renegotiate the large commercial contract. Based on this renegotiation, the Company’s subscription revenue and annual recurring revenue would be adversely affected. Based on these facts, the Company’s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period. When the market learned the truth about Digimarc, investors suffered damages. For more information on the Digimarc class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/DMRC Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV) Class Period: April 18, 2024, and October 16, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 11, 2025 According to the lawsuit, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that, with the Medicaid redetermination process nearly complete, defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the risk and cost profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid programs. While defendants acknowledged that Medicaid expenses were rising, they repeatedly assured investors that this was adequately reflected in Elevance’s guidance for the year. These representations were materially false or misleading. In truth, the redeterminations were causing the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members to rise significantly, as the members being removed from Medicaid programs were, on average, healthier than those who remained eligible for the programs. This shift was occurring to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations with the states or in its financial guidance for 2024. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. For more information on the Elevance class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ELV West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. (NYSE:WST) Class Period: February 16, 2023, - February 12, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 7, 2025 The West Pharmaceutical class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) despite claiming strong visibility into customer demand and attributing headwinds to temporary COVID-related product destocking, West Pharmaceutical was in fact experiencing significant and ongoing destocking across its high-margin High-Value Products portfolio; (ii) West Pharmaceutical’s SmartDose device, which was purportedly positioned as a high-margin growth product, was highly dilutive to West Pharmaceutical’s profit margins due to operational inefficiencies; and (iii) these margin pressures created the risk of costly restructuring activities, including West Pharmaceutical’s exit from continuous glucose monitoring (“CGM”) contracts with long-standing customers. The West Pharmaceutical class action lawsuit further alleges that on February 13, 2025, West Pharmaceutical issued its 2025 revenue forecast in the range of $2.88 billion to $2.91 billion, significantly below expectations. According to the complaint, West Pharmaceutical attributed the disappointing guidance in part to Contract Manufacturing headwinds, including the loss of two major CGM customers that had begun transitioning to in-house manufacturing of next-generation devices because West Pharmaceutical “made the decision to not participate going forward as our financial thresholds cannot be achieved.” The West Pharmaceutical class action lawsuit further alleges that West Pharmaceutical also revealed that its SmartDose wearable injector will become margin dilutive in 2025 due to lower pricing. On this news, the price of West Pharmaceutical’s stock fell more than 38%.

(DV) Misled Investors Regarding its Business Prospects According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants failed to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on its Activation Services was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; and (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities. The complaint alleges that the truth was revealed on February 27, 2025, when DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending and the suspension of DoubleVerify services by a large customer. Defendants also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was negatively impacting the Company. On this news, DoubleVerify’s stock price dropped $7.83 per share, or 36%, from a closing price of $21.73 on February 27, 2025, to a closing price of $13.90 on February 28, 2025.

Eight of the ten universities with the largest number of Nobel laureates are in the United States. A tremendous amount of innovation emerges from the research performed at US universities. Canes-Wrone reminds us of what universities contribute to society and describes what universities can do to reverse the trend of public distrust. Watch the video here. Mass Versus Donor Attitudes on the Importance of Supreme Court Nominations In the American Political Science Review, Brandice Canes-Wrone and coauthors Jonathan P. Kastellec and Nicolas Studen report on their survey of 7,000 political donors and a sample of the general public, in which they asked members of each constituency how they prioritize Supreme Court justice nominations. They find donors “substantially more likely “than what they call their “general public co-partisans” to prioritize Supreme Court nominations. “Our unique survey data on donors shows that these differences are quite sizable; on average, donors from either [major] party are about 20 percentage points more likely to cite judicial appointments as a top-three priority compared to general population partisans,” Canes-Wrone and her coauthors write.

Scholars Meet at Hoover to Discuss Possibility of Ideologically Neutral AI in a Polarized World Recognizing the rising power of artificial intelligence to shape the public’s opinions and influence how information is created and consumed, scholars gathered at the Hoover Institution on March 21 to discuss ways to create generative AI models all Americans can trust in an increasingly polarized era. Convened by Hoover Institution Senior Fellow Andrew B. Hall, he said the meeting was meant to determine how the AI models and agents of the future would “reflect our values and earn our trust, given concerns that companies and governments might accidentally or intentionally engineer them to adopt some beliefs and preferences over others.” Sponsored by RAI, the conference is one of many efforts underway to push back on the root causes of declining public trust in institutions and the growing distance between the far points on America’s political spectrum. It brought together scholars on AI, free speech, and computer science, along with representatives from social media and AI firms themselves. Research presented during the day suggested developing ideologically neutral large language models will be a difficult task. Read more here. Building on the conference, a new paper from Hall and Hoover Institution fellows Justin Grimmer and Sean Westwood finds that most Americans perceive major large language models (LLMs) as biased and that small changes in how the LLMs are instructed could measurably reduce this sentiment. Exploring Liquid Democracy for the 21st Century On the latest episode of Policy Stories, Hall speaks of resurrecting a 19th-century concept known as liquid democracy and applying it to help make decisions in the 21st century. In liquid democracy, voters retain the option to vote for themselves, but those who feel insufficiently informed can give their vote to someone else to cast on their behalf. It's a hybrid between representative democracy and direct democracy. And digital technology makes it feasible to build this option at scale for the first time. Today, a variety of organizations are actively experimenting with different ways to delegate decision-making power to others. Major investment firms like BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard now allow shareholders to delegate their votes through voting-choice programs using blockchain. Hall is exploring whether systems that delegate decision-making power to randomly sampled citizen assemblies could provide guidance on what AI chatbots should and shouldn't say or what they can and cannot do. The real-world applications for liquid democracy are promising. In California, for example, ballot initiatives, which are chances for voters to make decisions together outside the legislative process, can be so numerous that it's difficult to be informed on each one. Delegating the call to better-informed citizens could be beneficial. Watch the episode here. Hoover’s RAI Asks How Social Media and AI Can Encourage Democratic Practice Some public commentators fear that social media and generative AI drive polarization and misinformation online, while others hope that they might counter polarization and help to restore public trust, according to scholars at a gathering at the Hoover Institution. The Social Media and Democratic Practice conference on March 17, 2025, sought to see how social media platforms and AI both positively and negatively impact public discourse and democracy. Earlier studies of legacy platforms like Facebook, Twitter (now X), and YouTube found little evidence of harmful effects produced by explicitly political content on social media. At the time, filter bubbles were largely nonexistent, and misinformation and disinformation had little or no discernible effect. The prevailing theory was simply that most people paid little attention to politics on social media and thus were immune to potential effects. In recent years, however, new platforms have proliferated. While not explicitly political, many of these might have important indirect political effects, such as the 2024 Joe Rogan podcast of a conversation with Donald Trump that has reportedly been streamed more than 50 million times. In addition, seemingly nonpolitical content on legacy social media (such as posts reflecting vaccine skepticism) can have political implications. Scant research has examined these new dimensions of the social media universe as yet. Senior Fellow Morris P. Fiorina, who organized the event, said the gathering was aimed at encouraging research about the ways new developments in social media and other online applications help and hinder democratic engagement and practice. “Today is a first step in measuring impact and reach of political content on social media, something academics have not paid enough attention to in recent years,” Fiorina said.

He is also a professor of government at the University of Texas at Austin. He spoke with Chris Herhalt about how the Latino vote is moving to the right, and the misconceptions both major political parties hold about Hispanic voters. Chris Herhalt: Can you explain what you call the Latino assimilation paradox? David L. Leal: I created this term as a way to explain some of the big-picture dynamics involving the Latino vote, particularly the rumors, misunderstandings, and wishful thinking that have circulated within both Democratic and Republican circles. For many years, the common view of how demographic change would shape politics was the theory of “demography as destiny.” This predicted that as the Latino population grew and the American population more generally diversified, the Democratic Party would be the inevitable beneficiary. All it had to do was sit back and wait for an unstoppable demographic dividend at the ballot box. The flip side was that Republicans would eventually be reduced to permanent minority party status. The logic was that as California went, so would go the nation. This belief was shared by Democrats and Republicans, although it gave confidence—some would say complacency—to the former but heartburn to the latter. There have been good reasons to doubt this rather oversimplified view of how population change would shape politics. And by the Trump era, real-life electoral results and polling data were showing that Latinos—and also many immigrants and other minority groups—were starting to move toward the Republican Party in a slow but sure way. This was contrary to almost everything that activists, academics, journalists, pollsters, politicians, and pundits, Republicans included, were expecting. Many are now trying to understand why Latinos are moving toward the GOP. My answer is that this is just the latest chapter in the great American assimilation story. We do not have time here to review the scholarship, but to take one example, the 2005 book Italians Then, Mexicans Now studied socioeconomic progress among second-generation immigrants in two different historical eras, and the title says it all. Assimilation is complex, of course, but it was real and consequential then, and it is real and consequential now. Politically, across the last century, we find that new waves of immigrant groups often begin as strong Democrats, but over time, they slowly but surely move toward the Republican Party. This was true broadly for all of the White Catholic ethnic groups of the late 19th and early 20th centuries: Italian-Americans, Polish-Americans, Irish-Americans, and others. The White Catholic vote is today majority Republican, but when John F. Kennedy ran in 1960, it would have seemed self-evident that Catholics would overwhelmingly and indefinitely vote Democratic. But assimilation did its work, despite long-standing populist rumors to the contrary. Today, although the evidence for assimilation remains strong, both parties have denied, doubted, and disparaged its effects, although for very different reasons, and this is where we find the paradoxes—one for each party.

Renewing America’s Civics Education A story in the Stanford Report highlights the Stanford Civics Initiative (SCI), a joint endeavor between the School of Humanities and Sciences and the Hoover Institution that launched in the fall of 2020 and is led by RAI participant and Senior Fellow Josiah Ober. “The goal of civic education in a democracy is learning how to live in a world in which there are people who are very different from yourself,” said Ober. “A core part of teaching citizenship is showing students how to gain an understanding of where other people are coming from and figuring out a way to engage together to make policy and create civic bargains—the compromise and negotiation integral to democracy.” SCI provides Stanford students with advanced courses on democratic citizenship and is about to launch a senior honors program. The initiative builds on a long-standing tradition at Stanford of studying, in the words of the university’s founding grant, “the blessings of liberty regulated by law.” Read more here. Upcoming Events: More Than Red Vs. Blue: Stories, Struggles, and Strengths in Rural America Rural America is often reduced to a political talking point — red states, blue states, culture wars. But there’s a deeper story, rooted in place, community, and history. Drawing on his own research, Nicholas Jacobs, co-author of The Rural Voter: The Politics of Place and the Disuniting of America, explores what it means to understand rural life on its own terms — and why doing so matters now more than ever.

Title: Sen. Mike Lee removes public lands provision from Trump's "big, beautiful bill"

Time Published: 2025-06-30T21:03:50Z

Watch CBS News June 30, 2025 / 5:03 PM EDT / CBS/AP Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah announced over the weekend he was removing a provision from the Senate's "big, beautiful bill" that would allow the sale of hundreds of thousands of acres of public lands for affordable housing and infrastructure. "Because of the strict constraints of the budget reconciliation process, I was unable to secure clear, enforceable safeguards to guarantee that these lands would be sold only to American families—not to China, not to BlackRock, and not to any foreign interests," Lee said in a statement announcing the withdrawal of the provision. After the Senate parliamentarian ruled that Lee's original proposal, which encompassed millions of acres, would violate budget reconciliation rules, he had reduced the acreage. The bill, which contains President Trump's tax cuts, border and defense initiatives, is being considered under the special rules because it requires only a simple majority to pass, rather than the 60-vote super majority that is required for consideration of most legislation in the Senate. Under Lee's plan, land in 11 Western states from Alaska to New Mexico would have been eligible for sale. Montana was carved out of the proposal after its lawmakers objected. In states like Utah and Nevada, the government controls the vast majority of lands, protecting them from potential exploitation but hindering growth. Lee's revised plan would have excluded all U.S. Forest Service land from possible sale. Sales of sites controlled by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management were to be significantly reduced, Lee said, so that only land within 5 miles of population centers could be sold. But in addition to opposition from Democrats, Republican senators in Idaho and Montana objected to the plan, too. Several House Republicans also said that if the provision were included in the Senate bill, they would vote against it when the bill received a vote in the lower chamber, threatening its passage. Lee said in his statement that he still believes the federal government "owns far too much land—land it is mismanaging and in many cases ruining for the next generation" and he complained that under Democratic presidents, "massive swaths of the West are being locked away from the people who live there, with no meaningful recourse." The House originally had a public land sales provision, too, one which would have allowed sales of acreage in Utah and Nevada. But GOP Rep. Ryan Zinke of Montana, who served as interior secretary during President Trump's first administration, opposed the idea immediately. "I do not support the widespread sale or transfer of public lands," Zinke said in a statement in May. "Once the land is sold, we will never get it back. God isn't creating more land." Several other Western state Republican House members also rejected the idea, so the provision was stripped out of the budget bill before the House voted on it. Housing advocates have cautioned that federal land is not universally suitable for affordable housing. Some of the parcels up for sale in Utah and Nevada under the House proposal were many miles from developed areas. New Mexico Sen. Martin Heinrich, the top Democrat on the Senate Energy Committee, said before Lee withdrew his plan that it would exclude Americans from places where they fish, hunt and camp. "I don't think it's clear that we would even get substantial housing as a result of this," Heinrich said earlier this month. "What I know would happen is people would lose access to places they know and care about and that drive our Western economies." © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Private Lenders Pitch Restructuring for Stressed Pallet Company

(Bloomberg) -- Private lenders have proposed a potential debt restructuring for 48Forty Solutions, less than a year after Summit Partners acquired a majority stake in the pallet management company, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The company’s debt includes around $1.75 billion of private credit, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. The lenders, which include Antares Capital, KKR & Co. and BlackRock Inc. provided the financing in a recapitalization deal in October, the people said. Representatives for Antares, KKR and BlackRock declined to comment, while representatives for 48Forty and Summit didn’t respond to requests for comment. The $1.7 trillion private credit industry has started to see more signs of stress, as companies grapple with persistently high interest rates and a weakening consumer. Investors are eyeing how the asset class would handle a potential downturn, as the market has not yet been tested by one after growing rapidly in recent years. FS KKR Capital Corp., a business development company jointly managed by KKR and FS Investments, marked down the value of the 48Forty loan to 76 cents on the dollar in the first quarter, according to a May regulatory filing. On a call discussing first-quarter earnings, Daniel Pietrzak, the chief investment officer of the BDC, said 48Forty had been affected by “labor costs and excess inventory.” 48Forty has also suffered from a pullback in consumer spending, the people said. 48Forty provides recycled wood pallets and pallet management services across the US and Canada. As of March 31, the company was paying the majority of the interest on its debt, priced at 6 percentage points over the base rate, in kind, according to regulatory filings. Payment-in-kind deals allow borrowers to defer making cash interest payments typically until maturity. The October recapitalization deal also saw Summit Partners, which first invested in the company in 2022, take a majority stake in 48Forty. If the restructuring happens, 48Forty would join a growing list of companies that have restructured their private credit loans over the past year, with others including Alacrity Solutions, Zips Car Wash and Pluralsight Inc. The default rate for US private credit ticked up slightly in May to reach 4.6%, according to a Fitch Ratings report. Fitch cited “weakening North American corporate credit environment and ongoing macroeconomic challenges such as higher interest rates and slowing growth” as a cause of the increase.

Posted in: Comics, Current News | Tagged: Ad Populum, AENT, diamond The exit interviews of Diamond Comic Distributor Staff, Lee Butman, Matt Demory, Joe Lunday, Trista Peterson, Sadie Campos and Ryan Shelkett The Exit Interviews for the six members of Diamond Comic Distributors who quit on the same day to go work for Alliance Entertainment, following Mike Schimmel, and kicking off another lawsuit in the ongoing Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings of the comic book publisher, have been unsealed. And they paint a picture of a distributor that people were pretty happy working at, until the bankruptcy. Though they did talk about the poor communication, both traditionally and with the new owners, how they didn't like learning things about their jobs and the bankruptcy on Bleeding Cool, and the lack of career advancement at Diamond due to so many people staying in their jobs and not moving on. Oh and then there were the fist bumps of new owner Joel Weinshanker of Ad Populum. Bleeding Cool published the exit interviews in full, but there's also an additional note Bleeding Cool is adding to Joe Lunday's entry, regarding the mention of fellow Diamond employee Steve Warble. DATE – May 30, 2025 POSITION – Merchandise Team Manager DATE HIRED – June 12, 2000 TERMINATION DATE – May 30, 2025 MAIN REASON FOR LEAVING – Lee left the Company due to accepting a role with Alliance Entertainment. 1. WHAT WILL YOUR ROLE BE IN YOUR NEW JOB? Lee's new role will be Buyer – Consumer Product Specialist. Lee believes he will be working for Ryan Shelkett, former Executive Director of Applications Development. Lee said he was looking for stability. He felt there was a lack of communication from Ad Populum, including that they were not forthcoming with plans and the future. Lee also said he sent out his resume a few months ago to get feelers for potential new employers. Having a family, Lee needed stability to be able to support his family. Lee also shared that he was aware Alliance Entertainment had spoken with others. He said Alliance Entertainment was at the LA Toy Fair a few weeks ago and around the same time they were scheduled to buy the Company. Those who attended flew out to LA just after the deal fell through. 2. WAS SALARY A CONSIDERATION? No 3. WHAT DID YOU LIKE MOST ABOUT DIAMOND? Lee said what he liked most were the people he worked with. He also said, in earlier years, Diamond felt like family. Once things began to change due to new management, Lee did his best to continue to maintain that type of atmosphere with his team. 4. WHAT DID YOU LIKE LEAST ABOUT DIAMOND? Tying into his statement above, Lee felt, unfortunately, that the last ten (10) years seemed more corporate and colder. 5. HOW WOULD YOU RATE THE FOLLOWING: EXCELLENT,GOOD,FAIR,POOR A. WORKING CONDITIONS IN YOUR DEPARTMENT – Pretty good – Lee felt Ryan Shelkett did a good job, once he settled into his new role. Lee felt, ultimately, morale improved. B. ADVANCEMENT OPPORTUNITY – Lee said it was tough to advance. There were "long timers" in the Company. Therefore, it was hard to see opportunities to advance. C. COMMUNICATION – Fair – Lee felt the last five (5) months were not good. He hated that he read so much about what was happening in Bleeding Cool, versus the Company sharing information. D. BENEFITS – Good E. COMPENSATION AND PAY INCREASES – Good F. OVERALL OPINION OF THE COMPANY – Excellent – If it weren't for the bankruptcy and recent sale, Lee envisioned working at Diamond until he retired. DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE POLICY REMINDER THAT WAS PROVIDED TO YOU? No – understood DATE – May 30, 2025 POSITION – Assistant Manager – Print Team DATE HIRED – July 18, 2012 TERMINATION DATE – May 30, 2025 MAIN REASON FOR LEAVING – Matt said he did not want to leave the Company. He had no ill will towards Diamond. That said, he had to do what was best for him and his family. He felt that Diamond lost too many employees and the core competency…too many pieces of the puzzle are gone. He said he was not sure how Diamond Book Distributors sales is supposed to function. He also felt that too much of the industry is rejecting Diamond, and too many businesses have made it clear they do not want to continue business with Diamond. Instead, they are moving to competitors. It seemed to become a trend where others felt this is what I'm supposed to do since everyone else is doing it. Matt's impression was DC and Marvel leaving made it look easy, so others followed. All that said, Matt worried that some of those that left realized the grass was not necessarily greener on the other side. However, they were locked into contracts that they could not get out of. 1. WHAT WILL YOUR ROLE BE IN YOUR NEW JOB? Matt will be a Buyer with Alliance Entertainment. He said they contacted him with an employment offer. In his new role, he will be working with a new set of accounts. However, he will continue using his skills to manage inventory. 2. WAS SALARY A CONSIDERATION? No – Matt was ok with his salary. However, he was drained emotionally. He said he constantly felt like he was on the front line defending the company. 3. WHAT DID YOU LIKE MOST ABOUT DIAMOND? Matt said he enjoyed everyone on his team. He grew up with comics and wanted to do something to encourage other kids to have the same opportunity. 4. WHAT DID YOU LIKE LEAST ABOUT DIAMOND? Matt said what he liked least was the software. 5. HOW WOULD YOU RATE THE FOLLOWING: EXCELLENT,GOOD,FAIR,POOR A. WORKING CONDITIONS IN YOUR DEPARTMENT – Excellent – Matt enjoyed the freedom to work independently with the understanding that guidance was always available when needed. B. ADVANCEMENT OPPORTUNITY – Matt described advancement opportunities as "pretty flat". C. COMMUNICATION – Excellent – Matt felt people were good to respond timely. D. BENEFITS – NA – Matt said he was on his wife's insurance. E. COMPENSATION AND PAY INCREASES – Poor – Matt could not remember the last time he received a pay increase. He understood that the Company faced tough times which resulted in no recent pay increases. F. OVERALL OPINION OF THE COMPANY – Excellent – Matt wished the very best for the future of the new Diamond. He hoped it could survive given how many were no longer with the Company as a result. DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE POLICY REMINDER THAT WAS PROVIDED TO YOU? No – Matt said he fully understood our policy. He felt that Alliance Entertainment has their own systems and way of doing things. OVERALL GENERAL COMMENTS: Overall, Matt said he very much respects Diamond. DATE – May 30, 2025 POSITION – Director of Ecommerce Sales DATE HIRED – November 28, 2022 TERMINATION DATE – May 30, 2025 MAIN REASON FOR LEAVING – Joe left due to accepting a position with Alliance Entertainment. Joe will be helping to build the collectibles and toy program. 1. WHAT WILL YOUR ROLE BE IN YOUR NEW JOB? See above 2. WAS SALARY A CONSIDERATION? Yes – However, he also said he was not going to be receiving a huge bump in pay. Joe added he was concerned about Diamond's future now that the sale to Ad Populum has taken place. Joe said he had a conversation with Chuck Parker, President, and was encouraged to stay but he had concerns about the future with vendors and the company, overall. Joe also said morale is very low across the organization. Ad Populum has provided no communication, leading others to wonder how much they really care about employees. Further, they eliminated the necessary roles to keep any attempt at success very limited. Additionally, Joe said when Joel Weinshanker from Ad Populum was in town and meeting with various employees, Joe's meeting with him, which he thought was scheduled for 15 minutes, lasted 4 minutes. Joe's impression was that it was 2 minutes longer than Joel would have liked. Joel came off as very off putting. Joe went into the meeting with questions for Joel. Joe walked away with the strong impression that Joel really only wanted the warehouse and was meeting with employees as a formality. Also, when Joe walked into the meeting, Joel fist bumped him and then proceeded to read his name and title off of a piece of paper. Joel then asked what Joe did. Joe explained his role in sales and read sales data information from last year. He further described the business…Japanese, Taiwan, Amazon, Godzilla. Joel asked who his contact was at Amazon. Joel gave very little feedback during the brief encounter. Joe shared that he later spoke with Steve Warble, Sales and Marketing Inventory Manager. Steve told Joe that his meeting lasted 3 minutes. He, too, had the same impression of Joel. Additionally, Joe said he was speaking with someone else (he did not share who) and that individual said that Joel told them directly "you know I did not get a good first impression of you". Joel later changed his tune when he admitted to needing the person. Joe also said that he was told that Mike Schimmel and Tim Lenaghan were forced by Joel to make snap staff decisions…keep vs who to let go. This was hard for them to do given that many of the staff are in various departments. Therefore, Mike and Tim did not have strong knowledge of good vs bad. They felt like that had to make random decisions vs well thought out. 3. WHAT DID YOU LIKE MOST ABOUT DIAMOND? Joe said what he liked most were the people. He also enjoyed being able to maximize sales. 4. WHAT DID YOU LIKE LEAST ABOUT DIAMOND? Joe said, long term, he always struggled with pay. He felt Diamond lost a lot of good people due to the low pay they provided. Further the pay did not always match the talent. 5. HOW WOULD YOU RATE THE FOLLOWING: EXCELLENT,GOOD,FAIR,POOR A. WORKING CONDITIONS IN YOUR DEPARTMENT – Excellent – Joe felt his team was well organized. B. ADVANCEMENT OPPORTUNITY – Good – Joe said he started in Order Entry, then moved to Retailer Services and ultimately moved into the role of Sales Manager and promoted to Director. Joe said his only resentment was not being made a Director sooner. He left the Company for a period of time to go to Funko. It was when he returned that he was made a Director. C. COMMUNICATION – Poor – Joe said he spoke quite a bit recently with Chuck Parker. Joe felt Chuck was trying very hard. He felt bad for Chuck as he wanted to give feedback but needs guidance from the new owners to let people know what is going on. D. BENEFITS – Good – Joe said he only participated in the 401K plan since he is on his wife's insurance. He also felt the vacation and sick time was generous. E. COMPENSATION AND PAY INCREASES – Joe said this was tough to answer. He felt it went through a lot of phases and, unfortunately, many people went without raises for a long time. Further, as stated above, many were underpaid for the work they did. F. OVERALL OPINION OF THE COMPANY – Good – Joe said he believed in Diamond. He said there was a reason he chose to return after he left for a period of time. DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE POLICY REMINDER THAT WAS PROVIDED TO YOU? Joe said he fully understood the Company's policy. OVERALL GENERAL COMMENTS: Joe said, going forward, he was concerned for those employees who were staying with Ad Populum. He hopes they have a future there, and hopes they are paid accordingly, particularly given the reduction in staff which will result in more work. Also, Joe pointed out that he was told he would be receiving a retention bonus of 10% of his salary, which he said was $9,300. He would like to know when he will receive this. ADDITIONAL: Steve Warble, Diamond Sales and Marketing Inventory Manager posted to Daniel Best's Substack, who has also posted these exit interviews, saying "For the record, my meeting with Joel was only about 5 minutes, but I deny ever saying that I thought Joel only wanted us for the warehouse. I did say that another employee who I won't name had said that exact thing. I am also furious that my name has been dragged into this without anyone asking me" also adding "I am not angry at you or any other journalist that quotes the legal documents, and there is no need to redact anything. I am not even angry at Joe Lunday, as I know he is an honest man and I am sure he stated the conversation as he remembered it. I am angry that those documents misrepresent my position and the conversation as I remember it." If there are any other people mentioned who want similar additional statements of added context, please let me know. DATE – May 30, 2025 POSITION – Sales Manager DATE HIRED – April 17, 2023 TERMINATION DATE – May 30, 2025 MAIN REASON FOR LEAVING – Trista left the Company due to accepting a position with Alliance Entertainment. Trista stressed, without being asked, that Mike Schimmel, former Vice President of Sales, did not poach her to join Alliance Entertainment. She said she had applied to Alliance Entertainment months ago to see if there were any Buyer positions. Trista said that Alliance Entertainment started "sniffing around" at the recent Toy Fair. She said they reached out to her to discuss joining their Company. 1. WHAT WILL YOUR ROLE BE IN YOUR NEW JOB? Trista's new role will be Director of Sales – Collectibles Division 2. WAS SALARY A CONSIDERATION? Trista said salary is always a consideration when determining future in a current role. That said, Trista was actually focused on the title, as she said her goal has always been on a new title to show growth. 3. WHAT DID YOU LIKE MOST ABOUT DIAMOND? Trista said she came to Diamond to learn and was proud to say she did. She has always had a passion for the market. She also loved taking care of small accounts. Trista also said she wished nothing but the best for "new" Diamond. And she said, "as silly as it sounds…she loved the name Diamond". 4. WHAT DID YOU LIKE LEAST ABOUT DIAMOND? Trista said communication lacked and seemed siloed, particularly over the last few months. She found it frustrating that information was not shared with employees. Instead, information was learned from Bleeding Cool and ICV2. Because information was on the internet, retailers contacted Trista and her team. However, they were not able to answer questions. 5. HOW WOULD YOU RATE THE FOLLOWING: EXCELLENT,GOOD,FAIR,POOR A. WORKING CONDITIONS IN YOUR DEPARTMENT – Good B. ADVANCEMENT OPPORTUNITY – Fair – As stated earlier, Trista was focused on titles. She said she came to Diamond with the hopes of becoming a Director, as this was a personal goal of hers. She did admit she could have communicated better so others knew what her goal was. C. COMMUNICATION – Poor – See above D. BENEFITS – Good E. COMPENSATION AND PAY INCREASES – Poor – Trista said she took a $40,000 pay cut to come to Diamond. She also felt the commission structure should be reevaluated. She felt the Sales Reps are clearly underpaid in this area for the work they do and sales that they make. F. OVERALL OPINION OF THE COMPANY – Good – Trista only wished the best for the future of the Company. She loved Diamond and what it did for small retailers. She said the bankruptcy was truly unfortunate and hoped the new owners were successful. Overall, Trista said everyone that she came into contact with was wonderful. She said it was hard to say goodbye. She appreciated the "family owned vibe" and was very grateful for the opportunity she had at Diamond. Trista also wanted it noted that she appreciated her recent interactions with Chuck Parker, President. She said he was so nice and felt bad for the position he had been put in. DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE POLICY REMINDER THAT WAS PROVIDED TO YOU? No – Fully understood DATE – May 30, 2025 POSITION – Business Development Manager DATE HIRED – June 10, 2024 TERMINATION DATE – May 30, 2025 MAIN REASON FOR LEAVING – Sadie she was leaving the Company due to accepting a position with another company. Sadie would not say where she was going or what her new role would be. (NOTE – per LinkedIn, Sadie is working for Alliance Entertainment as Collectible Sales) 1. WHAT WILL YOUR ROLE BE IN YOUR NEW JOB? See above 2. WAS SALARY A CONSIDERATION? No 3. WHAT DID YOU LIKE MOST ABOUT DIAMOND? Sadie said what she liked most about the Company was the product and the people. 4. WHAT DID YOU LIKE LEAST ABOUT DIAMOND? Sadie said what she liked least were the financial concerns. Sadie said she joined the Company in June 2024. Very shortly, thereafter, communication began about the cash flow concerns. That was very unsettling. 5. HOW WOULD YOU RATE THE FOLLOWING: EXCELLENT,GOOD,FAIR,POOR A. WORKING CONDITIONS IN YOUR DEPARTMENT – Good B. ADVANCEMENT OPPORTUNITY – NA – Sadie felt, because she had only been with the Company for just under a year, she could not answer this question. C. COMMUNICATION – Poor – Sadie felt communication across the companies was poor. She said she worked a lot with Diamond Select Toys & Collectibles, LLC (DST) and it was like pulling teeth to get them to respond to anything. D. BENEFITS – Good E. COMPENSATION AND PAY INCREASES – Sadie said she was happy with her compensation. F. OVERALL OPINION OF THE COMPANY – Good – Even with everything going on, Sadie said there were a lot of great things about the Company. That said, she felt there was zero infrastructure. DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE POLICY REMINDER THAT WAS PROVIDED TO YOU? No OVERALL GENERAL COMMENTS: Overall, Sadie said when the announcement about the bankruptcy came out, she could handle that. She was disappointed that with the lawsuits up to what is transpiring now, there is no communication. She was frustrated that nothing was shared about DST being shut down after the sale and with no plan in place for "what's next". Sadie interacted with DST on a regular basis. She felt she was left to pick up the pieces with no direction. Sadie said morale is awful and stressed that a Team Hall needs to take place, so people understand what is going on. Sadie also liked that the Company allowed employees to work remote. That said, her perspective was that many people took advantage of it. From day 1, Sadie said she could have listed names of people who should have been let go due to not working. Unfortunately, some of those people were still with the Company (Sadie did not provide names). DATE – May 30, 2025 POSITION – Executive Director of Applications Development DATE HIRED – August 28, 2023 TERMINATION DATE – May 30, 2025 MAIN REASON FOR LEAVING – Ryan left Diamond to accept a position with Alliance Entertainment. He will be their Vice President of Purchasing. Ryan said they contacted him to discuss a job offer. Ryan explained that he had been looking for a new job since the bankruptcy announcement was made in January 2025. He researched opportunities in a variety of industries. However, he stopped when he was asked to stay through the transition period. Ryan also said he was told by Tim Lenaghan, Chief Purchasing Officer, if he stayed, he would receive a retention bonus of $16,000. Ryan said he continued to check the court docket and saw that the court had approved the issuing of these. Based on what he read, Ryan strongly believes he is eligible for this and wanted to know when he could expect to receive it. 1. WHAT WILL YOUR ROLE BE IN YOUR NEW JOB? See above – Ryan was scheduled to begin his new job on Monday, June 2, 2025. Ryan also pointed out that he and Mike Schimmel, former Vice President of Sales, will be working in completely different departments. Further, Ryan made it clear that Mike did not contact him in an attempt to bring him to Alliance Entertainment. Ryan said he had run into someone at Alliance, which is how the communication began (he did not mention who the "someone" was). 2. WAS SALARY A CONSIDERATION? No 3. WHAT DID YOU LIKE MOST ABOUT DIAMOND? Ryan said he believed in Diamond. He said he had previously worked for Diamond, left to work for Bandai and then returned in 2023. He said he came back because he loved the concept of the different product available to different stores. He was very much focused on helping with the growth of the business and he truly loved the Company. Ryan also said the coolest thing about Diamond was he got to play in so many sandboxes…Japanese, Hasbro, small boutique, etc…it was truly gratifying. 4. WHAT DID YOU LIKE LEAST ABOUT DIAMOND? Ryan said what he liked least was the fact that the Company had to file for bankruptcy. 5. HOW WOULD YOU RATE THE FOLLOWING: EXCELLENT,GOOD,FAIR,POOR A. WORKING CONDITIONS IN YOUR DEPARTMENT – Good B. ADVANCEMENT OPPORTUNITY – Excellent – Ryan said for him personally, he was very fortunate for the opportunities he received. C. COMMUNICATION – Poor – Ryan was very disappointed in the lack of transparency with numbers and profitability. It made it tough to understand the financial aspect of the toy side of the business, as well as the lack of feedback on any progress. D. BENEFITS – Good E. COMPENSATION AND PAY INCREASES – Excellent – Ryan knew what his salary was when he joined and was very appreciative of his salary. That said, when he joined, he was told he would receive a bonus of 10-20% of sales, based on metrics. Unfortunately, that was never provided. He said when he asked Tim Lenaghan about this, Tim continued to push the topic down the road. Note – Below is the language from his offer letter. I pulled this to see what he was referring to: "The rate for this position will be $155,000.00, to be paid to you on a bi-weekly basis. Additionally, within six (6) months of your start date, we will jointly develop metrics to be used to evaluate a bonus of between 10-20% of this annual salary. $10,000 of this bonus will be provided to you as an initial signing bonus, to be paid to you with the first scheduled pay date, September 8, 2023, after joining the Company. Should you decide to terminate your employment during the first six (6) months of joining the Company, you will be required to return a prorated amount of the signing bonus (based on the months you leave before the end of the successful completion of six (6) months)." F. OVERALL OPINION OF THE COMPANY – Overall, Ryan was proud to be part of Diamond. He felt the Company fought the good fight. Diamond served an important purpose and Ryan strongly believed in it. DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE POLICY REMINDER THAT WAS PROVIDED TO YOU? Ryan said he completely understands the Company's policy and totally gets it. OVERALL GENERAL COMMENTS: Overall, Ryan said he intended to be with Diamond for a long time. He came back embracing the opportunity and felt he could help save the Company, as well as turnaround toys and collectibles.

Title: Circle applies for national trust bank license to expand USDC reserve custody
URL: https://cryptobriefing.com/circle-trust-bank-license-tokenized/
Time Published: 2025-06-30T20:37:26Z
Full Content:
Share this article The company’s move follows its June 5 IPO, which gave Circle an initial market cap of around $6 billion. With its stock now trading at $181, the company is currently valued at approximately $44 billion. The proposed entity, First National Digital Currency Bank, N.A., would enable Circle to directly custody USDC reserves and provide digital asset custody services to institutional clients, though it would not handle cash deposits or lending. “Establishing a national digital currency trust bank of this kind marks a significant milestone in our goal to build an internet financial system that is transparent, efficient and accessible,” Circle Co-Founder, Chairman and CEO Jeremy Allaire said in a press release. BlackRock and BNY Mellon currently manage and custody Circle’s USDC reserves. While the new trust bank would take over reserve management, Circle intends to maintain relationships with major banks for portions of its holdings. Allaire indicated the bank would concentrate on tokenized stocks and bonds rather than digital assets like Bitcoin or Ether. The expansion comes as lawmakers advance legislation regulating stablecoins. The bill, which passed the Senate and is expected to clear the House this summer, would require stablecoins to maintain liquid asset backing and provide monthly reserve disclosures. President Trump is anticipated to sign the measure into law. Several brokerages initiated coverage of Circle stock this week, with Barclays, Bernstein, and Canaccord issuing bullish ratings and price targets above $200. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs expressed concerns about the company’s valuation following its post-IPO stock price doubling. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Business FILE PHOTO: Circle logo is seen in this illustration taken March 31, 2023. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo Stablecoin firm Circle is applying to create a national trust bank in the U.S., a major move after its blockbuster IPO valued the company at nearly $18 billion earlier this month. If the charter is granted by the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, it would enable Circle to act as a custodian for its own reserves and hold crypto assets on behalf of institutional clients. Unlike traditional banks, the license would not allow Circle to take cash deposits or make loans. "Circle has long sought to seek the highest standards of trust, transparency, governance, compliance," CEO Jeremy Allaire told Reuters in an interview. "Becoming a publicly traded company is a significant part of that, becoming a national trust company is again a continuation of that." Circle's national trust bank entity would be called First National Digital Currency Bank, N.A.

If signed into law, the bill would require tokens to be backed by liquid assets and for issuers to publicly disclose the composition of their reserves on a monthly basis.The Senate passed the bill earlier this month, and the House of Representatives is poised to pass the legislation early this summer. U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to sign the bill into law. He has sought to overhaul cryptocurrency regulation after courting cash from the industry during his presidential campaign.

Title: Dairy, meat lead surge in food prices as shoppers feel the pinch

Food prices have soared at NZ supermarkets. Photo / RNZ By Louise Ternouth of RNZ Whether it is a block of butter or cheese, a kilogram of mince, a dozen eggs or a cooked chook, food prices have gone up rapidly. The latest Stats NZ figures show that in the past 12 months, food prices have gone up 4.4% – the highest increase since December 2023. Over the past three years, RNZ’s Checkpoint has been tracking a weekly shop from the same suburb at a Woolworths and Pak’nSave supermarket to see just how much things have gone up at the checkout. Some of the results are more eye-watering than mouth-watering. For over three years, Checkpoint has tracked the cost of 36 items likely to be in a household’s trolley. In May 2022, a shopping trip to Woolworths Greenlane cost $238 and $217 at Pak’nSave Royal Oak. Today, those same items at Woolworths have shot up to $305 – an extra $67 at the checkout. At Pak’nSave the items now cost $270, an extra $53. Compared to 2022, seasonal vegetables like carrots and cabbage were cheaper. Other items that had come down slightly or stayed the same were Watties baked beans, plain flour, Mightyfresh wheatmeal toast bread and diced tomatoes. But they were mostly exceptions, most of the items on the shopping list cost more. Some shoppers told Checkpoint they have noticed an increase on some items in particular. “Olive oil is really expensive and eggs,” said one shopper. “Dairy items I’ve noticed but even just general fresh fruit and vege.” Others said meat was on the list. Unsurprisingly, dairy had one of the biggest jumps. At both supermarkets you still could not get a 1kg block of cheese for $10 or less. Though 1kg is now $1 cheaper at Woolworths for $12.49. At Pak’nSave a 1kg block stayed much the same at $11.89. Two litres of standard blue top milk were sitting at just under $5 at both supermarkets. In 2022, a 500g block of Woolworths branded butter cost $5.80, now a whopping $8.50. At Pak’nSave it was a similar story, in 2022 it was $5.70 for a Pams 500g block, now $8.30. One shopper said their family uses a lot of butter and they were feeling the pinch, “It’s been absolutely ridiculous it’s almost $10.” Others said they bought butter in bulk from Costco to save money “to buy cheaper New Zealand butter in bulk and freeze it rather than buying at the supermarkets”. A 50 box of Twinning’s Earl Grey tea more than doubled in price at Pak’nSave to $7.89. As for a dozen barn eggs, those more than doubled at Pak’nSave to $9.59 and $9.50 at Woolworths. The humble beef mince now not so humble at 1kg used to cost $11.99 at Pak’nSave, now $18.99. At Countdown, it was up from $14.90 in 2022 to $23.80 now. For some, it is now a luxury among other items they are going without. “Probably meat products and dairy,” said one shopper. Others were also leaving those products on the shelves and opting for a butter “blend” and no brand versions. One man said snacks were off the shopping list. “Snack bars and extra things you’d put into kids lunches.” One woman said she had left her broccoli and cauliflower out of the shop. Washing and toiletry products also came out far more expensive.

ByJason Kirsch ByJason Kirsch, Contributor. The combination of attractive yields, reasonable valuations, and strong dividend safety scores makes ... More this diversified selection an ideal choice for building a robust income-generating portfolio in the current market environment. The dividend investing landscape continues to evolve as we move through 2025, presenting both opportunities and challenges for income-focused investors. With the upward trend in interest rates stabilizing (and perhaps soon declining) and economic uncertainty persisting in various sectors, dividend stocks remain a cornerstone strategy for building wealth while generating steady cash flow. The current market environment has created compelling entry points across multiple industries, from energy infrastructure to consumer staples. This article examines five carefully selected dividend-paying stocks that offer attractive yields, strong fundamentals and the potential for long-term capital appreciation. Each selection has been evaluated based on dividend safety (according to the ratings of Dividend.com), business model sustainability, and current valuation metrics to provide readers with actionable investment opportunities for the remainder of 2025. The selection process for these dividend stocks involved a comprehensive analysis of multiple factors, beyond just yield percentage. Primary consideration was given to dividend safety scores (as scored by Dividend.com), which evaluate a company's ability to maintain and potentially grow its dividend payments over time. Companies with scores above 3.0 were prioritized, indicating a reasonable level of confidence in the sustainability of their dividends. Market capitalization, current valuation relative to analyst price targets and year-to-date performance were also critical factors in the evaluation process. Special attention was paid to companies trading below their recommended price targets, suggesting potential upside beyond the dividend yield. The final selections represent a diversified mix of sectors, including energy infrastructure, real estate, consumer goods, utilities and pharmaceuticals, providing investors with exposure to different economic drivers while maintaining focus on income generation. Enterprise Products Partners stands as one of North America's largest midstream energy companies, operating an extensive network of pipelines, storage facilities and processing plants across the United States. The master limited partnership structure provides tax advantages while focusing on the critical infrastructure that connects energy producers with end markets. Currently trading at $31.09 per share with a market capitalization of $67.50 billion, EPD represents a substantial player in the energy infrastructure space. The company's business model centers on fee-based contracts rather than commodity price exposure, providing more predictable cash flows compared to upstream energy companies. With a dividend safety score of 4.2, EPD demonstrates strong fundamentals supporting its generous 6.88% yield. The partnership has maintained its distribution for over 25 years, showcasing remarkable consistency even through challenging energy market cycles. Enterprise Products Partners offers compelling value at current levels, trading significantly above the analyst price recommendation of $25.77, yet still providing exceptional income potential. The 6.88% yield represents one of the highest sustainable yields available from a large-cap energy infrastructure company, supported by diversified cash flows from natural gas, crude oil and petrochemical transportation services. The company's strategic positioning benefits from North America's continued growth in energy production and the ongoing need for midstream infrastructure. Recent expansion projects and strategic acquisitions have strengthened EPD's competitive moat while providing additional growth catalysts. Despite modest year-to-date returns of 1.44%, the combination of high current income and potential for distribution growth makes EPD attractive for income-focused investors seeking energy sector exposure. Mid-America Apartment Communities operates as a real estate investment trust, specializing in multifamily residential properties across the Sun Belt region of the United States. With a market capitalization of $17.46 billion and a current share price of $147.46, MAA represents a significant player in the apartment rental market. The company's portfolio comprises high-quality apartment communities in growing metropolitan areas, which benefit from favorable demographic trends and regional economic expansion. The REIT structure requires MAA to distribute at least 90% of its taxable income to shareholders, supporting its current 4.11% dividend yield with a forward dividend of $6.06 per share. While the dividend safety score of 3.4 indicates moderate risk, the company's focus on Sunbelt markets, characterized by strong job growth and population migration, provides fundamental support for rental demand and pricing power. Mid-America Apartment Communities presents an attractive opportunity in the residential real estate sector, particularly given the ongoing housing shortage and demographic trends favoring rental properties. The company's geographic focus on high-growth Sunbelt markets positions it to benefit from continued population migration from higher-cost regions, supporting both occupancy rates and rental growth potential. Trading above the analyst price recommendation of $136.93, MAA's current valuation reflects market recognition of its quality portfolio and strategic positioning. Despite a modest year-to-date decline of 1.56%, the company's consistent dividend payments and exposure to essential housing needs provide defensive characteristics. The combination of steady income and potential for capital appreciation as interest rates stabilize makes MAA suitable for investors seeking real estate exposure with reliable dividend income. PepsiCo is among the world's largest food and beverage companies, operating iconic brands such as Pepsi, Frito-Lay, Tropicana and Quaker Oats. With a massive market capitalization of $179.68 billion and a current trading price of $128.22, PEP represents a blue-chip investment in the consumer staples sector with a global reach. The company's diversified portfolio spans beverages, snacks and food products, providing multiple revenue streams and geographic diversification. The dividend safety score of 3.7 reflects PEP's strong balance sheet and consistent cash generation capabilities, which support its current yield of 4.44% with a forward dividend of $5.69 per share. As a Dividend Aristocrat with over 50 years of consecutive dividend increases, PepsiCo demonstrates an exceptional commitment to returning capital to shareholders while investing in business growth and innovation. PepsiCo presents exceptional value at current levels, trading significantly below the analyst price recommendation of $181.54, suggesting substantial upside potential beyond the attractive dividend yield. The year-to-date decline of around 11% has created an opportunity to acquire shares of this high-quality consumer staples company at a discount to fair value estimates. The company's defensive business model provides stability during economic uncertainty, as consumers continue purchasing food and beverages regardless of economic conditions. Recent strategic initiatives focusing on healthier product offerings and sustainability align with evolving consumer preferences while supporting long-term growth prospects. The combination of a discounted valuation, reliable dividend growth history and defensive characteristics makes PEP particularly attractive for conservative dividend investors seeking quality at reasonable prices. UGI Corporation operates as a diversified energy company providing natural gas and electric utility services, propane distribution and energy marketing across the United States and internationally. With a market capitalization of $7.82 billion and a current share price of $36.05, UGI represents a mid-cap utility investment with both regulated and unregulated business segments. The company's operations span utility services in Pennsylvania, propane distribution through AmeriGas and international energy operations. The impressive dividend safety score of 4.4 reflects UGI's stable cash flows from regulated utility operations and established propane distribution network. Currently yielding 4.16% with a forward dividend of $1.50 per share, UGI offers an attractive income stream while maintaining financial flexibility for growth investments and infrastructure improvements. UGI Corporation has delivered exceptional performance with year-to-date returns of 32.09%, yet still offers compelling value for dividend-focused investors. The company's diversified business model provides multiple growth drivers, including regulated utility rate increases, expansion opportunities in propane distribution, and renewable energy initiatives. Trading above the analyst price recommendation of $28.28, UGI's recent performance reflects market recognition of its strategic positioning and execution capabilities. The utility sector's defensive characteristics, combined with UGI's growth initiatives in renewable energy and infrastructure modernization, provide both stability and upside potential. The strong dividend safety score and consistent payment history make UGI suitable for investors seeking utility sector exposure with above-average growth prospects. AbbVie operates as a global biopharmaceutical company, focusing on the development and commercialization of advanced therapies across immunology, oncology, neuroscience and other therapeutic areas. With a substantial market capitalization of $327.76 billion and current trading price of $186.79, ABBV represents one of the largest pharmaceutical companies globally. The company's portfolio includes blockbuster drugs such as Humira, Skyrizi and Rinvoq, generating substantial cash flows to support dividend payments and research and development investments. The dividend safety score of 4.3 reflects AbbVie's strong financial position and diversified revenue base, supporting its current yield of 3.51% with a forward dividend of $6.56 per share. Despite facing patent expirations on key products, the company's robust pipeline and strategic acquisitions provide confidence in long-term cash flow generation and dividend sustainability. AbbVie presents an attractive value proposition, trading near the analyst price recommendation of $189.65, with a solid year-to-date performance of 6.39%, demonstrating market confidence in the company's strategic direction. The pharmaceutical giant's focus on high-growth therapeutic areas and strong pipeline development provides multiple catalysts for future growth beyond current dividend income. The company's successful navigation of Humira's patent cliff, achieved through new product launches and strategic positioning, demonstrates management's ability to adapt to industry challenges. Recent acquisitions and pipeline developments in oncology and immunology support long-term growth prospects while maintaining the financial strength necessary for consistent dividend payments. The combination of current income, growth potential and defensive characteristics of the healthcare sector makes ABBV suitable for investors seeking pharmaceutical exposure with reliable dividend income. Bottom Line These five dividend stocks represent compelling opportunities across diverse sectors, each offering unique advantages for income-focused investors in July 2025. Enterprise Products Partners provides exceptional yield from energy infrastructure, while Mid-America Apartment Communities offers real estate exposure with Sunbelt growth potential. PepsiCo presents blue-chip quality at discounted valuations, UGI combines utility stability with growth initiatives, and AbbVie delivers pharmaceutical innovation with strong dividend coverage. The combination of attractive yields, reasonable valuations, and strong dividend safety scores makes this diversified selection an ideal choice for building a robust income-generating portfolio in the current market environment.

Title: 5 Top Undervalued Stocks To Buy For July 2025

ByJason Kirsch ByJason Kirsch, Contributor. The combination of reasonable valuations, strong competitive positions and clear catalysts for ... More future value recognition makes this group particularly attractive for long-term investors willing to be patient while markets recognize their intrinsic worth. The stock market has always been a realm where patience meets opportunity, and July 2025 presents a particularly compelling landscape for value-oriented investors. While growth stocks continue to dominate headlines, a careful examination of market fundamentals reveals several high-quality companies trading at attractive valuations relative to their intrinsic worth. These opportunities often emerge when market sentiment temporarily overshadows solid business fundamentals, creating windows for astute investors to acquire shares of profitable enterprises at discounted prices. In this comprehensive analysis, we'll explore five exceptional companies that currently trade below their fair value, offering investors the potential for substantial returns as markets eventually recognize their true worth. Each selection represents a different sector and investment thesis, providing diversification opportunities while maintaining a focus on companies with strong competitive positions, healthy balance sheets and clear paths to future growth. These aren't speculative plays or turnaround stories; instead, they are established businesses that have temporarily fallen out of favor with the broader market. Selection methodology combines traditional value investing principles with modern financial analysis to identify companies trading below their intrinsic value. The primary screening criteria focused on companies with price-to-earnings ratios significantly below their historical averages and current share prices trading near or below key moving averages, indicating potential technical support levels. I specifically sought companies where the current stock price reflects pessimism that appears disconnected from underlying business performance. Beyond valuation metrics, each selected company demonstrates strong operational fundamentals, including consistent profitability, manageable debt levels and competitive advantages within their respective industries. Businesses with predictable cash flows, experienced management teams and clear catalysts that could drive future value recognition were prioritized. The analysis also considered macroeconomic factors, industry trends and company-specific developments that might influence near-term performance while maintaining focus on long-term value creation potential. Johnson & Johnson stands as one of the world's most diversified healthcare conglomerates, operating across three primary segments that have demonstrated remarkable resilience through various economic cycles. The company's pharmaceutical division generates the majority of revenue through innovative treatments in oncology, immunology and infectious diseases, while its medical devices segment serves hospitals and surgical centers globally. The consumer products division, though recently spun off, historically provided stable cash flows through trusted brands like Tylenol, Band-Aid and Neutrogena. Currently trading at approximately $152 per share with a market capitalization of $425 billion, JNJ operates in the healthcare sector, boasting a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 15.8, which is significantly below its five-year average of 18.2. The company maintains an impressive dividend track record, having increased payments for 62 consecutive years, which has earned it Dividend King status. With earnings per share of $10.15 and a robust pipeline of pharmaceutical products in development, Johnson & Johnson presents compelling value characteristics that have attracted long-term investors for decades. Johnson & Johnson's current valuation reflects temporary headwinds rather than fundamental deterioration in its business model. The stock trades near its 200-day moving average of $158, suggesting technical support at current levels, while the pharmaceutical pipeline continues to generate promising clinical trial results. Recent concerns about litigation costs and patent expirations have created selling pressure, but these challenges appear manageable given the company's financial strength and diversified revenue streams. The company's pharmaceutical division continues to launch innovative treatments, with several blockbuster drugs in late-stage development that are expected to drive significant revenue growth over the next five years. Management's focus on high-margin pharmaceutical products, combined with strategic acquisitions and partnerships, positions JNJ to capitalize on demographic trends, including aging populations and increased global healthcare spending. The current dividend yield of 3.2% offers an attractive income while investors await the market's recognition of the company's intrinsic value, making it an ideal core holding for value-oriented portfolios. Berkshire Hathaway represents Warren Buffett's masterpiece in value creation, operating as a diversified conglomerate with wholly owned subsidiaries spanning the insurance, energy, manufacturing and retail sectors. The company's insurance operations, including GEICO and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, generate substantial float that management deploys into profitable investments and acquisitions. Beyond insurance, Berkshire owns iconic American businesses, including BNSF Railway, Berkshire Hathaway Energy and numerous manufacturing companies that benefit from strong competitive positions and experienced management teams. Trading at approximately $485 per share for Class B shares, Berkshire Hathaway maintains a price-to-earnings ratio of 17.1, which is reasonable for a company of its quality and diversification. The conglomerate generates earnings per share of $22.80 across its various operating segments, though this figure can fluctuate significantly based on investment gains and losses. Unlike most large corporations, Berkshire pays no dividend; instead, it reinvests all profits in growing the business and building shareholder value through capital appreciation and strategic acquisitions. Berkshire Hathaway's current valuation appears attractive relative to the sum of its parts, with the stock trading below its intrinsic value as calculated by many analysts who closely follow the company. The shares recently touched their 50-day moving average of $385, providing a potential entry point for investors seeking exposure to Buffett's investment acumen and the company's diversified business model. Market concerns about succession planning and the advanced age of key leadership have created temporary selling pressure, but these concerns overlook the deep bench of talented managers throughout the organization. The company's massive cash position, currently exceeding $150 billion, provides tremendous flexibility for opportunistic investments and acquisitions during market downturns. Berkshire's operating businesses continue to generate strong cash flows, while the investment portfolio benefits from positions in high-quality companies like Apple, Bank of America and Coca-Cola. The combination of defensive characteristics during economic uncertainty and offensive capabilities during market dislocations makes Berkshire Hathaway an exceptional value proposition for investors seeking long-term wealth preservation and growth. Pfizer Inc. operates as one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies, developing and manufacturing prescription medicines and vaccines that address critical health needs across diverse therapeutic areas. The company's portfolio encompasses treatments for oncology, rare diseases, inflammation and infectious diseases, with a particular strength in areas that require significant research and development investments. Pfizer's recent success with COVID-19 vaccines and treatments has demonstrated its ability to develop and commercialize innovative therapies rapidly. However, this success has also created challenging comparisons as pandemic-related revenues normalize. Currently priced at approximately $24 per share, with a market capitalization of $137 billion, Pfizer trades in the healthcare sector, boasting a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 11.2, which is well below historical averages and those of its peer companies. The stock offers an attractive dividend yield of 5.8%, supported by earnings per share of $2.84 and a commitment to returning capital to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. The company's extensive pipeline includes numerous late-stage candidates that could drive future growth, while its established products continue to generate substantial cash flows to fund research and development activities. Pfizer's current valuation reflects excessive pessimism about the company's post-pandemic prospects, creating an attractive entry point for value investors willing to look beyond near-term headwinds. The stock trades near its 52-week low and below its 200-day moving average of $35, suggesting that negative sentiment has been fully reflected in the share price. While COVID-related revenues will inevitably decline, the company's underlying pharmaceutical business remains robust, with several promising drug candidates approaching commercialization that could offset this revenue decline. The pharmaceutical industry's defensive characteristics become particularly valuable during economic uncertainty, as healthcare spending tends to remain stable regardless of broader economic conditions. Pfizer's strong balance sheet, experienced management team, and commitment to innovation position the company to capitalize on demographic trends including aging populations and increased prevalence of chronic diseases. The generous dividend yield offers an attractive income while investors await the market's recognition of Pfizer's diversified pharmaceutical portfolio and promising pipeline developments. Intel Corporation is a pioneer in the semiconductor industry, designing and manufacturing microprocessors and related technologies that power personal computers, data centers and emerging applications, including artificial intelligence and autonomous vehicles. The company's dominant position in central processing units has faced increased competition in recent years, particularly from Advanced Micro Devices and companies developing ARM-based processors, forcing Intel to invest heavily in manufacturing capabilities and product development. Despite these challenges, Intel maintains significant competitive advantages, including advanced manufacturing processes, extensive intellectual property portfolios and long-standing relationships with major technology companies. Trading at approximately $22 per share with a market capitalization of $195 billion, Intel operates in the technology sector, boasting a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 9.8, which represents a significant discount to its historical valuations and those of many of its technology peers. The company generates earnings per share of $4.92 while maintaining a dividend yield of 2.1%, demonstrating management's confidence in future cash flow generation. Intel's substantial investments in new manufacturing facilities and research and development activities position the company to compete effectively in next-generation semiconductor technologies. However, these investments have put pressure on near-term profitability. Intel's current valuation appears to reflect worst-case scenarios regarding the company's competitive position, creating potential upside for investors willing to bet on the company's turnaround efforts. The stock trades below its 200-day moving average of $46, indicating technical weakness that may have created an attractive entry point for long-term investors. Recent management changes and strategic initiatives, including significant investments in manufacturing capacity and partnerships with government entities, indicate that Intel is taking the necessary steps to address competitive challenges and capitalize on the growing demand for semiconductors. The global semiconductor shortage and increasing digitization trends support long-term demand for Intel's products, while government initiatives to strengthen domestic semiconductor manufacturing provide additional tailwinds. Intel's foundry services business represents a significant growth opportunity as companies seek alternatives to Asian manufacturing, particularly given geopolitical tensions and supply chain concerns. The combination of an attractive valuation, a defensive dividend yield and potential catalysts from new product launches and manufacturing investments makes Intel a compelling value proposition for patient investors willing to wait for the company's strategic initiatives to yield results. The Coca-Cola Company operates as the world's largest beverage company, manufacturing and distributing non-alcoholic beverages across more than 200 countries and territories through an extensive network of bottling partners and distributors. The company's portfolio includes iconic brands such as Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fanta and Dasani, as well as newer additions in categories including energy drinks, sports beverages and premium waters. Coca-Cola's business model focuses on concentrate production and brand marketing, while bottling partners handle manufacturing and distribution, creating an asset-light structure that generates attractive returns on invested capital. Currently valued at approximately $69 per share with a market capitalization of $300 billion, Coca-Cola operates in the consumer staples sector with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 28.2, which is reasonable for a company with such strong brand recognition and global reach. The stock yields $2.69 per share and offers a dividend yield of 2.9%, supported by 62 consecutive years of dividend increases that have made Coca-Cola a favorite among income-focused investors. The company's global presence and diverse product portfolio provide natural hedges against regional economic fluctuations and changing consumer preferences. Coca-Cola's current trading level near $69 represents attractive value for a company with such enduring competitive advantages and predictable cash flows. The stock recently found support at its 100-day moving average of $63, suggesting technical strength despite broader market volatility. While concerns about health consciousness and sugar consumption have pressured beverage companies, Coca-Cola has successfully diversified its portfolio to include low-calorie and no-calorie options that address changing consumer preferences without sacrificing brand loyalty or pricing power. The company's global footprint presents significant opportunities for growth in emerging markets, where rising incomes and urbanization are driving increased demand for beverages. Coca-Cola's unmatched distribution network and brand recognition create substantial barriers to entry, protecting its market share and pricing power across diverse geographic markets. The reliable dividend growth history, combined with the company's ability to generate consistent cash flows regardless of economic conditions, makes Coca-Cola an ideal core holding for investors seeking stability and income in uncertain market environments. Bottom Line These five undervalued stocks represent compelling opportunities for investors seeking quality companies at attractive prices in July 2025. Each selection offers a different risk-reward profile and sector exposure, ranging from Johnson & Johnson's healthcare stability to Intel's technology turnaround potential. The combination of reasonable valuations, strong competitive positions and clear catalysts for future value recognition makes this group particularly attractive for long-term investors willing to be patient while markets recognize their intrinsic worth. While short-term volatility remains possible, the fundamental strength of these businesses, combined with their current attractive valuations, suggests significant upside potential for investors who can maintain a long-term perspective.

Title: Coffee Break: OpenAI as The Money Pit

Time Published: 2025-06-30T18:00:30Z

OpenAI has fatally flawed finances which reveal a company that presents no serious threat to any of the tech incumbents, including Google. In the (excellent) comments to my post last Monday on Google’s inexplicable-to-me decision to risk their search monopoly by going all-in on LLM AI one from Hickory exposed that I had failed to make a key point: ChatGPT is not a threat to replace Google as the leader in search because OpenAI loses money on every ChatGPT prompt and is trying to make it up in volume. Let’s put aside the claims about LLMs having reasoning ability for now and focus on the bullish business case for ChatGPT as a killer app that threatens Google search. Cal Newport lays out that case: The application that has… leaped ahead to become the most exciting and popular use of these tools is smart search. If you have a question, instead of turning to Google you can query a new version of ChatGPT or Claude. These models can search the web to gather information, but unlike a traditional search engine, they can also process the information they find and summarize for you only what you care about. Want the information presented in a particular format, like a spreadsheet or a chart? A high-end model like GPT-4o can do this for you as well, saving even more extra steps. Smart search has become the first killer app of the generative AI era because, like any good killer app, it takes an activity most people already do all the time — typing search queries into web sites — and provides a substantially, almost magically better experience. This feels similar to electronic spreadsheets conquering paper ledger books or email immediately replacing voice mail and fax. I would estimate that around 90% of the examples I see online right now from people exclaiming over the potential of AI are people conducting smart searches. This behavioral shift is appearing in the data. A recent survey conducted by Future found that 27% of US-based respondents had used AI tools such as ChatGPT instead of a traditional search engine. From an economic perspective, this shift matters. Earlier this month, the stock price for Alphabet, the parent company for Google, fell after an Apple executive revealed that Google searches through the Safari web browser had decreased over the previous two months, likely due to the increased use of AI tools. Keep in mind, web search is a massive business, with Google earning over $175 billion from search ads in 2023 alone. In my opinion, becoming the new Google Search is likely the best bet for a company like OpenAI to achieve profitability… That’s a seemingly reasonable claim, but doesn’t hold up after a look into OpenAI’s business plans for ChatGPT. Despite their seeming threat to Google search, OpenAI is the kind of self-defeating competition no monopolist should fear, much less destroy its proven business model to compete with. The New York Times put it pretty well last September: pic.twitter.com/As1hKPAqtB — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) June 30, 2025 Morningstar summed up the NYT’s reporting well: Financial documents reviewed by The New York Times reveal a company burning through cash at an alarming rate, raising questions about the sustainability of its current trajectory and the potential risks of prioritizing break-neck expansion over responsible AI development. Let’s discuss some of the key points from the New York Times report, which was published last week before the funding announcement: — OpenAI’s monthly revenue hit $300 million in August 2024, a 1,700% increase since early 2023. — The company expects to generate around $3.7 billion in annual sales this year and anticipates revenue ballooning to $11.6 billion in 2025. — Despite rising revenues, OpenAI predicts a loss of about $5 billion. this year due to high operational costs, biggest of which is the cost of computing power it gets through its partnership with Microsoft. — OpenAI predicts its revenue will hit $100 billion in 2029. The Times report raises serious questions about OpenAI’s sustainability and realistic goals. The company’s monthly revenue growth from early 2023 to August 2024 is nothing short of explosive; however, the long-term projection of $100 billion in revenue by 2029 appears unrealistic. This figure would require sustaining an average annual growth rate of more than 90% for five consecutive years (93.3% to be precise, from an expected $3.7 billion in 2024 to $100 billion in 2029), a feat rarely achieved in the tech industry, especially for a company already operating at such a large scale. While impressive on paper, said projections may be masking underlying financial challenges and setting expectations that could be difficult, if not impossible, to meet. Financial challenges become even more apparent given the current expense structure in relation to projected growth. It’s crucial to note that, even if it reaches the projected revenue targets, OpenAI is not merely failing to break even in 2024 – it’s losing significantly more money than it’s generating. This means that before OpenAI can even consider achieving its ambitious growth targets, it must first find a way to become profitable, or at the very least, break even. Bryan McMahon pointed out the massive financial risk posed by the stock market bubble driven by faith in LLMs or as he calls it Generative AI: Venture capital (VC) funds, drunk on a decade of “growth at all costs,” have poured about $200 billion into generative AI. Making matters worse, the stock market’s bull run is deeply dependent on the growth of the Big Tech companies fueling the AI bubble. In 2023, 71 percent of the total gains in the S&P 500 were attributable to the “Magnificent Seven”—Apple, Nvidia, Tesla, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft—all of which are among the biggest spenders on AI. Just four—Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta—combined for $246 billion of capital expenditure in 2024 to support the AI build-out. Goldman Sachs expects Big Tech to spend over $1 trillion on chips and data centers to power AI over the next five years. Yet OpenAI, the current market leader, expects to lose $5 billion this year, and its annual losses to swell to $11 billion by 2026. If the AI bubble bursts, it not only threatens to wipe out VC firms in the Valley but also blow a gaping hole in the public markets and cause an economy-wide meltdown. But wait it gets worse, per Ed Zitron: It seems, from even a cursory glance, that OpenAI’s costs are increasing dramatically. The Information reported earlier in the year that OpenAI projects to spend $13 billion on compute with Microsoft alone in 2025, nearly tripling what it spent in total on compute in 2024 ($5 billion). This suggests that OpenAI’s costs are skyrocketing, and that was before the launch of its new image generator which led to multiple complaints from Altman about a lack of available GPUs, leading to OpenAI’s CEO saying to expect “stuff to break” and delays in new products. Nevertheless, even if we assume OpenAI factored in the compute increases into its projections, it still expects to pay Microsoft $13 billion for compute this year. This number, however, doesn’t include the $12.9 billion five-year-long compute deal signed with CoreWeave, a deal that was a result of Microsoft declining to pick up the option to buy said compute itself. Payments for this deal, according to The Information, start in October 2025, and assuming that it’s evenly paid (the terms of these contracts are generally secret, even in the case of public companies), this would still amount to roughly $2.38 billion a year. I’ll let the Entertainment Strategy Guy nail the profitability coffin shut: By all accounts, right now, OpenAI is losing money. Like literally billions of dollars. The energy costs of LLMs are enormous. If they’re pricing their services below market value, trying to gain market share, then we don’t know if AI can make money for the service it’s providing right now. Two factors are driving these costs. First, the memory an AI program uses (either the more data it stores as it thinks or the longer it thinks about a problem/answer), the more it costs the AI companies in compute. Second, the AI companies are racing to build next-generation models that will require even more training, which means higher costs. And the salaries for top AI engineers/scientists are also sky-rocketing up. This is why I’m somewhat skeptical about the sorts of things that OpenAI is promising that AI can do (like become your universal assistant that remembers everything about you); it seems like an absolute memory boondoggle of monumental proportions. How much energy will it take for AI to analyze my whole life if it’s already too taxing for an LLM to remember how to format links properly? But wait, there’s even more bad news that just dropped. OpenAI is now in a bidding war for talent with some of the stupidest money out there, Mark Zuckerberg of Meta: …competition for top AI researchers is heating up in Silicon Valley. Zuckerberg has been particularly aggressive in his approach, offering $100 million signing bonuses to some OpenAI staffers, according to comments Altman made on a podcast with his brother, Jack Altman. Multiple sources at OpenAI with direct knowledge of the offers confirmed the number. The Meta CEO has also been personally reaching out to potential recruits, according to the Wall Street Journal. “Over the past month, Meta has been aggressively building out their new AI effort, and has repeatedly (and mostly unsuccessfully) tried to recruit some of our strongest talent with comp-focused packages,” Chen wrote on Slack. And speaking of dumb money and OpenAI, Softbank is involved, although maybe not as much as reported: (In April) OpenAI closed “the largest private tech funding round in history,” where it “raised” an astonishing “$40 billion,” and the reason that I’ve put quotation marks around it is that OpenAI has only raised $10 billion of the $40 billion, with the rest arriving by “the end of the year.” The remaining $30 billion — $20 billion of which will (allegedly) be provided by SoftBank — is partially contingent on OpenAI’s conversion from a non-profit to a for-profit by the end of 2025, and if it fails, SoftBank will only give OpenAI a further $20 billion. The round also valued OpenAI at $300 billion. And things might not be going so well with Softbank because OpenAI is now talking to even dumber, and much more dangerous, money: Saudi Arabia. And if you’ve ever paid attention to the actual words coming out of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s mouth, you’ll realize Altman attracting dumb money is just a case of birds of a feather flocking together. Ed Zitron chronicles some of the stupid in his latest newsletter: Here is but one of the trenchant insights from Sam Altman in his agonizing 37-minute-long podcast conversation with his brother Jack Altman from last week: “I think there will be incredible other products. There will be crazy new social experiences. There will be, like, Google Docs style AI workflows that are just way more productive. You’ll start to see, you’ll have these virtual employees, but the thing that I think will be most impactful on that five to ten year timeframe is AI will actually discover new science.” When asked why he believes AI will “discover new science,” Altman says that “I think we’ve cracked reasoning in the models,” adding that “we’ve a long way to go,” and that he “think[s] we know what to do,” adding that OpenAI’s o3 model “is already pretty smart,” and that he’s heard people say “wow, this is like a good PHD.” That’s the entire answer! It’s complete nonsense! Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, a company allegedly worth $300 billion to venture capitalists and SoftBank, kind of sounds like a huge idiot! Ed also roasts Alphabet/Google’s Sundar Pichai: Sundar Pichai, when asked one of Nilay Patel’s patented 100-word-plus-questions about Jony Ive and Sam Altman’s new (and likely heavily delayed) hardware startup: I think AI is going to be bigger than the internet. There are going to be companies, products, and categories created that we aren’t aware of today. I think the future looks exciting. I think there’s a lot of opportunity to innovate around hardware form factors at this moment with this platform shift. I’m looking forward to seeing what they do. We are going to be doing a lot as well. I think it’s an exciting time to be a consumer, it’s an exciting time to be a developer. I’m looking forward to it. The fuck are you on about, Sundar? Your answer to a question about whether you anticipate more competition is to say “yeah I think people are gonna make shit we haven’t come up with and uhh, hardware, can’t wait!” While I think Pichai is likely a little smarter than Altman, in the same way that Satya Nadella is a little smarter than Pichai, and in the same way that a golden retriever is smarter than a chihuahua. That said, none of these men are superintelligences, nor, when pressed, do they ever seem to have any actual answers. If ChatGPT were such an existential threat to Google’s search monopoly that Alphabet’s only option was risking the empire to beat OpenAI in the LLM race, it would be profitable or at least have a plausible path to profitability. Sam Altman being a blithering idiot isn’t really the disadvantage it should be since he’s going up against competition like Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, and Sundar Pichai. This isn’t like Uber vs. the local taxi incumbents in the 2010s where despite Uber’s never going to be profitable business model they were able to take over in many markets because OpenAI does not have a huge cash advantage over Alphabet and never will. Next week we’ll look at at Meta, the absolute stupidest tech money around — a company that put Dana White of the Ultimate Fighting Championship on its board. And because I promised I’d get around to this, regarding LLMs ability to “reason” it was thoroughly debunked last October by six researchers from Apple in a paper called “GSM-Symbolic: Understanding the Limitations of Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models.” When the paper was released the senior author, Mehrdad Farajtabar, tweeted that, ““we found no evidence of formal reasoning in language models …. Their behavior is better explained by sophisticated pattern matching—so fragile, in fact, that changing names can alter results by ~10%!” Veteran political operative and corporate media professional. One of the Ed Zitron pieces you cited: https://www.wheresyoured.at/openai-is-a-systemic-risk-to-the-tech-industry-2/ while quite long, goes deep into the details of OpenAI’s present and future financing and how they expect to meet their financial commitments over the next two or three years. It left me in a funk for several days, not because I care a whit about OpenAI, but because the business press has now apparently become so delusional and dishonest that it’s hard to believe anything or even see how things can go on. After reading this, I have to conclude that OpenAI/Softbank is definitely, positively going to go out of business in the next two or three years. How much of the rest of the economy they take down with it is perhaps more worrisome. This is the same business press that covered Uber and Lyft breathlessly for 15 years as Uber burnt through money.. because they wanted the businesses to succeed. The will do the same thing with OpenAI until they magically find profit. Kurtismayfield, yea but I don’t think the overall economy has the runway that Uber had in the 2010s. Gonna be some reality checks sooner rather than later. Yea, the LLM bubble popping might be the end of the “Everything Bubble” that George Soros wrote a whole book about 20 years ago As a complement to this piece, I recommend this lengthy interview with technology journalist Karen Hao about her recent book “Empire of AI: Dreams and Nightmares in Sam Altman’s OpenAI”. thanks! I will check it out. Agreed. It was excellent. I’m not so sure that taking over search or even making money are the real goals of these people. We had a story in Links today about LLMs ability to ensnare the lonely or unhappy into “relationships” that seem quite real to the victims. That could prove a handy tool if you’re a tech billionaire trying to take over the world or even a government seeking to disable potential dissidents. One emerging dystopia is a world where tech billionaires use AIs to battle each other for world control. The LLMs would be useful for “converting” people to their cause, while another type of AI could control huge drone swarms that attack opponents’ data centers. Philip K. Dick could make a fun novel out of that possibility. excellent point. I’m always missing the story because I’m busy arguing the rational explanation. Like trying to evaluate today’s stonk market based on business fundamentals or betting on professional wrestling based on the athleticism of the performers. LLM’s ability to persuade might indeed be the killer app. What dark magick! That is in fact VULCAN’S HAMMER from 1959, or damned close to it, IIRC. It’s almost universally agreed to be Dick’s worst novel, for completions only. but Dick’s visionary abilities make even his least essential work of interest. It certainly wasn’t his mastery of prose. Apologies, I read the post before I saw your comment which I duplicated below. Karen Hao has substantial insights into the broader questions. “Second, the AI companies are racing to build next-generation models that will require even more training, which means higher costs.” “Training” Data mining that amounts to wealth transfers and even more opportunities for surveillance and control of the flow of information are going to be the main outcome. Yea Gary Marcus is saying surveillance is where OpenAI is headed, I’ll get into that in a future post although even there Palintir is way ahead of them and is infamously using AI widely in Gaza and everywhere else. There is a lot to be said for local inference. “Fast” and “easy” are not usually among them. I will say that the installation process is slowly getting easier for the suitably equipped general user, month by month. Consider also the possibility of OpenAI or other chatbot providers being a regulatory arbitrage bid with broader ambitions, sort of like Uber. The anti-AI partisans, supplied with scary developments by researchers, are helping create the conditions for the enclosure of local private computation, with the economic and surveillance effects you’d imagine. The “Singapore Consensus on Global AI Safety Research Priorities” only hints at this eventuality. It does speak plainly to the general desire for surveillance among the participants, and utters some other uncomfortably guild-like noises. yikes. It’s easy to dismiss some of the “OMG AI is totes going to take over the world” crap as the opposite side of the coin of the hype but you’re right. There are a lot of very scary possibilities being worked toward even as the business idiots defraud believers for billions. Of course that’s scary too as they’re risking yet another financial collapse. I love dooming with this community! Everyone here is smarter than me and I’m learning a ton in these comment sections. Such a pleasant change from the various ridiculous and highly toxic electorates, “targets” and fandoms I’ve been writing for these last 28 years. To see where all this AI stuff may be headed, a viewing of “Forbidden Planet” might be predictive. Their version ruined it’s creators, the Krell,. I haven’t seen that since I was a kid and I didn’t have a clue what it was about. will give it a shot now Seconded. Not only is it a beautiful movie with stunning hand-painted sets, credible spacecraft and a great robot, but also the issues it addresses are more relevant now than when the movie was made. Human hubris and the human subconscious make for a dangerous pairing. Transhumanist dreams become nightmares. And Anne Francis is smokin’ hot. ok then, my friend’s documentary is going to have to wait As a complete ignoramus in these matters, I have long assumed the most likely financiers of AI are going to to be the US and Chinese militaries. I imagine no self-respecting general is going to want to fight a war of the future without feeling he has the superior AI. Am I missing something? Palintir has certainly used AI as a “killer app” in Gaza. But I don’t know much about what type of AI — if it’s machine learning or LLMs or what. I suspect it’s some of all types. No intelligent general would depend on AI because LLM based AIs are always very convincing but one out of three times they are flat out wrong. These mistakes are sometimes called “hallucinations.” I was not thinking of LLMs, but other forms of AI. Palantir and the IDF don’t care about hallucinations or wrong data, they don’t view their targets as human so they don’t care if they get a few extra victims while they’re targeting a doctor or journalist’s family for a synchronized multi-site assassination. for genocidal purposes hallucinations are a feature, not a bug “one out of three times they are flat out wrong.” Seems like better results than those delivered by our present intelligence agencies (the surveillance and control bureaucracies). So we can guarantee about 100% of generals will buy into it. Especially once a the hint of post military career board positions are offered. A young man our family knew when he was a high school student in Ljubljana desperate to come to America and work on AI now, nearly 20 years later, has a Silicon Valley start-up working on voice recognition and mimicry. Wonder who’s interested in that. all kinds of fun people, I’m sure. From MI6 to the Sinaloa Cartel… I think you are right for two reasons: 1. Drones with target matching that can take over in case of broken communication would make one main anti-drone defence on the battlefield in Ukraine much less useful. (Machine learning, not a chatbot) 2. Accountability sink. When the need comes to massacre civilians or POWs, it’s useful if the machine kills and can be blamed. Also it saves on PTSD treatment for the soldiers. See Gaza. Don’t know the business aspects, but ISTM that building the models and running the models are two different things. I have a couple of open source Hugging Face-type models here locally that I run in the open source Python environment on NVidia cuda with 6 Gb VRAM, though you need 12 or even 18 Gb to really be productive. As far as online, I’ve found I’m using Google-AI from their search where I might have used Stack Overflow in the past for simple programming solutions. Don’t see any monetization opportunities for Google from my usage. On a large open source project I work on, one dev has a MS CoPilot account and runs all the commits through it prior to merging. I don’t see any earth-shaking insights from it but it does in the main offer useful ideas. You haven’t seen CoPilot producing hallucinations? Oddly, I’ve found for basic Python, OpenAI’s Codex and its GitHub integration work surprisingly well. It’s still clearly a very early product and you can’t for example independently push to a PR branch and get Codex to update its working branch, but whatever. I was only using it for pretty straightforward personal things. Some of us are so old we can remember twenty five years ago when the web was considered a libertarian alternative to traditional media and the open source movement an ultimate expression of this. I still regard it that way and about half my searches go to information aggregator Wikipedia which is produced by humans if not always trustworthy humans. But whatever it’s flaws, I’d say Wiki is a lot more trustworthy than a money making robot run by investor sharks. If AI isn’t about surveillance then what else could this impractical technology possibly be about? True, from the above, it sounds like it is merely about suckering stock buyers. Balzac said behind every great fortune is a great crime and then W.C. Fields said you can’t cheat an honest man. Welcome to our world. Wiki (and Reddit) has been heavily manipulated by the worst actors on Earth for decades now. See Who’s Editing Wikipedia – Diebold, the CIA, a Campaign — Wired 2007 There’s also the rumor that Ghislaine Maxwell was a huge moderator on Reddit which has never been confirmed, but this Vice article “debunking” it has many of the tropes of other “debunkings” (see Vox.com’s 2020 covid coverage, the suppression of the NY Post’s 2020 election eve Hunter Biden laptop story or MSNBC on Russiagate to this day). Use of terms like “incoherent and evidence-free conspiracy theory”, “The ‘evidence’ shared by conspiracy theorists”….sets off alerts in the part of my brain that triggers PTSD when the phrase “unprovoked invasion of Ukraine” is encountered. Counterpoint, the theory was pushed hard by this Utah MAGA Senate candidate who at a glance is walking the anti-Zionist/anti-Semite line a little to closely for my comfort. Like others I don’t get much out of Reddit. And of course we all know about how Wales is not to be trusted and how Wikipedia is manipulated by the spooks. But also of course there are countless topics on Wikipedia that have nothing to do with the spooks. Everything is manipulated now to some degree but some formats are less susceptible than others. Walter Cronkite once said he picked all the stories for the evening news from that day’s NY Times. Now the Times is a joke https://www.moonofalabama.org/2025/06/nyt-guessing-about-iran-with-experts-who-lack-knowledge-of-it.html and we webians have to become our own gatekeepers and editors rather than rely on that dubious “first draft of history” (which I too once read avidly). Computers are a tool. You control them or they control you. my difficulty is dealing with normies who don’t become their own gatekeepers. watching the democrats go blue maga in the 2016-2024 era was pretty awful since that was my closest family and friends my GOP family and friends were always at a bit of an arm’s remove, cousins not siblings I think you’ll find the full-fat version is “Vladimir Putin’s brutal, unprovoked invasion of Ukraine”. Extra points for later references to Putin’s Chef, Putin’s Banker, Putin’s Thinker and other variations on his imagined menagerie of stock villain characters. Karen Hao, in an interview with Novara Media UK offers substantial information on the AI situation. Silicon Valley Insider Exposes Cult Like AI Companies As Artificial Intelligence begins to fundamentally alter the way normal people live their lives, it’s often talked about in terms of boom and doom, which makes a nuanced examination difficult. The problem with AI is that the understanding required to scrutinise the technology is rare and even if one does have that understanding, the ability to clearly communicate it is even rarer. This week’s guest has been both a worker in, and reporter on the tech industry and is uniquely poised to present a nuanced and informed analysis of this rapidly expanding industry. In her new book, ‘Empire of AI’, Karen Hao debunks myths that surround AI and exposes us to the full breadth of this global industry, from it’s cult-leader like CEOs to the workers that power the technology. She sat down with Aaron to talk about Sam Altman’s origin story, the traumatising nature of content moderation work and the striking similarities between Open AI and the British East India Company. IMO there is a case for LLMs becoming profitable but it involves injecting ads/propaganda directly into the answers. I’m sure companies and governments would pay large amounts of money to make sure that a model is biased in a way that directly benefits them. Of course, it requires getting to the point where people don’t have any alternatives to go back to. This makes Google’s destruction of the open web make sense on multiple levels The Sam Altman and Sundar Pichai quotes reminded me of this NewsRadio clip from the 90s: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lE1bS-Mn2Mk It would be funny if they weren’t running some of the biggest and most powerful companies in the world. I mean it’s easy to beat Google search these days because it’s been completely enshittified. I use Kagi – paying $100/year but I will never get a single ad. It’s like Google when Google was actually good. Well worth it. I’m doing the same, although on the monthly plan and never switched to annual. Worth noting unlike Neeva, Kagi doesn’t spider itself and just uses feeds from Google, Microsoft Bing, and a few others I think. Nonetheless, not being the product is worth paying $10 a month for. The specific survival of OpenAI isn’t of any particular interest to me personally, but DeepThink’s achievement of a 30x improvement in cost for training an effective model showed that the link between performance improvement and cost for such a new technology is not something that should be projected forward with any confidence. Whether that will save OpenAI itself, again, to me, who cares, but it seems likely to be relevant to the future ubiquity of the technology itself. DeepThink or DeepSeek? DeepSeek! Thank you Just clarifying because they’re very different animals. Very hard to tell how much of the claims made by DeepSeek are true. There is a true fog of propaganda war over that topic at the moment. It seems likely they did achieve significant efficiencies. It also seems entirely plausible that they did take advantage of OpenAI and others’ training data so it might not be replicable. This was my first thought. Just because chatgpt is unprofitable and expensive to operate now doesn’t mean that’s baked in to LLMs or “AI”. anyone who wants to evaluate whether it is wise for google to adopt LLMs in search needs to look at best-in-class in terms of cost like deepseek. Someone recently said the cost of AI converges to the cost of electricity over time. Deepseek’s improvements likely will be adopted by google eventually. What does the profitability look like at this point? I agree with many of the points in this article, but pointing out chatgpt’s unprofitability isn’t convincing. It’s very early stages and Chinese firms clearly show there’s massive room for cost savings. I saw one estimate that deepseek query costs are 3% of Chatgpt’s, so I think google’s decision should be judged with that future efficiency rate. also, whether or not chatgpt is a threat to google isn’t the issue. It’s whether LLMs and related ai tech is a threat, especially with 97% reduced query costs, and I think the answer is obviously yes. Natural language queries and responses are far more intuitive for most users and use cases than inputting a phrase and browsing links. Compare with asking “where is the nearest home depot” and being given the answer. It would be good to be skeptical of the reported cost advantages of Deepseek. I looked at it for my applications, which relate to cyber security for industrial control systems, and I was astounded by its ability to “reason.” (I’m going to sidestep here why I put quotes around “reason,” except to say the capability is valuable, even if it is not what humans do.) Back in February, my firm expectation was that every other engine would acquire the same reasoning capabilities within weeks or months. The fact that they have come nowhere close is suggestive that the cost advantages of Deepseek are not what they were claimed to be. A chunk of LLM API requests get redirected from places where money is real to OpenAI where the charges are on the order of 1/6 the price. Setting up your own compute to run your own models locally is pretty pricey, so if OpenAI craters it’s going to cause some pain in certain products currently subsidized by the magic of Silicon Valley. built in lack of resilience to the industry. OpenAI collapsing could be a singularity that pulls a lot of peripheral companies down into a black hole with it. “oops not the singularity we promised, does a minsky moment count?” Great post this and reading it, I can see a future direction that they will go in. That they will want the user to talk to the AI instead of just hammering on keys. That, come to think of it, was featured in the 2013 film “Her” which had a computer AI- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_(2013_film)#Plot They say that they want more training sets to make their AI better but where will those come from? They have ransacked the internet now and slurped it all up. They haven’t even set up standards for AI yet and we are still in the bananas stage- https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/27/bofh_2025_episode_12/ that’s one of the reasons Gary Marcus has known all along that the mass compute/big money/big scale approach wouldn’t work. they’re out of content to train on and the more the LLM generated content gets mixed in the worse the output gets There is lots of content left to train on. But it isn’t openly accessible stuff. Think of all the NHS data palantir will now get it’s hands on. All the data that various governments store. All the data corporations store. Hell even think about all the messages that get sent in Whatsapp and similar every day. All of that data is out that and not currently accesible. But it will be. and private phone conversations! I suspect Palintir, Meta, Alphabet, Amazon and others are grabbing “training data” that would shock and appall even the most jaded of us Oh, the Dems love “labor,” because the honchos give them (dues) money to run their campaigns during which they mouth platitudes about “working families.” But as far as supporting actual rank and file workers, not at all. You see these union politicians like Sean Fain (yes, he is for all intents and purposes a Dem Party neoliberal politician). The Dems co-opted the unions, and deal almost exclusively with high- and medium-level hacks like Fain, who think like they do. Please do not leave off topic comments. The place for this is Links. This is called thread-jacking and is a violation of our written site Policies. And there is this: Potemkin Understanding in Large Language Models As a search engine it’s OK at best, but in other regards it’s really not very reliable. this persuading people to believe crazy nonsense might be the killer app I failed to see when I did the initial post. very scary but as someone who’s spent decades in the “get attention > attempt to persuade” field I can see where that’s a high margin business provided they can cut way way down on the compute costs and energy burn. but I’m not sure the lack of need for high quality content relates to any technical cost savings. Anyone know? People already believe crazy nonsense Who needs AI? Well per MIT Technology Review “AI can do a better job of persuading people than we do: OpenAI’s GPT-4 is much better at getting people to accept its point of view during an argument than humans are—but there’s a catch.” There is a huge market to be able to control exactly what crazy nonsense specific individuals believe. This could replace advertising completely — provided they can dramatically reduce cost and energy use. Big provisions. Re tweet that the behavior of LLMs is best explained as “sophisticated pattern matching.” I agree with that, but I think a better and more incisive way of explaining LLMs is to simply say that they are all about mimicry. They are consummate con artists. They can sound just like a doctor without knowing medicine. They can sound just like a PhD without even knowing how to reason or think. Is that some huge human achievement, that we have developed a computer program that can mimic doctors and PhDs without actually knowing anything? To me, the answer is no. It’s not much of an achievement at all to develop automated con artists. Why do we need automated con artists that sound convincing but know nothing and have no value other than how convincing they sound? Several years back i overheard a senior enginer explaining to a junior one that “the key to being s consultant isn’t knowing more than the client, it’s bullshitting them that you know more”. Perhaps AI is kust a reflection of where society has already gone. it might be an achievement along the lines of Dr Frankenstein’s. I don’t pay any attention to the AI “features” in Google search, though that’s getting more and more difficult over time, because I don’t trust it not to make stuff up. I’m surprised more people aren’t likewise leery of it. word is getting out but reptition is the most powerful form of persuasion according to some and the whole tech industry is pushing this stuff on us over and over and over and over “The energy costs of LLMs are enormous.” Amongst all their BS and hype I can’t look past the energy aspect. Where will the affordable energy come from to power all of the data centres as they store increasing amounts of data, and the more data AI has to interrogate the more it consumes energy to ‘think’ (just consumes an increasingly larger amount of energy as it learns and grows)? The more I listen to energy experts discuss energy demand and affordable clean energy (is anything really clean considering the resources we dig up to build solar/wind capture infrastructure) the more I think AI will be limited by (clean/cleanish) energy availability.

Title: Coffee Break: OpenAI as The Money Pit

OpenAI has fatally flawed finances which reveal a company that presents no serious threat to any of the tech incumbents, including Google. In the (excellent) comments to my post last Monday on Google’s inexplicable-to-me decision to risk their search monopoly by going all-in on LLM AI one from Hickory exposed that I had failed to make a key point: ChatGPT is not a threat to replace Google as the leader in search because OpenAI loses money on every ChatGPT prompt and is trying to make it up in volume. Let’s put aside the claims about LLMs having reasoning ability for now and focus on the bullish business case for ChatGPT as a killer app that threatens Google search. Cal Newport lays out that case: The application that has… leaped ahead to become the most exciting and popular use of these tools is smart search. If you have a question, instead of turning to Google you can query a new version of ChatGPT or Claude. These models can search the web to gather information, but unlike a traditional search engine, they can also process the information they find and summarize for you only what you care about. Want the information presented in a particular format, like a spreadsheet or a chart? A high-end model like GPT-4o can do this for you as well, saving even more extra steps. Smart search has become the first killer app of the generative AI era because, like any good killer app, it takes an activity most people already do all the time — typing search queries into web sites — and provides a substantially, almost magically better experience. This feels similar to electronic spreadsheets conquering paper ledger books or email immediately replacing voice mail and fax. I would estimate that around 90% of the examples I see online right now from people exclaiming over the potential of AI are people conducting smart searches. This behavioral shift is appearing in the data. A recent survey conducted by Future found that 27% of US-based respondents had used AI tools such as ChatGPT instead of a traditional search engine. From an economic perspective, this shift matters. Earlier this month, the stock price for Alphabet, the parent company for Google, fell after an Apple executive revealed that Google searches through the Safari web browser had decreased over the previous two months, likely due to the increased use of AI tools. Keep in mind, web search is a massive business, with Google earning over $175 billion from search ads in 2023 alone. In my opinion, becoming the new Google Search is likely the best bet for a company like OpenAI to achieve profitability… That’s a seemingly reasonable claim, but doesn’t hold up after a look into OpenAI’s business plans for ChatGPT. Despite their seeming threat to Google search, OpenAI is the kind of self-defeating competition no monopolist should fear, much less destroy its proven business model to compete with. The New York Times put it pretty well last September: pic.twitter.com/As1hKPAqtB — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) June 30, 2025 Morningstar summed up the NYT’s reporting well: Financial documents reviewed by The New York Times reveal a company burning through cash at an alarming rate, raising questions about the sustainability of its current trajectory and the potential risks of prioritizing break-neck expansion over responsible AI development. Let’s discuss some of the key points from the New York Times report, which was published last week before the funding announcement: — OpenAI’s monthly revenue hit $300 million in August 2024, a 1,700% increase since early 2023. — The company expects to generate around $3.7 billion in annual sales this year and anticipates revenue ballooning to $11.6 billion in 2025. — Despite rising revenues, OpenAI predicts a loss of about $5 billion. this year due to high operational costs, biggest of which is the cost of computing power it gets through its partnership with Microsoft. — OpenAI predicts its revenue will hit $100 billion in 2029. The Times report raises serious questions about OpenAI’s sustainability and realistic goals. The company’s monthly revenue growth from early 2023 to August 2024 is nothing short of explosive; however, the long-term projection of $100 billion in revenue by 2029 appears unrealistic. This figure would require sustaining an average annual growth rate of more than 90% for five consecutive years (93.3% to be precise, from an expected $3.7 billion in 2024 to $100 billion in 2029), a feat rarely achieved in the tech industry, especially for a company already operating at such a large scale. While impressive on paper, said projections may be masking underlying financial challenges and setting expectations that could be difficult, if not impossible, to meet. Financial challenges become even more apparent given the current expense structure in relation to projected growth. It’s crucial to note that, even if it reaches the projected revenue targets, OpenAI is not merely failing to break even in 2024 – it’s losing significantly more money than it’s generating. This means that before OpenAI can even consider achieving its ambitious growth targets, it must first find a way to become profitable, or at the very least, break even. Bryan McMahon pointed out the massive financial risk posed by the stock market bubble driven by faith in LLMs or as he calls it Generative AI: Venture capital (VC) funds, drunk on a decade of “growth at all costs,” have poured about $200 billion into generative AI. Making matters worse, the stock market’s bull run is deeply dependent on the growth of the Big Tech companies fueling the AI bubble. In 2023, 71 percent of the total gains in the S&P 500 were attributable to the “Magnificent Seven”—Apple, Nvidia, Tesla, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft—all of which are among the biggest spenders on AI. Just four—Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta—combined for $246 billion of capital expenditure in 2024 to support the AI build-out. Goldman Sachs expects Big Tech to spend over $1 trillion on chips and data centers to power AI over the next five years. Yet OpenAI, the current market leader, expects to lose $5 billion this year, and its annual losses to swell to $11 billion by 2026. If the AI bubble bursts, it not only threatens to wipe out VC firms in the Valley but also blow a gaping hole in the public markets and cause an economy-wide meltdown. But wait it gets worse, per Ed Zitron: It seems, from even a cursory glance, that OpenAI’s costs are increasing dramatically. The Information reported earlier in the year that OpenAI projects to spend $13 billion on compute with Microsoft alone in 2025, nearly tripling what it spent in total on compute in 2024 ($5 billion). This suggests that OpenAI’s costs are skyrocketing, and that was before the launch of its new image generator which led to multiple complaints from Altman about a lack of available GPUs, leading to OpenAI’s CEO saying to expect “stuff to break” and delays in new products. Nevertheless, even if we assume OpenAI factored in the compute increases into its projections, it still expects to pay Microsoft $13 billion for compute this year. This number, however, doesn’t include the $12.9 billion five-year-long compute deal signed with CoreWeave, a deal that was a result of Microsoft declining to pick up the option to buy said compute itself. Payments for this deal, according to The Information, start in October 2025, and assuming that it’s evenly paid (the terms of these contracts are generally secret, even in the case of public companies), this would still amount to roughly $2.38 billion a year. I’ll let the Entertainment Strategy Guy nail the profitability coffin shut: By all accounts, right now, OpenAI is losing money. Like literally billions of dollars. The energy costs of LLMs are enormous. If they’re pricing their services below market value, trying to gain market share, then we don’t know if AI can make money for the service it’s providing right now. Two factors are driving these costs. First, the memory an AI program uses (either the more data it stores as it thinks or the longer it thinks about a problem/answer), the more it costs the AI companies in compute. Second, the AI companies are racing to build next-generation models that will require even more training, which means higher costs. And the salaries for top AI engineers/scientists are also sky-rocketing up. This is why I’m somewhat skeptical about the sorts of things that OpenAI is promising that AI can do (like become your universal assistant that remembers everything about you); it seems like an absolute memory boondoggle of monumental proportions. How much energy will it take for AI to analyze my whole life if it’s already too taxing for an LLM to remember how to format links properly? But wait, there’s even more bad news that just dropped. OpenAI is now in a bidding war for talent with some of the stupidest money out there, Mark Zuckerberg of Meta: …competition for top AI researchers is heating up in Silicon Valley. Zuckerberg has been particularly aggressive in his approach, offering $100 million signing bonuses to some OpenAI staffers, according to comments Altman made on a podcast with his brother, Jack Altman. Multiple sources at OpenAI with direct knowledge of the offers confirmed the number. The Meta CEO has also been personally reaching out to potential recruits, according to the Wall Street Journal. “Over the past month, Meta has been aggressively building out their new AI effort, and has repeatedly (and mostly unsuccessfully) tried to recruit some of our strongest talent with comp-focused packages,” Chen wrote on Slack. And speaking of dumb money and OpenAI, Softbank is involved, although maybe not as much as reported: (In April) OpenAI closed “the largest private tech funding round in history,” where it “raised” an astonishing “$40 billion,” and the reason that I’ve put quotation marks around it is that OpenAI has only raised $10 billion of the $40 billion, with the rest arriving by “the end of the year.” The remaining $30 billion — $20 billion of which will (allegedly) be provided by SoftBank — is partially contingent on OpenAI’s conversion from a non-profit to a for-profit by the end of 2025, and if it fails, SoftBank will only give OpenAI a further $20 billion. The round also valued OpenAI at $300 billion. And things might not be going so well with Softbank because OpenAI is now talking to even dumber, and much more dangerous, money: Saudi Arabia. And if you’ve ever paid attention to the actual words coming out of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s mouth, you’ll realize Altman attracting dumb money is just a case of birds of a feather flocking together. Ed Zitron chronicles some of the stupid in his latest newsletter: Here is but one of the trenchant insights from Sam Altman in his agonizing 37-minute-long podcast conversation with his brother Jack Altman from last week: “I think there will be incredible other products. There will be crazy new social experiences. There will be, like, Google Docs style AI workflows that are just way more productive. You’ll start to see, you’ll have these virtual employees, but the thing that I think will be most impactful on that five to ten year timeframe is AI will actually discover new science.” When asked why he believes AI will “discover new science,” Altman says that “I think we’ve cracked reasoning in the models,” adding that “we’ve a long way to go,” and that he “think[s] we know what to do,” adding that OpenAI’s o3 model “is already pretty smart,” and that he’s heard people say “wow, this is like a good PHD.” That’s the entire answer! It’s complete nonsense! Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, a company allegedly worth $300 billion to venture capitalists and SoftBank, kind of sounds like a huge idiot! Ed also roasts Alphabet/Google’s Sundar Pichai: Sundar Pichai, when asked one of Nilay Patel’s patented 100-word-plus-questions about Jony Ive and Sam Altman’s new (and likely heavily delayed) hardware startup: I think AI is going to be bigger than the internet. There are going to be companies, products, and categories created that we aren’t aware of today. I think the future looks exciting. I think there’s a lot of opportunity to innovate around hardware form factors at this moment with this platform shift. I’m looking forward to seeing what they do. We are going to be doing a lot as well. I think it’s an exciting time to be a consumer, it’s an exciting time to be a developer. I’m looking forward to it. The fuck are you on about, Sundar? Your answer to a question about whether you anticipate more competition is to say “yeah I think people are gonna make shit we haven’t come up with and uhh, hardware, can’t wait!” While I think Pichai is likely a little smarter than Altman, in the same way that Satya Nadella is a little smarter than Pichai, and in the same way that a golden retriever is smarter than a chihuahua. That said, none of these men are superintelligences, nor, when pressed, do they ever seem to have any actual answers. If ChatGPT were such an existential threat to Google’s search monopoly that Alphabet’s only option was risking the empire to beat OpenAI in the LLM race, it would be profitable or at least have a plausible path to profitability. Sam Altman being a blithering idiot isn’t really the disadvantage it should be since he’s going up against competition like Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, and Sundar Pichai. This isn’t like Uber vs. the local taxi incumbents in the 2010s where despite Uber’s never going to be profitable business model they were able to take over in many markets because OpenAI does not have a huge cash advantage over Alphabet and never will. Next week we’ll look at at Meta, the absolute stupidest tech money around — a company that put Dana White of the Ultimate Fighting Championship on its board. And because I promised I’d get around to this, regarding LLMs ability to “reason” it was thoroughly debunked last October by six researchers from Apple in a paper called “GSM-Symbolic: Understanding the Limitations of Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models.” When the paper was released the senior author, Mehrdad Farajtabar, tweeted that, ““we found no evidence of formal reasoning in language models …. Their behavior is better explained by sophisticated pattern matching—so fragile, in fact, that changing names can alter results by ~10%!” Veteran political operative and corporate media professional. One of the Ed Zitron pieces you cited: https://www.wheresyoured.at/openai-is-a-systemic-risk-to-the-tech-industry-2/ while quite long, goes deep into the details of OpenAI’s present and future financing and how they expect to meet their financial commitments over the next two or three years. It left me in a funk for several days, not because I care a whit about OpenAI, but because the business press has now apparently become so delusional and dishonest that it’s hard to believe anything or even see how things can go on. After reading this, I have to conclude that OpenAI/Softbank is definitely, positively going to go out of business in the next two or three years. How much of the rest of the economy they take down with it is perhaps more worrisome. This is the same business press that covered Uber and Lyft breathlessly for 15 years as Uber burnt through money.. because they wanted the businesses to succeed. The will do the same thing with OpenAI until they magically find profit. Kurtismayfield, yea but I don’t think the overall economy has the runway that Uber had in the 2010s. Gonna be some reality checks sooner rather than later. Yea, the LLM bubble popping might be the end of the “Everything Bubble” that George Soros wrote a whole book about 20 years ago As a complement to this piece, I recommend this lengthy interview with technology journalist Karen Hao about her recent book “Empire of AI: Dreams and Nightmares in Sam Altman’s OpenAI”. thanks! I will check it out. Agreed. It was excellent. I’m not so sure that taking over search or even making money are the real goals of these people. We had a story in Links today about LLMs ability to ensnare the lonely or unhappy into “relationships” that seem quite real to the victims. That could prove a handy tool if you’re a tech billionaire trying to take over the world or even a government seeking to disable potential dissidents. One emerging dystopia is a world where tech billionaires use AIs to battle each other for world control. The LLMs would be useful for “converting” people to their cause, while another type of AI could control huge drone swarms that attack opponents’ data centers. Philip K. Dick could make a fun novel out of that possibility. excellent point. I’m always missing the story because I’m busy arguing the rational explanation. Like trying to evaluate today’s stonk market based on business fundamentals or betting on professional wrestling based on the athleticism of the performers. LLM’s ability to persuade might indeed be the killer app. What dark magick! That is in fact VULCAN’S HAMMER from 1959, or damned close to it, IIRC. It’s almost universally agreed to be Dick’s worst novel, for completions only. but Dick’s visionary abilities make even his least essential work of interest. It certainly wasn’t his mastery of prose. Apologies, I read the post before I saw your comment which I duplicated below. Karen Hao has substantial insights into the broader questions. “Second, the AI companies are racing to build next-generation models that will require even more training, which means higher costs.” “Training” Data mining that amounts to wealth transfers and even more opportunities for surveillance and control of the flow of information are going to be the main outcome. Yea Gary Marcus is saying surveillance is where OpenAI is headed, I’ll get into that in a future post although even there Palintir is way ahead of them and is infamously using AI widely in Gaza and everywhere else. There is a lot to be said for local inference. “Fast” and “easy” are not usually among them. I will say that the installation process is slowly getting easier for the suitably equipped general user, month by month. Consider also the possibility of OpenAI or other chatbot providers being a regulatory arbitrage bid with broader ambitions, sort of like Uber. The anti-AI partisans, supplied with scary developments by researchers, are helping create the conditions for the enclosure of local private computation, with the economic and surveillance effects you’d imagine. The “Singapore Consensus on Global AI Safety Research Priorities” only hints at this eventuality. It does speak plainly to the general desire for surveillance among the participants, and utters some other uncomfortably guild-like noises. yikes. It’s easy to dismiss some of the “OMG AI is totes going to take over the world” crap as the opposite side of the coin of the hype but you’re right. There are a lot of very scary possibilities being worked toward even as the business idiots defraud believers for billions. Of course that’s scary too as they’re risking yet another financial collapse. I love dooming with this community! Everyone here is smarter than me and I’m learning a ton in these comment sections. Such a pleasant change from the various ridiculous and highly toxic electorates, “targets” and fandoms I’ve been writing for these last 28 years. To see where all this AI stuff may be headed, a viewing of “Forbidden Planet” might be predictive. Their version ruined it’s creators, the Krell,. I haven’t seen that since I was a kid and I didn’t have a clue what it was about. will give it a shot now Seconded. Not only is it a beautiful movie with stunning hand-painted sets, credible spacecraft and a great robot, but also the issues it addresses are more relevant now than when the movie was made. Human hubris and the human subconscious make for a dangerous pairing. Transhumanist dreams become nightmares. And Anne Francis is smokin’ hot. ok then, my friend’s documentary is going to have to wait As a complete ignoramus in these matters, I have long assumed the most likely financiers of AI are going to to be the US and Chinese militaries. I imagine no self-respecting general is going to want to fight a war of the future without feeling he has the superior AI. Am I missing something? Palintir has certainly used AI as a “killer app” in Gaza. But I don’t know much about what type of AI — if it’s machine learning or LLMs or what. I suspect it’s some of all types. No intelligent general would depend on AI because LLM based AIs are always very convincing but one out of three times they are flat out wrong. These mistakes are sometimes called “hallucinations.” I was not thinking of LLMs, but other forms of AI. Palantir and the IDF don’t care about hallucinations or wrong data, they don’t view their targets as human so they don’t care if they get a few extra victims while they’re targeting a doctor or journalist’s family for a synchronized multi-site assassination. for genocidal purposes hallucinations are a feature, not a bug “one out of three times they are flat out wrong.” Seems like better results than those delivered by our present intelligence agencies (the surveillance and control bureaucracies). So we can guarantee about 100% of generals will buy into it. Especially once a the hint of post military career board positions are offered. A young man our family knew when he was a high school student in Ljubljana desperate to come to America and work on AI now, nearly 20 years later, has a Silicon Valley start-up working on voice recognition and mimicry. Wonder who’s interested in that. all kinds of fun people, I’m sure. From MI6 to the Sinaloa Cartel… I think you are right for two reasons: 1. Drones with target matching that can take over in case of broken communication would make one main anti-drone defence on the battlefield in Ukraine much less useful. (Machine learning, not a chatbot) 2. Accountability sink. When the need comes to massacre civilians or POWs, it’s useful if the machine kills and can be blamed. Also it saves on PTSD treatment for the soldiers. See Gaza. Don’t know the business aspects, but ISTM that building the models and running the models are two different things. I have a couple of open source Hugging Face-type models here locally that I run in the open source Python environment on NVidia cuda with 6 Gb VRAM, though you need 12 or even 18 Gb to really be productive. As far as online, I’ve found I’m using Google-AI from their search where I might have used Stack Overflow in the past for simple programming solutions. Don’t see any monetization opportunities for Google from my usage. On a large open source project I work on, one dev has a MS CoPilot account and runs all the commits through it prior to merging. I don’t see any earth-shaking insights from it but it does in the main offer useful ideas. You haven’t seen CoPilot producing hallucinations? Oddly, I’ve found for basic Python, OpenAI’s Codex and its GitHub integration work surprisingly well. It’s still clearly a very early product and you can’t for example independently push to a PR branch and get Codex to update its working branch, but whatever. I was only using it for pretty straightforward personal things. Some of us are so old we can remember twenty five years ago when the web was considered a libertarian alternative to traditional media and the open source movement an ultimate expression of this. I still regard it that way and about half my searches go to information aggregator Wikipedia which is produced by humans if not always trustworthy humans. But whatever it’s flaws, I’d say Wiki is a lot more trustworthy than a money making robot run by investor sharks. If AI isn’t about surveillance then what else could this impractical technology possibly be about? True, from the above, it sounds like it is merely about suckering stock buyers. Balzac said behind every great fortune is a great crime and then W.C. Fields said you can’t cheat an honest man. Welcome to our world. Wiki (and Reddit) has been heavily manipulated by the worst actors on Earth for decades now. See Who’s Editing Wikipedia – Diebold, the CIA, a Campaign — Wired 2007 There’s also the rumor that Ghislaine Maxwell was a huge moderator on Reddit which has never been confirmed, but this Vice article “debunking” it has many of the tropes of other “debunkings” (see Vox.com’s 2020 covid coverage, the suppression of the NY Post’s 2020 election eve Hunter Biden laptop story or MSNBC on Russiagate to this day). Use of terms like “incoherent and evidence-free conspiracy theory”, “The ‘evidence’ shared by conspiracy theorists”….sets off alerts in the part of my brain that triggers PTSD when the phrase “unprovoked invasion of Ukraine” is encountered. Counterpoint, the theory was pushed hard by this Utah MAGA Senate candidate who at a glance is walking the anti-Zionist/anti-Semite line a little to closely for my comfort. Like others I don’t get much out of Reddit. And of course we all know about how Wales is not to be trusted and how Wikipedia is manipulated by the spooks. But also of course there are countless topics on Wikipedia that have nothing to do with the spooks. Everything is manipulated now to some degree but some formats are less susceptible than others. Walter Cronkite once said he picked all the stories for the evening news from that day’s NY Times. Now the Times is a joke https://www.moonofalabama.org/2025/06/nyt-guessing-about-iran-with-experts-who-lack-knowledge-of-it.html and we webians have to become our own gatekeepers and editors rather than rely on that dubious “first draft of history” (which I too once read avidly). Computers are a tool. You control them or they control you. my difficulty is dealing with normies who don’t become their own gatekeepers. watching the democrats go blue maga in the 2016-2024 era was pretty awful since that was my closest family and friends my GOP family and friends were always at a bit of an arm’s remove, cousins not siblings I think you’ll find the full-fat version is “Vladimir Putin’s brutal, unprovoked invasion of Ukraine”. Extra points for later references to Putin’s Chef, Putin’s Banker, Putin’s Thinker and other variations on his imagined menagerie of stock villain characters. Karen Hao, in an interview with Novara Media UK offers substantial information on the AI situation. Silicon Valley Insider Exposes Cult Like AI Companies As Artificial Intelligence begins to fundamentally alter the way normal people live their lives, it’s often talked about in terms of boom and doom, which makes a nuanced examination difficult. The problem with AI is that the understanding required to scrutinise the technology is rare and even if one does have that understanding, the ability to clearly communicate it is even rarer. This week’s guest has been both a worker in, and reporter on the tech industry and is uniquely poised to present a nuanced and informed analysis of this rapidly expanding industry. In her new book, ‘Empire of AI’, Karen Hao debunks myths that surround AI and exposes us to the full breadth of this global industry, from it’s cult-leader like CEOs to the workers that power the technology. She sat down with Aaron to talk about Sam Altman’s origin story, the traumatising nature of content moderation work and the striking similarities between Open AI and the British East India Company. IMO there is a case for LLMs becoming profitable but it involves injecting ads/propaganda directly into the answers. I’m sure companies and governments would pay large amounts of money to make sure that a model is biased in a way that directly benefits them. Of course, it requires getting to the point where people don’t have any alternatives to go back to. This makes Google’s destruction of the open web make sense on multiple levels The Sam Altman and Sundar Pichai quotes reminded me of this NewsRadio clip from the 90s: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lE1bS-Mn2Mk It would be funny if they weren’t running some of the biggest and most powerful companies in the world. I mean it’s easy to beat Google search these days because it’s been completely enshittified. I use Kagi – paying $100/year but I will never get a single ad. It’s like Google when Google was actually good. Well worth it. I’m doing the same, although on the monthly plan and never switched to annual. Worth noting unlike Neeva, Kagi doesn’t spider itself and just uses feeds from Google, Microsoft Bing, and a few others I think. Nonetheless, not being the product is worth paying $10 a month for. The specific survival of OpenAI isn’t of any particular interest to me personally, but DeepThink’s achievement of a 30x improvement in cost for training an effective model showed that the link between performance improvement and cost for such a new technology is not something that should be projected forward with any confidence. Whether that will save OpenAI itself, again, to me, who cares, but it seems likely to be relevant to the future ubiquity of the technology itself. DeepThink or DeepSeek? DeepSeek! Thank you Just clarifying because they’re very different animals. Very hard to tell how much of the claims made by DeepSeek are true. There is a true fog of propaganda war over that topic at the moment. It seems likely they did achieve significant efficiencies. It also seems entirely plausible that they did take advantage of OpenAI and others’ training data so it might not be replicable. This was my first thought. Just because chatgpt is unprofitable and expensive to operate now doesn’t mean that’s baked in to LLMs or “AI”. anyone who wants to evaluate whether it is wise for google to adopt LLMs in search needs to look at best-in-class in terms of cost like deepseek. Someone recently said the cost of AI converges to the cost of electricity over time. Deepseek’s improvements likely will be adopted by google eventually. What does the profitability look like at this point? I agree with many of the points in this article, but pointing out chatgpt’s unprofitability isn’t convincing. It’s very early stages and Chinese firms clearly show there’s massive room for cost savings. I saw one estimate that deepseek query costs are 3% of Chatgpt’s, so I think google’s decision should be judged with that future efficiency rate. also, whether or not chatgpt is a threat to google isn’t the issue. It’s whether LLMs and related ai tech is a threat, especially with 97% reduced query costs, and I think the answer is obviously yes. Natural language queries and responses are far more intuitive for most users and use cases than inputting a phrase and browsing links. Compare with asking “where is the nearest home depot” and being given the answer. It would be good to be skeptical of the reported cost advantages of Deepseek. I looked at it for my applications, which relate to cyber security for industrial control systems, and I was astounded by its ability to “reason.” (I’m going to sidestep here why I put quotes around “reason,” except to say the capability is valuable, even if it is not what humans do.) Back in February, my firm expectation was that every other engine would acquire the same reasoning capabilities within weeks or months. The fact that they have come nowhere close is suggestive that the cost advantages of Deepseek are not what they were claimed to be. A chunk of LLM API requests get redirected from places where money is real to OpenAI where the charges are on the order of 1/6 the price. Setting up your own compute to run your own models locally is pretty pricey, so if OpenAI craters it’s going to cause some pain in certain products currently subsidized by the magic of Silicon Valley. built in lack of resilience to the industry. OpenAI collapsing could be a singularity that pulls a lot of peripheral companies down into a black hole with it. “oops not the singularity we promised, does a minsky moment count?” Great post this and reading it, I can see a future direction that they will go in. That they will want the user to talk to the AI instead of just hammering on keys. That, come to think of it, was featured in the 2013 film “Her” which had a computer AI- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_(2013_film)#Plot They say that they want more training sets to make their AI better but where will those come from? They have ransacked the internet now and slurped it all up. They haven’t even set up standards for AI yet and we are still in the bananas stage- https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/27/bofh_2025_episode_12/ that’s one of the reasons Gary Marcus has known all along that the mass compute/big money/big scale approach wouldn’t work. they’re out of content to train on and the more the LLM generated content gets mixed in the worse the output gets There is lots of content left to train on. But it isn’t openly accessible stuff. Think of all the NHS data palantir will now get it’s hands on. All the data that various governments store. All the data corporations store. Hell even think about all the messages that get sent in Whatsapp and similar every day. All of that data is out that and not currently accesible. But it will be. and private phone conversations! I suspect Palintir, Meta, Alphabet, Amazon and others are grabbing “training data” that would shock and appall even the most jaded of us Oh, the Dems love “labor,” because the honchos give them (dues) money to run their campaigns during which they mouth platitudes about “working families.” But as far as supporting actual rank and file workers, not at all. You see these union politicians like Sean Fain (yes, he is for all intents and purposes a Dem Party neoliberal politician). The Dems co-opted the unions, and deal almost exclusively with high- and medium-level hacks like Fain, who think like they do. Please do not leave off topic comments. The place for this is Links. This is called thread-jacking and is a violation of our written site Policies. And there is this: Potemkin Understanding in Large Language Models As a search engine it’s OK at best, but in other regards it’s really not very reliable. this persuading people to believe crazy nonsense might be the killer app I failed to see when I did the initial post. very scary but as someone who’s spent decades in the “get attention > attempt to persuade” field I can see where that’s a high margin business provided they can cut way way down on the compute costs and energy burn. but I’m not sure the lack of need for high quality content relates to any technical cost savings. Anyone know? People already believe crazy nonsense Who needs AI? Well per MIT Technology Review “AI can do a better job of persuading people than we do: OpenAI’s GPT-4 is much better at getting people to accept its point of view during an argument than humans are—but there’s a catch.” There is a huge market to be able to control exactly what crazy nonsense specific individuals believe. This could replace advertising completely — provided they can dramatically reduce cost and energy use. Big provisions. Re tweet that the behavior of LLMs is best explained as “sophisticated pattern matching.” I agree with that, but I think a better and more incisive way of explaining LLMs is to simply say that they are all about mimicry. They are consummate con artists. They can sound just like a doctor without knowing medicine. They can sound just like a PhD without even knowing how to reason or think. Is that some huge human achievement, that we have developed a computer program that can mimic doctors and PhDs without actually knowing anything? To me, the answer is no. It’s not much of an achievement at all to develop automated con artists. Why do we need automated con artists that sound convincing but know nothing and have no value other than how convincing they sound? Several years back i overheard a senior enginer explaining to a junior one that “the key to being s consultant isn’t knowing more than the client, it’s bullshitting them that you know more”. Perhaps AI is kust a reflection of where society has already gone. it might be an achievement along the lines of Dr Frankenstein’s. I don’t pay any attention to the AI “features” in Google search, though that’s getting more and more difficult over time, because I don’t trust it not to make stuff up. I’m surprised more people aren’t likewise leery of it. word is getting out but reptition is the most powerful form of persuasion according to some and the whole tech industry is pushing this stuff on us over and over and over and over “The energy costs of LLMs are enormous.” Amongst all their BS and hype I can’t look past the energy aspect. Where will the affordable energy come from to power all of the data centres as they store increasing amounts of data, and the more data AI has to interrogate the more it consumes energy to ‘think’ (just consumes an increasingly larger amount of energy as it learns and grows)? The more I listen to energy experts discuss energy demand and affordable clean energy (is anything really clean considering the resources we dig up to build solar/wind capture infrastructure) the more I think AI will be limited by (clean/cleanish) energy availability.

Digital assets should be among the go-to assets in an investor's portfolio, alongside stocks and bonds, he said on CNBC’s Crypto World, reiterating his comments from earlier this month at a Texas conference for wealth management professionals. At one point, Edelman, who co-founded Edelman Financial Engines, a $293 billion asset manager, advocated for a “low single digits” allocations to crypto, but he’s been swayed recently by “dramatically improved regulatory clarity and institutional engagement in crypto.” For conservative portfolios, Edelman recommended that at least 10% of assets be allocated to crypto, with a 25% allocation for moderate portfolios, and 40% for aggressive investors. Edelman, who is also founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, a trade group, cited advancements in technology leading to longer human lives as part of this basis for his recommendation, saying the average investor that’s alive today will live to be 100 years or older, requiring “portfolios to last far longer than most investors anticipate.” In addition, Edelman said that the “continued growth of blockchain technology will propel its levels five or 10 times its current size by 2030.” Whether an investor should only invest in Bitcoin, as opposed to other digital assets as well, should be between them and their advisor, Edelman told Decrypt on Monday. There could be other ways to get exposure to the digital assets industry, too, he added, pointing to stablecoin issuers, custodians, chipmakers, and exchanges. “There is now a very healthy and diverse infrastructure that represents blockchain and digital assets, and some argue that only owning Bitcoin deprives you of engagement in that broader community,” he said. As cryptocurrencies see continued adoption on Wall Street through products like exchange-traded funds, Edelman believes that Bitcoin will be worth $19 trillion by 2030. Today, the leading cryptocurrency is worth $2.1 trillion, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. With U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration reversing Biden-era restrictions on banks’ ability to offer services related to digital assets, the stage has been set “for massive engagement by the banking community,” Edelman added. Although most financial advisors increase investors’ allocation to bonds as they age, Edelman said that professionals should allocate no more than 30% of funds to U.S. debt. In some cases, it makes sense to allocate 100% of a portfolio to stocks and crypto, he said. Even a 90-year-old investor should have some exposure to digital assets, Edelman told Decrypt, saying their decision boils down to risk tolerance, as opposed to their age. The rationale, he said, could be that they’re investing with future generations in mind. “If you're in your 90s, you know that you're not going to spend all of your money. You're going to leave it to your children and grandchildren,” he said. “That means the money is not really yours. You're merely the steward of that money for the benefit of your heirs.” It was reasonable to wonder whether crypto would survive the regulatory headwinds that it faced not long ago, or whether the tech would be adopted by banks, Edelman noted. However, those questions have been settled, setting crypto up for a long-term future, he said. On Monday, Edelman’s recommendation turned heads within the cryptosphere. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said on X, formerly Twitter, that Edelman’s remarks could be “the most important full throated endorsement of crypto from [the] TradFi world since Larry Fink.” The BlackRock CEO emerged as a Bitcoin backer last year after the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. but touted tokenization’s prospects in 2022. More recently, Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JP Morgan, has put his long-run skepticism aside. In May, he said that the bank’s customers would soon allow clients to purchase Bitcoin.

Title: GoFundMe is refurbishing a little-known financial tool in a bid to supercharge everyday giving

By JAMES POLLARD, Associated Press NEW YORK (AP) — GoFundMe CEO Tim Cadogan had some complications while fundraising on his own website last fall. Several friends wanted to help Cadogan reach his $28,000 goal as he crowdfunded for a Los Angeles area wilderness rescue team. But they tried to donate through a lesser-known wealth management tool called a donor-advised fund, or a DAF, a no-frills investing vehicle for money earmarked as eventual charitable gifts. After cutting checks and waiting three weeks, Cadogan said, the money finally arrived. “It was just a bit of a thing,” he added. “If they were using a Giving Fund, it would take ten seconds.” Giving Funds are GoFundMe’s latest in a flurry of product rollouts with the purported goal of moving stagnant U.S. charitable contributions beyond the 2% GDP mark where totals have long hovered. But the for-profit company’s DAF, announced Monday, enters a crowded market of more than a thousand providers — products often with older, wealthier clienteles that are often criticized for warehousing gifts. To transform the way that everyday users plan their donations, Cadogan will have to widen the appeal of DAFs beyond the likes of the technology entrepreneur’s circles. And he wants to change public perceptions of his company as just a crowdfunding site. “We’re also hopeful that more people will start using GoFundMe for a broader set of things in their lives: not just that one fundraiser they’re supporting, not just that one nonprofit. But they’re coming in and they’re managing their giving portfolio with us and through us,” Cadogan said. “That connects directly to our mission, which is we want to help people help each other.” Donor-advised funds grew popular over the last decade among ultra-high net worth individuals as a tax-efficient instrument for grantmaking without the hassle of a more sophisticated charitable foundation. Donors can immediately write the contribution off on their taxes but face no deadline for giving the money to a nonprofit. The idea: account holders could invest money they wanted to ultimately donate, let the funds grow tax-free while they sit and give themselves time to identify the recipients best aligned with their giving goals. There’s since been a rush to court average givers. Legacy financial services firms such as Fidelity Charitable lowered the minimums to open accounts. Fintech startups such as Daffy contrast their flat fees with the hidden expenses they allege their competitors charge. All that traction brought IRS proposals last year to impose penalties on those who abuse DAFs and Congress has considered legislation that would require some deadlines for disbursements. GoFundMe’s Giving Funds will have no minimum balances, zero management fees and donations starting at $5. Users can load their DAF through their bank accounts or direct deposits for free. Credit card payments will be covered through the end of the year and then face the company’s standard transaction fee of 2.2% plus 30 cents. Contributions can then be invested in a choice of exchange traded funds from managers including Vanguard, Blackrock and State Street Global Advisors. Cadogan pitches Giving Funds as a way to be more intentional about giving — something he said user feedback suggests more people want. As he sees it, widespread adoption hasn’t occurred because DAFs have been framed as “wealth management products.” “This is a giving product,” Cadogan said. “It’s something for everybody. And you don’t need to know the words ‘donor advised fund.’ It doesn’t show up.” DAFs remain scrutinized for allowing donors to reap tax benefits before they ever redistribute any money to charitable causes — even if the notion that the channel is being exploited is fiercely debated in the nonprofit sector. Opaque disclosure requirements make it difficult to put a number on the overall assets held within the funds. The National Philanthropic Trust placed the total at more than $250 billion in 2023. Cadogan believes GoFundMe’s culture is uniquely suited to nudge users with targeted spotlights of the 1.5 million charities already active on the platform. Giving Funds holders will be peppered with information about local nonprofits, crisis responders, their friends’ charities of choice and potential beneficiaries that address their selected issue areas. That “dynamic, alive community” is very different from the “fairly static, passive” financial vehicles in the current market, according to Cadogan. “It’s essentially inspiring the money to move,” he said. Other features seek to encourage contributions by simplifying things. Users can set annual giving goals by a percentage of their income or a fixed number. Their gifts will tally up in real-time records to track their progress and ease year-end tax planning. Streamlining the process was one area for improvement identified in the DAF Research Collaborative’s recent survey of more than 2,100 donors. But Jeff Williams, one of the researchers, said DAFs are currently hitting the “sweet spot of convenience and connection to nonprofits.” The challenge for any new player, he said, is that it’s a competitive environment with many different options. Plus, he added, many DAFs already are “available-to-everyone vehicles” considering that half run balances under $50,000. “Givers are voting with their feet that DAFs are increasing with popularity. More options are generally better,” Williams said. “Anything that makes sure we maintain or enhance the ease of giving, it makes me happier.” But Direct Relief CEO Amy Weaver, previously the CFO at Salesforce, described GoFundMe’s entrance as “a game changer” that could unlock additional funds. Direct Relief, a nonprofit that supplies free medical resources worldwide, reported receiving more than 18,000 DAF gifts totaling $116 million over the past five years. Weaver acknowledged DAFs have been traditionally used by those with more substantial wealth. But she encouraged people to view them as a “savings account” for “good works.” “And GoFundMe, with its name familiarity and the fact that it really attracts people making smaller gifts, I think could be incredibly powerful if they can bring DAFs to that group of people,” she said.

Title: A public lands sell-off is struck from the GOP policy bill
URL: https://www.denverpost.com/2025/06/30/public-lands-sell-off-gop-policy-bill/
Time Published: 2025-06-30T17:21:44Z

By Maxine Joselow, The New York Times WASHINGTON — Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, said late Saturday that he had dropped his contentious plan to sell millions of acres of public lands from the sweeping domestic policy package that the Senate will soon begin debating. Lee made the nighttime announcement on social media after it became clear that the plan faced insurmountable opposition from within his own party. At least four Republican senators from Western states had said they planned to vote for an amendment to strike the proposal from the bill. The plan had also triggered intense pushback from conservative hunters and outdoorsmen across the American West, who had warned that it threatened the lands where they hunted and fished. “Over the past several weeks, I’ve spent a lot of time listening to members of the community, local leaders and stakeholders across the country,” Lee wrote on the social platform X on Saturday. “While there has been a tremendous amount of misinformation — and in some cases, outright lies — about my bill, many people brought forward sincere concerns.” The provision would have required the Bureau of Land Management to sell as much as 1.225 million acres of public property in 11 Western states. Proponents had argued that the region has a severe shortage of affordable housing and that developers could build new homes on these tracts. In his post, Lee said that, because of the strict rules governing the budgetary process that Republicans are using to pass the bill, he was “unable to secure clear, enforceable safeguards to guarantee that these lands would be sold only to American families — not to China, not to BlackRock, and not to any foreign interests.” It was not immediately clear whether the budgetary process would have allowed Lee to prohibit certain businesses or foreign countries from purchasing land. The process, known as reconciliation, allows bills that affect government revenues to pass the Senate on a simple majority vote, avoiding a filibuster. A spokesperson for Lee did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The four Republicans who opposed the plan were Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy of Montana and Jim Risch and Mike Crapo of Idaho. While opponents acknowledged the housing shortage as a serious problem, they rejected a public lands sell-off as a solution. “One of the greatest gifts we’ve ever had in America is the public lands that have been passed down generation to generation,” Sheehy said in an interview Saturday before the proposal was struck from the package. “Especially for us in Western states, it’s our way of life for hunting and fishing,” he continued. “I believe Mike Lee knows that, too, and I don’t believe he’s acting in bad faith at all.” A previous version of Lee’s plan had called for the BLM and the U.S. Forest Service to sell between 2.2 million and 3.3 million acres of public lands. But the provision was stripped from the bill by the Senate’s parliamentarian, the nonpartisan official who enforces the chamber’s rules. The latest version of the plan would have allowed individuals and companies to buy up to 2 square miles of land at a time, with no limit on how much property they could ultimately purchase. Only land within 5 miles of a population center would have been eligible to be sold. In addition to the four Republican senators who opposed the plan, five House Republicans said Thursday that the land sell-off was a “poison pill” that would cost their votes for the package. The opponents in the House included Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., who led the Interior Department during Trump’s first term. Donald Trump Jr., the president’s eldest son and an avid hunter and outdoorsman, had been publicly silent on Lee’s plan while it was under consideration. But Sunday morning, he wrote on X that the proposal’s withdrawal was a “huge win for our public lands!” Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., celebrated the plan’s demise while warning other lawmakers not to attempt to resurrect it. “To those already plotting to go after our public lands another way: Don’t. Unless you like losing,” Heinrich said in a statement Saturday. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Title: June 2025 in Review

The Site How about now? Is the site loading performance any better now? I opened up a post about the site’s performance on the WP.com support forum and got a response from the team the next day that was basically, “Works on my machine, get lost,” which is honestly the level of support I have come to expect from WP.com over the years. They are absolutely in a mode to deflect all possible complaints on the first try. Still, I was disappointed. I thought I had them because their own speed test tool, which runs on their servers and not my local machine, was reporting problems. But if you run the test enough times eventually you will hit a good patch and it will work. (I finally got it to run, but its results include AI recommendations that were ludicrously wrong. Badly trained AI is worse than no AI.) So I started building up evidence to support a ticket, because I wasn’t giving up and when profiling the site loading it was always the initial response from the server that was the long pole. That is WP.com being bad, that long line I took measurements at different times of day over a few days and I was seeing time between 653ms (acceptable) and 22.4 seconds (WTF?) always backed up at the waiting for response marker. Every time. And then it stopped happening for a while. For about a week the biggest slow down on the profiles was loading the header image… which are not large images at all. So I suspect the JavaScript which does the random header selection is causing that issue, something they absolutely won’t fix because they don’t support their old themes and, as far as I can tell, none of their new themes support such a feature. That points, once again, to a need to change themes to something currently supported, work I am not thrilled to start. I went with a hosted plan rather than hosting the blog myself because I wanted to avoid all this sort of thing. But WP.com cares not for its customers. Then the delays started up again. Same routine. The problem is that “waiting for response” category is a bucket that could be covering for any number of things. It might just be their server being bad. But it could be something else. So I started down the final list of items I had yet to change, landing on the Blog Roll 8.0 sidebar RSS widget. That particular Rube Goldberg setup started as 3.0 back in 2014 as my second attempt to replace Google Reader as the RSS source. (Again, screw Google for killing that app.) I’ve had to patch it and rework it multiple times over the years, and it still had problems. Pinboard, which creates the RSS feed, has always been balky and goes through periods of unreliability, but WP.com used to load that widget after the first screen load. It seems that WP.com made a change and it looks like they won’t load the site unless all widgets have loaded or timed out. So when Pinboard chokes, the site is slow. Very slow. Or that was my theory. To fix that I am on to a new version of the blog roll, using Inoreader, a Feedly competitor, which does the Google Reader thing and lets you get an RSS feed out of a category group. It doesn’t let me format the output the way my Feedly to IFTTT to Pinboard route did, but it does seem more responsive. So I ask again, is the site loading any better now? Or do I need a new theory of the case? Also, a last minute gripe… I turned ads back on again and WP.com broke something because it shouldn’t be showing ads to people logged into WP.com… but the site was showing outlines of where ads should be… which was just as bad as having ads there, but zero revenue. So I turned them off again. Did you see any of that last week? Dammit WP.com, can you just stop screwing things up already? One Year Ago Playable Worlds announced Stars Reach. We also got a launch date for The War Within. The Janthir Wilds expansion for Guild Wars 2 was announced, promising player housing. In a Friday Bullet Points post I summed up the hot summer happenings including the Equinox expansion for EVE Online, the beta for The War Within, Valheim on MacOS, Pax Dei early access, the Tarisland launch, the coming Steam Summer Sale, and the imminent demise of ICQ. That was followed up by another Friday Bullet Points post where I covered Tarisland launching, the Valheim board game, the Throne & Liberty launch date, and the latest Hearthstone expansion that had something to do with ketchup packets. Then I tried Tarisland and said I hated it… mostly due to its control scheme. This upset a few people, so I gave it a try on the iPad. The Anashti Sul special server opened up in EverQuest II. I created some memes about various CCP projects… which were honestly not as harsh as I billed them. I say that because we got the Equinox expansion which was a whole lot of stuff that wasn’t really done yet… and wouldn’t be done for months. At least we got login rewards again and I made a lime green ship SKIN with SKINR. The May MER didn’t look bad, but would the expansion bump up activity? There was also the road to Alliance Tournament XX to consider. Also, the EVE Online app ecosystem seemed to be in decay. However, we did have Ser Fukalite’s ship spinning medal to celebrate. In WoW Classic it was Cataclysm time, and I was in the fragile submarine quest in Vash’jir. Then it was off to Mount Hyjal, and after that Deepholm. The group was doing its first run at Blackrock Caverns Civilization VII was announced. I was still poking around in Valheim looking for The Queen. I eventually found her after a long voyage and slew her… though I had set the server for easy mode at that point. That unlocked my journey to the Ashlands. In my ongoing telephone tales series I wrote about the great failure of VXML, the ascent of enterprise VoIP, Noted imbecile Lars Wingefors declared you couldn’t raise prices on video games. Amazon Games announced an update to New World by trying to make it sound like a brand new console title as they tried to pretend the PC game didn’t exist. I was leafing through the state of the Twitter alternatives. Over on X Elon decided to hide the ability to see who clicked on the like button so his white nationalist fan boys would stopped getting called out for being literal nazis. I was also vanity searching on AI to see if it knew anything about me. There was also a brief mention at the end of the month in review post of something called Fantasy Critic. Did that ever become something? And, as mentioned at the top of this section, there was a Steam Summer Sale. Five Years Ago Our daughter graduated from high school. It was a pandemic graduation, but we made do. My poll about voice chat indicated that Discord now rules that roost. Pokemon Go gave us remote raid passes since we all had to stay home. I was giving Minecraft Dungeons a try. I finished the main story fairly quickly and found the game to be light and fun, but not very deep or replayable. Other reviews were even less charitable. Daybreak was still having problems with their Aradune progression server. We were getting down to the final days of the Battle for Azeroth expansion in World of Warcraft and I was wondering how it would rank in the pantheon of expansions and how much the previous expansion plays into how people feel about the current or next expansion. WoW Classic was still going strong enough that Blizz had to turn layering back on for several realms. There was also the Summer Bowl and the campaign against bots. The instance group was still working on Zul’Farrak, failing the stairs when Sergeant Bly and his crew died. Then, the next time, Bly and his crew survived, but disappeared as we looted the field. My hunter became my first character to hit level 50 in WoW Classic. In EVE Online I was reminding people about why CCP gave Upwell structures asset safety… because they took it away with the Forsaken Fortress update. Another case of people foolishly believing in company promises. So we went out and shot our own abandoned state structures in Delve just to keep other groups from coming along and doing it. Meanwhile, the CCP mineral starvation plan was driving mineral prices to an all time high. (Which would seem comically low a year, two years, and even five years later.) We did, however, get new ships for the EDENCOM faction as part of the Triglavian invasion event as well as a Project Discovery update that moved its focus onto the coronavirus. And we got character log off! People had only been asking for that since forever. The CSM15 elections kicked off, with the results being announced by mid-month. Also a little something about how opaque the game UI can be. Actually in space the GEF was still up north fighting over various objectives. But that all came to a screeching halt when we we found out that most of null sec was planning to gang up against us and invade. They denied it, but then the evidence was found. Our deployment up north ended and we began consolidating the empire into our core space, pulling down the last Keepstar in Cloud Ring before the month was out. World War Bee was coming. We were playing some Minecraft and seeing how villages had changed. I was getting promotions for an Atari branded online casino complete with its own crypto-currency. I guess, as a brand, Atari still has some value. Ten Years Ago There was a cheer for the NBI class of 2015. I was wondering what Turbine would do after they cancelled Infinite Crisis. I was also looking for a summer game to play. After waffling before a live audience, Blizzard finally caved and said there would be flying in Draenor. Remember that time we killed a Mordus Angels Revenant? It seems like everybody has killed one by now. Also in EVE Online we got the Carnyx expansion, which had some of the initial Fozzie Sov features. So we were out sov-wanding station services, though Dominion sov quirks still ruled the day in our fight at ED-9LT. We then headed back north thinking maybe our friends in Querious would come visit us some day… *cough* The coming of Fozzie Sov also meant further consolidation of holdings to make sure we could defend our space. TNT got pushed out to Tribute to share space with the Circle of Two. Tensions between the two alliances started almost right away. And then there was Burn Amarr. I took some screen shots. And I splurged on ship skins. Over at Daybreak they were talking about special servers for EverQuest II at last. It looked like we might get some sort of progression server, for which there was a poll. And then another poll, looking for a name. Meanwhile, over in EverQuest, they were still working on how to deal with raiding on the Ragefire server, and the Ruins of Kunark unlock vote was upon us. I was playing Neko Atsume on the iPad… back when it was only in Japanese! I was also going on about 64-bit OS requirements finally coming to video games and an old grievance of mine. My daughter suddenly wanted to play The Sims. That lasted for about three days. This is why I make her wait a week on any sudden new fad she want to follow. The Steam Summer sale came and went and I bought nothing. That turned out to be the last sale with the traditional daily specials format. I brought up the F2P business model yet again based on a quote over at Massively OP which, if nothing else, got a long comment from Brad McQuaid on the subject. And, finally, I played Minecraft with my daughter for Father’s Day, which led to a whole new adventure in gaming. Fifteen Years Ago Warhammer Online, whose game tips I previously mocked, was out soliciting user written game tips with the most boring video game related video ever. Really, I was embarrassed for them. Meanwhile, there were comical tips to be found in another game. CCP was telling people that the steep learning curve in EVE Online was just part of the game, and Hulkageddon III was on the way. FrontierVille came along, evoking the whole Oregon Trail thing… for which they recently were sued. And a good thing to, as they are a bunch of lying bastards there at Zynga. They never sent me my FarmVille magnet. There was the big news from Turbine with Lord of the Rings Online going Free to Play. I wondered is Lifetime Subscribers like myself would get the shaft in this transition. But Turbine made me a perm VIP instead and put out one of those charts that seems to accompany these multi-level subscription scams structures. But I was winning LOTRO lotteries, so I was happy for the moment. In Pokemon SoulSilver I had beat all the gym leaders, but we were having Pokewalker problems. Then there was Blizzard. Where to start? They were selling WoW Gold straight from the main page. Really. It just isn’t what you think. They screwed up the parental controls interface… in my opinion… along with compromising the security of it. The whole RealID thing was just getting warmed up. One of the accounts in our guild was compromised and the guild bank was looted. That had happened so many times to so many people that wasn’t even news any more. And during all this, the instance group was working its way through The Burning Crusade content with our Horde alts, but we weren’t really feeling it. Ennui had set in and our only hope was Cataclysm. And there were plenty of offers to get us into the beta. Twenty Years Ago In EverQuest II we got the Splitpaw Saga adventure pack. Those of us with Station Access got it as part of the package, while those without had to pay… ten bucks I think. I actually ended up playing through that quite a bit. As early experiment with content that scaled with your levels, it was good from level 20 to level 50. Unfortunately, it never progressed and now every time I end up in the Thundering Steppes with my newer characters the intro quest pops up. Twenty-Five Years Ago Diablo II launched. It enlarged on its predecessor with more classes and a four act storyline that played out over different environments. A pre-digital distribution title, it was awarded a Guinness Book record as the fastest selling video game ever, having shipped and sold one million boxes over the course of the first month. For comparison its 2012 successor, Diablo III, sold 3.5 million copies in the first 24 hours, also setting a Guinness Book record. Shogun: Total War launched, setting down a template that would become the Total War series that is still getting new titles. Microsoft acquired Bungie… and then later spun them off. Then some years later Sony acquired them. Sony’s SOE acquired Verant Interactive, something that simplified the “who is running EverQuest?” question which, at launch, was possibly some sub-group within Sony, 989 Studios, or Verant, a situation reflected in gaming press coverage of the time, where various companies were named, often in the same article. It was all SOE after that… until Daybreak then EG7.

We haven’t played since early November. Meanwhile, some travel meant I only played Pokemon Go for the last few days of the month. It is the only game I play on my phone. (Balatro is iPad only for me, though you can play it on the iPhone. I just need my glasses to do so.) Enshrouded I meant all month to write something about Enshrouded… but never quite got to it. Part of that is because we’re moving forward a bit slowly and because we’re covering some of the same ground about which I have already written. But the latest big update has changed the game enough that I want to cover how much it has changed. I’ll get there. But we are playing it regularly. EVE Online What happens when you have a war and the other side declines to show up? More move ops! I spent quite a bit of time in the game, but not very much of it in combat. I mean, I got on my share of kill mails… but at last check I went on 17 fleets, most of which were moving things, scooping things, or covering people moving and scooping things. War is logistics I guess. Lord of the Rings Online Onward to Mordor! I left off at the very gates of the black land. Soon I will be there. (Well, I have already been at this point, but that post has gone line. Soon!) I played a lot of LOTRO in June, though not as much as May, largely due to increased activity in EVE Online and there being only so many hours in the day. Still, I did log in daily and use up my blue bar and do my tasks. Pokemon Go Since hitting level 48 my main focus has been on completing the tasks required to unlock level 49. Specifically, the 35 platinum medals. I managed to get one more since I leveled up, but I still need 13 more. I am going to need a plan. Meanwhile, my play time was up because it was Pokemon Go fest and we were at the airport waiting for a delayed flight, so we spent quite a bit of time doing raids and tasks. Coming Up I will undoubtedly make it fully into Mordor in Lord of the Rings Online. That will be kind of a big deal for me. Expect a post or three. Meanwhile, WoW Classic might liven up a bit as we’re running down the clock to the long awaited arrival of the Mists of Pandaria expansion. We stopped playing WoW Classic on November 3, 2024, having grown tired of Cataclysm. Will pandas revive our spirits? Am I still subscribed? Find out in July! In New Eden I expect more move ops and such as the Imperium continues to slide east, nestling up against long time rival and foe PanFam. Could sparks fly? But we’ll also be into the Icelandic summer vacation season, so EVE Online might be otherwise quiet. We’ll also be half way through the year, so that will probably get at least one “the year so far…” sort of post out of me. Otherwise I guess it is just hot hobbit summer.

Title: UK Government Pushes Green Finance as Banks Rethink Climate Goals

Both platforms cover financial and business news as well as sport and… More Info The City minister has reaffirmed the government’s ambition for a green transition across the financial services sector, despite the industry pivoting on climate priorities. Speaking at City Week on Monday, Emma Reynolds said: “The UK has a world leading financial and related professional services ecosystem and the research that is needed to integrate sustainable finance.” Reynolds said the Treasury’s upcoming Financial Services Growth and Competitiveness Strategy – a key pillar in the government’s economic agenda – will help foster the UK’s push to “transition finance” through honing in on skills as one of five key areas. But this comes amid a widespread retreat from the financial services sector. The banking industry has been at the forefront of a green row back, with Barclays and Natwest dropping climate targets from their annual bonus schemes for senior executives. Meanwhile, Europe’s biggest lender HSBC slapped a 20-year delay on its net zero target. Energy secretary Ed Miliband has touted plans to “transform” the UK’s financial services sector “into a global hub for green investment”. Whilst London is a leader in the area, City AM reported earlier this year green finance ratings across financial sectors were dramatically reducing. Despite topping the 15th edition of Z/Yen Global Green Finance Index, London’s rating reduced 36 points to 598. The Treasury has said the financial services growth strategy, set to be published on July 15, will “shape the type of growth being pursued, and support net zero, regional growth, and economic security and resilience”. Reynolds, who is steering the Treasury’s plans, said the upcoming COP30 in Brazil will be crucial to green ambitions following last years agreement where governments pledged to scale up climate finance into developing countries to $1.3 trillion per year by 2035. “We think that in order to make this a success, the road map must ensure that it’s based on several principles. It must be inclusive, it must have stability, and it must have focus,” the City minister added. But top names across the sector have vocalised concerns efforts in green finance have stalled. Sandra Boss, the UK Chair at Blackrock, said during a at City Week panel whilst “the need” for investing in renewable energy was “undeniable,” the energy transition was progressing “slower than hoped”. The waning commitment to green finance is being witnessed on a global scale and many have pointed to President Donald Trump’s return to the White House as a key catalyst. One of Trump’s first executive orders following his inauguration in both 2017 and 2025 was to withdraw the US from the Paris Climate Agreement. The document encourages global co-operation to limit the causes of global warming. The World Bank – an international development organisation owned by 187 countries – softened its climate approach after the US took a chainsaw to climate programs.

June 30, 2025 13:00 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, June 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming July 21, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (“DoubleVerify” or the “Company”) (NYSE: DV) common stock between November 10, 2023 and February 27, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR DOUBLEVERIFY INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On May 7, 2024, DoubleVerify released its first quarter 2024 financial results and reduced its 2024 revenue guidance, disclosing that there had been a pullback in customer spending on advertising. On this news, DoubleVerify’s stock price fell $11.79, or 38.6%, to close at $18.78 per share on May 8, 2024, thereby injuring investors. Then, on February 27, 2025, DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending. The Company also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was having a negative impact on the Company. On this news, DoubleVerify’s stock price fell $7.83, or 36%, to close at $13.90 per share on February 28, 2025. Then, on March 28, 2025, Adalytics Research, LLC published a report alleging, among other things, that DoubleVerify’s web advertisement verification and fraud protection services were ineffective and that its customers were regularly billed for ad impressions served to bots. The same day, The Wall Street Journal reported that DoubleVerify regularly missed detection of nonhuman traffic despite the Company’s claims that it helps brands avoid serving ads to nonhuman bot accounts. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (2) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on its Activation Services was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (3) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (4) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (5) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (6) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (7) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired DoubleVerify securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than July 21, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Title: Why Jefferies Thinks Disney Stock Can Keep Climbing

Disney has set the stage for its stock to retouch levels last seen in 2022, Jefferies analysts said. Jefferies on Monday upgraded Disney (DIS) stock from “hold” to “buy," forecasting that its operating income will grow for the first time in nearly a decade. Favorable trends in theme park admission, cruise bookings and streaming subscriptions should contribute to the transition, analysts said. Disney shares were recently up less than 1%, trading for about $123. They’ve gained nearly 11% so far this year, steadily rising since mid-April, when the White House softened its approach to tariffs. Their climb may only be beginning, Jefferies said: It raised its price target for Disney shares to $144—the third highest target shared by analysts who follow Disney and are tracked by Visible Alpha, where the average target is around $131. “Since 2016, [Disney] has juggled several factors … leading to limited [operating income] growth and limited stock appreciation,” Jefferies wrote in a note that credited CEO Bob Iger with improving the company’s outlook. “However, we believe Iger and co. have finally righted the ship, and the drivers ahead can change this dynamic.” Disney plans to add two cruise ships to its fleet in early 2025, which could bolster revenue by about $1 billion to $1.5 billion, according to Jefferies’ estimates. Travel and tourism spending is holding up better than anticipated, which should help Disney’s theme parks, analysts added. The outlook for Disney’s streaming services is also bright, analysts said. Analysts estimate Disney+ can add 5 million subscribers annually over the next few years and boost advertising revenue thanks, in part, to an Amazon (AMZN) partnership that allows for more targeted ads.

(NYSE: DV): If you have held DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: DV) shares since prior to November 10, 2023, and would like to learn more about the investigation and your rights, please visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/doubleverify-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call us at 267-507-6085. Why? As alleged in an underlying securities fraud class action complaint, DoubleVerify, via certain of its officers, failed to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company’s high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the above, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. What You Can Do Now: Current DoubleVerify shareholders who have held DoubleVerify shares since prior to November 10, 2023, can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to them whatsoever.

(NASDAQ: MANH): Grabar Law Office is investigating whether certain officers and directors of Manhattan Associates, Inc. (NASDAQ: MANH) breached their fiduciary duties owed to the company. If you have held Manhattan Associates, Inc. (NASDAQ: MANH) shares since prior to October 22, 2024, and would like to learn more about the investigation and your rights, please visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/manh-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call us at 267-507-6085. Why? A recently filed securities fraud class action complaint alleges that Manhattan Associates, Inc. (NASDAQ: MANH), through certain of its officers, provided investors with material information concerning Manhattan Associates’ expected revenue for the fiscal year 2025. These statements included, among other things, confidence in the Company’s ability to forecast guidance despite macroeconomic fluctuations, the growth potential of their professional services offerings, and the ability for their cloud revenue to drive revenue for its professional services. The underlying complaint alleges that Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Manhattan Associates’ forecasting ability for its professional services; notably, the Company was either not truly equipped to deliver “responsible targets” for growth or, otherwise, Manhattan Associates’ services were not equipped to achieve such targets. Finally, the Complaint alleges that such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Manhattan Associates’ securities at artificially inflated prices. What You Can Do Now: Current Manhattan Associates shareholders who have held Manhattan Associates shares since prior to October 22, 2024, are encourage to visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/manh-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua H. Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call us at 267-507-6085. You can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to you whatsoever. $MANH #ManhattanAssociates Napco Security Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: NSSC) Shareholder Class Action Survives Motion to Dismiss: If you are a Current Napco Security Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: NSSC) shareholder who has held Napco shares since prior to November 7, 2022, you can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to you whatsoever. Click here to join or learn more: https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/Napco-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua H. Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call 267-507-6085. Why? Key allegations in a recently filed securities fraud class action complaint against the company and certain of its officers have survived a motion to dismiss. That complaint alleges that Napco Security Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: NSSC), through certain of its officers and directors, made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Napco failed to address any material weaknesses with internal controls regarding cost of goods sold ("COGS") and inventory; (2) Napco downplayed the severity of material weaknesses regarding their internal controls; (3) Napco’s unaudited financial statements from September 30, 2022 to the present included “certain errors” such as overstating inventory and understanding net COGS, resulting in overstated gross profit, operating income and net income for each period; (4) as a result, Napco would need to restate its previously filed unaudited financial statements for certain periods; and (5) as a result, Defendants’ statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. On April 11, 2025, the federal court determined that key allegations would survive Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint. In so holding, the court determined “Plaintiffs have adequately stated Exchange Act claims by pleading scienter [knowledge of wrongdoing] through defendants’ unusual stock sales and by plausibly alleging loss causation between the corrective announcement and stock price drop. Plaintiffs have also stated Securities Act claims against Napco and the underwriter defendants.” . . . “Taking the well-pleaded facts as true, there is no question that plaintiffs have adequately pled scienter. First, the stock sales were highly unusual in timing and amount. As to amount, the total proceeds of over $108 million from stock sales by the officer defendants weigh in favor of a motive. . . . And the officer defendants sold hefty percentages of their holdings – 48.5% for Soloway and 45.5% for Buchel.” What To Do Now: If you have held Napco shares since before November 7, 2022 and would like to learn more about this matter, please visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/Napco-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua H. Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call 267-507-6085. You can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to you whatsoever. $NSSC #NAPCO Virtu Financial Inc. (NYSE: VIRT) Class Action Survives Motion to Dismiss: A federal securities fraud class action complaint alleging that Virtu Financial Inc. (NYSE: VIRT), and certain of its officers failed to disclose to investors that it had improper safeguards in place for sensitive trader information, has survived a motion to dismiss. Virtu shareholders who have continuously held Virtu shares since prior to November 7, 2018, can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to them whatsoever. Learn more or join by clicking https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/Virtu-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua H. Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call 267-507-6085. WHY: A securities fraud class action complaint alleges that Virtu Financial (NASDAQ: VIRT), via certain of its officers, made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) the Company maintained deficient policies and procedures with respect to its information access barriers; (ii) accordingly, Virtu had overstated the Company’s operational and technological efficacy as well as its capacity to block the exchange of confidential information between departments or individuals within the Company; (iii) the foregoing deficiencies increased the likelihood that the Company would be subject to enhanced regulatory scrutiny; and (iv) as a result, Defendants’ public statements were materially false and/or misleading at all relevant times. On March 17, 2025, a federal Court determined that key allegations were sufficiently pled to survive defendants’ motion to dismiss. According to the Court’s Order, "essentially anyone at Virtu, including its proprietary traders" could directly access this material non-public information from at least January 2018 through April 2019, and to do so, Virtu traders only needed to use a "widely known and frequently shared username and password." WHAT YOU SHOULD DO NOW: If you are a current Virtu shareholder who has held Virtu stock since on or before November 7, 2018, you can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds spent defending litigation back to the company, and a court approved incentive award, at no cost to you whatsoever.

Title: ETF Expert Says Ripple Closing This Chapter Clears The Way For XRP ETF, BlackRock To Join The Race?

Nate Geraci, the president of the ETF store, has weighed in on what Ripple’s decision to drop its cross appeal could mean for XRP ETFs. He also raised the possibility of BlackRock joining the ETF race now that the lawsuit is ending. In an X post, Nate Geraci stated that a closed chapter on the XRP lawsuit clears the way for a spot XRP ETF. His statement suggested that the SEC could now move to approve the applications for issuers to offer this fund. Geraci was reacting to Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s announcement of his firm’s decision to drop its cross-appeal against the SEC. Bitcoinist reported that Garlinghouse stated that Ripple is dropping its cross-appeal and that the SEC is expected to drop its appeal, which will put an end to the XRP lawsuit. He added that they are closing this chapter and focusing on building the Internet of Value. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart had earlier in the year mentioned how the lawsuit impacts an XRP ETF. In an X post, Seyffart opined back then that there is unlikely to be an XRP ETF until the whole XRP lawsuit between the SEC and Ripple is settled. He added that the Commission needed to “untangle that mess” before it possibly proceeds to approve these ETFs. Indeed, the SEC has, up till now, continued to delay its decision on these funds and has yet to provide comments. This is unlike the Solana ETFs, which the Commission had asked issuers to amend, as it prepares to approve these funds. However, once the SEC drops its appeal and formally ends the XRP lawsuit, this could change, with the Commission communicating with XRP ETF issuers on the next steps. Nate Geraci also stated that the end of the XRP lawsuit also clears the way for the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, to file to offer an XRP ETF. Despite already offering Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, the asset manager has yet to file for other crypto ETFs, including one for XRP. This is unlike other Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF issuers, such as Bitwise, which has filed to offer ETFs for XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin, among others. However, as Geraci predicts, that could change soon enough, with BlackRock filing for an XRP ETF. The asset manager would be the eighth to do so if they file for this fund anytime soon. Bloomberg analysts Seyffart and Eric Blachunas predict a 95% chance that the SEC will approve these funds this year. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.19, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Make Fun of Them
URL: https://www.wheresyoured.at/make-fun-of-them/
Time Published: 2025-06-30T15:25:03Z
Full Content:
Have you ever heard Sam Altman speak? I’m serious, have you ever heard this man say words from his mouth? Here is but one of the trenchant insights from Sam Altman in his agonizing 37-minute-long podcast conversation with his brother Jack Altman from last week: When asked why he believes AI will “discover new science,” Altman says that “I think we’ve cracked reasoning in the models,” adding that “we’ve a long way to go,” and that he “think[s] we know what to do,” adding that OpenAI’s o3 model “is already pretty smart,” and that he’s heard people say “wow, this is like a good PHD.” That’s the entire answer! It’s complete nonsense! Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, a company allegedly worth $300 billion to venture capitalists and SoftBank, kind of sounds like a huge idiot! “But Ed!” you cry. “You can’t just call Sam Altman an idiot! He isn’t stupid! He runs a big company, and he’s super successful!” My counter to that is, first, yes I can, I’m doing it right now. Second, if Altman didn’t want to be called stupid, he wouldn’t say stupid shit with a straight face to a massive global audience. My favourite part of the interview is near the beginning: This is a nonsensical conversation, and both of them sound very, very stupid. “So, is this going to make new science or make science faster?” “Yeah, I hear scientists are using AI to go faster [CITATION NEEDED], but if a human scientist goes three times faster [CITATION NEEDED] using my model that would be good. Also I heard from a guy that he heard a guy who did biology who said ‘this helped.’” Phenomenal! Give this guy $40 billion or more dollars every year until he creates a superintelligence, that’ll fucking work. Here are some other incredible quotes from the genius mind of Sam Altman: This is gobbledygook, nonsense, bullshit peddled by a guy who has only the most tangential understanding of the technology his company is building. Every single interview with Sam Altman is like this, every single one, ever since he became a prominent tech investor and founder. Without fail. And the sad part is that Altman isn’t alone in this. Sundar Pichai, when asked one of Nilay Patel’s patented 100-word-plus-questions about Jony Ive and Sam Altman’s new (and likely heavily delayed) hardware startup: The fuck are you on about, Sundar? Your answer to a question about whether you anticipate more competition is to say “yeah I think people are gonna make shit we haven’t come up with and uhh, hardware, can’t wait!” While I think Pichai is likely a little smarter than Altman, in the same way that Satya Nadella is a little smarter than Pichai, and in the same way that a golden retriever is smarter than a chihuahua. That said, none of these men are superintelligences, nor, when pressed, do they ever seem to have any actual answers. Let’s see what Satya Nadella of Microsoft answered when asked about how exactly it’s going to get to (and I paraphrase Dwarkesh Patel’s mealy-mouthed question) $130 billion in AI revenue “through AGI”: This quote has been used as a means of suggesting that Nadella is saying that “generative AI is generating basically no value,” which, while somewhat true, obfuscates its true meaning: Satya Nadella isn’t saying a fucking thing. The question was “how do you get Microsoft to $130 billion in revenue,” and Satya Nadella’s answer was to say “uhhh, abundance, uhhh, explosion, uhhhhh, GDP! Growth! Industrial revolution! Inflation-adjusted! Percentages! The winners will be the people who do stuff, and then productivity will go up!” This is fucking nonsense, and it’s time to stop idolizing these speciously-informed goobers. While kinder souls or Zitron-haters may read this and say “ahh, actually, what Nadella was saying was…” stop. I want to stop you there and suggest that perhaps a smart person should be able to speak clearly enough that their intent is obvious. It’s tempting to believe that there is some sort of intellectual barrier between you and the powerful — that the confusing and obtuse way that they speak is the sound of genius, rather than somebody who has learned a lot of smart-sounding words without ever learning what they mean. “But Ed, they’re trained to do this!” As someone who has media trained hundreds of people, there is only so much you can do to steer someone’s language. You cannot say to Sundar Pichai “hey man, can you sound more confusing?” You can, however, tell them what not to talk about and hope for the best. Sure, you can make them practice, sure, you can give them feedback, but people past a certain stage of power or popularity are going to talk however they want, and if they’re a big stupid idiot pretending to be smart, they’re going to sound exactly like this. Why? Because nobody in the media ever asks them to explain themselves. When you’ve spent your entire career being asked friendly-or-friendly-adjacent questions and never having someone say “wait, what does that mean?” you will continue to mutate in a pseudo-communicator that spits out information-adjacent bullshit. I am, to be clear, being very specific about that question. Powerful CEOs and founders never, ever get asked to explain what they’re saying, even when what they’re saying barely resembles an actual answer. Pichai, Altman and Nadella have always given this kind of empty-brained intellectual slop in response to questions because the media coddles them. These people are product managers and/or management consultants — and in Altman’s case, a savvy negotiator and manipulator known for “an absenteeism that rankled his peers and some of the startups he was supposed to nurture” as an investor at yCombinator, according to the Washington Post. By “coddle,” I mean these people are deliberately engaging in a combination of detective work and amnesia, where the reader or the listener is forced to simultaneously try and divine the meaning of their answer, while also not thinking too hard about the question the interviewer asked. Look at most modern business interviews. They involve a journalist asking a question, somebody giving an answer, and the journalist saying “okay!” and moving onto the next question, occasionally saying “but what about this?” when the appropriate response to many of the answers is to ask them to simplify them so that their meaning is clearer. A common response to all of this is to say that “interviewers can’t be antagonistic,” and I don’t think a lot of people understand what that means. It isn’t “antagonistic” to ask somebody to clearly articulate what they’re saying, nor is it “antagonistic” to say that you don’t understand, or that they didn’t answer the question you asked. If this is “antagonistic” to you, you are, intellectually-speaking, a giant fucking coward, because what you’re suggesting is that somebody cannot ask somebody to explain themselves, which is what an interview is. And I imagine nobody really wants to do this, because if you actually put these people on the spot, you’d realize the dark truth that I spoke of a few weeks ago: that the reason the powerful sound like idiots is because, well, they’re idiots. They sound like Business Idiots and create products to sell to Business Idiots, because Business Idiots run most companies and buy solutions based on what the last Business Idiot told them. To quote the excellent Nik Suresh: I know some of you might read this and say “these people can’t be stupid! These people run companies! They make huge deals! They read all these books!” and my answer is that some of the stupidest people I’ve ever met have read more books than you or I will read in a lifetime. While they might be smart when it comes to corporate chess moves or saying “this product category should do this,” none of these men — not Altman, Pichai or Nadella — actually has a hand in the design or creation of any of the things their companies make, and they never, ever have. Regardless, I have a larger point: it’s time to start mocking these people and tearing down their legends as geniuses of industry. They are not better than us, nor are they responsible for anything that their companies build other than the share price (which is a meaningless figure) and the accumulation of power and resources. These men are neither smart nor intellectually superior, and it’s time to start treating them as such. These people are powerful because they have names that are protected by the press. They are powerful because it is seen as unseemly to mock them because they are rich and “running a company,” a kind of corporate fealty that I find deeply unbecoming of an adult. We are, at most, customers. We do not “owe them” anything. We are long past the point when any of the people running these companies actually invented anything they sell. iIf anything, they owe us something, because they are selling us a product, even if said product is free and monetised by advertising. While reporters — as anyone — should have some degree of professionalism in interviews or covering subjects, there is no reason to treat these people as special, even if they have managed to raise a lot of money or their product is popular, because if that were the case we’d have far more coverage of defense contractor Lockheed Martin. It made $1.71 billion in profit last quarter, and hasn’t had a single quarter under a billion dollars in the last year. I’m being a little glib, but the logic behind covering OpenAI is, at this point, “it makes a lot of money and its product is popular,” which is also a fitting description of Lockheed Martin. The difference is that OpenAI has a consumer product that loses billions of dollars, and Lockheed Martin has products that makes billions of dollars by removing consumers from the Earth. Both of them are environmentally destructive. Covering OpenAI sure doesn’t seem to be about the tech, because if you looked at the tech you’d have to understand the tech, you’d see that the user numbers weren’t there outside of the 500 million people using ChatGPT, of which very few are actually paying for the product, and that the term “user” encompasses everything from the most occasional users who log in out of curiosity, to people who are actually using it as part of their daily lives. If covering OpenAI was about the tech, you’d read about how the tech itself doesn’t seem to have a ton of mass-market use cases, and those use cases aren’t really the kind of things that you’d pay for. If they did, there’d be articles that definitively discussed them versus articles in the New York Times about “everybody using AI” that boil down to “I use ChatGPT as search now” and “I heard a guy who asked it to teach him about modern art.” Yet men like Dario Amodei and Sam Altman continue to be elevated because they are “building the future,” even if they don’t seem to have built it yet, or have the ability to clearly articulate what that future actually looks like. Anthropic has now put out multiple stories suggesting that its generative AI will “blackmail” people as a means of stopping a user from turning off the system, something which is so obviously the company prompting its models to do so. Every member of the media covering this uncritically should feel ashamed of themselves. Sadly, this is all a result of the halo effect of being a Guy Who Raised Money or Guy Who Runs Big Company. We must, as human beings, assume that these people are smart, and that they’d never mislead us, because if we accept that they aren’t smart and that they willingly mislead us, we’d have to accept that the powerful are, well, bad and possibly unremarkable. And if they’re untrustworthy people that don’t seem that smart, we have to accept that the world is deeply unfair, and caters to people like them far more than it caters to people like us. We do not owe Satya Nadella any respect because he’s the CEO of Microsoft. If anything, we should show him outright scorn for the state of Microsoft products. Microsoft Teams is an insulting mess that only sometimes works, leaving workers spending 57% of their time either in Teams Chat, Teams Meetings or sending emails according to a Microsoft study. MSN.com is an abomination read by hundreds of millions of people a month, bloated with intrusive advertisements, attempts to trick you into downloading an app, and quasi-content that may or may not be AI generated. There are few products on the modern internet that show more contempt for the user -- other than, of course, Skype, a product that Microsoft let languish for more than a decade, the product so thoroughly engorged with spam that leaving it unattended for more than a month left you with a hundred unread messages from Eastern European romance scammers. Microsoft finally killed it in May. Products like Word and Excel don’t need improving, but that doesn’t stop Microsoft from trying, bloating them with odd user interface choices and forcing users to fight with popups to use an AI-powered Copilot that most of them hate. Why, exactly, are we meant to show these people respect? Because they run a company that provides a continually-disintegrating service? Because that service has such a powerful monopoly that it’s difficult to leave it if you’re interacting with other people or businesses? I think it’s because we live in Hell. The modern tech ecosystem is so utterly vile. Every single day our tech breaks in new and inventive ways, our iPhones resetting at random, random apps not accepting button presses, our Bluetooth disconnecting, our word processors harassing us to “try and use AI” while no longer offering us suggestions for typos, and our useful products replaced with useless shit, like how Google’s previously-functional assistants were replaced with generative AI that makes them tangibly worse so that Google can claim it has 350 million monthly active Gemini users. Yet the tech and business media acts as if everything is fine. It isn’t fine! It’s all really fucked! You can call me a cynic or a pessimist or every name under the sun, but the stakes have never been higher, and the damage never more wide-spread. Everything feels broken, and covering these companies as if it isn’t is insulting to your readers and your own intelligence. Look at the state of your computer or phone and tell me anything feels congruent or intentional rather than an endless battle of incentives. Look at the notifications on your phone and count the number of them that have absolutely nothing to do with information you actively need. As we speak, I have a notification from Adobe Lightroom, an app I use occasionally to edit photos, that tells me “Elevate any scene - now enhance people, sky, water and more with Quick Actions.” Zerocam, an app that brands itself “the first anti-AI camera app” where you “capture moments, not megapixels,” gave me a notification asking if I took a photo today. Amazon notified me that there is a deal picked just for me — a battery pack that I bought several months ago. Every single company that sends notifications like these should be mocked, but we have accepted such vile conditions as the norm. Apple should be tarred and feathered for allowing companies to send spam notifications, and yet it isn’t because, by and large, Apple is less vile and less exploitative than Microsoft, Google or Amazon. If you are reading this as a member of the tech press, seriously, please look at your daily experience with tech. Count the number of times that your day or a task is interrupted by poorly-designed software or hardware (such as the many, many times Zoom or Teams has a problem with Bluetooth, or a website just doesn’t load, or you type something into your browser and it just doesn’t do anything), or when the software you use either actively impedes you (hey, did you want to use AI? No? You sure?) or refuses to work in a logical way (see: Google Drive). There are tens of thousands of stories like this every day, and if you talked to people, you’d see how widespread it is…or maybe, I dunno, see that it’s happening to you too? There are people responsible, and the tech media writes about them every day. I realize it seems weird to constantly write that a company is releasing broken, convoluted software, but hey, if we can write 300,000 stories about how crime-ridden New York City is, why can’t we write three of them about how fucked Microsoft Office or Google Search have become? And why can’t we talk to the people in power about it? Is it because the questions are too hard to ask? Is it because it feels icky to interrupt Satya Nadella as he waffles on about using Copilot all the time by saying “hey man, Microsoft Teams is broken, tons of people feel this way, why?” or “why have you let MSN.com turn into a hub of AI slop and outright disinformation?” Oh no! You won’t get your access! Wahh! Who cares? Write a story about how Microsoft has become so unbelievably profitable as its products get worse, and talk about how weird and bad that is for the world! Ask Nadella those tough questions, or publish that Microsoft’s PR wouldn’t let you! These people are neither articulate nor wise, and whatever “intelligence” they may claim to have doesn’t seem to manifest in good products or intelligent statements. So why treat them like they’re smart? Why show them deference or pleasantries? These people have crapped up our digital lives at scale, and they deserve contempt, or at the very least a stern fucking reception. I realize I’m repeating points I’ve made again and again, but why is there such a halo around these fucking bozos? I’m serious! Why are we so protective of these guys? We’re more than happy to criticise celebrities, musicians, professional sports players, and politicians (fucking barely), but the business class is somehow protected outside of the occasional willingness to say that Elon Musk might have sort have done something wrong. I’m not denying there are critics. We have Molly White, Edward Ongweso Jr, Brian Merchant and — at a major outlet like CNN, no less! — one of the greatest living business writers in Allison Morrow. I believe that tech criticism is a barely-explored and hugely-profitable industry if we treated tech journalism less like the society pages and more like a force to hold the most powerful people in the world accountable as they continually harm billions of people in subtle ways. People are angry, and they aren’t stupid, and they want to see that anger reflected in the stories they read — and the meek deference we show to dumb fucking tech leaders is the opposite of that. As I’ve said before: we live in an era of digital tinnitus, nagged by notifications, warring with software ostensibly built for us that acts as if we’re the enemy. And if we’re the enemy, we should treat those building this software as the enemy in return. We are their customers, and they have failed us. The entire approach to business owners, especially in tech, is ridiculous. These people are selling us a product and the product fucking stinks! Put aside however you feel about generative AI for a second and face one very simple point: it doesn’t do enough, it’s really not cool at all, and we’re being forced to use it. I realize that some of you may want them to succeed, or want to be the person who tells everybody that they did so. I get that there are rewards for you — promotions, new positions, TV appearances repeating exactly what the powerful did and why they did it, or a plush role as that company’s head of communications — but I am telling you, your readers and viewers are waking up to it, and they feel like you have contempt for them and contempt for the truth. It’s easy — and common! — to try and dismiss my work as some sort of hater’s screed, a “cynical” approach to a tech industry that’s trying “brave new things” or whatever. In my opinion, there’s nothing more cynical than watching billions of people get shipped increasingly-shitty and expensive solutions and then get defensive of the people shipping them, and hostile to the people who are complaining that the products they use suck. I am angry at these companies because they have, at scale, torn down a tech industry that allowed me to be who I am today, and their intentional and disgraceful moves fill me full of disgust. I have watched the tech media move away from covering “technology” and more toward covering the people behind it, to the point that the actual outputs — the software and hardware we use every day — have taken a backseat to stories about whether Elon Musk does or doesn’t use a computer, which is meaningless, empty gossip journalism built to be shared by peers and nothing else. And please, please do not talk about optimism. If you are blindly saying that everything OpenAI does is cool and awesome and interesting, you aren’t being optimistic — you’re telling other people to be optimistic about a company’s success. It isn’t “optimistic” to believe that a company is going to build powerful AI despite it failing to do so. It’s propaganda, and yes, this is also the case if you simply don’t do the research to form a real opinion. I am not a pessimist because I criticize these companies, and framing me as one is cowardly and ignorant. If you are so weak-willed and speciously-informed that you can’t see somebody criticise a company without outright dismissing them as “a hater” or “pessimist,” you are an insult to journalism or analysis, and you know it in your wretched little heart. My heart sings with a firm belief in the things I think, founded on rigorous structures of knowledge that I’ve gained from reading things and talking to people, because something in me is incapable of being swayed by something just because everybody else is. You are assuming people are right because it is inconvenient and uncomfortable to accept they may not be, because doing so requires you to reckon with a market-wide hysteria founded on desperation and a lack of hyper-growth markets left in the tech industry. Worse still, in engaging with faux-optimism, you are failing to protect your readers and the general public. And if that’s what you want to do, ask yourself why! Why do you want these companies to win? What is it you want them to win? Do you want them to be rich? Do you want to be the person that told people they would be first? What is the world you want, and what does it look like, and how does doing your job in this way work toward creating that world? This isn’t optimism — it’s horse-trading, or strategic alignment behind powerful entities. It is choosing a side, because your side isn’t with the reader or the truth. If it was — even if you believed generative AI was powerful and that they simply didn’t understand — your duty would be to educate the reader in a clear-set and obvious way, and if you can’t find a way to do so, acknowledging that and explaining why. True optimism requires you to have a deep, meaningful understanding of things so that you can engage in real hope — a magical feeling, one that can buoy you in the most challenging times. What many claim is “optimism” is actually blind faith, the likes of which you’ll see at a roulette table. Or, of course, knowingly peddling propaganda. Let’s even take a different tact: say you actually want these companies to “build powerful AI,” and believe they’re smart enough to do so. Say that, somehow, looking at their decaying finances, the lack of revenue, the lack of growth, and the remarkable lack of use cases, you still come out of it saying “sure, I think they’re going to do this!” How? Why haven’t they done it yet? Why, three years in, are we still unable to describe what ChatGPT actually does, and why we need it? Take away how much money OpenAI makes for a second (and, indeed, how much it loses). Does this product actually really inspire anything in you? What is it that’s magical about this? And, on a business level, what is it I’m meant to be impressed by, exactly? OpenAI has — allegedly — hit “$10 billion in annualized revenue” (essentially the biggest month it can find, multiplied by 12), which is…not that much, really, considering it’s the most prominent company in the software world, with the biggest brand, and with the attention of the entirety of the world’s media. It has, allegedly, 500 million weekly active users — and, by the last count, only 15.5 million paying subscribers, an absolutely putrid conversion rate even before you realize that the actual conversion rate would be monthly active subscribers. That’s how any real software company actually defines its metrics, by the fucking way. Why is this impressive? Because it grew fast? It literally had more PR and more marketing and more attention and more opportunities to sell to more people than any company has ever had in the history of anything. Every single industry has been told to think about AI for three years, and they’ve been told to do so because of a company called OpenAI. There isn’t a single god damn product since Google or Facebook that has had this level of media pressure, and both of those companies launched without the massive amount of media (and social media) that we have today. Having literally everybody talking about your product all the time for years is pretty useful! Why isn’t it making more money? Why are we taking any of these people seriously? Mark Zuckerberg paid $14.3 billion for Scale AI, an AI data company, as a means of hiring its CEO Alexandr Wang to run his “superintelligence” team, has been offering random OpenAI employees $100 million to join Meta, thought about buying both AI search company Perplexity and generative video company Runway and even tried to buy OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever’s pre-product “$32bn valuation” non-company Safe Superintelligence, settling instead on hiring its CEO Daniel Gross and buying his venture fund for some fucking reason. When you put aside the big numbers, these are the actions of a desperate dimwit with a failing product trying to buy his way to making generative AI into a “superintelligence,” something that Meta’s own Chief AI scientist Yan LeCun says isn’t going to work. By assuming that there is some sort of grand strategy behind these moves beyond “if we get enough smart people together something will happen,” you help boost the powerful’s messaging and buoy their stock valuations. You are not educating anybody by humouring these goofballs. In fact, the right way to approach this would be to ask why Meta, a multi-trillion dollar market cap company with a near-monopoly over all social media, is spending billions of dollars in what appears to be a totally irresponsible way. Instead, people are suggesting this is Mark Zuckerberg’s genius at work. Anyway, putting that aside, what exactly is the impressive part of generative AI again? The fucking code? Enough about the code, I’m tired of hearing about the code, I swear to god you people think that being a software engineer is only coding and that it’s fine if you ship “mediocre code,” as if bad code can’t bring down entire organizations. What do you think a software engineer does? Is all they do code? If you think the answer is yes, you are wrong! Human beings may make mistakes in writing code, but they at least know what a mistake looks like, which a generative AI does not, because a generative AI doesn’t know what anything is, or anything at all, because it is a probabilistic model. Congratulations! You made another way in which software engineers can automate parts of their jobs — stop being so fucking excited about the idea that people are going to lose their livelihoods! It’s nasty, and founded on absolutely nothing other than your adulation for the powerful! These models are dangerous and chaotic, built with little intention or regard for the future, just like the rest of big tech’s products. ChatGPT would’ve been a much smaller deal if Google had any interest in turning Google Search into a product that truly answered a query (as opposed to generating more of them to show more impressions to advertisers) — a nuanced search engine that took a user’s query and spat out a series of websites that might help answer said question rather than just summarising a few of them for an answer. And if you ever need proof that Google just doesn’t know how to fucking innovate anymore, look at AI Summaries, a product that both misunderstands search and why people use ChatGPT as a search replacement. While OpenAI may “summarise” stuff to give an answer, it at the very least gives something approximating a true answer, rather than a summary that feels like an absentee parent trying to get rid of you and then throwing you $20 in the hopes you’ll leave them alone. If Google Search truly evolved, ChatGPT wouldn’t really matter, because the idea of a machine that can theoretically answer a question is kind of why people used fucking Google in the fucking first place. Again, why are we not describing this company as the business equivalent of a banana republic? It’s actively making its shit worse to juice growth, and it’s really obvious how badly it sucks. Why doesn’t the state of Google dominate tech news, just like how random ketamine-fuelled tweets from Elon Musk do? Why aren’t we, collectively, repulsed by Google as a company? Why aren’t we, collectively, repulsed by OpenAI? No matter how big ChatGPT is, the fact that there’s a product out there with hundreds of millions of users that constantly gets answers wrong is a genuinely worrying thing for society, and that’s before you get to the environmental damage, the fact it trained its models on millions of people’s art and writing, and oh, I dunno, the fact it plans to lose over a hundred billions of dollars before becoming profitable? Why are we not more horrified? Why are we not more forlorn that this is where hundreds of billions of dollars are being forced? The most prominent company in the tech industry is an unstable monolith with a vague product that can only make $10 billion a year (revenue, not profit) as the very fabric of its existence is shoved down the throat of every executive in the world at once. Also, if it’s not fed $20 billion to $40 billion a year, it will die. Give me a fucking break. I don’t know, I sound pretty ornery, I get accused of being a hater or missing the grand mystery of this bullshit every few minutes by somebody with an AI avatar of a guy who looks like he’s banned from multiple branches of Best Buy, I understand there’s things that people do with Large Language Models, I am aware, but none of it matters because the way they’re being discussed is like we’re two steps from digitally replacing hundreds of millions of people. The reality is far simpler: we have an industry that has spent nearly half a trillion dollars between its capital expenditures and venture capital funding to create another industry with the combined revenue of the fucking smartwatch industry. What I’m writing isn’t inflammatory — in fact, it’s far more deeply rooted in reality than those claiming that OpenAI is building the future. Let’s do some fucking mathematics! Projected Big Tech Capital Expenditures in 2025 and revenue from AI: That’s $327 billion this year, with a total revenue of…what, $18 billion of revenue? And that’s not profit! And that’s if we include OpenAI’s spend on Azure. Even if every single one of these companies was making $18 billion in revenue a year from this it wouldn’t be great, but it’s more than likely that these chunderfucks can’t even pull together the projected revenue ($32 billion) of the global smartwatch industry! What a joke! “Wuhh, but what about OpenAI?” What about OpenAI? I’ve written about this so much. So what, OpenAI makes $12.7 billion this year, but loses $14 billion, what does that mean to you, exactly? What’re you going to say? The cost of inference is coming down? No, the cost that people are being charged is going down, we have no firm data on the actual costs because the companies don’t want to talk about it, and yes, it will absolutely lower prices to compete with other companies. The Information just reported that OpenAI was doing this to compete with Microsoft last week! Hey, quick question — wasn’t SoftBank meant to spend $3 billion annually on OpenAI’s software? Did that happen? Anyway, even if we add OpenAI’s revenue to the pot, we are at $30.7 billion. If we add the supposed $1 billion in revenue from training data startup Surge, $300 million in “annualized revenue” from Turing, optimistically assume that Perplexity will have $100 million (up from $34 million in 2024, where it burned $65 million) in revenue in 2025, and assume that Anysphere’s (which makes Cursor) $200 million run rate stays consistent through 2025, we are at…$32.3 billion. But I'm not being fair, am I? I didn’t include many of the names from The Information’s generative AI database. Prepare yourself, this is gonna be annoying! So let's add some more. We’ve got $3 billion from Anthropic, $870 million from Scale (now part of Meta), another alleged $300 million for Anysphere (The Information claims $500 million in ARR), we consider Neo4j’s “>$200 million ARR” to mean “$200 million,” Midjourney’s “>$200 million ARR” to mean $200m, Ironclad’s “>$150 million ARR” to mean $150 million ARR, Glean’s $103 million ARR, Together AI’s $100 million ARR, Moveworks’ $100 million ARR, Abridge’s $100 million ARR, Synthesia’s $100 million ARR, WEKA’s “>$100 million ARR” to mean $100m ARR, Windsurf’s $100m ARR, Runway’s $84 million ARR, Elevenlabs’ “>$100m ARR” to mean $100m ARR, Cohere’s $70m ARR, Jasper’s “>$60m ARR” to mean $60m, Harvey’s $50m ARR, Ada’s “>$50m ARR” to mean $50m, Photoroom’s $50m ARR…and then assumed the combined ARR of the remainders are somewhere in the region of a very generous $200m, we get… Less than $39 billion dollars of total revenue in the entire generative AI industry. Jesus fucking christ! According to The Information, generative AI companies have raised more than $18.8 billion in the first quarter of 2025, after investing $21 billion in Q4 2024 and $4 billion in Q3 2024 for a grand total of $43.8 billion, or a total of $370.8 billion of investment and capital expenditures for an industry that, despite being the single-most talked about thing on the planet, cannot even create a tenth of the dollars it requires to make it work. These companies are predominantly unprofitable, perpetually searching for product-market fit, and even when they find it, seem incapable of generating revenue numbers that remotely justify their valuations. If I’m honest, I think the truly radical position here is the one taken by most tech reporters that would rather take the lazy position of “well Uber lost a lot of money!” than think for two seconds about whether we’re all being sold a line of shit. What we’re watching is a mountain of waste perpetuated by the least-charming failsons of our generation. Nobody should be giving Satya Nadella or Sam Altman a glossy profile — they should be asking direct, brutal questions, much like Joanna Stern just did of Apple’s Craig Federighi, who had absolutely fucking nothing to share because he has never been pushed like this. Put aside the money for a second and be honest: these men are pathetic, unimpressive, uninventive, and dreadfully, dreadfully boring. Anthropic’s Wario (Sorry, Dario) Amodei and OpenAI’s Sam Altman have far more in common with televangelist Joel Olstein than they’ll ever have with Steve Jobs or any number of people that have actually invented things, and they got that way because we took them seriously instead of saying “wait, what do you mean?” To a single one of their wrongheaded, oafish and dim-witted hype-burps. It’s boring! I’m terribly, horribly bored, and if you’re interested in this shit I am genuinely curious why, especially if you’re a reporter, because right now the “innovation” happening in AI is, at best, further mutations of the Software As A Service business model, providing far less value than previous innovations at a calamitous cost. Reasoning models don’t even reason, as proven by an Apple paper released a few weeks ago, and agents as a concept are fucked because large language models are inherently unreliable — and yes, a study out of fucking Salesforce found that agents began to break down when given multi-step tasks, such as “any task you’d want to have an agent automate.” So, here’s my radical suggestion: start making fun of these people. They are not charming. They are not building anything. They have scooted along amassing billions of dollars promising the world and delivering you a hill of dirt. They deserve our derision — or, at the very least, our deep, unerring suspicion, if not for what they’ve done, but for what they’ve not done. Sam Altman is nowhere near delivering a functioning agent, let alone anything approaching intelligence, and really only has one skill: making other companies risk a bunch of money on his stupid ideas. No, really! He convinced Oracle to buy $40 billion of NVIDIA chips to put in the Abilene Texas “Stargate” data center, despite the fact that the Stargate organization has yet to be formed (as reported by The Information). SoftBank and Microsoft pay all of OpenAI’s bills, and the media does his marketing for him. OpenAI is, as I said, quite literally a banana republic. It requires the media and the markets to make up why it has to exist, it requires other companies to pump it full of money and build its infrastructure, and it doesn’t even make products that matter, with Sam Altman constantly talking about all the exciting shit other people will build. You can keep honking about how “it built the API that will power the future,” but if that’s the case, where’s the fucking future, exactly? Where is it? What am I looking at here? Where’s the economic activity? Where’s the productivity? The returns suck! The costs are too high! Why am I the radical person for saying this? This entire situation is absolutely god damn ridiculous, an incomparable waste even if it somehow went in the green. For the horrendous amounts of capital invested in generative AI to make sense, the industry would have to have revenue that dwarfed the smartphone and enterprise SaaS market combined, rather than less than half of that of the mobile gaming industry. Satya Nadella, Sam Altman, Wario Amodei, Tim Cook, Andy Jassy — they deserve to be laughed at, mocked, or at the very least interrogated vigorously, because their combined might has produced no exciting or interesting products outside of, at best, what will amount to a productivity upgrade for integrated development environments and faster ways to throw out code that may or may not be reliable. These things aren’t nothing, but they’re nowhere near the something that we’re being promised. So I put it to you, dear reader: why are we taking them seriously? What is there to take seriously other than their ability to force stuff on people? And I’ll leave you with a question: how do they manage to keep doing this, exactly? They always seem to find new growth, every single quarter, without fail? Is it because they keep coming up with new ideas? Or is it because they come up with new ideas to get more money, a vastly different choice that involves increasing the prices of products or making them worse so that they can show you more advertisements. My positions are not radical, and if you believe they are, your deference to the powerful disgusts me. In any case, I want to end this with something inspirational, because I believe that things change when regular people feel stronger and more capable. I want you to know that you are fully capable of understanding all of this. I don’t care if you “aren’t a numbers person” or “don’t get business.’ I don’t have a single iota of economics training, and everything you’ve ever read me write has been something I’ve had to learn. I was a layperson right up until I learned the stuff, then I became a stuff-knower, just like you can be. The tech industry, the finance industry, the entire mechanisms of capitalism want you to believe that everything they do is magical and complex, when it’s all far more obvious than you’d believe. You don’t have to understand the entire fundamentals of finance to know how venture capital works — they buy percentages of companies at a valuation that they hope is much lower than the company would be worth in the future. You don’t need to be technical to know that Large Language Models generate a response based on billions of pieces of training data, and by guessing at what the next bit of text in a line should be based on what it’s seen previously. These people love to say “ah, but didn’t you see-” and present an anecdote, when no anecdote will ever defeat the basics of “your business doesn’t make any money, the software doesn’t do the things you claim it’s meant to, and you have no path to profitability.” They can yammer at you all they want about “lots of people using ChatGPT,” but that doesn’t change the fact that ChatGPT just isn’t that revolutionary, and their only play here is to make you feel stupid rather than actually showing you why it’s so fucking revolutionary. This is the argument of a manipulator and a coward, and you are above such things. You don’t really have to be a specialist in anything to pry this shit apart, which is why so much of my work is either engaging to those who learn something from it or frustrating to those that intentionally deceive others through gobbledygook hype-schpiel. I will sit here and explain every fucking part of this horrid chain of freaks, and break it down into whatever pieces it takes to educate as many people as I have to to make things change. I also must be clear that I am nobody. I started writing this newsletter with 300 subscribers and no reason other than the fact I wanted to, and four years later I have nearly 64,000 subscribers and an award-winning podcast. I have no economics training, no special access, no deep sources, just the ability to look at things that are happening and say stuff. I taught myself everything I know about this industry, and there is nothing stopping you from doing the same. I was convinced I was stupid until around two years ago, though if I’m honest it might have been last year. I have felt othered the majority of my life, convinced by people that I am incapable or unwelcome, and as I’ve become more articulate and confident in who I am and what I believe in, I have noticed that the only people that seek to degrade or suppress are those of weak minds and weaker wills — Business Idiots in different forms and flavors. I have learned to accept who I am — that I am not like most people — and people conflate my passion and vigor with anger or hate, when what they’re experiencing is somebody different who deeply resents what the powerful have done to the computer. And while I complain about the state of media, what I’ve seen in the last year is that there are many, many people like me — both readers and peers — that resent things in the same way. I conflated being different with being alone, and I couldn’t be more wrong. For those of you that don’t wish to lick the boots of the people fucking up every tech product, the tent is large, it’s a big club, and you’re absolutely in it. A better tech industry is one where the people writing about it hold it accountable, pushing it toward creating the experiences and connectivity that truly change the world rather than repeating and reinforcing the status quo. Don’t watch the mouth, watch the hands. These companies will tell you that they’re amazing as many times as they want, but you don’t need to prove that — they do. I don’t care if you tell a single human soul about my work, but if it helps you understand these people better, use it to teach other people. These people may seem all-powerful, but they’ve built the Rot Economy on a combination of anonymity and a placant press, but pressure against them starts with you and those you know understanding how their businesses work, and trusting that you can understand because you absolutely can. Millions of people understanding how these people run their companies and how poorly they’ve built their software will stop people like Sundar Pichai from being able to quietly burn Google Search to the ground. People like Sam Altman are gambling that you are easily-confused, easily-defeated and incurious, when you could be writing thousands of words on a newsletter that you never, ever edit for brevity. You can understand every fucking part of their business — the economics of OpenAI, the flimsy promises of Salesforce, the destruction of Google Search — and you can tell everybody you know about it, and suddenly it won’t be so easy for these wretched creeps to continue thriving. I know it sounds small, and like your role is even smaller, but the reason they’ve grown so rapaciously is driven by the sense that the work they do is some sort of black magic, when it’s really fucking stupid and boring finance stapled onto a tech industry that’s run out of ideas. You are more than capable of understanding this entire world — including the technology, along with the finances that ultimately decide what technology gets made next. These people have got rich and famous and escaped all blame by casting themselves as somehow above us, when if I’m honest, I’ve never looked down on somebody quite as much as I do the current gaggle of management consultant fucks that have driven Silicon Valley into the ground.

Title: Make Fun of Them

Full Content:
Have you ever heard Sam Altman speak? I’m serious, have you ever heard this man say words from his mouth? Here is but one of the trenchant insights from Sam Altman in his agonizing 37-minute-long podcast conversation with his brother Jack Altman from last week: When asked why he believes AI will “discover new science,” Altman says that “I think we’ve cracked reasoning in the models,” adding that “we’ve a long way to go,” and that he “think[s] we know what to do,” adding that OpenAI’s o3 model “is already pretty smart,” and that he’s heard people say “wow, this is like a good PHD.” That’s the entire answer! It’s complete nonsense! Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, a company allegedly worth $300 billion to venture capitalists and SoftBank, kind of sounds like a huge idiot! “But Ed!” you cry. “You can’t just call Sam Altman an idiot! He isn’t stupid! He runs a big company, and he’s super successful!” My counter to that is, first, yes I can, I’m doing it right now. Second, if Altman didn’t want to be called stupid, he wouldn’t say stupid shit with a straight face to a massive global audience. My favourite part of the interview is near the beginning: This is a nonsensical conversation, and both of them sound very, very stupid. “So, is this going to make new science or make science faster?” “Yeah, I hear scientists are using AI to go faster [CITATION NEEDED], but if a human scientist goes three times faster [CITATION NEEDED] using my model that would be good. Also I heard from a guy that he heard a guy who did biology who said ‘this helped.’” Phenomenal! Give this guy $40 billion or more dollars every year until he creates a superintelligence, that’ll fucking work. Here are some other incredible quotes from the genius mind of Sam Altman: This is gobbledygook, nonsense, bullshit peddled by a guy who has only the most tangential understanding of the technology his company is building. Every single interview with Sam Altman is like this, every single one, ever since he became a prominent tech investor and founder. Without fail. And the sad part is that Altman isn’t alone in this. Sundar Pichai, when asked one of Nilay Patel’s patented 100-word-plus-questions about Jony Ive and Sam Altman’s new (and likely heavily delayed) hardware startup: The fuck are you on about, Sundar? Your answer to a question about whether you anticipate more competition is to say “yeah I think people are gonna make shit we haven’t come up with and uhh, hardware, can’t wait!” While I think Pichai is likely a little smarter than Altman, in the same way that Satya Nadella is a little smarter than Pichai, and in the same way that a golden retriever is smarter than a chihuahua. That said, none of these men are superintelligences, nor, when pressed, do they ever seem to have any actual answers. Let’s see what Satya Nadella of Microsoft answered when asked about how exactly it’s going to get to (and I paraphrase Dwarkesh Patel’s mealy-mouthed question) $130 billion in AI revenue “through AGI”: This quote has been used as a means of suggesting that Nadella is saying that “generative AI is generating basically no value,” which, while somewhat true, obfuscates its true meaning: Satya Nadella isn’t saying a fucking thing. The question was “how do you get Microsoft to $130 billion in revenue,” and Satya Nadella’s answer was to say “uhhh, abundance, uhhh, explosion, uhhhhh, GDP! Growth! Industrial revolution! Inflation-adjusted! Percentages! The winners will be the people who do stuff, and then productivity will go up!” This is fucking nonsense, and it’s time to stop idolizing these speciously-informed goobers. While kinder souls or Zitron-haters may read this and say “ahh, actually, what Nadella was saying was…” stop. I want to stop you there and suggest that perhaps a smart person should be able to speak clearly enough that their intent is obvious. It’s tempting to believe that there is some sort of intellectual barrier between you and the powerful — that the confusing and obtuse way that they speak is the sound of genius, rather than somebody who has learned a lot of smart-sounding words without ever learning what they mean. “But Ed, they’re trained to do this!” As someone who has media trained hundreds of people, there is only so much you can do to steer someone’s language. You cannot say to Sundar Pichai “hey man, can you sound more confusing?” You can, however, tell them what not to talk about and hope for the best. Sure, you can make them practice, sure, you can give them feedback, but people past a certain stage of power or popularity are going to talk however they want, and if they’re a big stupid idiot pretending to be smart, they’re going to sound exactly like this. Why? Because nobody in the media ever asks them to explain themselves. When you’ve spent your entire career being asked friendly-or-friendly-adjacent questions and never having someone say “wait, what does that mean?” you will continue to mutate in a pseudo-communicator that spits out information-adjacent bullshit. I am, to be clear, being very specific about that question. Powerful CEOs and founders never, ever get asked to explain what they’re saying, even when what they’re saying barely resembles an actual answer. Pichai, Altman and Nadella have always given this kind of empty-brained intellectual slop in response to questions because the media coddles them. These people are product managers and/or management consultants — and in Altman’s case, a savvy negotiator and manipulator known for “an absenteeism that rankled his peers and some of the startups he was supposed to nurture” as an investor at yCombinator, according to the Washington Post. By “coddle,” I mean these people are deliberately engaging in a combination of detective work and amnesia, where the reader or the listener is forced to simultaneously try and divine the meaning of their answer, while also not thinking too hard about the question the interviewer asked. Look at most modern business interviews. They involve a journalist asking a question, somebody giving an answer, and the journalist saying “okay!” and moving onto the next question, occasionally saying “but what about this?” when the appropriate response to many of the answers is to ask them to simplify them so that their meaning is clearer. A common response to all of this is to say that “interviewers can’t be antagonistic,” and I don’t think a lot of people understand what that means. It isn’t “antagonistic” to ask somebody to clearly articulate what they’re saying, nor is it “antagonistic” to say that you don’t understand, or that they didn’t answer the question you asked. If this is “antagonistic” to you, you are, intellectually-speaking, a giant fucking coward, because what you’re suggesting is that somebody cannot ask somebody to explain themselves, which is what an interview is. And I imagine nobody really wants to do this, because if you actually put these people on the spot, you’d realize the dark truth that I spoke of a few weeks ago: that the reason the powerful sound like idiots is because, well, they’re idiots. They sound like Business Idiots and create products to sell to Business Idiots, because Business Idiots run most companies and buy solutions based on what the last Business Idiot told them. To quote the excellent Nik Suresh: I know some of you might read this and say “these people can’t be stupid! These people run companies! They make huge deals! They read all these books!” and my answer is that some of the stupidest people I’ve ever met have read more books than you or I will read in a lifetime. While they might be smart when it comes to corporate chess moves or saying “this product category should do this,” none of these men — not Altman, Pichai or Nadella — actually has a hand in the design or creation of any of the things their companies make, and they never, ever have. Regardless, I have a larger point: it’s time to start mocking these people and tearing down their legends as geniuses of industry. They are not better than us, nor are they responsible for anything that their companies build other than the share price (which is a meaningless figure) and the accumulation of power and resources. These men are neither smart nor intellectually superior, and it’s time to start treating them as such. These people are powerful because they have names that are protected by the press. They are powerful because it is seen as unseemly to mock them because they are rich and “running a company,” a kind of corporate fealty that I find deeply unbecoming of an adult. We are, at most, customers. We do not “owe them” anything. We are long past the point when any of the people running these companies actually invented anything they sell. iIf anything, they owe us something, because they are selling us a product, even if said product is free and monetised by advertising. While reporters — as anyone — should have some degree of professionalism in interviews or covering subjects, there is no reason to treat these people as special, even if they have managed to raise a lot of money or their product is popular, because if that were the case we’d have far more coverage of defense contractor Lockheed Martin. It made $1.71 billion in profit last quarter, and hasn’t had a single quarter under a billion dollars in the last year. I’m being a little glib, but the logic behind covering OpenAI is, at this point, “it makes a lot of money and its product is popular,” which is also a fitting description of Lockheed Martin. The difference is that OpenAI has a consumer product that loses billions of dollars, and Lockheed Martin has products that makes billions of dollars by removing consumers from the Earth. Both of them are environmentally destructive. Covering OpenAI sure doesn’t seem to be about the tech, because if you looked at the tech you’d have to understand the tech, you’d see that the user numbers weren’t there outside of the 500 million people using ChatGPT, of which very few are actually paying for the product, and that the term “user” encompasses everything from the most occasional users who log in out of curiosity, to people who are actually using it as part of their daily lives. If covering OpenAI was about the tech, you’d read about how the tech itself doesn’t seem to have a ton of mass-market use cases, and those use cases aren’t really the kind of things that you’d pay for. If they did, there’d be articles that definitively discussed them versus articles in the New York Times about “everybody using AI” that boil down to “I use ChatGPT as search now” and “I heard a guy who asked it to teach him about modern art.” Yet men like Dario Amodei and Sam Altman continue to be elevated because they are “building the future,” even if they don’t seem to have built it yet, or have the ability to clearly articulate what that future actually looks like. Anthropic has now put out multiple stories suggesting that its generative AI will “blackmail” people as a means of stopping a user from turning off the system, something which is so obviously the company prompting its models to do so. Every member of the media covering this uncritically should feel ashamed of themselves. Sadly, this is all a result of the halo effect of being a Guy Who Raised Money or Guy Who Runs Big Company. We must, as human beings, assume that these people are smart, and that they’d never mislead us, because if we accept that they aren’t smart and that they willingly mislead us, we’d have to accept that the powerful are, well, bad and possibly unremarkable. And if they’re untrustworthy people that don’t seem that smart, we have to accept that the world is deeply unfair, and caters to people like them far more than it caters to people like us. We do not owe Satya Nadella any respect because he’s the CEO of Microsoft. If anything, we should show him outright scorn for the state of Microsoft products. Microsoft Teams is an insulting mess that only sometimes works, leaving workers spending 57% of their time either in Teams Chat, Teams Meetings or sending emails according to a Microsoft study. MSN.com is an abomination read by hundreds of millions of people a month, bloated with intrusive advertisements, attempts to trick you into downloading an app, and quasi-content that may or may not be AI generated. There are few products on the modern internet that show more contempt for the user -- other than, of course, Skype, a product that Microsoft let languish for more than a decade, the product so thoroughly engorged with spam that leaving it unattended for more than a month left you with a hundred unread messages from Eastern European romance scammers. Microsoft finally killed it in May. Products like Word and Excel don’t need improving, but that doesn’t stop Microsoft from trying, bloating them with odd user interface choices and forcing users to fight with popups to use an AI-powered Copilot that most of them hate. Why, exactly, are we meant to show these people respect? Because they run a company that provides a continually-disintegrating service? Because that service has such a powerful monopoly that it’s difficult to leave it if you’re interacting with other people or businesses? I think it’s because we live in Hell. The modern tech ecosystem is so utterly vile. Every single day our tech breaks in new and inventive ways, our iPhones resetting at random, random apps not accepting button presses, our Bluetooth disconnecting, our word processors harassing us to “try and use AI” while no longer offering us suggestions for typos, and our useful products replaced with useless shit, like how Google’s previously-functional assistants were replaced with generative AI that makes them tangibly worse so that Google can claim it has 350 million monthly active Gemini users. Yet the tech and business media acts as if everything is fine. It isn’t fine! It’s all really fucked! You can call me a cynic or a pessimist or every name under the sun, but the stakes have never been higher, and the damage never more wide-spread. Everything feels broken, and covering these companies as if it isn’t is insulting to your readers and your own intelligence. Look at the state of your computer or phone and tell me anything feels congruent or intentional rather than an endless battle of incentives. Look at the notifications on your phone and count the number of them that have absolutely nothing to do with information you actively need. As we speak, I have a notification from Adobe Lightroom, an app I use occasionally to edit photos, that tells me “Elevate any scene - now enhance people, sky, water and more with Quick Actions.” Zerocam, an app that brands itself “the first anti-AI camera app” where you “capture moments, not megapixels,” gave me a notification asking if I took a photo today. Amazon notified me that there is a deal picked just for me — a battery pack that I bought several months ago. Every single company that sends notifications like these should be mocked, but we have accepted such vile conditions as the norm. Apple should be tarred and feathered for allowing companies to send spam notifications, and yet it isn’t because, by and large, Apple is less vile and less exploitative than Microsoft, Google or Amazon. If you are reading this as a member of the tech press, seriously, please look at your daily experience with tech. Count the number of times that your day or a task is interrupted by poorly-designed software or hardware (such as the many, many times Zoom or Teams has a problem with Bluetooth, or a website just doesn’t load, or you type something into your browser and it just doesn’t do anything), or when the software you use either actively impedes you (hey, did you want to use AI? No? You sure?) or refuses to work in a logical way (see: Google Drive). There are tens of thousands of stories like this every day, and if you talked to people, you’d see how widespread it is…or maybe, I dunno, see that it’s happening to you too? There are people responsible, and the tech media writes about them every day. I realize it seems weird to constantly write that a company is releasing broken, convoluted software, but hey, if we can write 300,000 stories about how crime-ridden New York City is, why can’t we write three of them about how fucked Microsoft Office or Google Search have become? And why can’t we talk to the people in power about it? Is it because the questions are too hard to ask? Is it because it feels icky to interrupt Satya Nadella as he waffles on about using Copilot all the time by saying “hey man, Microsoft Teams is broken, tons of people feel this way, why?” or “why have you let MSN.com turn into a hub of AI slop and outright disinformation?” Oh no! You won’t get your access! Wahh! Who cares? Write a story about how Microsoft has become so unbelievably profitable as its products get worse, and talk about how weird and bad that is for the world! Ask Nadella those tough questions, or publish that Microsoft’s PR wouldn’t let you! These people are neither articulate nor wise, and whatever “intelligence” they may claim to have doesn’t seem to manifest in good products or intelligent statements. So why treat them like they’re smart? Why show them deference or pleasantries? These people have crapped up our digital lives at scale, and they deserve contempt, or at the very least a stern fucking reception. I realize I’m repeating points I’ve made again and again, but why is there such a halo around these fucking bozos? I’m serious! Why are we so protective of these guys? We’re more than happy to criticise celebrities, musicians, professional sports players, and politicians (fucking barely), but the business class is somehow protected outside of the occasional willingness to say that Elon Musk might have sort have done something wrong. I’m not denying there are critics. We have Molly White, Edward Ongweso Jr, Brian Merchant and — at a major outlet like CNN, no less! — one of the greatest living business writers in Allison Morrow. I believe that tech criticism is a barely-explored and hugely-profitable industry if we treated tech journalism less like the society pages and more like a force to hold the most powerful people in the world accountable as they continually harm billions of people in subtle ways. People are angry, and they aren’t stupid, and they want to see that anger reflected in the stories they read — and the meek deference we show to dumb fucking tech leaders is the opposite of that. As I’ve said before: we live in an era of digital tinnitus, nagged by notifications, warring with software ostensibly built for us that acts as if we’re the enemy. And if we’re the enemy, we should treat those building this software as the enemy in return. We are their customers, and they have failed us. The entire approach to business owners, especially in tech, is ridiculous. These people are selling us a product and the product fucking stinks! Put aside however you feel about generative AI for a second and face one very simple point: it doesn’t do enough, it’s really not cool at all, and we’re being forced to use it. I realize that some of you may want them to succeed, or want to be the person who tells everybody that they did so. I get that there are rewards for you — promotions, new positions, TV appearances repeating exactly what the powerful did and why they did it, or a plush role as that company’s head of communications — but I am telling you, your readers and viewers are waking up to it, and they feel like you have contempt for them and contempt for the truth. It’s easy — and common! — to try and dismiss my work as some sort of hater’s screed, a “cynical” approach to a tech industry that’s trying “brave new things” or whatever. In my opinion, there’s nothing more cynical than watching billions of people get shipped increasingly-shitty and expensive solutions and then get defensive of the people shipping them, and hostile to the people who are complaining that the products they use suck. I am angry at these companies because they have, at scale, torn down a tech industry that allowed me to be who I am today, and their intentional and disgraceful moves fill me full of disgust. I have watched the tech media move away from covering “technology” and more toward covering the people behind it, to the point that the actual outputs — the software and hardware we use every day — have taken a backseat to stories about whether Elon Musk does or doesn’t use a computer, which is meaningless, empty gossip journalism built to be shared by peers and nothing else. And please, please do not talk about optimism. If you are blindly saying that everything OpenAI does is cool and awesome and interesting, you aren’t being optimistic — you’re telling other people to be optimistic about a company’s success. It isn’t “optimistic” to believe that a company is going to build powerful AI despite it failing to do so. It’s propaganda, and yes, this is also the case if you simply don’t do the research to form a real opinion. I am not a pessimist because I criticize these companies, and framing me as one is cowardly and ignorant. If you are so weak-willed and speciously-informed that you can’t see somebody criticise a company without outright dismissing them as “a hater” or “pessimist,” you are an insult to journalism or analysis, and you know it in your wretched little heart. My heart sings with a firm belief in the things I think, founded on rigorous structures of knowledge that I’ve gained from reading things and talking to people, because something in me is incapable of being swayed by something just because everybody else is. You are assuming people are right because it is inconvenient and uncomfortable to accept they may not be, because doing so requires you to reckon with a market-wide hysteria founded on desperation and a lack of hyper-growth markets left in the tech industry. Worse still, in engaging with faux-optimism, you are failing to protect your readers and the general public. And if that’s what you want to do, ask yourself why! Why do you want these companies to win? What is it you want them to win? Do you want them to be rich? Do you want to be the person that told people they would be first? What is the world you want, and what does it look like, and how does doing your job in this way work toward creating that world? This isn’t optimism — it’s horse-trading, or strategic alignment behind powerful entities. It is choosing a side, because your side isn’t with the reader or the truth. If it was — even if you believed generative AI was powerful and that they simply didn’t understand — your duty would be to educate the reader in a clear-set and obvious way, and if you can’t find a way to do so, acknowledging that and explaining why. True optimism requires you to have a deep, meaningful understanding of things so that you can engage in real hope — a magical feeling, one that can buoy you in the most challenging times. What many claim is “optimism” is actually blind faith, the likes of which you’ll see at a roulette table. Or, of course, knowingly peddling propaganda. Let’s even take a different tact: say you actually want these companies to “build powerful AI,” and believe they’re smart enough to do so. Say that, somehow, looking at their decaying finances, the lack of revenue, the lack of growth, and the remarkable lack of use cases, you still come out of it saying “sure, I think they’re going to do this!” How? Why haven’t they done it yet? Why, three years in, are we still unable to describe what ChatGPT actually does, and why we need it? Take away how much money OpenAI makes for a second (and, indeed, how much it loses). Does this product actually really inspire anything in you? What is it that’s magical about this? And, on a business level, what is it I’m meant to be impressed by, exactly? OpenAI has — allegedly — hit “$10 billion in annualized revenue” (essentially the biggest month it can find, multiplied by 12), which is…not that much, really, considering it’s the most prominent company in the software world, with the biggest brand, and with the attention of the entirety of the world’s media. It has, allegedly, 500 million weekly active users — and, by the last count, only 15.5 million paying subscribers, an absolutely putrid conversion rate even before you realize that the actual conversion rate would be monthly active subscribers. That’s how any real software company actually defines its metrics, by the fucking way. Why is this impressive? Because it grew fast? It literally had more PR and more marketing and more attention and more opportunities to sell to more people than any company has ever had in the history of anything. Every single industry has been told to think about AI for three years, and they’ve been told to do so because of a company called OpenAI. There isn’t a single god damn product since Google or Facebook that has had this level of media pressure, and both of those companies launched without the massive amount of media (and social media) that we have today. Having literally everybody talking about your product all the time for years is pretty useful! Why isn’t it making more money? Why are we taking any of these people seriously? Mark Zuckerberg paid $14.3 billion for Scale AI, an AI data company, as a means of hiring its CEO Alexandr Wang to run his “superintelligence” team, has been offering random OpenAI employees $100 million to join Meta, thought about buying both AI search company Perplexity and generative video company Runway and even tried to buy OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever’s pre-product “$32bn valuation” non-company Safe Superintelligence, settling instead on hiring its CEO Daniel Gross and buying his venture fund for some fucking reason. When you put aside the big numbers, these are the actions of a desperate dimwit with a failing product trying to buy his way to making generative AI into a “superintelligence,” something that Meta’s own Chief AI scientist Yan LeCun says isn’t going to work. By assuming that there is some sort of grand strategy behind these moves beyond “if we get enough smart people together something will happen,” you help boost the powerful’s messaging and buoy their stock valuations. You are not educating anybody by humouring these goofballs. In fact, the right way to approach this would be to ask why Meta, a multi-trillion dollar market cap company with a near-monopoly over all social media, is spending billions of dollars in what appears to be a totally irresponsible way. Instead, people are suggesting this is Mark Zuckerberg’s genius at work. Anyway, putting that aside, what exactly is the impressive part of generative AI again? The fucking code? Enough about the code, I’m tired of hearing about the code, I swear to god you people think that being a software engineer is only coding and that it’s fine if you ship “mediocre code,” as if bad code can’t bring down entire organizations. What do you think a software engineer does? Is all they do code? If you think the answer is yes, you are wrong! Human beings may make mistakes in writing code, but they at least know what a mistake looks like, which a generative AI does not, because a generative AI doesn’t know what anything is, or anything at all, because it is a probabilistic model. Congratulations! You made another way in which software engineers can automate parts of their jobs — stop being so fucking excited about the idea that people are going to lose their livelihoods! It’s nasty, and founded on absolutely nothing other than your adulation for the powerful! These models are dangerous and chaotic, built with little intention or regard for the future, just like the rest of big tech’s products. ChatGPT would’ve been a much smaller deal if Google had any interest in turning Google Search into a product that truly answered a query (as opposed to generating more of them to show more impressions to advertisers) — a nuanced search engine that took a user’s query and spat out a series of websites that might help answer said question rather than just summarising a few of them for an answer. And if you ever need proof that Google just doesn’t know how to fucking innovate anymore, look at AI Summaries, a product that both misunderstands search and why people use ChatGPT as a search replacement. While OpenAI may “summarise” stuff to give an answer, it at the very least gives something approximating a true answer, rather than a summary that feels like an absentee parent trying to get rid of you and then throwing you $20 in the hopes you’ll leave them alone. If Google Search truly evolved, ChatGPT wouldn’t really matter, because the idea of a machine that can theoretically answer a question is kind of why people used fucking Google in the fucking first place. Again, why are we not describing this company as the business equivalent of a banana republic? It’s actively making its shit worse to juice growth, and it’s really obvious how badly it sucks. Why doesn’t the state of Google dominate tech news, just like how random ketamine-fuelled tweets from Elon Musk do? Why aren’t we, collectively, repulsed by Google as a company? Why aren’t we, collectively, repulsed by OpenAI? No matter how big ChatGPT is, the fact that there’s a product out there with hundreds of millions of users that constantly gets answers wrong is a genuinely worrying thing for society, and that’s before you get to the environmental damage, the fact it trained its models on millions of people’s art and writing, and oh, I dunno, the fact it plans to lose over a hundred billions of dollars before becoming profitable? Why are we not more horrified? Why are we not more forlorn that this is where hundreds of billions of dollars are being forced? The most prominent company in the tech industry is an unstable monolith with a vague product that can only make $10 billion a year (revenue, not profit) as the very fabric of its existence is shoved down the throat of every executive in the world at once. Also, if it’s not fed $20 billion to $40 billion a year, it will die. Give me a fucking break. I don’t know, I sound pretty ornery, I get accused of being a hater or missing the grand mystery of this bullshit every few minutes by somebody with an AI avatar of a guy who looks like he’s banned from multiple branches of Best Buy, I understand there’s things that people do with Large Language Models, I am aware, but none of it matters because the way they’re being discussed is like we’re two steps from digitally replacing hundreds of millions of people. The reality is far simpler: we have an industry that has spent nearly half a trillion dollars between its capital expenditures and venture capital funding to create another industry with the combined revenue of the fucking smartwatch industry. What I’m writing isn’t inflammatory — in fact, it’s far more deeply rooted in reality than those claiming that OpenAI is building the future. Let’s do some fucking mathematics! Projected Big Tech Capital Expenditures in 2025 and revenue from AI: That’s $327 billion this year, with a total revenue of…what, $18 billion of revenue? And that’s not profit! And that’s if we include OpenAI’s spend on Azure. Even if every single one of these companies was making $18 billion in revenue a year from this it wouldn’t be great, but it’s more than likely that these chunderfucks can’t even pull together the projected revenue ($32 billion) of the global smartwatch industry! What a joke! “Wuhh, but what about OpenAI?” What about OpenAI? I’ve written about this so much. So what, OpenAI makes $12.7 billion this year, but loses $14 billion, what does that mean to you, exactly? What’re you going to say? The cost of inference is coming down? No, the cost that people are being charged is going down, we have no firm data on the actual costs because the companies don’t want to talk about it, and yes, it will absolutely lower prices to compete with other companies. The Information just reported that OpenAI was doing this to compete with Microsoft last week! Hey, quick question — wasn’t SoftBank meant to spend $3 billion annually on OpenAI’s software? Did that happen? Anyway, even if we add OpenAI’s revenue to the pot, we are at $30.7 billion. If we add the supposed $1 billion in revenue from training data startup Surge, $300 million in “annualized revenue” from Turing, optimistically assume that Perplexity will have $100 million (up from $34 million in 2024, where it burned $65 million) in revenue in 2025, and assume that Anysphere’s (which makes Cursor) $200 million run rate stays consistent through 2025, we are at…$32.3 billion. But I'm not being fair, am I? I didn’t include many of the names from The Information’s generative AI database. Prepare yourself, this is gonna be annoying! So let's add some more. We’ve got $3 billion from Anthropic, $870 million from Scale (now part of Meta), another alleged $300 million for Anysphere (The Information claims $500 million in ARR), we consider Neo4j’s “>$200 million ARR” to mean “$200 million,” Midjourney’s “>$200 million ARR” to mean $200m, Ironclad’s “>$150 million ARR” to mean $150 million ARR, Glean’s $103 million ARR, Together AI’s $100 million ARR, Moveworks’ $100 million ARR, Abridge’s $100 million ARR, Synthesia’s $100 million ARR, WEKA’s “>$100 million ARR” to mean $100m ARR, Windsurf’s $100m ARR, Runway’s $84 million ARR, Elevenlabs’ “>$100m ARR” to mean $100m ARR, Cohere’s $70m ARR, Jasper’s “>$60m ARR” to mean $60m, Harvey’s $50m ARR, Ada’s “>$50m ARR” to mean $50m, Photoroom’s $50m ARR…and then assumed the combined ARR of the remainders are somewhere in the region of a very generous $200m, we get… Less than $39 billion dollars of total revenue in the entire generative AI industry. Jesus fucking christ! According to The Information, generative AI companies have raised more than $18.8 billion in the first quarter of 2025, after investing $21 billion in Q4 2024 and $4 billion in Q3 2024 for a grand total of $43.8 billion, or a total of $370.8 billion of investment and capital expenditures for an industry that, despite being the single-most talked about thing on the planet, cannot even create a tenth of the dollars it requires to make it work. These companies are predominantly unprofitable, perpetually searching for product-market fit, and even when they find it, seem incapable of generating revenue numbers that remotely justify their valuations. If I’m honest, I think the truly radical position here is the one taken by most tech reporters that would rather take the lazy position of “well Uber lost a lot of money!” than think for two seconds about whether we’re all being sold a line of shit. What we’re watching is a mountain of waste perpetuated by the least-charming failsons of our generation. Nobody should be giving Satya Nadella or Sam Altman a glossy profile — they should be asking direct, brutal questions, much like Joanna Stern just did of Apple’s Craig Federighi, who had absolutely fucking nothing to share because he has never been pushed like this. Put aside the money for a second and be honest: these men are pathetic, unimpressive, uninventive, and dreadfully, dreadfully boring. Anthropic’s Wario (Sorry, Dario) Amodei and OpenAI’s Sam Altman have far more in common with televangelist Joel Olstein than they’ll ever have with Steve Jobs or any number of people that have actually invented things, and they got that way because we took them seriously instead of saying “wait, what do you mean?” To a single one of their wrongheaded, oafish and dim-witted hype-burps. It’s boring! I’m terribly, horribly bored, and if you’re interested in this shit I am genuinely curious why, especially if you’re a reporter, because right now the “innovation” happening in AI is, at best, further mutations of the Software As A Service business model, providing far less value than previous innovations at a calamitous cost. Reasoning models don’t even reason, as proven by an Apple paper released a few weeks ago, and agents as a concept are fucked because large language models are inherently unreliable — and yes, a study out of fucking Salesforce found that agents began to break down when given multi-step tasks, such as “any task you’d want to have an agent automate.” So, here’s my radical suggestion: start making fun of these people. They are not charming. They are not building anything. They have scooted along amassing billions of dollars promising the world and delivering you a hill of dirt. They deserve our derision — or, at the very least, our deep, unerring suspicion, if not for what they’ve done, but for what they’ve not done. Sam Altman is nowhere near delivering a functioning agent, let alone anything approaching intelligence, and really only has one skill: making other companies risk a bunch of money on his stupid ideas. No, really! He convinced Oracle to buy $40 billion of NVIDIA chips to put in the Abilene Texas “Stargate” data center, despite the fact that the Stargate organization has yet to be formed (as reported by The Information). SoftBank and Microsoft pay all of OpenAI’s bills, and the media does his marketing for him. OpenAI is, as I said, quite literally a banana republic. It requires the media and the markets to make up why it has to exist, it requires other companies to pump it full of money and build its infrastructure, and it doesn’t even make products that matter, with Sam Altman constantly talking about all the exciting shit other people will build. You can keep honking about how “it built the API that will power the future,” but if that’s the case, where’s the fucking future, exactly? Where is it? What am I looking at here? Where’s the economic activity? Where’s the productivity? The returns suck! The costs are too high! Why am I the radical person for saying this? This entire situation is absolutely god damn ridiculous, an incomparable waste even if it somehow went in the green. For the horrendous amounts of capital invested in generative AI to make sense, the industry would have to have revenue that dwarfed the smartphone and enterprise SaaS market combined, rather than less than half of that of the mobile gaming industry. Satya Nadella, Sam Altman, Wario Amodei, Tim Cook, Andy Jassy — they deserve to be laughed at, mocked, or at the very least interrogated vigorously, because their combined might has produced no exciting or interesting products outside of, at best, what will amount to a productivity upgrade for integrated development environments and faster ways to throw out code that may or may not be reliable. These things aren’t nothing, but they’re nowhere near the something that we’re being promised. So I put it to you, dear reader: why are we taking them seriously? What is there to take seriously other than their ability to force stuff on people? And I’ll leave you with a question: how do they manage to keep doing this, exactly? They always seem to find new growth, every single quarter, without fail? Is it because they keep coming up with new ideas? Or is it because they come up with new ideas to get more money, a vastly different choice that involves increasing the prices of products or making them worse so that they can show you more advertisements. My positions are not radical, and if you believe they are, your deference to the powerful disgusts me. In any case, I want to end this with something inspirational, because I believe that things change when regular people feel stronger and more capable. I want you to know that you are fully capable of understanding all of this. I don’t care if you “aren’t a numbers person” or “don’t get business.’ I don’t have a single iota of economics training, and everything you’ve ever read me write has been something I’ve had to learn. I was a layperson right up until I learned the stuff, then I became a stuff-knower, just like you can be. The tech industry, the finance industry, the entire mechanisms of capitalism want you to believe that everything they do is magical and complex, when it’s all far more obvious than you’d believe. You don’t have to understand the entire fundamentals of finance to know how venture capital works — they buy percentages of companies at a valuation that they hope is much lower than the company would be worth in the future. You don’t need to be technical to know that Large Language Models generate a response based on billions of pieces of training data, and by guessing at what the next bit of text in a line should be based on what it’s seen previously. These people love to say “ah, but didn’t you see-” and present an anecdote, when no anecdote will ever defeat the basics of “your business doesn’t make any money, the software doesn’t do the things you claim it’s meant to, and you have no path to profitability.” They can yammer at you all they want about “lots of people using ChatGPT,” but that doesn’t change the fact that ChatGPT just isn’t that revolutionary, and their only play here is to make you feel stupid rather than actually showing you why it’s so fucking revolutionary. This is the argument of a manipulator and a coward, and you are above such things. You don’t really have to be a specialist in anything to pry this shit apart, which is why so much of my work is either engaging to those who learn something from it or frustrating to those that intentionally deceive others through gobbledygook hype-schpiel. I will sit here and explain every fucking part of this horrid chain of freaks, and break it down into whatever pieces it takes to educate as many people as I have to to make things change. I also must be clear that I am nobody. I started writing this newsletter with 300 subscribers and no reason other than the fact I wanted to, and four years later I have nearly 64,000 subscribers and an award-winning podcast. I have no economics training, no special access, no deep sources, just the ability to look at things that are happening and say stuff. I taught myself everything I know about this industry, and there is nothing stopping you from doing the same. I was convinced I was stupid until around two years ago, though if I’m honest it might have been last year. I have felt othered the majority of my life, convinced by people that I am incapable or unwelcome, and as I’ve become more articulate and confident in who I am and what I believe in, I have noticed that the only people that seek to degrade or suppress are those of weak minds and weaker wills — Business Idiots in different forms and flavors. I have learned to accept who I am — that I am not like most people — and people conflate my passion and vigor with anger or hate, when what they’re experiencing is somebody different who deeply resents what the powerful have done to the computer. And while I complain about the state of media, what I’ve seen in the last year is that there are many, many people like me — both readers and peers — that resent things in the same way. I conflated being different with being alone, and I couldn’t be more wrong. For those of you that don’t wish to lick the boots of the people fucking up every tech product, the tent is large, it’s a big club, and you’re absolutely in it. A better tech industry is one where the people writing about it hold it accountable, pushing it toward creating the experiences and connectivity that truly change the world rather than repeating and reinforcing the status quo. Don’t watch the mouth, watch the hands. These companies will tell you that they’re amazing as many times as they want, but you don’t need to prove that — they do. I don’t care if you tell a single human soul about my work, but if it helps you understand these people better, use it to teach other people. These people may seem all-powerful, but they’ve built the Rot Economy on a combination of anonymity and a placant press, but pressure against them starts with you and those you know understanding how their businesses work, and trusting that you can understand because you absolutely can. Millions of people understanding how these people run their companies and how poorly they’ve built their software will stop people like Sundar Pichai from being able to quietly burn Google Search to the ground. People like Sam Altman are gambling that you are easily-confused, easily-defeated and incurious, when you could be writing thousands of words on a newsletter that you never, ever edit for brevity. You can understand every fucking part of their business — the economics of OpenAI, the flimsy promises of Salesforce, the destruction of Google Search — and you can tell everybody you know about it, and suddenly it won’t be so easy for these wretched creeps to continue thriving. I know it sounds small, and like your role is even smaller, but the reason they’ve grown so rapaciously is driven by the sense that the work they do is some sort of black magic, when it’s really fucking stupid and boring finance stapled onto a tech industry that’s run out of ideas. You are more than capable of understanding this entire world — including the technology, along with the finances that ultimately decide what technology gets made next. These people have got rich and famous and escaped all blame by casting themselves as somehow above us, when if I’m honest, I’ve never looked down on somebody quite as much as I do the current gaggle of management consultant fucks that have driven Silicon Valley into the ground.

Title: Lowe’s CEO warns young workers to stay away from the corner office: ‘AI isn’t going to fix a hole in your roof’

Preston Fore is a reporter at Fortune, covering education and personal finance for the Success team. Anxiety about an AI job bloodbath is everywhere. As generative-AI tools like ChatGPT advance at lightning speed, even high-skilled roles like software engineering appear to be at risk. But according to Lowe’s CEO Marvin Ellison, the reality of AI’s impact on the workforce is far more grounded. “AI isn’t going to fix a hole in your roof,” Ellison, chief executive of the home-improvement retail giant, said at Business Roundtable’s CEO Workforce Forum earlier this month. “It’s not going to respond to an electrical issue in your home,” he said. “It’s not going to stop your water heater from leaking.” Particularly for Gen Z, who are facing an uphill battle thanks to slowed hiring among recent graduates, Ellison reassures them there are job opportunities—as long as you are willing to give up dreams of the corner office. “When young people come to me and they desire to work in the corporate office, my advice to them is, Stay as close to the cash register as you can,” he said. “Stay close to the customers because you will always have employment opportunities to grow.” And while his words may sound ironic considering how technology is the reason for self-checkout, Ellison is a believer that mastering the skills AI doesn’t have is a wise move. Ellison didn’t immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment. Ellison’s comments come at a time when there’s a fierce debate among business leaders about the impacts of AI, especially on young talent. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has warned the technology could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs, and Amazon recently announced it will soon cut its corporate workforce thanks to the technology. However, OpenAI chief operating officer Brad Lightcap is more optimistic. “We look at the problem and opportunity of deploying AI into every company on earth, and we have yet to see any evidence that people are kind of wholesale replacing entry-level jobs,” Lightcap said on the Hard Fork podcast. Some business leaders agree one growing pathway to success is the skilled trade industry. After all, construction, utilities, as well as oil, gas, and mining are the fastest-growing industries for new grads, according to LinkedIn’s 2025 Grad Guide. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said earlier this year electricians in particular are so desperately needed the U.S. could run out of them, thanks in part to growing demand and the deportation of skilled workers. “I’ve even told members of the Trump team that we’re going to run out of electricians, that we need to build out AI data centers,” Fink told an audience at CERAWeek, an S&P Global energy conference hosted in Houston. “We just don’t have enough.” According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, demand for plumbers (6%), roofers (6%), and electricians (11%) is expected to grow over the next decade—and each rate is faster than the national average of all occupations. However, a McKinsey report suggests the need for young people to pursue critical trade skills is even more dire due to the aging of existing skilled trade workers; in fact, hiring for critical skilled roles could be more than 20 times the projected annual increase in new jobs between 2022 and 2032. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Apple Reportedly Has Numerous XR Headsets & Glasses Coming Between Now & 2028

Independent tech analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reports that Apple’s XR and smart glasses roadmap will feature multiple XR devices, including a spec-bumped Vision Pro slated to release later this year. At the far end of the spectrum, Kuo also says Apple is making AR glasses, reportedly coming in 2028. Kuo is a long-time tech analyst and respected figure in Apple product leaks. In a new blogpost, Kuo has laid out a timeline for a number of Apple XR releases, ostensibly based on various supply chain leaks. Kuo reports that a new Vision Pro featuring the company’s M5 chip is scheduled for mass production in Q3 2025, with 150,000–200,000 units expected to ship. This next Vision Pro is reportedly upgrading the chip from M2 to M5, but will otherwise retain the original specs. Kuo maintains the iterative approach is based on Vision Pro’s current position as a niche product, as the company hopes to use the next version to maintain market presence, reduce component stock, and further refine XR applications. Next, Kuo says Apple is preparing a much lighter headset, reportedly called ‘Vision Air’, set to release in Q3 2027. Vision Air is said to be dramatically lighter at over 40% less than the current Vision Pro, which weighs in at 21.2–22.9 ounces (600–650 g), excluding the battery. Kuo maintains Vision Air will include plastic lenses, magnesium alloys, fewer sensors, a top-tier iPhone chip, and be priced significantly lower to appeal to broader users. The true next-gen Vision device is said to be ‘Vision Pro 2’ though, which Kuo says could arrive in 2H 2028, replete with a full redesign, Mac-grade chip, reduced weight, and a lower price, signaling Apple’s shift to move away from niche XR products and move toward mainstream adoption. Meanwhile, Kuo says Apple is investing heavily in smart glasses. A Ray-Ban-like, audio-first wearable is expected to arrive in Q2 2027, Kuo says, noting that the company is hoping to manufacture 3–5 million units—ostensibly a significant push towards making its first smart glasses a mainstream success. Like Ray-Ban Meta, and the recently unveiled Oakley Meta HSTN, Apple’s smart glasses are said to have no display, rather offering audio playback, photo and video capture, an AI assistant, and both gesture and voice controls. Arguably the biggest claim among Kuo’s timeline is the mention of Apple XR Glasses, which the analyst maintains will include a color display (LCoS + waveguide) and AI features, making it the first true AR glasses from the company. Kuo says Apple is targeting release in 2H 2028, with a lighter variant being developed in parallel. This follows reports of Apple potentially scraping a more casual XR glasses-type viewer, which would be tethered to Apple devices and use birdbath optics. The device was originally planned for release in Q2 2026, but Kuo maintains it was paused in late 2024 due to insufficient differentiation, especially around weight. Granted, Apple is one of the most opaque black boxes in tech for a reason. The company historically announces products on stage, which typically also comes with a price and release date attached. While Kuo has a fairly reliable track record of reporting insider knowledge of Vision Pro, we’re taking this data dump with an equally-sized grain of salt. This article may contain affiliate links.

Some premium iPhones can't even run AI due to Apple's stingy memory. But they're the best and most excellently optimised things ever. Except when it comes to future proofing. Give me Samsung and similar any day. We owe a huge debt to Apple as regards smartphone evolution, but they're like your dad on the sofa now, wearing a jumper and watching Bowls. The minimum requirement for using Apple AI is an A17 Pro or A18, which double the NPU performance from ~16/17 TOPS on A15/A16 to 35 TOPS. All iPhones using the A17 Pro/A18 also come with 8GB of RAM compared to 6GB before, so you can run Apple AI on iPhone Pro/Plus from 2023 or all iPhones from 2024 or later. But it's not just the RAM that's the issue here. After years of annoyingly keeping the basic Mac configuration at 8GB, Apple now switched everything to at least 16GB esp. to be able to run Apple AI, so the stingy memory policy and obscene upgrade prices certainly play a part. But a lot of people using basic M1 MacBooks with 8GB RAM from late 2020 still see no reason to upgrade, because the speed is fine, and thanks to very fast SSDs and clever MacOS memory management, these 8GB will get you a lot further than on a Windows laptop. Just not for AI, which needs very fast access to gigabytes large models, with swapping not an option. So these users won't get Apple AI, which many consider a feature instead of a bug. And usually Apple devices get a lot longer support than anything Android, which may count for "future proofing". No doubt they are low specced, high-priced and served with plenty of Kool Aid. But as Apple controls the OS, the specs are typically well balanced for the majority of users. And even the most basic configuration will usually work just fine for at least half a decade with continued OS updates, though you might not get all of the latest features, and even longer security updates. TL;DR: 2025 M5 Vision Pro with the same issues, but more speed, for the enterprise market; 2027 A21 Vision Air for consumers, addressing the comfort/price issues, but otherwise offering the same experience as the current M2 AVP. A Vision Air makes a lot of sense, as it addresses high weight and price, which are the main issues most reviewers had/have with the AVP. By now Apple has learned how people use AVP, and can try to achieve the same experience with less/newer hardware. The M- and A-Series chips use the same types of cores, just in different configurations, with A-chips designed for low power mobile. By 2027 the M2 will be five years old, so a high end A-SoC should be faster, allowing for the same experience as the M2 AVP, but with less power/money/weight. And by reducing the huge amount of sensors to what is essential, they may be able to drop the extra R1 signal processor that works in parallel to the M2 in AVP. A more difficult question is who the M5 update is for. It not a redesign, mostly a SoC replacement with maybe some minor changes, similar to Pico 4 Ultra compared to Pico 4. But all it effectively does is bump up the speed, and this is the one area where AVP hasn't been widely criticized. Price/weight/power consumption/comfort all stay the same and will only be addressed by the Vision Air. So from a consumer perspective, they might as well have continued to sell the M2 AVP until the Air arrives. My guess is that this upgrade is mostly about pushing AVP for enterprise use instead of the consumer market. With no apps demanding it, regular customers won't really benefit from the extra power, but a large company running their own custom software might. Earlier this months Apple showed a couple of new features of visionOS 26, one of which was co-located AR, allowing several people using AVP in the same physical space to work together on virtual objects. This was demonstrated with Dassault Systèmes, who are a heavy weight in the aerospace CAD and simulation market and offer a number of compute-heavy engineering solutions. That's the type of software companies buy expensive workstation hardware for, and they most certainly would love every bit of speed they can get, money/power/weight be damned. If this is what Apple is going for, the next Apple Vision most XR users will care about will arrive in 2027 and no longer bear the "Pro" label. And what is released later this year will take the Pro more serious and explicitly target the enterprise market. Apple has done silent updates before, upping the specs without an actual product instructions, just offering a short press release. And if the M5 AVP is indeed aimed at the professional market, "the company historically announces products on stage, which typically also comes with a price and release date attached" may not apply here. So maybe don't expect any big announcement for later this year, or (mis-)interpret a lack of such announcements as Apple pulling back from XR. Excellent analysis and summary. I do think there will be more than just an M2-M5 upgrade. There are simple things Apple can do around the headstrap design (too heavy on the bridge of your nose/face) and upgraded battery. I do agree it will have more enterprise features (and would expect some partnership announcements with the big MDM players. I also think they will introduce multi-user device sharing. Technically visionOS is based on iPadOS, which has multi-user profile functionality, but ONLY for MDM users like schools or companies. So it would make sense to also introduce it for AVP as an enterprise feature, as it most likely existed in the OS from day one. Just not for regular consumer peasants. I'm somewhat pessimistic regarding other hardware changes though, mostly because Kuo said that "the company hopes to use the next version to maintain market presence, reduce component stock, and further refine XR applications." We knew right from the beginning that AVP production was limited by Sony microOLED availability to at most 450K units per year. But they sold even less, apparently a lot less than they expected, and some time ago told their manufacturers to stop producing new components, planing to sell off existing stock until a successor arrives. So they may be sitting on a large pile of sensors, displays, cases and head straps not yet used, making them reluctant to offer some easy to achieve improvements. The estimated 150K-200K (per year/total?) M5 AVP units may all use mostly components they already ordered for the original AVP, with only the SoC being replaced. They could have stockpiled a few hundred thousands of these too, but AVP is now the last Apple device sold still using M2, everything else has been moved to a newer generation, which may be another reason for the upgrade besides more power for enterprise users. Ok, if the guy is right that’s getting ridiculous… …3 more years to have a true successor to AVP. It better go directly 8k per eye, holographic lenses with varifocal and weigh less than 150g by then because that’s next century in nerd years. And 40 percent lighter for a vision air with plastic lenses in 2 years, that’s pathetic both in terms of specs (still way too heavy) and way too late.. Apple is really a company falling apart. There is no excitement with them, since cook took over, it’s as dull as an insurance company. Yes, Tim Cook is for Apple what Bob Iger is for Disney. Profit and wokeness, but no soul. So for the 2027 Quest 4, we hope for 2.5K/3.5K microOLED, better passthrough, eye tracking, and XR2 Gen 3 with ~2.8x the graphics performance of the 2023 Quest 3, at roughly the same size/weight. And if Apple, who's 2024 AVP already offers 3.5K microOLEDs, excellent passthrough, eye tracking and ~50% more raw GPU performance than Quest 3, doesn't manage to one year after Quest 4 release an AVP2 that offers tech that doesn't even work as prototypes yet, at less than 1/3rd the weight of Quest 3, and technically completely unfeasible for anybody else, they are falling apart, because they are as dull as an insurance company. In the last 20 years, Apple has invented nothing but iPhones. – Always faster iPhones, sometimes a bit bigger, sometimes a bit smaller – Very small iPhones with a strap (iWatch) – Very large iPhones (iPad) – iPhones you can strap to your face (Apple Vision Pro) – Large foldable iPhones with a keyboard (MacBook Air) Oh yes, and of course AirPods too! Innovation looks different than constantly just varying the same theme.

Wall Street heavyweight JPMorgan (JPM) initiated coverage of stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) with an underweight rating and an underwhelming $80 price target. The shares were trading 4.5% higher at around $189 at publication time. Circle is well positioned, the bank said, and its USDC stablecoin has an "early-mover advantage," with growing use cases in payments. "We think highly of the Circle management team and are confident in the outlook for outsized stablecoin and USDC growth," analysts led by Kenneth Worthington wrote. Still, the analysts see the company's market capitalization as elevated, and initiated coverage with an underweight rating. The stock priced at $31 a share in its initial public offering (IPO), and hit a record high of $299 last Monday. Other Wall Street analysts were not as bearish. Broker Bernstein initiated coverage with an outperform rating and a $230 price target, saying Circle was an "investor must-hold." "CRCL is building a market-leading digital dollar stablecoin network, with a strong regulatory edge, liquidity headstart and marquee distribution partnerships," analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote. Bernstein is also bullish about the wider stablecoin market, and expects total market cap to reach around $4 trillion in the next decade from $225 billion today. Rival broker Canaccord Genuity started coverage of Circle with a buy rating and a $247 price target. The firm's analysts view the issuer of USDC as "having many of the key attributes that could make it a long-term winner in this potentially very large and new market for truly digital money."

Title: Differentiating bacteria by their unique surface interactions

New, rapid, and accessible approaches to bacterial detection are necessary to help curb the rising impacts of antimicrobial resistance. In this study, we introduce a technique that distinguishes bacteria through their unique surface interactions. By measuring and combining the interaction strengths of a bacterium across a set of chemically defined surfaces, we produced a novel bacterial identifier termed the surface interaction profile (SIP). The interaction strengths of twelve test bacteria across three discrete polyelectrolyte multilayer films (PEMs) were measured, facilitated by introducing each bacterial suspension to individual PEMs in microfluidic channels over a 10-minute interaction period and rinsing to remove bulk and loosely bound bacteria. The remaining surface-bound cells were counted via microscopy and plotted against suspension concentrations to build attachment curves whose slopes were measured as the strength of interaction for a given bacteria-PEM combination. These slopes were collected, per bacterial type, to produce each SIP. SIPs were capable of distinguishing between our pathogenic strains (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus) by Gram stain and individual species, and each blind test pathogen was successfully identified through SIP comparison. Furthermore, SIPs were also successful at differentiating between select Staphylococcus aureus walKR mutants impacting cell wall metabolism and high-risk antibiotic resistance mutants (MRSA and VISA), highlighting the utility and future diagnostic potential of this technique.

In principle, improving the turnaround time for bacterial identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) enables doctors to quickly prescribe effective antibiotics, improving patient outcomes while reducing the overuse and misuse of antibiotics that contribute to the further breeding of resistance [1,2]. In practice, traditional approaches (e.g., culture-based, phenotypic, turbidimetric) and improved or emerging rapid techniques (e.g., nucleic acid amplification tests, mass spectrometry, enhanced turbidity) are either significantly time-consuming or resource-intensive [3]. Furthermore, emerging technologies are limited in their routine use and implementation in low-resource settings due to significant cost and operational barriers [4,5]. A chorus of risk factors, including limited access to clean water and sanitation, poor infection control practices in healthcare facilities, and a lack of antibiotic stewardship, increase the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant infections, associated mortality rates and healthcare costs in developing countries [6,7]. Continued progress toward new, rapid, and accessible approaches to pathogen detection is necessary to curb the global impact of AMR by improving diagnostics and infection surveillance practices beyond our borders. This study introduces a novel technique that differentiates bacteria based on their surface interactions, with the aim of developing a more rapid and less resource-intensive bacterial diagnostic. Variability in bacterial surface composition is observed across classes of bacteria, from broader differences between Gram stain and species to more subtle differences between strains and individual mutants, which impact the expression of virulence factors and/or antibiotic resistance [8–13]. Their unique surface composition and chemistry directly influence how they interact with surfaces [14,15], including those in their natural environments. The early stages of attachment are facilitated predominantly by electrostatics and, to a lesser extent, van der Waals forces and hydrophobic interactions [16–18]. In this context, the bacterial surface becomes a viable, versatile target for detection, offering a broad spectrum of potential surface interactions that can be utilized to differentiate between a wide array of bacteria. The attachment of bacterium A and B to an identical substrate C may not yield a measurable difference in their interaction strengths to differentiate them, primarily due to the small pool of possible interactions available when using a single substrate as a probe. Increasing the number and chemical diversity of substrates for which interaction strengths are measured enhances the capacity and complexity of potential interactions used to differentiate. In principle, this would allow for more nuanced variations in surface composition to be detectable, improving the probability of distinguishing bacterium A from B while also expanding the potential utility beyond species- or strain-level identification. By integrating interaction strengths across multiple chemically distinct surfaces we generate a unique bacterial identifier, the surface interaction profile (SIP) (Fig 1), designed to differentiate bacteria by direct comparison and to identify a clinical pathogen causing infection through comparison across a library of pre-measured SIPs. a, A schematic depicting the SIP, a novel bacterial identifier produced by combining interaction strengths between a given bacterium and a series of chemically unique surfaces. b, An illustration of a polyelectrolyte multilayer film assembled via the layer-by-layer approach. c-e, The chemical structures of polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (PDDA), polystyrene sulfonate (PSS), and polyethylenamine (PEI). f, A schematic of six test PEM surfaces (grey circles) encased in microfluidic channels (squares) in a polystyrene Petri dish. g, The protocol for bacterial-surface interactions: (1) pre-soaking PEM with PBS buffer (30 min), (2) introducing bacterial suspensions to each channel, (3) leaving them in contact for 10 minutes, and (4) rinsing channels with PBS. a, A schematic depicting the SIP, a novel bacterial identifier produced by combining interaction strengths between a given bacterium and a series of chemically unique surfaces. b, An illustration of a polyelectrolyte multilayer film assembled via the layer-by-layer approach. c-e, The chemical structures of polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (PDDA), polystyrene sulfonate (PSS), and polyethylenamine (PEI). f, A schematic of six test PEM surfaces (grey circles) encased in microfluidic channels (squares) in a polystyrene Petri dish. g, The protocol for bacterial-surface interactions: (1) pre-soaking PEM with PBS buffer (30 min), (2) introducing bacterial suspensions to each channel, (3) leaving them in contact for 10 minutes, and (4) rinsing channels with PBS. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0327489.g001 To test the distinguishing power of SIPs, we quantified the surface interaction strengths of twelve test bacteria across three discrete, chemically distinct polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) films (Fig 1b) topped with the following positive- and negative-charged polymers: poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) (Fig 1c), polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) (Fig 1d), and polyethylenimine (PEI) (Fig 1e). All PEMs were encased in individual microfluidic channels (Fig 1f) and were exposed to four serially diluted bacterial suspensions (prepared via three biological replicates) through the following steps (Fig 1g): (1) pre-soaking the PEMs, (2) introducing bacterial suspensions to the channels, (3) leaving them in contact for 10 minutes, and (4) removing excess and loosely bound cells via rinsing. The remaining surface-attached bacteria were counted via optical microscopy and plotted against all suspension concentrations to build attachment curves (S1 Fig). Their slopes represented the interaction strength values for each bacterial-PEM combination and were collected (per bacterium) to produce each SIP (Fig 1g). A set of pathogens responsible for the majority of nosocomial infections [19] was tested to compare SIPs of bacteria broadly by Gram stain and individual species, including a blind experiment. This was followed by comparing SIPs across Staphylococcus aureus mutants affecting cell wall metabolism and antibiotic resistance (including single- and multi-drug-resistant mutants). The stock solutions (10 mg/mL) for polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (PDDA) (Aldrich, 208.00 mg/mL, Mw 100,000–200,000), polyethylenimine (PEI) (Aldrich, 50% wt, Mw 750,000), and polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) (Aldrich, 344.13 mg/mL, Mw 200,000) polyelectrolytes were prepared by weight and dissolved in deionized (DI) water (pH 6.998, Millipore Milli-Q) with magnetic stirring. Three working polymer solutions (1 mg/mL) for each polymer type were prepared by diluting each respective stock (x10) with DI water and were sonicated (10 minutes) prior to use. Using a template (S3 Fig a), thirty-six small circles (1 cm diameter) were drawn across the interior of six Petri dish lids that formed the perimeter of each individual PEM surface. Three polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) type surfaces were prepared via the layer-by-layer approach with the following combinations of positive and negative polymer layers: PDDA/PSS (5.5 bilayer, positively charged PDDA-topped PEM), PDDA/PSS (5 bilayer, negatively charged PSS-topped PEM), and PEI/PSS (5.5 bilayer, positively charged PEI-topped PEM). To begin, a small aliquot (100 µL) of the positively charged polymer was added to each marked circle: PDDA (1 mg/mL) for PDDA- (N = 12) and PSS-topped (N = 12) PEMs, and PEI (1 mg/mL) for the PEI-topped PEM surfaces (N = 12). Once the positive polymer solution was added to each circle (N = 36), they were left to interact for 1 minute. After the interaction period, each individual surface was rinsed from top to bottom (unidirectional flow) in the order that the polymer was added (~2 seconds duration per surface) with a light stream of DI water: the rinsing protocol is detailed in S4 Fig. With a single Petri lid held at an approximately 35˚ angle (a), three of six surfaces were rinsed individually from left to right (b) with the DI water waste collecting at the bottom lip of the lid. The lid was then rotated counterclockwise by 180˚ (c), maintaining its angled position and allowing the excess water to flow around the lid edge. The final three surfaces were rinsed from above in the same order (left to right) as above (d), and the accumulated DI water was subsequently poured out (e). The lids were then flipped upside down and firmly tapped eight times against three piled Kimwipes on the lab bench, removing excess DI water without contacting the PEMs (f). This process was repeated for all remaining surfaces. A small aliquot (100 µL) of PSS (1 mg/mL) was then added to all 36 surfaces in sequence and left to incubate for 1 minute. The same rinsing protocol (above) was used post-incubation. This cycle of polymer addition and rinsing was repeated a total of 9 times for the (+) PEMs and 8 times for the (-) PEMs. The polymer incubation period for the last two layers of each PEM type (layers 10 and 11 of the (+) PEMs and layers 9 and 10 for the (-) PEMs) were left to incubate for 5 minutes. After the final rinsing step, when all polyelectrolyte layers had been added, the surfaces were left to dry with the lids ajar. Four strips of double-sided tape (1/2 in. double-sided polyester film tape, Tesa) were cut (6 cm long), and one strip (i) was added between two of three PEM surfaces in each row (S3 Fig b). On either side of the first strip of tape, two more strips (ii and iii) were added parallel to the first at 0.7 cm on either side. Finally, the last strip (iv) was added with the same 0.7 cm spacing to the left of strip iii. This was repeated for all six Petri dish lids. Next, the top plastic layer of each strip of tape was carefully removed using a tweezer. Each PEM surface was topped with a thin glass coverslip (1.5x1.5 cm, VWR), where the PEM was positioned at the center, and the coverslip edges contacted the double-sided tape strips on either side (S3 Fig b). Pressure was applied by hand at all points of contact between the cover slip and tape. All chip inlets and the inlet-facing edge of all coverslips had hydrophobic boundaries drawn on via a black permanent marker (S3 c). Bacteria were first prepared by inoculating the strain of interest and incubating it overnight with shaking (220 RPM) at 37˚C in LB. Bacteria were sub-cultured the next day at 1:1000 into fresh LB and incubated with shaking at 37˚C for 4–6 hours to the desired optical densities measured at 600 nm (OD600). The specific species, strains, mutants, and OD600 measurements pre- and post-resuspension in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) can be found in S1 Table. All test bacteria were laboratory stock, and all Staphylococcus aureus walKR mutants were sourced from a previous study [20]. S. aureus ATCC29213 walR EV and walR murOP were both grown in LB containing 12 µg/mL chloramphenicol, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) CA-USA300 ∆tarO-10 was grown in LB containing 300 µg/mL spectinomycin. Next, two 1 mL aliquots were transferred to individual Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 8000 x g for 3 minutes to obtain a pellet for each strain. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended with 500 µL PBS. The 500 µL suspensions of two tubes from the same original culture were combined to produce a concentrated suspension (1 mL) each. The cells were rinsed two more times with PBS. Subsequently, all concentrated PBS suspensions were further serially diluted two-fold to produce four unique dilutions per suspension labelled C1-C4 from lowest to highest cell concentration. All bacteria were tested using three biological replicates, where each suspension was prepared from a single colony. All fluidic chips were arranged by PEM type in a biosafety cabinet with Petri covers removed. Groups of three PEMs in a row were marked C1-C4, covering all cell suspension concentrations per PEM type (N = 3 replicates per concentration per PEM type). The steps involved in the addition of a bacterial suspension to a fluid lane are illustrated in S5 Fig. Once the same-day bacterial suspensions reached the desired range of optical densities, all 36 fluid lanes were pre-wet with 100 µL of PBS for 30 minutes (1). Post-wetting, excess PBS buffer was removed via Kimwipe contact at both the fluid lane inlets and outlets while preventing the removal of PBS from the fluid lane interiors. Aliquots (70 µL) of C1-C4 cell suspensions were pipetted onto the marked lane inlets (N = 36), one suspension per lane per PEM type in triplicates, and were wicked through in sequence via Kimwipes in contact with the lane outlet (2). The suspensions were left to interact for 10 minutes (3). Post-interaction, all lanes were rinsed with a 100 µL aliquot of PBS buffer in the sequence that the suspensions were wicked through initially (4). This step was repeated for a total of 200 µL PBS wicked through using a fresh Kimwipe per lane. With all lanes rinsed, each PEM surface (N = 36) was imaged 10 times per surface (N = 360 total images per type of bacterium) using an inverted microscope (S5 Fig). All images were taken at 200x magnification, and the positions along each surface were selected randomly (S6 Fig). Areas containing large pieces of dust or debris were avoided. All images were batch processed in ImageJ (open source) to count the surface-bound cells: the left and right edges were cropped out, followed by applying the Find Maxima function (15 prominence, excluding edge cases) to extract cell counts. The batch processing macros code is as follows: makeRectangle(503, 1, 925, 1079); run(“Crop”); run(“Find Maxima...”, “prominence=15 exclude output=Count”); The mean cell counts across replicates per added bacterial suspension concentration (OD600) were plotted to produce attachment curves (mean ± SEM) per PEM type per bacterium (S2 Fig). All cell counts across all replicates were plotted per added bacterial suspension concentration (OD600) and a linear regression was applied. The interaction strength values (slope values) per bacterial-PEM combination were collected per bacterial type to produce each bacteria-specific SIP. Polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) films were selected as the probe substrates in this study due to their simple and highly reproducible fabrication process, the layer-by-layer assembly (Fig 1b), which yields robust thin films with easily adjustable surface properties [21]. The PEM surface properties (e.g. charge, hydrophobicity, roughness) are determined by the deposition conditions (e.g. pH, ionic strength) and the polymer type, primarily in the topmost exposed layer [22,23]. Each individual PEM offers a variety of interactions from the charged (positive or negative), uncharged, hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties present in the polymers used, expanding the pool of interactions needed while maintaining a small number of probing substrates. The individual polymer layers are deposited under equilibrium conditions, such that while they are structurally amorphous, the distribution of these distinct chemical features is reproducibly uniform. All fabricated PEMs used in this study were pre-wet with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) for 30 minutes to allow them time to reconfigure through polymer relaxation and to prevent this process from impacting the bacterial-PEM interactions. Bacteria were introduced as liquid suspensions in PBS to ensure that they remained viable throughout the duration of each experiment. The suspensions were introduced to each PEM through individual microfluidic channels (Fig 1f) that were designed to limit variability in fluid flow rate and direction. Shear stress caused by fluid flow can significantly impact bacterial attachment [24], requiring consistent control over the hydrodynamics of our channels. The SIPs of all test bacteria were plotted as a heat map (Fig 2a), highlighting distinct differences in the relative magnitudes of their interaction strengths across each PEM. While grouping the pathogen SIPs by Gram stain (Fig 2b), we observed the Gram-negative bacteria as having a stronger attachment preference for PEI while the Gram-positive bacteria preferred PSS. This was unsurprising, given that these two classes represent broad differences in bacterial envelope structure and surface chemistry, including polymer layers that encompass the cell. They comprise lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in Gram-negatives and teichoic acids (TA) in Gram-positives, both of which play an important factor in surface attachment [8]. For example, TAs were reported to be significant for attachment to plastics and glass found on biomedical devices [16]. Coincidentally, removing TAs in methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) through a tarO deletion produced SIPs with reduced attachment strengths across all PEMs compared to the wild type (WT) (Fig 2c). a, The interaction strengths of all twelve test bacteria plotted as a heatmap for SIP comparison. b, The SIPs organized by Gram stain (mean ± SEM). c-f, All SIPs across S. aureus mutants (mean ± SEM). a, The interaction strengths of all twelve test bacteria plotted as a heatmap for SIP comparison. b, The SIPs organized by Gram stain (mean ± SEM). c-f, All SIPs across S. aureus mutants (mean ± SEM). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0327489.g002 SIPs continued to be distinguishable at the species level among the clinically significant pathogens (Fig 2a), with differentiating factors including the average magnitude of interaction strengths across PEMs (average SIP), and the variance of interaction strengths across PEMs (SIP spread). Notably, among these strains, Pseudomonas aeruginosa displayed the highest average SIP, and vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA) had the smallest SIP spread. Isolating the exact differences in bacterial surface features that produced the observed shifts in SIP is non-trivial and beyond the scope of this initial study. However, experimental clues suggest that differences in SIPs may not be limited to surface chemistry alone. Within the Gram-negative pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa displayed significantly higher interaction strengths across all PEMs (Fig 1i) and is unique in its expression of flagella. These hairlike appendages confer swimming motility and increase the probability of surface encounters in P. aeruginosa [25,26], likely contributing to its increased average SIP. Examining other surface features and the genes that control them may be as simple as tracking changes in SIP between a set of mutants and their WT. To investigate further, we compared SIPs of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in S. aureus with single-point mutations in the wal operon, a key regulator of the autolysin-encoding genes in cell wall metabolism [27]. The first case study was S. aureus with a single-point mutation in walR, which reduced peptidoglycan recycling and increased the cell wall thickness [20]. This was followed by a subsequent single-point mutation in walK that restored cell wall metabolism and thickness back to approximately WT levels [20]. The walR SIP (Fig 2d) displayed a notable decrease in interaction strength for PEI and PSS and a comparable increase for PDDA, amounting to an overall drop in average SIP compared with the WT. The walK SIP reverted to an approximate WT SIP while preserving the order of PDDA and PEI preference from walR. In our second case study, cell wall thickness was reverted instead by adding the mupGmurQmurP operon encoded on a plasmid (Fig 2e), in effect corroborating the restoration of cell wall metabolism by producing a SIP similar to that of walK. Mutations in the walKR system have been linked to multidrug-resistant pathways in S. aureus [28]. Reduced susceptibility to vancomycin, a last-line antibiotic used to treat serious MRSA infections [29], is primarily associated with modifications to the cell wall peptide sequence that reduce the binding affinity and action of vancomycin [30]. However, vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA) isolates have also displayed thicker cell walls analogous to the walR mutant [12]. Coincidentally, the shifts in SIP from MRSA to VISA (Fig 1m) showed a decrease in average SIP and SIP spread, with drops in PEI and PSS interaction strengths similar to those observed in walR (Fig 1k). The more subtle shift in SIP from WT to MRSA (Fig 1m) was not unexpected as the action of methicillin resistance is mainly internal to the cell [31], though minor shifts in wall TA glycosylation have been observed [13]. Very subtle modifications like these could be detectable by improving SIP specificity through an increase in the number and diversity of test surfaces used to provide additional interactions. Regardless, both MRSA and VISA present serious risk factors in clinical settings [32,33] and being able to quickly distinguish between them (and possibly other resistant mutants) in tandem with bacterial identification presents an unignorable clinical potential for SIPs. In principle, we could determine the identity of an unknown pathogen by matching its SIP to one in a library of pre-measured SIPs. This library would be generated and continuously updated by measuring and compiling the SIPs of all current and new clinically relevant bacterial pathogens and antibiotic-resistant mutants using an optimized protocol developed for a future SIP-based diagnostic. To explore further, three test pathogens were randomly selected, their suspensions prepared blind, and their SIPs measured. We were able to successfully identify each blind test pathogen by comparing and matching SIPs (Fig 3a): i) Enterococcus faecalis, ii) Acinetobacter baumannii, and iii) Klebsiella pneumoniae. The attachment curves and interaction strength values between the blind test pathogens and their correctly identified clinically relevant strain counterparts displayed significant agreement across PEMs (Fig 3b) and were the highest percent matching pairs among all possible SIPs (S2 Table). a, All clinically significant pathogen and blind test pathogen SIPs are plotted as a heat map. b, The bacterial-surface attachment curves (surface-adhered cell counts plotted against suspension optical densities) of blind pathogens i, ii, and iii compared with their correctly identified counterparts E. faecalis, A. baumannii, and K. pneumoniae, respectively (mean ± SEM). a, All clinically significant pathogen and blind test pathogen SIPs are plotted as a heat map. b, The bacterial-surface attachment curves (surface-adhered cell counts plotted against suspension optical densities) of blind pathogens i, ii, and iii compared with their correctly identified counterparts E. faecalis, A. baumannii, and K. pneumoniae, respectively (mean ± SEM). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0327489.g003 Herein, we introduced a novel technique capable of rapidly differentiating a set of bacteria through their surface interactions, utilizing a quick 10-minute interaction period and only three probing surfaces. By comparing our first-generation SIPs, we were able to successfully distinguish between clinically significant pathogens from Gram stain to individual species. Furthermore, we confirmed the restoration of cell wall metabolism via tracking and comparing SIPs between a series of S. aureus mutants in the walKR system, broadening the scope and utility of this technique. Lastly, an early glance at its predictive capabilities combined with distinguishing single- and multidrug-resistant forms of S. aureus underscored its clinical relevance and future diagnostic potential in combining pathogen identification and AST under a single, rapid, low-cost test.

Title: Moonwell’s Founder Calls for Better Crypto UX: “Take the Hippocratic Oath to Your Users” | HackerNoon

Full Content:
One of web3’s biggest challenges today is designing for people who don’t already speak its language, so I was excited to sit down with Luke Youngblood to explore what it takes to build systems that reach beyond the crypto bubble. From AWS to Coinbase and now leading Moonwell, Luke brings deep infrastructure expertise and a sharp focus on making blockchain easier, safer, and more accessible. In the early days of crypto, most people accessed it from a desktop computer on a fast internet connection. If you were early to Bitcoin or Ethereum, you were probably a developer like me—or a gamer—using it on your gaming PC. Either way, at that time, you needed some serious hardware and bandwidth just to run a wallet or interact with DeFi apps. In the last few years, decentralized finance (DeFi) apps have become usable on mobile web. That brought us a step closer to real accessibility; today, you can use most apps on chains like Ethereum or Base directly from your phone in a browser like Safari or Chrome. The next step, and one we’re already starting to see, is the use of native mobile apps. Zora, for example, now has an iOS app on Base. It’s a social and creative platform, and moving to native mobile is a big leap. That’s likely the direction we’ll take with Moonwell, too: building a great native experience on both iOS and Android. Of course, there are still other barriers to adoption—and language is a big one. Most early crypto apps simply assumed users spoke English. That might work in parts of the Americas or Europe, but it doesn’t hold in much of Latin America, Africa, or Asia, where English often isn’t the primary language. That’s why we’ve translated Moonwell into four additional languages: Spanish, Portuguese, Korean, and Chinese. We have to keep making web3 more accessible, not just in terms of devices and apps, but in terms of language and context, too. Reaching beyond the small percentage of people who speak English as a second language is key to global adoption. At the core of an open financial system is self-custody. People should be able to own and control their assets directly—without relying on a third party. That’s always been important to early crypto users like me: being able to hold your own tokens and actually use them. The fundamentals are simple: freedom to custody and freedom to transact. What’s not simple, though, is onboarding the next billion in a way that makes those freedoms real. First come, wallets. If you’ve ever installed one, you know how painful it can be. App store, endless options, weird UX, seed phrase anxiety… For someone new to crypto, it’s a maze. That whole flow needs to go. We think passkey wallets are the answer; they’re built into most phones, secured by biometrics like Face ID, and don’t require downloading anything or managing a seed phrase. Telling someone to store twelve or twenty-four recovery words in a drawer and hope they never lose them really isn’t the way. Passkeys solve this, too. They back up automatically to iCloud or Google Cloud, so if you lose your phone, you can recover your wallet without panic or paperwork. Most people don’t use password managers—another problem—but at least modern browsers and OSs are making that easier. Still, access to the latest hardware isn’t universal. That’s a gap we can’t ignore. And then there’s transaction fees. Most onchain apps still expect users to buy ETH just to make a transaction, which adds unnecessary friction. At Moonwell, we solve this with Paymasters and sponsored transactions. First-time users can create a passkey wallet, enable cloud backup, and start using the app without ever buying ETH or worrying about fees. On Base, we use credits from Coinbase’s Gasless campaign to cover costs; on other networks, we sponsor transactions with USDC. The cost is low—just twenty dollars can cover thousands of transactions, making it easier for users to get started and for developers to scale. This way, we can onboard people without having to ask them to pay just to try an app—and it changes everything! Think about web2 apps like Instagram. It just works, it’s free. You never think about paying to post a photo. DeFi needs to feel that simple, too, if we want people to actually use it. One of the things I’ve noticed—after using the internet for decades since I was a kid—is how much it has evolved when it comes to networks. Back in the early days, if you wanted to connect with someone online, you had to think about which network you were on. I remember using university networks and dial-up bulletin board systems. You couldn’t just go anywhere; you had to log into a specific system to reach specific people. Everything was its own little walled garden. And honestly, that’s how crypto feels today. Ethereum, Base, other layer 1s, and layer 2s—there are bridges between them, but using apps across chains is still a hassle. If your wallet is connected to one network, you can’t easily interact with an app on another. You always have to think about where your tokens are and how to move them. So at Moonwell, we’ve been trying to solve this. We built a feature called Beam, already live in its early version, to make cross-chain UX feel like single-chain UX. Beam shows your total balance across chains—if you’ve got $50 on one chain, $25 on another, and $25 elsewhere, we just show you $100. When you hit “deposit” and sign the transaction, Beam gathers your tokens, bridges them if needed, and deposits them—all behind the scenes. To do that, we use a modular execution environment that picks the fastest and most cost-effective route. In many cases, that’s Across Protocol, which is great for bridging efficiently. The user stays in control the whole time—they’re still signing the transaction—but the complexity is abstracted away. It’s both faster and cheaper. Even when bridging from Ethereum mainnet, the process takes just a few minutes. We bundle transactions using an intents-based system, so your share of the gas might only be a penny or two. It's not like those big onchain operations that cost $15 or more. Under the hood, it's complex, but to the user, it feels simple and seamless. Too much of web3 expects users to think about the underlying infrastructure. What chain they are on, how to bridge assets, or whether an app is even compatible with their wallet. That’s not a good user experience—it’s just extra friction. The “Switch Network” prompt you see in many wallets is a great example. It’s really one of the clearest signs we haven’t abstracted the complexity away. If you look at messaging, be it via SMS or WhatsApp, you send a text, and it delivers. You’re not wondering what carrier the other person uses—it’s invisible to you. That’s what people expect from software. Web3 should be no different. Users shouldn’t be blocked from an app just because it runs on a different chain. With Beam, we’re pushing infrastructure into the background, where it belongs. My hope is that in a few years, no one will care whether they’re on Ethereum, Solana, Base, or BNB Chain. They’ll just open the app—whether it’s Moonwell, a game on Sonium, or something on World Chain—and it’ll just work. Before I went full-time into crypto, I worked in web2 tech—at Amazon Web Services (AWS). And in many ways, the adoption of cloud services mirrors what’s happening now with web3. In the early days, most companies didn’t take the cloud seriously. If you worked in tech back then, you were probably dealing with massive data centers and centralized systems like Oracle. When AWS launched EC2—the Elastic Compute Cloud—in the 2000s, big enterprises saw it as a toy. Something for startups or hobbyists, not real infrastructure. But now, most of the largest businesses in the world use cloud as their default. It’s faster, cheaper, and more flexible because you only pay for what you use. That’s very similar to what’s happening with web3 and financial apps today. Legacy banking infrastructure often takes days to settle transactions, while web3 enables instant cross-border settlements. We’re upgrading the financial system much like engineers upgraded from on-prem data centers to cloud services in the 2010s. By adopting new financial infrastructure—smart contracts and web3—banks, fintechs, and traditional finance companies will be able to offer far better services. Much of this will be powered by protocols like Moonwell, because we’ve spent years building decentralized infrastructure that’s self-custodial, permissionless, and gives people real control over their money. The GENIUS Act recently passed the U.S. Senate, marking the first step toward allowing banks to hold stablecoins on their balance sheets. It still needs to pass the House and be signed by the President, but if it does, the “crypto economy” may soon just be “the economy. Big banks—like Bank of America, Santander in Latin America, and Brazil’s BTG Pactual—will want to integrate stablecoin infrastructure into their core products. That means instant cross-border settlements and cheaper remittances, which is a big deal for people in places like Colombia who currently wait days and pay high fees to services like MoneyGram to receive money from abroad. It’s exciting to see the traditional finance system upgrading to support onchain finance and stablecoins, just like the cloud transformed data centers and opened up new possibilities for services that didn’t exist before. That’s a tough question. Large traditional finance players will always want to centralize control because they want to protect their existing business models. Decentralization threatens that, so there’s a natural tension. Some of these centralized players will build private networks. For example, BlackRock has its BUIDL Fund on Ethereum and Base. It’s a tokenized fund that lets people invest in traditional financial assets. The fund is an ERC-20 token, but it’s permissioned—only licensed broker-dealers, ATS (Alternative Trading Systems), and other regulated market participants can hold it. So, there will be centralized assets—like tokenized stocks—that you can only interact with if you’re a bank, brokerage, or have passed KYB (Know Your Business) checks. However, I think decentralization and permissionless self-custody can still exist through intermediaries. For instance, if the BlackRock BUIDL Fund is only available to institutions, retail investors like me can’t buy it directly. But a bank or fintech could become a licensed participant, join the fund as an institution, and then offer retail banking services to customers like me. They’d do KYC on me, and then I could buy and transact with a wrapped version of the fund. But that’s just an example; you can imagine similar things for tokenized stocks—it would mean only US investors can hold them if they’ve completed KYC through a bank. This setup would look somewhat like the current financial system, but with benefits like instant settlement—you wouldn’t have to wait two days for stock certificates to clear. It’s much more efficient. A concrete example is loan origination. Instead of waiting days or weeks for human loan officers to review credit and approve loans, decentralized apps like Moonwell can originate thousands of loans in a single day automatically using smart contracts. So, as traditional finance adopts web3 tech, you’ll see huge efficiency gains. But ultimately, retail users will still be able to take the self-custodial route. I might buy a fraction of Nvidia stock and hold it in my own wallet—not through BlackRock or a big bank, but via something like E*TRADE or a retail-focused platform offering a faster, cheaper experience powered by blockchain. Put yourself in the user’s shoes. When I build onchain apps, I think of it like a Hippocratic oath. For doctors, that means avoiding harm to the patient. For us, it means protecting the user and their funds, no matter what. Of course, crypto has its share of hacks, so as builders, we must never release anything that isn’t audited, secure, and backed by a solid bug bounty. Malicious actors will always try to steal from your users, so protecting user funds has to be a top priority. The other piece is decentralization. Early on, it’s tempting to keep control centralized—you can move faster. But if your app grows to millions in value, you don’t want all control in one place or one person’s hands. It puts your team and users at risk, making you a target. It’s important to think early about moving control to a DAO or decentralized governance by token holders, and to distribute those tokens widely. Moonwell has over 100,000 WELL token holders who govern the protocol. That setup lets us upgrade contracts and add markets safely without centralized control. It builds resilience and helps us sleep better at night. Start by exploring. Moonwell’s a good place to learn how lending and borrowing work onchain. And if you’ve got questions along the way, Mamo’s there too—it’s a cute little AI companion we built to help people get more comfortable with the basics. The jump from curious to confident takes time, so start small and stay curious!

Title: Too Many Leaders Are In Denial About AI's Job Displacement Threat

ByMark Murphy ByMark Murphy, Senior Contributor. Too Many Leaders Are In Denial About AI's Job Displacement Threat There's been no shortage of news about recent workforce changes and even layoffs as a result of AI. Perhaps most famously, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote in a message to employees: "As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done. We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. It's hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company." Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet and Google, speaking on a recent earnings call about AI, said, "But beyond that, all the way from the Finance team preparing for this earnings call, to everything, it’s deeply embedded in everything we do. But I still see it as early days, and there’s going to be a lot more to do." IBM has reportedly eliminated around 8,000 positions, including a large number in HR, while CEO Arvind Krishna noted that the company has been aggressively adopting AI and automation. Joining the list of notable companies with AI-related layoffs are Microsoft, Intel, Meta, CrowdStrike, Salesforce, Dell, and more. Now, technology companies are, not surprisingly, the ones making headlines, but the impact of AI is being felt far beyond the tech industry. Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, an AI powerhouse, recently told Axios that AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs and spike unemployment to 10-20% in the next one to five years. Aneesh Raman, chief economic opportunity officer at LinkedIn, recently wrote that "While the technology sector is feeling the first waves of change, reflecting A.I.'s mass adoption in this field, the erosion of traditional entry-level tasks is expected to play out in fields like finance, travel, food and professional services, too." But here's where the story takes a troubling turn. While CEOs and industry leaders are publicly acknowledging AI's transformative impact on employment, a comprehensive new study from Leadership IQ reveals that the vast majority of business leaders may be living in denial about what's actually coming. The AI Readiness 2025 study, which surveyed 1,251 executives, directors, and managers across diverse industries, uncovered a striking paradox that should alarm anyone concerned about organizational preparedness. Despite nearly 80% of business leaders now personally using AI tools—a dramatic surge from just two years ago—a staggering 56.4% either don't expect AI to replace employees in their organizations over the next three years or remain completely uncertain about it. Let that sink in for a moment. More than half of the decision-makers responsible for steering organizations through the AI revolution either don't see job displacement coming or have no idea whether it's coming at all. AI Readiness 2025 Study The breakdown is even more revealing: 35.9% of leaders flatly don't believe AI will replace employees, while another 20.5% simply don't know. Only 43.6% acknowledge that AI will likely lead to job displacement, with just 12.8% expecting a "significant number" of replacements and 30.8% anticipating a "small number." What makes these findings particularly concerning is their consistency with our 2023 baseline study. Despite nearly three years of unprecedented AI development since ChatGPT's launch, despite the public statements from tech CEOs about workforce reductions, and despite widespread personal experience with AI tools, leadership attitudes about AI's employment impact have remained remarkably static. This isn't simply a case of cautious optimism—it's a potentially dangerous case of what researchers call "optimism bias," where decision-makers systematically underestimate the likelihood and severity of negative outcomes. When Andy Jassy tells his employees that Amazon will "need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today," but 56% of business leaders don't expect job displacement in their own organizations, we have a fundamental disconnect between industry reality and leadership perception. The implications are staggering. If the majority of business leaders are unprepared for AI-driven workforce changes, their organizations will be caught flat-footed when those changes accelerate. Employees will receive inadequate warning and retraining opportunities. Strategic planning will be based on flawed assumptions. And companies may find themselves scrambling to adapt when competitors who took AI's impact seriously begin to pull ahead with leaner, more AI-integrated operations. Perhaps most telling is that this skepticism extends to leaders' views of their own roles. Despite using AI tools daily and seeing their capabilities firsthand, 46% of business leaders either don't believe AI will impact their own jobs or remain uncertain about it. This personal blind spot may be fueling the broader organizational denial. It's a classic case of "it won't happen to me" thinking, amplified across entire leadership teams. If executives can't acknowledge that AI might transform their own roles—roles that often involve strategic thinking, analysis, and decision-making that AI is increasingly capable of supporting or even replacing—how can they realistically assess the impact on their organizations? This leadership disconnect creates a "preparation crisis." While AI capabilities continue expanding at breakneck speed, the majority of organizations may be operating under the assumption that significant workforce disruption isn't coming—or at least isn't coming soon. The contrast with forward-thinking leaders couldn't be starker. When Dario Amodei warns that AI could eliminate half of entry-level white-collar jobs and spike unemployment to 10-20% within five years, he's not speaking hypothetically. Anthropic is at the forefront of AI development, and their CEO has a front-row seat to what's coming next. Yet our study suggests that most business leaders either haven't internalized these warnings or don't believe they apply to their organizations. This isn't just concerning—it's potentially catastrophic for organizational competitiveness and employee welfare. Despite these concerns, there is a glimmer of hope. A recent PwC report found that workers with AI skills command a 56% wage premium. And given how few people have advanced AI skills, it's really not that hard to elevate your AI skillset quickly and stand out from everyone else. As Amazon's CEO put it in his memo, "Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company."

Title: GoFundMe launches new funds aimed at maximizing charitable donations

Alicia Adamczyk is a New York City-based senior writer at Fortune, covering personal finance, investing, and retirement. Nina Ajemian is the newsletter curation fellow at Fortune and works on the Term Sheet and MPW Daily newsletters. – Funding the future. Even when they are not the breadwinners, women tend to make many of their households’ financial decisions, including charitable giving. And with the impending great wealth transfer, in which women in particular are expected to inherit trillions upon trillions of dollars, that could have profound effects on charitable giving throughout the country in the near future. That’s according to Margaret Richardson, GoFundMe’s chief marketing and corporate affairs officer, who I talked to last week about women and philanthropy and the company’s newest product launch. According to Richardson, women are busier than ever. And while they can and have managed many of these household tasks, many are also looking for ways to make managing their finances more seamless. “Women are often the charitable decision makers already in their families, and we see that that trend just continuing as women have more resources and more responsibilities,” says Richardson. That is one of the reasons GoFundMe is launching its newest product today, one it hopes will make charitable giving easier and more impactful—and attract some of those trillions. Called Giving Funds, it is a type of donor-advised fund that will allow users to contribute to the charitable investment accounts right on GoFundMe’s site. Donor-advised funds, or DAFs, are growing in popularity, as I wrote last year. They are tax-advantaged accounts for charitable giving, in which lump sum or automated recurring contributions can be invested; eventually the contributions and gains will go to charity, and they grow tax-free. It can be helpful to think of DAFs as similar to a 401(k), health savings account, or 529 account. Money contributed to a DAF cannot be taken back, it is effectively a charitable contribution and donors are generally eligible to take an immediate tax deduction. The benefit is that you can donate now, get that tax deduction now (if you itemize), invest the funds, and then have more to give in the future. GoFundMe is partnering with fund managers like BlackRock, State Street Global Advisors, and Vanguard to advise on the investment options, which are a number of exchange-traded funds. Though plenty of financial institutions offer DAFs, Richardson says the benefit of doing it on GoFundMe is that users will have all of their charitable giving centralized, and receive one annual tax document. There are no management fees and no minimum balances, and users can give their funds to any of the 1.4 million charities on the platform. Despite their tax benefits, DAFs are still fairly niche products—only about 1% of Americans use them, says Richardson, though an increasingly larger share of the U.S.’s total annual charitable contributions stem from them with each passing year. But a site like GoFundMe offering them could be the start to broadening their appeal—after all, the site has some 200 million users from all income levels, races, and genders. It could be many peoples’ first exposure to the investment tool. And, she says, it makes it easier for people to plan ahead. Many users come to GoFundMe after a natural disaster or other event to find causes to donate to. If they already have a pot of money waiting there that they previously donated—and that has possibly grown as it was invested—it can make all of their charitable giving more seamless. “This could be a really efficient and effective way for people to…get [funds] out the door quickly when organizations need it most,” she says.

A reversal in disability benefits from the U.K.’s prime minister has eliminated £3 billion ($4.1 billion) in savings, leaving chancellor Rachel Reeves with the question: Where is she going to find the funds to stay on track in meeting her budget rules? Bloomberg - Regional relocations. Following the protests in Los Angeles over ICE raids, Kelly Loeffler’s Small Business Administration (SBA) is moving some of its offices out of “sanctuary cities.” Losing these regional offices could have a real impact on the over 1.3 million small businesses in L.A., as founders will now have to travel to other offices for SBA services. Inc. - Large losses. Since Roe was overturned in 2022, the U.S. has sustained $133 billion in economic losses annually, says a new analysis from the Institute for Women’s Policy Research.

Giving Funds is GoFundMe’s latest in a flurry of product rollouts with the purported goal of moving stagnant U.S. charitable contributions beyond the 2% GDP mark where totals have long hovered NEW YORK -- GoFundMe CEO Tim Cadogan had some complications while fundraising on his own website last fall. Several friends wanted to help Cadogan reach his $28,000 goal as he crowdfunded for a Los Angeles area wilderness rescue team. But they tried to donate through a lesser-known wealth management tool called a donor-advised fund, or a DAF, a no-frills investing vehicle for money earmarked as eventual charitable gifts. After cutting checks and waiting three weeks, Cadogan said, the money finally arrived. “It was just a bit of a thing,” he added. "If they were using a Giving Fund, it would take ten seconds.” Giving Funds are GoFundMe's latest in a flurry of product rollouts with the purported goal of moving stagnant U.S. charitable contributions beyond the 2% GDP mark where totals have long hovered. But the for-profit company's DAF, announced Monday, enters a crowded market of more than a thousand providers — products often with older, wealthier clienteles that are often criticized for warehousing gifts. To transform the way that everyday users plan their donations, Cadogan will have to widen the appeal of DAFs beyond the likes of the technology entrepreneur's circles. And he wants to change public perceptions of his company as just a crowdfunding site. “We’re also hopeful that more people will start using GoFundMe for a broader set of things in their lives: not just that one fundraiser they’re supporting, not just that one nonprofit. But they’re coming in and they’re managing their giving portfolio with us and through us,” Cadogan said. “That connects directly to our mission, which is we want to help people help each other.” Donor-advised funds grew popular over the last decade among ultra-high net worth individuals as a tax-efficient instrument for grantmaking without the hassle of a more sophisticated charitable foundation. Donors can immediately write the contribution off on their taxes but face no deadline for giving the money to a nonprofit. The idea: account holders could invest money they wanted to ultimately donate, let the funds grow tax-free while they sit and give themselves time to identify the recipients best aligned with their giving goals. There's since been a rush to court average givers. Legacy financial services firms such as Fidelity Charitable lowered the minimums to open accounts. Fintech startups such as Daffy contrast their flat fees with the hidden expenses they allege their competitors charge. All that traction brought IRS proposals last year to impose penalties on those who abuse DAFs and Congress has considered legislation that would require some deadlines for disbursements. GoFundMe's Giving Funds will have no minimum balances, zero management fees and donations starting at $5. Users can load their DAF through their bank accounts or direct deposits for free. Credit card payments will be covered through the end of the year and then face the company's standard transaction fee of 2.2% plus 30 cents. Contributions can then be invested in a choice of exchange traded funds from managers including Vanguard, Blackrock and State Street Global Advisors. Cadogan pitches Giving Funds as a way to be more intentional about giving — something he said user feedback suggests more people want. As he sees it, widespread adoption hasn't occurred because DAFs have been framed as “wealth management products.” “This is a giving product,” Cadogan said. “It’s something for everybody. And you don’t need to know the words ‘donor advised fund.’ It doesn’t show up.” DAFs remain scrutinized for allowing donors to reap tax benefits before they ever redistribute any money to charitable causes — even if the notion that the channel is being exploited is fiercely debated in the nonprofit sector. Opaque disclosure requirements make it difficult to put a number on the overall assets held within the funds. The National Philanthropic Trust placed the total at more than $250 billion in 2023. Cadogan believes GoFundMe's culture is uniquely suited to nudge users with targeted spotlights of the 1.5 million charities already active on the platform. Giving Funds holders will be peppered with information about local nonprofits, crisis responders, their friends' charities of choice and potential beneficiaries that address their selected issue areas. That “dynamic, alive community” is very different from the “fairly static, passive” financial vehicles in the current market, according to Cadogan. “It’s essentially inspiring the money to move,” he said. Other features seek to encourage contributions by simplifying things. Users can set annual giving goals by a percentage of their income or a fixed number. Their gifts will tally up in real-time records to track their progress and ease year-end tax planning. Streamlining the process was one area for improvement identified in the DAF Research Collaborative's recent survey of more than 2,100 donors. But Jeff Williams, one of the researchers, said DAFs are currently hitting the “sweet spot of convenience and connection to nonprofits.” The challenge for any new player, he said, is that it's a competitive environment with many different options. Plus, he added, many DAFs already are “available-to-everyone vehicles" considering that half run balances under $50,000. “Givers are voting with their feet that DAFs are increasing with popularity. More options are generally better,” Williams said. “Anything that makes sure we maintain or enhance the ease of giving, it makes me happier.” But Direct Relief CEO Amy Weaver, previously the CFO at Salesforce, described GoFundMe's entrance as “a game changer” that could unlock additional funds. Direct Relief, a nonprofit that supplies free medical resources worldwide, reported receiving more than 18,000 DAF gifts totaling $116 million over the past five years. Weaver acknowledged DAFs have been traditionally used by those with more substantial wealth. But she encouraged people to view them as a “savings account" for "good works." “And GoFundMe, with its name familiarity and the fact that it really attracts people making smaller gifts, I think could be incredibly powerful if they can bring DAFs to that group of people,” she said. ___ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Cadogan pitches Giving Funds as a way to be more intentional about giving — something he said user feedback suggests more people want. As he sees it, widespread adoption hasn't occurred because DAFs have been framed as “wealth management products.” “This is a giving product,” Cadogan said. “It’s something for everybody. And you don’t need to know the words ‘donor advised fund.’ It doesn’t show up.” DAFs remain scrutinized for allowing donors to reap tax benefits before they ever redistribute any money to charitable causes — even if the notion that the channel is being exploited is fiercely debated in the nonprofit sector. Opaque disclosure requirements make it difficult to put a number on the overall assets held within the funds. The National Philanthropic Trust placed the total at more than $250 billion in 2023. Cadogan believes GoFundMe's culture is uniquely suited to nudge users with targeted spotlights of the 1.5 million charities already active on the platform. Giving Funds holders will be peppered with information about local nonprofits, crisis responders, their friends' charities of choice and potential beneficiaries that address their selected issue areas. That “dynamic, alive community” is very different from the “fairly static, passive” financial vehicles in the current market, according to Cadogan. “It’s essentially inspiring the money to move,” he said. Other features seek to encourage contributions by simplifying things. Users can set annual giving goals by a percentage of their income or a fixed number. Their gifts will tally up in real-time records to track their progress and ease year-end tax planning. Streamlining the process was one area for improvement identified in the DAF Research Collaborative's recent survey of more than 2,100 donors. But Jeff Williams, one of the researchers, said DAFs are currently hitting the “sweet spot of convenience and connection to nonprofits.” The challenge for any new player, he said, is that it's a competitive environment with many different options. Plus, he added, many DAFs already are “available-to-everyone vehicles" considering that half run balances under $50,000. “Givers are voting with their feet that DAFs are increasing with popularity. More options are generally better,” Williams said. “Anything that makes sure we maintain or enhance the ease of giving, it makes me happier.” But Direct Relief CEO Amy Weaver, previously the CFO at Salesforce, described GoFundMe's entrance as “a game changer” that could unlock additional funds. Direct Relief, a nonprofit that supplies free medical resources worldwide, reported receiving more than 18,000 DAF gifts totaling $116 million over the past five years. Weaver acknowledged DAFs have been traditionally used by those with more substantial wealth. But she encouraged people to view them as a “savings account" for "good works." “And GoFundMe, with its name familiarity and the fact that it really attracts people making smaller gifts, I think could be incredibly powerful if they can bring DAFs to that group of people,” she said. ___ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have become a $3.4 trillion market this year as U.S. president Donald Trump helps drive the bitcoin price with a wild crypto prediction. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price is nearing its all-time high of $112,000 per bitcoin, bouncing back from April lows of $75,000, with markets braced for a Federal Reserve flip. Now, as a legendary billionaire has said he expects global “de-dollarization" to catapult the bitcoin price higher, traders are eyeing what Trump’s crypto czar David Sacks has said will be a “big” July, while the Federal Reserve is under pressure to cut interest rates and unleash the “trillions and trillions” of dollars that are on the sidelines. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. president Donald Trump's second term in the White House has helped the bitcoin price soar. "July will be a big month," Sacks posted to X, adding that he's expecting "a bill signing" for the stablecoin Genius Act, and the crypto market structure Clarity Act “going to the Senate.” "President Trump supports Clarity on market structure as well as Genius on stablecoins," Sacks posted. "Let’s get this done!" The Trump administration has fast-tracked crypto legislation, rushing to pass bills that would legitimise dollar-pegged stablecoins and carve up the bitcoin and crypto market between regulators after companies and developers complained for years they’ve been left in limbo. Earlier this month, the Senate passed the Genius Act that would establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, legitimizing their use for issuers and custodians. Trump said he expected the the Genius Act to lead to “massive” crypto investment once if it’s passed by the House of Representatives. Trump’s support of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies more broadly has flourished since he returned to the White House in January. Last week, Trump said bitcoin is taking "a lot of pressure off the dollar, and it is a great thing for our country," during a press conference, adding bitcoin has “become amazing.” The U.S. dollar index, which measures its performance against six other major currencies, is on track for its biggest drop in the first six months of a year since the era of free-floating currencies began in the early 1970s.

More as a perfect storm of U.S. president Donald Trump and the Federal Reserve hits. Meanwhile, Powell, who Trump has repeatedly attacked for his commitment to holding interest rates steady even as inflation falls toward its 2% target, is under increasing pressure to lower rates. “Jerome Powell is in an increasingly untenable situation because he will be looked at as politicizing the office of the Federal Reserve,” investor Chamath Palihapitiya said during an episode of the All In Podcast, which he hosts alongside crypto czar David Sacks and fellow investors David Friedburn and Jason Calacanis. “Look at how much money is sitting in money market funds … you have trillions and trillions of dollars of dry powder on the sidelines that will need to find a home.” Bitcoin and crypto analysts are generally feeling upbeat about the market’s outlook as policy, macro and funding factors align. “The setup for bitcoin remains compelling,” Matt Mena, crypto research strategist at 21Shares, said in emailed comments. “A clean break above $110,000 could trigger a fast move to $120,000—putting our $138,500 summer target within reach. With policy, macro, and flows aligning, bitcoin may be setting up for a bullish end to the year—where a push toward $200,000 is no longer just a long shot, but a growing probability."

"Admittedly, a month is too short a period to make a call on a definite trend, but it’s an area to watch closely.”

(“Credicorp” or “the Company”) (NYSE:BAP | BVL: BAP), the leading financial services holding company in Peru with a presence in Chile, Colombia, Bolivia, and Panama, through its subsidiary Grupo Credito S.A. initiates legal action against the Peruvian Tax Administration (Superintendencia Nacional de Aduanas y de Administración Tributaria – SUNAT), for disregarding the law and the decision of SUNAT´s Review Committee (Comité Revisor), whose rulings are binding under current legislation. The Company expresses concern that SUNAT is ignoring the legal framework in effect at the time of the transactions in question, thereby undermining legal certainty for companies operating in Peru. The transactions in question involved Grupo Crédito S.A. purchasing Banco de Crédito del Perú (BCP) shares from Credicorp Ltd. in 2018 and 2019, through the Lima Stock Exchange. At the time, Peruvian law exempted such transactions from income tax, provided that the transferred shares did not exceed 10% of the total outstanding shares of the issuing company within a 12-month period. These transactions were communicated to the Superintendencia del Mercado de Valores (SMV), approved by the Superintendencia de Banca, Seguros y AFP (SBS), and duly registered with Registro Central de Valores y Liquidaciones (CAVALI). They were conducted transparently and in full compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Credicorp notes that this case was previously reviewed by SUNAT’s own Review Committee, which confirmed the authenticity of the transactions and found no grounds for tax elusion claims. Nevertheless, SUNAT has reopened the matter and is now seeking over S/. 1.5 billion in purported unpaid income tax and accrued interest. Credicorp views this action as a serious breach of legal predictability, given it involves both the disregard of established legal norms, and the reopening of a case already assessed and resolved by SUNAT’s own Review Committee. In accordance with International Accounting Standards, no expense provisions are necessary. Credicorp is evaluating this new development and will respond through all appropriate legal and administrative channels. Grupo Crédito S.A., the entity involved, reaffirms its commitment to full regulatory and tax compliance, and to protecting the interests of its employees, clients, and investors.

Title: Click, speak, move: These brain implants are poised to help people with disabilities

Jon Hamilton Phillip McKenzie, who was paralyzed from the neck down in a fall in 2012, uses a brain-computer interface developed by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh to navigate complex virtual tasks that simulate everyday activities, UPMC and Pitt Health Sciences hide caption People who have lost the ability to move or speak may soon have a new option: surgically implanted devices that link the brain to a computer. More than two decades after researchers first demonstrated that a person could move a computer cursor with their thoughts, several firms are poised to take the brain-computer interface (BCI) from experimental curiosity to commercial product. "We know it works, we know the enabling technologies are now ready," says Michael Mager, the CEO of Precision Neuroscience. "It's time to turn this academic work into a thriving industry that can make a big impact on people's lives." Already, experimental brain-computer interfaces have been implanted in dozens of people. The latest devices go under the skin and can communicate wirelessly with a smartphone or tablet. Elon Musk's Neuralink is the most visible player in the BCI field. But the first product to reach the market may well come from competitors including Precision, Blackrock Neurotech, Paradromics, or Synchron. Some of these companies, like Blackrock, have much more experience than Neuralink. Others use less invasive, and potentially safer, technology that may make it easier to get approval from the Food and Drug Administration. The first BCI customers are likely to be people living with paralysis from a spinal injury or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Early products will allow them to control a computer cursor, or generate artificial speech. Implanted BCIs work by detecting and decoding signals coming from areas of the brain that control movement or speech. These signals indicate when a person is trying to move a limb or speak a word. A BCI system typically includes sensors that detect brain activity, an interface that processes the signals, and an external device that turns thought into action. The result: A cursor moves, a prosthetic hand reaches, a synthetic voice speaks the words a person is trying to articulate. "Imagine the joy of connecting with your loved ones, browsing the web, or even playing games using only your thoughts," says the narrator of a promotional video from Neuralink. The company, which did not respond to requests for an interview, calls this capability "telepathy." Neuralink pushed BCIs into the public imagination in early 2024, thanks to a charismatic and resilient man with paralysis. A diving accident left Noland Arbaugh unable to move from the shoulders down. At 29, he became the first person to get Neuralink's device. A robot threaded more than a thousand electrodes into his brain's motor cortex at the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix. Then, human surgeons there installed a wireless interface about the size of a quarter in his skull. A few weeks later, Arbaugh was on stage at Neuralink's headquarters in Fremont, California, describing his experience controlling a computer cursor. "It's freakin' wild," he said. "When I first moved it just by thinking, it blew my mind for like a day. I just could not wrap my head around it." A video featuring Arbaugh's remarks has attracted more than 25 million views on Musk's social media platform, X. But the success was tempered by Neuralink's announcement a few weeks later that some of the threads of electrodes in Arbaugh's brain had "retracted," making the device less sensitive. Since then, Neuralink has reported implanting its BCI in at least six other people. But details about those experiments remain scant. While Neuralink's surgical robots and wireless electronics are new, using thoughts to move a cursor isn't. Dr. Leigh Hochberg — who holds positions at Brown University and Massachusetts General Hospital — was part of a team that pioneered the approach in 2004. Their subject was Matt Nagle, a man who was living with paralysis after being stabbed in the neck. Hochberg's team linked Nagle's brain to a computer using old-fashioned wires that passed through his skull. A research video from 2004 shows Nagle using his thoughts to open an email. "It was exactly what was supposed to happen," Hochberg says. "And even for all of us that were expecting it — there was a little bit of magic there." Nagle died in 2007 of an infection unrelated to the experiment. BrainGate evolved into an academic consortium directed by Hochberg. And in June 2025, a team at the University of California, Davis reported that a BrainGate 2 BCI allowed a man with ALS to speak through a computer. "I. Am. Good," the synthesized voice says in a video accompanying the study. The speech is slightly halting, spoken one word a time. But the voice sounds human — it was constructed from old audio of the man speaking. Experiments like that one show how computer interfaces have improved, Hochberg says. Instead of monitoring a few dozen neurons, they may listen to thousands. Instead of sending information out through wires, they use wireless protocols. And instead of interfacing with a wall of computers, the signals may go to a single laptop or tablet. Another big change is that scientists keep finding ways to decode brain activity "more accurately, more consistently and more reliably," Hochberg says. In the past few years, that has meant employing artificial intelligence to recognize the neural activity patterns that reveal a person's intention to speak, or pick up a bar of chocolate. The field has also become specialized, Hochberg says, with some groups focused on decoding speech while others work on improving control of robotic limbs. There are even groups "focused on putting information back into the brain," Hochberg says, which can add a sense of touch to a robotic arm or hand. The University of Pittsburgh is among the leaders in providing sensory feedback through a brain-computer interface. "You can't have fine and dextrous motor control with visual feedback alone," says Jennifer Collinger, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh. You need that sense of touch to be able to respond in a natural way." With touch feedback, the user can tell when an artificial finger makes contact with an object or when an artificial hand is holding a cup tightly enough to keep it from falling. So Collinger and her colleagues have been working with Blackrock Neurotech, whose brain interface technology has been used experimentally in dozens of people. One of those people is Nathan Copeland, who was paralyzed in a car accident. In 2016, Copeland famously used a robotic arm to bump fists with President Barack Obama. In 2021, Copeland was part of a study that showed how a sense of touch improved his ability to grasp and manipulate objects with his prosthetic hand. "With sensation, I could feel that the hand had made contact," Copeland said in a 2021 interview with NPR. "I could also tell if I had a firm grip on it or not." But advanced features like sensory feedback aren't going to appear in the first implanted devices on the market, Collinger says. Instead, they are likely to offer control of a computer cursor, much like BrainGate did in those lab experiments more than 20 years ago. "There's been enough consistent success that now companies are saying, 'Okay we can offer a first-generation device to people that will offer some kind of benefit to them,'" Collinger says. One of those companies is Precision Neuroscience, which was cofounded by Ben Rapoport, a neurosurgeon and engineer who had previously helped start Neuralink. Precision's other co-founder and CEO, Michael Mager, says the company's short-term goal is a wireless device that allows a person with paralysis to operate a smartphone or computer. "We think about accessing news and entertainment, we think about productivity software like Microsoft Office, Word, Powerpoint, Excel," Mager says. "If you can operate those programs as well as someone who is able-bodied, it's quality-of-life enhancing — and it's also potentially enabling for people to go back to work." Precision's device differs from Neuralink's because it doesn't insert its electrodes into the brain. "We have a very, very thin film that is designed to sit on the surface of the brain without penetrating into or damaging the brain," Mager says. That makes the implant safer and less invasive, Mager says, which could make it easier to get approval from the FDA. Synchron avoids opening the skull entirely. Its electrodes are delivered through blood vessels using technology designed to place stents in blocked arteries. All of these devices face some common challenges, Mager says. "We're sampling from thousands of electrodes, thousands of times a second, and the amount of data that comes off of these systems is just enormous," he says. It is far too much data to transmit through existing wireless links. So companies are working on ways to reduce or compress the data. Another obstacle is the cost to conduct the sort of clinical trials required by the FDA. That will probably be hundreds of millions of dollars, Mager says. Even so, Mager thinks his company and several others, including Neuralink, have the resources and expertise to turn the brain interface concept into a marketable product. That won't take another 20 years, he says. Perhaps another two or three. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor

Surging inflows catapult IBIT to fourth-largest US ETF with rapid AUM growth, outshining rivals. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) is rapidly cementing its status as the most dominant BTC fund among its peers. Bitcoin analyst James Check highlighted the divergence in a June 29 X post, noting that total inflows across all other Bitcoin ETFs have stagnated around $20 billion since December 2024. In contrast, IBIT alone has drawn over $52 billion in cumulative inflows since its launch, solidifying its dominance in the space. He further pointed out that this trend is reflected in weekly inflow data, where IBIT attracts the lion’s share of new investments and shows minimal outflows compared to competitors. Check wrote: “Dominance for all other ETFs in terms of total AUM has been in constant decline, initially dominated by GTBTC outflows, but more recently due to a clear preference for IBIT by investors.” This matches data from Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, who noted that based on year-to-date inflows, IBIT now ranks as the fourth-largest ETF in the US. According to Balchunas’ data, IBIT has leapfrogged over SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 ETF (SPLG) and is closing in on heavyweights like Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI). As of June 23, IBIT had recorded $13.7 billion in inflows, which is ahead of SPLG’s $13.4 billion but below VTI’s $19.3 billion. He also highlighted IBIT’s outlier status, noting that the fund is “the fifth in three-year flows (despite only being alive for 1.5 years).” These inflows helped the fund cross $70 billion in assets under management (AUM) in just 341 trading days, the fastest rate for any US ETF. This breakout performance has translated into significant financial gains for BlackRock. Nate Geraci, president of ETF Store, pointed out that IBIT generates $186 million annually in fee revenue, surpassing even IVV (BlackRock’s flagship S&P 500 ETF) by $3 million. According to Arkham Intelligence, this milestone is particularly noteworthy given that IVV is nearly ten times larger than IBIT in terms of assets under management. The shift signals a broader change in institutional behavior. BlackRock, long associated with traditional equity markets, is now seeing more fee revenue from its Bitcoin ETF than from legacy stock-based products. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Eurobike 2025: the Weird and the Wonderful

Time Published: 2025-06-30T08:00:00Z

Eurobike 2025 swung open its doors to welcome the cycling industry into its new-as-of-a-few-years home in Frankfurt, where the usual assortment of weird and wonderful products awaited the eager eyes - and cameras - of the world's cycling media. Our intrepid trade show reporter Andi Sykes scoured the fairground halls for us in search of novel and newsworthy items, and this is what he came back with. Dive in! Stablead is a new name to the MTB scene. The company is better known for tripods and gimbals and hopes to bring some of their expertise in those fields to the MTB world. The bike Stablead had on display isn’t intended to be released but show off their manufacturing technologies and also display some of their products which include front and rear suspension, pedals, stems and more. This unnamed upside down fork will be released next year. It will be aimed at enduro riders with around 160-170mm of travel. The upper leg and steerer assembly is one piece to reduce weight, but make sure you get your steerer length correct before cutting! To compliment their fork, Stablead also had this rear shock with carbon canister. Details are thin, but from the sample on display we can see this air shock will feature rebound, compression adjustments, an adjustable bladder and have a lock out lever. On top of carbon parts, Stablead had a range of alloy products on display, all of which should be available from July this year. As well as various stems with a removable faceplate, they had this wrap around design and also a direct mount stem too. Their CNC machined chain sets are made from 7075 alloy with a hard-anodized finished and will be available in 155-175mm lengths at 5mm increments. The chainring is also a Stablead product. There were also 2 flat pedal designs, this thinner model being the more attractive and possibly lighter version (they were fastened down and there were not weight details on display). Again these are machined from 7075 alloy with a hard-anodized finish. I was able to pick this one up and it did feel quite hefty in the hand, but it also felt extremely burly too. I don’t think I’d be worry about clipping a few rocks with these. 32-inch wheels was one of the trends of the show, and this prototype ‘Big Ben’ bikes was used on the Maxxis stand to show off their new big hoops. It was made using machined alloy lugs with tubing bonded into place. The linkage included details of the suspension from the amount of travel (120mm) to the progressively of the kinematic. I suppose other links are available to quickly make changes to the ride. Like it or not, but 32-inch tires are here. It currently looks like it’s being aimed at the XC crowd, but perhaps the introduction of all these new USD forks means we can expect 32-inch wheels and tires to move in to Trail, Enduro and possibly even Downhill? Nukeproof were back at the show under their new owners Belgian Cycling Factory. On display was this prototype Dissent DH bike with a custom rear end. Not many details on this, but the front triangle is a stock Dissent where as the rear has been updated to alter the kinematics. Interestingly the pivots all use Ceramic Speed Bearings which is something usually you see in high-end hubs. A new version of the Nukeproof Reactor was on show. This was actually designed and developed by the original Nukeproof team before the company went under, but the new owners are bringing it back. The updated front triangle now has a flip chip to run either 29" or MX wheels. You all knew it was coming! Here’s the first of around 14 DJI powered bikes spotted at Eurobike 2025. The Commencal Meta SX DJI won’t be available until Spring 2026, but it was quite clearly a show favorite. The Meta SX DJI runs 160mm travel, comes as a mullet only and all sizes but the small have an 800Wh battery. This Eurobike actually marked the first time in many years that Commencal attended. This is NOT a Cotic! This is a Heintz titanium full suspension trail bike spotted in the handmade area of the show. While it might look similar and use a suspension lay-out similar to Cotic’s Drop Link, the builder had made a few changes such as internal cable routing with full internal titanium guides, and a switch to a Horst link rather than the link on the seat stay found on the UK bikes. Also found in the handmade area of the show was the new Orange Phase Evo, the brand's first ever DJI bike and the first DJI bike that is handmade in the UK. The Phase Evo runs around 160mm of travel on Orange’s traditional single pivot suspension layout. The bike uses a new construction design for the downtube where either a 600Wh or 800Wh battery can be fitted. Orange thinks weights could be as low as 20kg. Also spotted on the Orange were HUNT’s latest enduro wheel set the Enduro V3. These alloy wheels feature FEA developed front and rear specific rims and HUNT’s new 40t ratchet free hub design. As ridden by The Firm, T-Mac and many more! Spanish brand Abums had their steel E-MTB on display. This was one of the launch models of the new Mahle E-MTB system and is apparently the world’s first steel electric mountain bike with an integrated battery. Sometimes the greatest finds at Eurobike are the ones you bump into while walking between halls and that is exactly how I came across this one! Handmade in Germany, this is the Truebc trail bike boasting an integrated 8 Pins dropper post and mid pivot suspension layout. Truebc is better known for making carbon components such as MTB rims and gravel parts, but they decided to branch out with frame production. Rather than going for something simple for their first frame they went for a beautifully executed full suspension frame with really neat features. I especially liked the external cable and hose routing that is hidden with a neat carbon cover giving the aesthetic of internal routing but the simplicity of external. Teewing had their Turbo Force carbon trail bike on display at the show. While new to the MTB market, this Chinese brand was one of the brands that made up the 2nd wave of DJI Avinox E-MTB launches earlier in the year. Remember this name because they may soon have an Enduro bike on sale. Rotwild doesn’t have the same brand recognition in the UK as it once did, but in Germany they are still well known for high quality bikes and smart engineering. The new REX E-MTB has a (surprise surprise) DJI Avinox motor, a 4-bar, high pivot suspension layout, 8 Pins integrated dropper and 150mm of travel. But its party trick is the custom carbon battery that is not only larger than a standard Avinox battery but also easily removable. Most DJI bikes require the motor to be dropped to access the battery, but the Rotwild battery slots in to the downtube and can be easily removed and swapped out. Not that it will need much swapping as it is a larger 875Wh battery. Head is better known as a tennis or ski brand but they do also make mountain bikes and this Enduro bike has been something I’ve wanted to see for a while. It’s not listed on the official Head website (at the time of writing) but their social channels have been promoting it for a few months already. The alloy frame has a huge amount of stand over clearance, there’s a modern mid-pivot suspension design with an idler, and there is an interesting choice of components too. Head even have athletes competing on this bike at enduro races in Europe now! But I feel they could have come up with a better name than ‘Downey’. Steppenwolf had a couple of DJI-powered bikes, but it was the newly launched Tundra 11.0 that caught my attention. This 170mm travel enduro bike had an interesting rear suspension layout that, rumor has it, was developed with some input from Unno. Prime Bikes had their entire range of bikes on show at Eurobike 2025, but it was this unreleased trail bike that stole the show for them. The 140mm travel bike runs on 29-inch wheels and showcases the same level of fit and finish we’ve come to expect from Prime. The bike is so new that it isn’t even named yet! There was even a competition running to figure out what it should be called. What would you name it? Let us know in the comments below! Crussis, a Czech mountain bike brand released a whole host of DJI bikes prior to Eurobike. Everything from alloy hardtails all the way up to carbon trail and enduro full suspension bikes! Not only do they have a massive range of models but individual build options and then even an option to fit either a 600Wh or 800Wh battery. It sounds like a merchandising nightmare... Their prices are impressive with an alloy DJI full suspension bike costing as little as €4500. Not this one though, this one is the flagship model with wireless Fox Neo components and the new Podium fork, costing around €11,000. At a show with DJI-powered bikes from the likes of Commencal and Unno, you’re going to want to show something really impressive to stand out. Unfortunately this Kross E Trail DJI bike feels really underwhelming compared to the competition. Polygon had this new trail version of the Collosus on display. The full carbon Collosus T9 promises to be an ‘aggressive trail machine’ and uses their tried and tested IFS suspension platform tuned to offer better small bump sensitivity. The Indonesian brand also had a new XC bike to show the crowds. The Syncline DR is aimed at riders who want to go fast uphill under their own steam and is decked out with RockShox Flight Attendant suspension and a power meter as standard. Please KTM make a downcountry/trail version of this! It looks amazing! One of the most interesting products at the show, and one that I am itching to get my hands on is this EXA Form F36 fork from Kindshock. I spotted this at China Cycle but KS confirmed that this would also be available aftermarket! It will feature an open bath design, with rebound and compression adjustment and uses an air spring. The model on show had 170mm travel and the action (just pushing by hand) felt very smooth with zero breakaway stiction. The most impressive part though is the price, at roughly €400 retail. Sign me up! Kindshock also had their new Rage Circuit wireless dropper on display. The current version has a max drop of 180mm but a 210mm version is in the works too. What’s neat about this is that there is an emergency button on top of the post, so if the battery in the shifter does die mid-ride you can still drop and raise your post. Again impressive pricing, as this will retail at just €399. Maxon were showing off their new motor system and a couple of bikes that are already ready to go on sale. The Maxon Air S weighs just 2kg and produces 90Nm torque and 650W peak power. Not quite as much as other motors, but less power means less battery drain, meaning smaller batteries and a lower weight. Maxon had a couple of bikes on show with their new motor system including this rather nice 145mm travel trail bike from Instictiv. They are also working with smaller brands to allow them to enter the E-MTB market without the risk of high MOQ’s (Minimum Order Quantity) that other manufacturers demand. 2025 might be the year of 32-inch wheels but while Maxxis might be looking at ways to save a few seconds here and their for XC racers, DirtySixer offers 32-inch wheels for larger riders, who need much bigger frames, wheels and... ...pedals! If 32-inch is too small then what about this 36-inch full suspension bike! Even Gary Fisher is shocked to see it! And the final find of the show was this near production ready version of the Velduro Rogue. We first saw this as a 3D-printed sample at the China Cycle Show, but this is a ready to ride and test bike. Velduro is hoping to open pre-orders for their Rogue later in the year. Words and photos by Andi Sykes Surely the as-yet-unnamed Prime bike should be called “Optimus”? Unless I'm missing something the Rotwild is not really a high pivot bike... As for the Steppenwolf, stuff of nightmares incarnated for @seanfisseli ? Lol! I hope I’m in on the joke but I’ll take it! In reply to Unless I'm missing something… by Primoz The Polygon Collosus T uses a VPP linkage (which Polygon calls "IFS Compact") Dear lord!The seat tube angle on that pink Dirtysixer!!! 🤮 woah does this mean Instinctiv is changing their frames to a more palatable shape (read: no egregiously bent top-tube) I am more shocked that it looks nothing like an ebike. In reply to woah does this mean… by LookinForIt Hello Vital MTB Visitor, We’re conducting a survey and would appreciate your input.

Title: Banks and Stablecoins: a first step towards bridging traditional finance and the crypto world (Carlo R.W. De Meijer)
URL: https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/28798/banks-and-stablecoins-a-first-step-towards-bridging-traditional-finance-and-the-crypto-world
Time Published: 2025-06-30T07:52:11Z
Full Content:
Stablecoins are attracting considerable attention by traditional financial institutions. Regulatory shifts are paving the way for banks to engage with stablecoins. These are rapidly evolving from a niche vertical in the cryptocurrency ecosystem into a foundational element of the global financial system. Stablecoins are increasingly becoming a preferred choice in modern finance, building a bridge between the traditional financial world and the crypto sector. Their evolution is shaping the future of global finance. In this blog we describe what stablecoins are, explore the current state of the stablecoin landscape, focus on key regulatory developments, the adoption by traditional financial institution, the various real-world use cases, the potential and challenges and the various solutions to these challenges. What are stablecoins? Stablecoins are blockchain-based digital tokens designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged one-to-one to traditional fiat currencies, predominantly the U.S. dollar and the euro, or high-quality liquid assets like commodities such as gold, silver or oil. Stablecoins are designed primarily to function as a stable medium of exchange. While their mechanisms may vary, they all aim to combine the trust and stability of fiat currencies (most commonly the US Dollar) associated with traditional banking infrastructure with the efficiency of blockchain-based transfers, thereby avoiding the volatility inherent in traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. This makes stablecoins suitable for commercial transactions, international remittances, and storing value digitally. How stablecoins work? The vast majority of stablecoins are fiat-backed. This means that for every digital token issued, an equivalent amount of fiat currency (or highly liquid, low-risk assets like cash equivalents and short-term government bonds) is held in reserves by the issuer. This 1:1 backing is crucial for maintaining their peg to the underlying fiat currency. Regular attestations and audits are essential to ensure the transparency and integrity of these reserves, building trust among users. These tokens will be listed on various crypto exchanges. Present state: stablecoin market capitalization The current market capitalization of stablecoins was worth around $255 billion early June 2025 according to CoinMarketCap. This record high is driven by a wave of adoption from major global banks. With this market capitalization size and a growing presence in cross-border payments, corporate treasury operations, and emerging market finance, stablecoins are fast becoming a relevant tool in global finance. The market itself has been projected to grow to $2 trillion in the next three years. The growth in stablecoin use is clear when looking at the actual transaction volumes. Over the past year 2024, transaction volumes involving stablecoins rose significantly from $521 billion to $710 billion monthly. A significant milestone occurred in 2024 when the total amount of money transferred using stablecoins reached $27.6 trillion—surpassing the combined total transaction volumes processed by Visa and Mastercard that same year. This trend underscores their growing importance in global commerce and remittances. This however is still a small share of the global M2 money supply, approximately 1%. Dominant stablecoins: USDT and USDC The stablecoin market is dominated by USD-backed variants. The two largest stablecoins out there right now are Tether (USDT: $155 billion) and the USD Coin from Circle (USDC: $62 billion). Together they account over 90% of total stablecoin market capitalization. They have gained traction in both crypto and traditional finance circles due to their ability to combine the stability of fiat currencies with the benefits of blockchain technology. This is however not much in the $36 trillion US Treasury market, but the growth has certainly focused US Treasury’s attention. Regulatory clarity: remove fragmentation The regulatory environment for stablecoins in 2025 has evolved dramatically from the fragmented approach of the early 2020s. The dramatic shift towards stablecoins by large institutions follows recent moves by regulatory bodies in the European Union (EU) and the United States (US) to create clear frameworks for stablecoins that define capital requirements, reserve management, and operational standards. These regulations may foster innovation while protecting consumers and maintaining financial stability. These moves may contribute to the further development of consistent and reliable regulations worldwide for blockchain and crypto-related technologies. EU regulation: MICA The European Union (EU) is at the forefront of stablecoin regulation, having introduced Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation for cryptocurrencies including stablecoins. This regulatory framework is designed to protect investors, promote fair and efficient markets, and foster innovation in the crypto space. The MiCA regulation that came into effect in mid-2024, sets clear rules for stablecoins, significantly reducing regulatory uncertainty. Issuers operating in the EU should adhere to specific financial standards. They must hold full reserves, meet transparency requirements, and be authorized by financial regulators. MiCA does not cover central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), but it allows regulated financial institutions (e.g. banks) to issue or support stablecoins, including acting as custodians or liquidity providers. Banks in the EU now have a legal framework to engage with stablecoins in a compliant way. US regulation: GENIUS Act and the STABLE Act US Congress has recently passed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins issuance by banks, aiming to bring stablecoin in the US financial system and creating standards for stablecoin oversight. This should be seen as a step towards creating a more stable and secure environment for their use. They focus on reserve requirements, licensing models and systemic risk considerations. This Act would require stablecoin issuers to hold one-to-one reserves, publish regular audits, and follow clear rules to protect users. Reserves backing stablecoins must be segregated from other corporate assets to reduce risk exposure. Monthly verification of reserves will become standard practice, giving users confidence in the stability of these digital assets. The GENIUS Act allows stablecoin issuers to operate under either federal or qualified state supervision, depending on their size and structure. Together with the STABLE Act that sets rules for the overall crypto market, they are are expected to provide the legal certainty needed for more banks and businesses to participate in the stablecoin market. Banking adoption of stablecoins: gather momentum A notable trend is the increasing involvement of major banks and fintech companies in the stablecoin market. This shift follows years of cautious observation and regulatory scepticism. But improved regular clarity has triggered a growing number of banks now experimenting with stablecoins, recognizing their value for improving operational efficiency, driven by a combination of fiat-like price stability with the speed, efficiency, and programmability of blockchain technology. Bank stablecoin initiatives: some examples This year a growing number of traditional financial institutions and fintechs in both the US, EU and Asia are joining existing financial services giants like Standard Chartered, PayPal, Revolut, and Stripe in adopting stablecoins. These companies are increasingly seeing their potential and have started different stablecoin initiatives, seeking to capitalize on the rapidly growing use of these coins. To give some insight here follows a number of examples of banks entering or planning to enter the stablecoin market, US banks Triggered by the pro-crypto Trump administration and the passing of the Genius Act, a growing number of US banks and fintechs are entering or planning to enter the stablecoin market. Including names like JPMorgan, US Bancorp, Bank of America, BNY Mellon and Paypal. Stripe, a leading fintech company, recently acquisitioned Bridge, a stablecoin orchestration platform. This initiative positions Stripe to enhance its payment processing capabilities, particularly in cross-border transactions. Similar moves are expected from competitors like Goldman Sachs and HSBC EU Banks Also banks in the EU have started to enter the stablecoin market including names like Societe Generale, Deutsche Bank and Banco Santander. The French Bank Societe Generale announced its plans to issue a publicly tradable stablecoin pegged to the US dollar named USD CoinVertible (USDCV) via its digital asset unit, SG-FORGE. This follows the launch of its euro-based stablecoin EUR CoinVertible in 2023. Both stablecoins are classified as electronic money tokens and will be arranged according to MiCA, EU’s crypto regulation. Deutsche Bank is also exploring the use of stablecoins and tokenized deposits, evaluating stablecoin options. Bloomberg reports that Deutsche Bank is actively researching how these technologies could be used within its services. Other banks, such as Banco Santander and Credit Lyonnais are also exploring stablecoins. Banco Santander has early-stage plans to launch its own euro- or dollar-denominated stablecoin or offering access to an existing one. Santander's Openbank unit has applied for MiCA licenses in Europe. Asian Banks Asia is leading the world in real-world stablecoin adoption, aimed to make stablecoins a foundational layer of Asia’s evolving payments infrastructure. Stablecoins are now a strategic lever for financial institutions in countries like Singapore (Standard Chartered’s Hong Kong branch), South Korea and Hong Kong (Ant Group), institutions are moving quickly—not just to explore stablecoins, but to scale them. But also in countries like Japan where the three largest banks (MUFG, SMBC, and Mizuho) joined a pilot platform called “Project Pax” to use stablecoins for cross-border payments. In Australia ANZ Bank launched an AUD-pegged stablecoin and executed the first public blockchain transaction by an Australian bank, now expanding use cases including real-time pension payments. These examples illustrate that stablecoins are gradually becoming part of mainstream financial infrastructure, not just for crypto-native firms, but for some of the world’s largest banks Stablecoin use cases While the bulk of stablecoin use is currently still within the crypto capital markets and not for everyday payments, this is fundamentally changing. Growing regulatory clarity is expected to unlock broader use cases. These may include cross-border payments and foreign exchange transactions, crypto trading in DeFi, on-chain settlement as well as cash, liquidity and collateral management. Stablecoins are increasingly seen as practical tools to broad institutional use for everyday financial transactions. Cross border payments Financial institutions are considering using stablecoins to improve its payment systems. Cross-border transactions through traditional banking systems can be slow and expensive due to high fees and currency conversion costs. Stablecoins may fundamentally transform how money moves across borders, addressing long-standing pain points in traditional payment systems, delivering reduced costs, speeding up settlements, and increasing financial inclusion. Stablecoins offer the potential to make international transfers faster and more cost-effective compared to some traditional correspondent banking methods. When supported by appropriate infrastructure (such as wallets and custody providers), these funds can be received and accessed by the counterparty almost immediately. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Another major use case where stablecoins are already thriving is decentralized finance (DeFi). They serve as the foundational currency for DeFi applications, enabling lending, borrowing, swapping, yield farming, and more - all without centralized intermediaries. Their programmable nature allows for automated transactions that traditional banking systems cannot match in efficiency or cost. Stablecoins are becoming the essential bridge connecting traditional finance with cryptocurrency ecosystems through DeFi protocols. Banks can use them to automate financial processes like collateralized lending, borrowing, derivatives trading, and even tokenization. This programmability allows banks to participate in blockchain-based financial markets while streamlining operations like asset management and market making. “Programmable Treasury” A third use case of stablecoins is as a means of payment. Governments generally want citizens to transact in their local currencies, and stablecoins challenge that sovereignty. Stablecoins are increasingly being integrated into payment platforms, enhancing the efficiency of transactions. Stablecoins are making it possible for businesses to automate payments based on real-world conditions. This is known as “programmable treasury”. More Accessible Loan Products Stablecoins could also unlock new lending and borrowing mechanisms within traditional banking by leveraging the transparency and programmability of blockchain technology. This could create more accessible loan products, collateralized by stablecoins themselves, opening up new markets and customer segments currently underserved by traditional lending practices. Attract capital and increase available liquidity Financial institutions could also offer reserve management services for assets backing stablecoins. This involves managing significant deposits and ensuring issuers meet regulatory obligations for transparency and liquidity. By welcoming stablecoin issuers as depositors, offering competitive and secure deposit solutions, providing them with secure, low-risk returns, banks can unlock new liquidity pools and expand their capital base and increase the amount of available liquidity, expanding their base of long-term, dependable clients. Onderkant formulier What may stablecoins bring for traditional banks? Financial industry executives cited slow transaction speeds and high fees in traditional banking systems as driving factors for stablecoin adoption. Stablecoins offer unique advantages by combining the stability of assets like fiat currencies with the benefits of blockchain technology. Using stablecoins may bring a number of important advantages including price stability, speed and efficiency, lower costs, global accessibility and programmability, making them attractive to international businesses and supply chains. Unlike cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH, their value remains relatively steady because they are tied to the value of more stable assets. This makes stablecoins a safer choice for risk-averse traders and investors who want to explore crypto markets without exposing themselves to drastic price fluctuations. Next to that stablecoins enable near-instant settlement of cross-border transactions. By eliminating intermediaries like correspondent banking, they enable domestic and cross-border payments to settle in a fraction of the time and at a fraction of the cost of traditional systems, while offering 24/7 services. Transaction costs may also dramatically decrease. By lowering the transaction costs often associated with traditional banking intermediaries, stablecoins also make financial services more affordable and accessible to a wider audience. Challenges Despite the enthusiasm and their advantages for traditional financial institutions, stablecoins face a number of challenges related to regulatory compliance, interoperability issues and liquidity risks.. Regulatory fragmentation: unclarity and risks Notwithstanding regulation in the EU and upcoming regulations in the US, stablecoins currently still operate under a patchwork of regulations worldwide, leading to unclarity around compliance, especially concerning reserve requirements and licensing. Notably, recent data from Chainalysis reveals that stablecoins are increasingly favoured in illicit activities such as money laundering and sanctions evasion. This underscores the global implications of stablecoin integration and the need for coordinated regulatory approaches. Lack of interoperability Financial institutions also face operational and credit risks inherent in digital currency management. The real challenge will be in the interoperability between stablecoins and existing financial systems. The existence of stablecoins across multiple blockchain networks (e.g., Ethereum, Solana, Polygon) introduces challenges in transaction settlements, requiring interoperability solutions. For businesses to fully adopt stablecoin payments, suppliers must be equipped to receive them, necessitating updates to wallets, regulatory clarity, and accounting systems Other risks And here is the liquidity risk. Stablecoins' influence extends beyond yields. The BIS notes that $40 billion in 2024 Treasury purchases by stablecoins outpaced many foreign investors, illustrating their role as de facto market participants. However, their reserve compositions often lack transparency, leaving investors vulnerable to sudden de-pegging events. Managing these risks requires robust compliance frameworks, security measures, and strict adherence to regulatory requirements, complicating their widespread adoption by traditionally cautious banks. Innitiatives by banks Consortium-backed stablecoin A group of big US banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup and PNC, met a few weeks ago in a working group to discuss the prospect of offering stablecoins in a collaborative effort. This initiative to develop a consortium-backed stablecoin aims to streamline routine financial transactions, improve transaction speeds whilst managing competition from encroaching crypto firms and counter the growing influence of crypto-native firms and fintech competitors. The potential introduction of a consortium-backed stablecoin by major banks could significantly impact the competitive landscape for community banks and credit unions. Offering familiar, secure interfaces For corporates, accessing stablecoins still involves a lot of manual steps and unfamiliar tools like wallets. Banks can fill this gap by offering familiar, secure interfaces that integrate stablecoin functionality into their existing online banking and treasury services. This include amongst others: helping clients move between fiat currency and stablecoins (and vice versa), or between different stablecoins, holding stablecoins securely on behalf of their clients, streamlining KYC/AML, source-of-funds checks, and transaction screening for blockchain-based payments and guiding clients on how and when to use stablecoins for payments, treasury management or regional risk hedging. Support from blockchain infrastructure providers Companies like Circle at the forefront of transformation Companies like Circle, the global issuer of USDC are at the forefront of this transformation, offering banks cross-chain clearing and other innovative solutions that could reshape the financial landscape. Increased involvement from the traditional financial industry is further supported by the advent of blockchain infrastructure providers like Zero Hash and Fireblocks, which are offering technology geared towards traditional financial institutions looking to integrate stablecoin capabilities. Stripe, which acquired stablecoin orchestration platform Bridge in February 2025, has added payment capabilities for the company’s USDB stablecoin, which generates yield through backing by BlackRock money market funds. Earlier this month, Stripe announced it is rolling out Stablecoin accounts in 101 countries. Matera and Circle join forces: building bridges in payments In a move to accelerate the adoption of stablecoins as a mainstream payment method, Matera, a leading technology provider for the financial system, announced a commercial partnership with Circle, through its regulated dollar-backed stablecoin USDC. This alliance marks the integration between a real-time banking infrastructure and a fully-reserved, transparent stablecoin, at the forefront of interoperability between local currency balances and digital dollars. This partnership unlocks their use in everyday near-instant payments - secure, fast, and accessible - directly from banking and fintech platforms powered by Matera’s real-time ledger, Digital Twin. The collaboration between Matera and Circle advances the concept of a “stablecoin-ready banking platform” building bridges between traditional and digital money. Criticism: BIS and Lagarde Notwithstanding the growing embrace of stablecoins by traditional financial institutions criticism has come recently from the BIS and ECB president Lagarde. BIS report A new report from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has cast doubt on the long-term role of stablecoins in the global financial system. The authors acknowledged that stablecoins have some benefits, including programmability, pseudonymity, and ease of use. Their structure also offers faster and cheaper transactions, particularly for cross-border payments. But the BIS concluded that these advantages are outweighed by risks, especially when compared to money issued by central banks and regulated financial institutions, arguing that they fall short of three essential criteria for functioning as true money: singleness, elasticity, and integrity. These are the core traits the BIS says are necessary for any instrument that hopes to support a modern monetary system. ECB president Lagarde In a recent statement ECB president Lagarde told stablecoins are privately issued and pose in particular risks to monetary policy and financial stability. Stablecoins must therefore “be governed by sound rules, especially when operating internationally”. According to Lagarde the underlying problem is precisely the lack of uniform rules. This fragmented approach prevents a global level playing field and can open the door to new risks and systemic vulnerabilities. “We must therefore remain alert to developments in other jurisdictions and support globally aligned regulations for stablecoins.” Lagarde. She therefore plaids for a Dital Euro. Forward looking: Market future and Expectations As we move through 2025, the stablecoin landscape continues to evolve rapidly. Upcoming regulation is expected in other regions worldwide including the UK, Asia (Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea) Australia and Japan. As stablecoins continue gaining traction globally, the financial industry anticipates further adoption, spurred by increasing regulatory clarity and growing consumer trust. In 2025, stablecoins are increasingly being integrated into the financial services infrastructure, a first step bridging the gap between traditional finance and the cryptocurrency world thereby enhancing business banking services. Banks that respond early can shape how this technology fits within their client offerings. As banks and fintech companies intensify their involvement, the stablecoin market stands on the threshold of significant transformation. The momentum behind stablecoins suggests they will play a significant role in reshaping the future of global financial system. The next step will be the worldwide introduction of Digital Euro’s and Digital dollars.

Photo: RNZ By Louise Ternouth of RNZ Whether it is a block of butter or cheese, a kilogram of mince, a dozen eggs or a cooked chook, food prices have gone up rapidly. The latest Stats NZ figures show in the past 12 months food prices have gone up 4.4 percent - the highest increase since December 2023. Over the last three years Checkpoint has been tracking a weekly shop from the same suburb at a Woolworths and Pak'nSave supermarket to see just how much things have gone up at the checkout. Some of the results are more eye-watering than mouthwatering. For over three years, Checkpoint has been tracking the cost of 36 items likely to be in a household's trolley. In May 2022, our first shop at Woolworths Greenlane cost us $238 dollars and $217 at Pak'nSave Royal Oak. Today, those same items at Woolworths have shot up to $305 dollars - an extra $67 dollars at the checkout. Pak'nSave our shop, now set us back $270, an extra $53 dollars. Compared to our 2022 shop, seasonal vegetables like carrots and cabbage were cheaper. Other items that had come down slightly or stayed the same were Watties baked beans, plain flour, Mightyfresh wheatmeal toast bread and diced tomatoes. File photo But they were mostly exceptions, most of the items on the shopping list cost more. Some shoppers told Checkpoint they have noticed an increase on some items in particular. "Olive oil is really expensive and eggs," said one shopper. "Dairy items I've noticed but even just general fresh fruit and vege." Others said meat was on the list. Unsurprisingly, dairy had one of the biggest jumps. At both supermarkets you still could not get a 1kg block of cheese for $10 or less. Though 1kg is now $1 dollar cheaper at Woolworths for $12.49. At Pak'nSave a 1kg block stayed much the same at $11.89. Two litres of standard blue top milk were sitting at just under $5 at both supermarkets. In 2022, a 500g block of Woolworths-branded butter cost $5.80, now a whopping $8.50. At Pak'nSave it was a similar story, in 2022 it was $5.70 for a Pams 500g block, now $8.30. One shopper said their family uses a lot of butter and they were feeling the pinch, "It's been absolutely ridiculous it's almost $10." Others said they bought butter in bulk from Costco to save money "to buy cheaper New Zealand butter in bulk and freeze it rather than buying at the supermarkets." A 50 box of Twining's Earl Grey tea more than doubled in price at Pak'nSave to $7.89. As for a dozen barn eggs, those more than doubled at Pak'nSave to $9.59 and $9.50 at Woolworths. The humble beef mince now not so humble at 1kg used to cost $11.99 at Pak'nSave, now $18.99. At Countdown, it was up from $14.90 in 2022 to $23.80 now. For some, it is now a luxury among other items they are going without. "Probably meat products and dairy," said one shopper. Others were also leaving those products on the shelves and opting for a butter "blend" and no brand versions. One man said snacks were off the shopping list. "Snack bars and extra things you'd put into kids lunches." One woman said she had left her broccoli and cauliflower out of the shop. Washing and toiletry products also came out far more expensive. Four kilograms of Persil sensitive washing powder was $22 at both supermarkets in 2022, now an extra $13 at Woolworths and $6.50 more at Pak'nSave. Huggies size 3 nappies were an extra $10 at Pak'nSave and a litre of Palmolive body wash was an extra $5 at Woolworths. For those advising to stock up on staples or frozen to cut costs, rice, noodles, sugar and frozen vegetables - all more expensive. SUBSCRIBER SUBSCRIBER SUBSCRIBER SUBSCRIBER SUBSCRIBER

UPDATED 13:32 EDT / JUNE 29 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by David Vellante and David Floyer Intel Corp.’s new chief executive has promised to clean up the balance sheet, slim down the company, return to a culture of engineering, sharpen its customer focus, shore up its products, become a world-class independent foundry and lead Intel for as long as it takes to achieve success – however that is defined. As our audience knows, unlike most other analysts, we have aggressively emphasized the icebergs ahead for Intel since 2013, culminating in our prediction that Intel would go bankrupt trying to execute on its previous strategy. Though we would have preferred a different approach to Intel’s foundry – that is, a joint venture with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. – CEO Lip-Bu Tan (pictured) at least has what we consider to be a viable go-forward plan. The steady-state outcome of this new direction, however, is far from certain. Our current thinking is that in addition to LBT’s cost-cutting, cultural do-over and other structural changes, Intel must execute on the following four strategies: In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest thinking about where Intel is now headed. We’ll review some striking data on Intel’s ascendency, how its fall from grace eerily echoes that of IBM Corp. 35 years ago, the daunting task of competing in foundry, its product outlook going forward, how we would approach its future, and a map of how the data center landscape has changed and what it will look like in the coming decades. Few technology narratives rival the dominance – and the subsequent reversal of fortune – of the x86 architecture. One of those narratives – IBM’s fall from dominance – has similar dimensions and is one we’ll draw upon today as a guidepost to the future. The story of Intel’s rise through the 1980s into the early 2000s is one of relentless execution, volume leverage, and ecosystem advantage. As shown below in Exhibit 1, x86 revenues grew from modest beginnings in the mid-’80s to become the heart of both client and data center computing. Our research indicates that this expansion was driven by several foundational advantages: From 1995 to 2000, x86 revenues grew at an impressive compound annual growth rate of 32% overall and 41% in the data center sector. Intel’s momentum carried through the 2000s, but as the chart makes clear, the story changed as time progressed. Though COVID briefly reinvigorated x86 revenues due to a surge in demand for PCs, with the shift to parallel processing, it has became clear to everyone finally that the architecture is facing a secular decline. Specifically: In our view, the COVID spike masked structural weaknesses in the x86 market. As alternative architectures – especially Arm-based designs — gained traction in cloud, mobile and now even AI, the moat that once protected Intel has deteriorated. Nonetheless, it’s important to acknowledge the sheer scale and historical success of this architecture. As David Floyer aptly put it, this was a “magnificent journey” driven by Intel’s mastery of both PC and server economics. We believe the x86 story is now well beyond its turning point. The architecture that once swept aside its predecessors is facing its own moment of reckoning – a pattern we’ll explore further as we dive into Intel’s current strategy and long-term bets. To understand Intel’s current situation, it’s essential to appreciate the historical momentum that carried the company for decades. The 15-year period from 1985 to 2000 represents the golden age of x86 – and by extension, the Wintel era. During this time, Intel didn’t just ride the PC wave – it helped define it, in concert with Microsoft. As PC chip revenues exploded, the tight integration between Intel and Microsoft created an unstoppable force as articulated above in Exhibit 2. We believe the secret to the dominance of x86 lies in the flywheel effect of volume, value and velocity. Intel supplied the volume – economies of scale and manufacturing capacity that no competitor could match. Microsoft delivered the value, with Windows becoming the de facto standard in both consumer and enterprise environments. Together, they removed friction and accelerated velocity across the industry. This dynamic had a cascading effect: In our opinion, this period laid the foundation for Intel’s dominance – but also embedded structural dependencies that would later become liabilities. The same tight coupling with Windows, the same x86-centric worldview, and the same centralized design ethos that once propelled Intel forward would later hinder its ability to adapt to changing market forces. While x86 volumes and margins drove Intel’s ascendancy in PCs and data centers, a quieter disruption was unfolding in parallel. It’s now well-understood that what began as consumer novelties – devices such as Apple’s iPod – would evolve into a tectonic platform shift that Intel failed to capitalize on. Arm’s architecture, with its low power consumption and efficient instruction sets, was tailor-made for the mobile era. Apple recognized this early on. When Intel passed on competing for the design win, Apple selected Arm with its superior battery life and thermals as key differentiators. The iPhone’s success would soon validate that choice and eventually bleed into PCs and the enterprise. The broader ecosystem followed suit as described in Exhibit 3 above: Our research suggests that Intel’s pass on Apple smartphones wasn’t just a product decision – it was a strategic failure rooted in institutional inertia. Moreover, our sources at the time suggested that Apple gave Intel some number of months to develop a plan to manufacture iPhone chips, at least giving it a possible angle to participate in the new volume play. Apple rejected the bid, reportedly because of Intel’s lack of customization and service capabilities in its foundry. This wasn’t the first opportunity Intel missed, but it was arguably the most consequential. Former CEO Paul Otellini would later admit it was a mistake to pass on the original iPhone chip design, a decision that left long-lasting damage. In our opinion, this moment marked a generational turning point. We believe the core issue was that Intel misunderstood the strategic importance of volume, despite that very same volume advantage that allowed it to crush RISC-based systems in earlier decades. Arm’s gains were initially dismissed because they didn’t show up in revenue or profit – but volume conferred learning cycles, developer traction and economies of scale. These advantages mirrored Intel’s own rise decades earlier, yet the company failed to recognize the parallel. As early as 2013, David Floyer warned that mobile volumes would overwhelm x86’s dominance, just as x86 once toppled minicomputers and mainframes. That prediction – once considered premature – now appears prescient. Even by that time, Arm-based silicon had already surpassed Intel in unit volumes as shown in Exhibit 4 above. Despite this, Intel took no decisive action. The company that once prided itself on paranoia and performance leadership had, in effect, lost its sense of urgency. As the mobile revolution accelerated outside the data center spotlight, few in the enterprise took it seriously. Many analysts became sanguine and sometimes fixated on Intel’s continued strength. X86 had long since vanquished RISC Unix systems in the server market, and with the rise of cloud computing, Intel’s market position only seemed to harden. From the dot-com era through the 2010s, Intel rode a powerful wave – that to some looked, if not unshakable, still promising. Below in Exhibit 5 we recount this history. That illusion would persist until COVID exposed structural flaws. From 2000 to 2020, Intel executed a bottom-up invasion of the data center: This momentum carried into the 2010s, but signs of trouble began to appear. Major cloud providers, particularly Amazon Web Services Inc., started looking for ways to reduce dependence on Intel. Initial trials with AMD failed to displace x86, but Amazon eventually turned to internal development through Annapurna Labs. The birth of the Graviton processor marked a strategic pivot – away from x86 and toward Arm. Still, none of this was widely seen as a threat by many analysts. Then came COVID. The pandemic triggered a surge in PC demand as remote work took hold. Volume spiked. OEMs such as Dell Technologies Inc. experienced a jump in PC revenue. And many, including Intel leadership, misread the signal. Some believed this uptick represented a sustainable resurgence in x86 demand. But it was a temporary anomaly – a final burst of relevance. In our view, this period was a mirage for Intel – masking underlying erosion in the company’s strategic position. The same volume flywheel that once catapulted x86 forward had reversed. Mobile and Arm-based architectures now held the growth leveer, while Intel clung to a temporarily inflated market. The parallels to IBM’s past are striking. Just as Big Blue failed to respond to the rise of lower-cost CMOS designs and was encumbered by mainframe inertia, Intel failed to respond to Arm’s volume and efficiency lead. In both cases, success bred complacency. And as history reminds us, only the paranoid survive. Intel loses 62 percentage points of data center processor share in four years. In the wake of COVID, the illusion of x86’s staying power evaporated – not only in PCs but in the data center as well. As highlighted in the Exhibit 6 below, Intel’s data center revenue has suffered a sharp and sustained decline, squeezed from below by AMD and from above by Nvidia. Between 2020 and 2024, Intel’s share of the data center processor market dropped from 73% to just 11%. This moment, in our view, echoes a pivotal chapter in tech history: IBM in 1990. We believe the same forces are now playing out with Intel – just inverted. Intel was once the disruptor, unseating IBM by embracing x86 and riding the volume economics of PC chips. But it has now become the incumbent being disrupted, this time by a new compute paradigm – so-called accelerated computing. The catalyst was the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, which unleashed a torrent of demand for AI workloads. The traditional scalar processing model that underpinned x86 is ill-suited for AI inference and training at scale. In contrast, Nvidia’s graphics processing unit-based architecture – what we refer to as extreme parallel processing or EPP – has emerged as the ideal foundation for generative AI. We see this as more than a cycle – it’s a complete market reset. What’s different this time is that the shift isn’t just to faster or cheaper chips. Rather it’s a move to a fundamentally different architecture, better suited to the AI era. Traditional scalar processing is giving way to parallel. General-purpose CPUs are ceding ground to domain-specific accelerators. And the dominant suppliers of the past are being replaced by platform companies optimized for the future. In short, where Intel once rode the rise of microprocessors to dethrone IBM, it now faces a similar fate – overtaken by a new architecture, a new set of economic drivers, and a new dominant monopoly in the form of Nvidia. Much of our concern around Intel centers on its ambition to become a world-class foundry outside of its own captive production. The company has publicly committed to regaining process leadership and serving external customers at scale. Yet the economic realities suggest this is a monumental challenge – one that history tells us is extremely difficult to overcome without unlimited capital and time. The data in Exhibit 7 below paints a stark contrast between Intel and TSMC: We believe the key indicator here is revenue efficiency. Intel’s foundry is producing just 21 cents of revenue per dollar of PPE investment, using TSMC as the benchmark. That suggests nearly $80 billion of Intel’s capital base is underutilized, with little prospect of near-term profitability. According to Intel’s own 10-K disclosures, the vast majority of depreciation expense is tied to the foundry business. While difficult to isolate, this underscores the scale of the challenge – an asset-heavy, capital-intensive business that is currently delivering negative economic value. Our view is that this economic disconnect was one major reason Intel has been unable – or unwilling – to pursue more aggressive structural moves, such as spinning off its foundry or forming a joint venture with TSMC. There is a reluctance to acknowledge that, on a GAAP basis, the foundry likely represents negative value. This dynamic mirrors what IBM faced when it paid GlobalFoundries $1.5 billion to take its microelectronics business. No board wants to repeat that headline. And yet, without a drastic rethink, Intel’s balance sheet may remain saddled with unproductive assets. That said, not all hope is lost. Former Intel executive Diane Bryant, who led the data center business during its peak, offered a candid yet cautiously optimistic view. She acknowledged that Intel has tried and failed five times to build a viable foundry business. But she expressed confidence in current CEO Lip-Bu Tan’s leadership, noting that while catching up to the leading edge is extremely difficult, not all chips require the most advanced nodes. There is still value in legacy and trailing-edge capacity — particularly for internet of things and industrial applications. [Listen to Diane Bryant’s commentary regarding Intel’s foundry prospects under the leadership of LBT] We agree with that view, but we also see the risk. Betting on lagging nodes may keep fabs full, but it won’t position Intel to compete with TSMC or Samsung on the most advanced innovation cycles. And though the CHIPS Act may provide some near-term funding relief, it won’t alter the structural economics without fundamental changes in execution. In our opinion: At best, the foundry journey remains a long road with uncertain returns. At worst, it’s a repeat of a painful chapter in U.S. semiconductor history. Under Lip-Bu Tan, our current base case is that Intel will dramatically cut costs, continue to write off assets, compete for N-1 and N-2 process business, and remain far behind TSMC but ahead of foundries such as Global Foundries from a node perspective. We believe it has a 40% chance of becoming a viable foundry for external customers over the long term and a 60% chance of being forced into a more radical change such as IBM faced in 2014. If China invades Taiwan, it could dramatically change these odds in ways we’ll discuss later in this research note. As the world now knows, a new sheriff has emerged in the datacenter – and its name is Nvidia. The torch once held by Intel and Microsoft as the defining force in compute has now been passed to a different kind of duo – that is, Nvidia, CUDA, its libraries, digital twin software and growing ecosystem. In many ways, this new architecture mirrors the dynamics of the Wintel era, with Nvidia combining hardware and software into a de facto standard for the accelerated computing age. We believe the post-ChatGPT surge in demand has only solidified Nvidia’s position as the dominant force shaping the datacenter future. The company is now doing what Intel once did – redefining the stack as described in Exhibit 8 below. Consider the elements of Nvidia’s new playbook: What’s more, Nvidia’s position is not simply the result of better hardware – it’s the integration of software, systems, and developer mindshare that has built a formidable moat. CUDA has become the new x86 – that is, a language and platform every AI developer must understand and use. The growth of Nvidia’s installed base means its APIs, libraries and protocols are now the default. This dominance is reinforced by high-profile validation. As noted recently, even Elon Musk has committed to using Nvidia over alternatives, citing performance and ecosystem maturity as key reasons. From our vantage point, this shift represents a wholesale restructuring of the datacenter value chain: We believe any player hoping to compete must align to this new reality. Whether it’s storage vendors such as Vast Data, or silicon hopefuls like Intel, the future will be defined by how well they integrate with the Nvidia-centric ecosystem – or differentiate meaningfully from it. Nvidia has become the new standard-bearer. And unlike previous cycles, it’s setting the rules at both the hardware and software levels. In our view, tee opportunity for others lies not in displacing Nvidia outright, but in carving out niches of differentiated value within the AI supply chain. The x86 era is not ending tomorrow – but its place in the computing hierarchy is undeniably shifting and far less relevant. As shown in Exhibit 9 below, between 2019 and 2024, x86 revenues declined at a 6% CAGR. And our current forecast indicates an even steeper slide of 13% annually through 2025 for traditional workloads. This decline is structural, not cyclical. The rise of AI has created a new datacenter marketplace, one where general-purpose CPUs are increasingly taking a back seat to AI-optimized architectures. The market for what we call AI Extreme Processing – largely GPU-accelerated, cloud-native, and highly parallel – is projected to grow at a 26% CAGR. By the end of the decade, we believe this new segment will be four times the size of the traditional x86 compute market. In this new world: In our view, the x86 market has now entered what we’d call a “managed decline” phase: The most likely scenario is that x86 continues to serve legacy workloads, particularly in enterprise, client, and embedded use cases. But the new innovation cycles – especially in AI and next-gen data platforms – will increasingly exclude x86 in favor of architectures purpose-built for extreme parallel processing. We believe Intel and AMD would do well to maximize the value of their x86 franchises while investing selectively in areas where they can add differentiated value – particularly where performance, latency or governance create competitive moats. We’ll explore this in more detail in the next section of this note. Given its declining share in data center compute, mounting foundry losses and missed opportunities in smartphones and AI, Intel now faces a critical juncture. The future success of the company will depend not on a return to past dominance, but on embracing a different role – one that prioritizes pragmatism, integration with broader ecosystems, and selective leadership in emerging markets. Our research suggests a focused, multi-pronged approach is essential as described in Exhibit 10 above: Looking ahead, the biggest opportunities may lie not in data center, but in AI PCs where no vendor has the advantage, at the edge and in robotics. We predict a major new market will emerge over the next five years – that is, Nvidia-compatible mobile, edge and robotics platforms. Though slower to ramp initially, this segment has the potential to exceed the x86 PC market in both volume and value. Here, Intel has real assets – experience with low-power design, longstanding government relationships, and embedded x86 ecosystems that can be extended or bridged into hybrid platforms. But seizing this opportunity requires alignment with the dominant AI platform – Nvidia — but in a way that differentiates from Nvidia where it is not dominant to avoid becoming a lower-priced, lower-margin “plug-compatible” designer. Internally, the company must take aggressive action: In our view, this path forward won’t recapture Intel’s former glory – but it offers a realistic, value-creating trajectory that aligns with both market trends and national interests. The key will be humility, focus and a willingness to integrate into ecosystems it no longer controls. As we close, we revisit a chart first presented in April 2021 to forecast the coming battle for enterprise tech dominance. We present it as Exhibit 11 below with some arrows to update the changes since that time. Though the chart predates ChatGPT and the generative AI explosion, many of the directional themes have come to pass. Nvidia has moved decisively up and to the right, becoming the undisputed leader in data center innovation. Arm is rising on the back of its increasing ubiquity and the flexibility the fabless model has created. AMD has effectively swapped places with Intel in x86 strength. And China’s ambitions loom larger than ever. What hasn’t changed – but should have in our view – is the U.S. approach to semiconductor sovereignty. The reality is stark in that Intel’s foundry ambitions remain years away from bearing fruit. Even under optimistic scenarios, it will take the better part of a decade for the company to establish even line of site parity with TSMC’s leading-edge capabilities. In parallel, U.S. policymakers and tech leaders have failed to back a bold, actionable plan to secure domestic chip manufacturing at scale – one that could survive geopolitical disruptions in East Asia. In particular, the U.S. is relying on the hope that TSMC will build advanced semiconductor manufacturing capabilities onshore and bring the requisite talent and IP to create foundries on par with its Taiwanese facilities. We see this as highly unlikely and essentially a capitulation to cede manufacturing leadership to Asia. Pat Gelsinger’s ambitions were not misguided, rather his path to success was virtually impossible without unlimited money and time. And it appears the U.S. government has given up on the ambition to have a U.S.-domiciled and -headquartered firm that develops the most advanced chips. We believe this is a mistake that will come back to haunt the United States. Let’s consider the consequences of a China-controlled Taiwan: This is not a farfetched scenario. Xi Jinping has publicly stated reunification with Taiwan is inevitable. Should that happen in the next three to five years – as Intel is still restructuring and ramping its foundry – America will be left without a domestically headquartered, bleeding-edge chip supplier. We believe this represents a critical failure of both industry and government. Some argue that the U.S. doesn’t need a leading-edge domestic champion – that TSMC’s Arizona investments are sufficient. We disagree. In our view, it is vital that the U.S. not only have advanced manufacturing capacity onshore, but that it is owned, operated, and innovated by a U.S.-domiciled entity. Without that, America risks falling behind in the very arms race that will define this century: AI. We close with this: There is a race underway, not just for compute, but for control of the future — a future where AI capabilities shape economies, militaries and societal outcomes. And though the U.S. still leads in many respects, it cannot afford to forfeit control of the most strategic layer of the technology stack. Intel had the chance to lead that effort. It may still have another with the help of the most powerful country in the world. But the clock is ticking. Support our open free content by sharing and engaging with our content and community.

Title: CEOs Are Quietly Telling Us the Truth: AI Is Replacing You

The fear is real. In meetings, Slack chats, and after-work drinks, one question is quietly eating away at millions of employees: Will AI take my job? In public, CEOs like to sound reassuring. They say generative AI will âenhance productivityâ or âstreamline operations.â But when you actually read what they’re telling their own employees, or what slips out in investor memos, the message is chilling: virtual workers are here, and theyâre not just assistants. Theyâre replacements. Letâs take a closer look at what some of the worldâs most powerful tech CEOs are saying. Not in hype videos, but in official internal messages, blog posts, and investor updates. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy recently published a company-wide message that sounds reasonable, until you actually read it. âAs we roll out more generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done. We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today… We expect this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.â The key phrase? âNext few years.â Thatâs corporate speak for 2026 to 2028. Not ten years away. This is soon. Jassy is not talking about automating only simple or repetitive tasks. Heâs preparing employees for a reality where AI replaces entire job categories across the board, and where hiring slows or stops altogether for roles that machines can now do. In a memo posted to LinkedIn, Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn was even more blunt. âMost functions will have specific initiatives to fundamentally change how they work… Headcount will only be given if a team cannot automate more of their work.â Translation: No more hiring unless your job is impossible for AI to do. The company is betting that most teams will soon need fewer humans. Shopify CEO Tobi LÃ¼tke shared a similar directive on X: âBefore asking for more headcount and resources, teams must demonstrate why they cannot get what they want done using AI… What would this area look like if autonomous AI agents were already part of the team?â LÃ¼tke is openly asking managers to reimagine teams as if AI agents are already integrated, and to justify why any humans are still necessary. https://t.co/6i6h3sKi3x — tobi lutke (@tobi) April 7, 2025 The message from these CEOs is clear: human employees are now the last resort. The new default is automation. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently stated that AI is already doing 50% of the work within his company, shortly before announcing another 1,000 job cuts. The CEO of Klarna, a major fintech company, was even more blunt, revealing that AI has already allowed the company to reduce its workforce by 40%. These arenât future scenarios. This is already happening. The reason for this sudden shift is the rapid evolution of AI technology. As OpenAI CEO Sam Altman explained in a recent podcast, the latest “reasoning models” have made a critical leap. In simple terms, these AI systems can now do more than just find information; they can “think” through complex, multi-step problems. Altman suggested these models can reason on par with someone holding a PhD, meaning they are now capable of performing the high level analytical tasks once reserved for highly educated humans. This capability is being actively harnessed. Three sources working at major AI labs told Gizmodo that they are training powerful models to perform real world tasks in nearly every “knowledge work” profession, including banking, financial analysis, insurance, law, and even journalism. These sources, who requested anonymity as their contracts prohibit them from speaking publicly, described how their work is used in side by side comparisons with AI models to refine the technology until it can produce professional grade output with minimal errors. Virtual employees are already doing our jobs; the current phase is simply about making them more perfect. The “next few years” Jassy spoke of may be closer to two years at most. Consider the tech industry’s recent layoff trends. In 2024, 551 tech companies laid off nearly 152,922 employees, according to data from Layoff.fyi. The pace has accelerated dramatically this year. In just the first six months of 2025, 151 tech companies have already laid off over 63,823 people. On average a tech company cut 277 workers in 2024. If that rate is maintained for the rest of the year, the average number of layoffs per tech company in 2025 would soar to 851, roughly three times the 2024 average. While there is no direct evidence linking all these layoffs to AI, the trend is happening during a period of record economic strength. The Nasdaq just closed at an all time high, and eight of the world’s ten largest companies are in the tech sector. Profitable, growing companies are shedding workers at an alarming rate, and the quiet implementation of AI is the most logical explanation. Tech CEOs wonât tell you outright that youâre being replaced. But the memos speak for themselves. AI is already here, and your company is likely building a roadmap to automate you out of your role. One internal pilot project at a time. One chatbot at a time. One hiring freeze at a time. If you want to understand whatâs next for the American workforce, donât listen to the marketing. Read the footnotes in the CEOâs blog. Because theyâre already telling you the truth.

Strategy Inc., the company once known as MicroStrategy, is now at the center of at least five class‑action lawsuits. Investors claim the firm hid big risks tied to its Bitcoin holdings and painted a rosier picture than what was real. The lawsuits hinge on about $6 billion in unrealized losses and cover an 11‑month stretch from April 2024 through April 2025. According to filings, the complaints say executives made untrue and misleading statements about Bitcoin’s ups and downs and an accounting change that forces the company to mark its crypto to market. One lead plaintiff, Abhey Parmar, insists that top officers breached their duties and oversold the company’s outlook. Based on reports, law firms are already bidding to lead these actions—the kind of scramble you see when big money is at stake. Strategy is facing at least five class action lawsuits alleging securities fraud due to $6 billion in unrealized BTC losses. The lawsuits accuse the firm of misleading investors about Bitcoin risks and profitability. Legal experts say such competing filings are common as firms… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) June 27, 2025 Investors point to trades by new CEO Phong Le and CFO Andrew Kang as proof of inside dealing. They sold about $32 million in stock just before the public disclosure of the accounting shift. Lawyers say that timing raises questions about whether executives knew how badly the mark‑to‑market losses would hit the books. If they held back material facts until after their trades, that could stiffen the case. In April, Strategy warned shareholders it wouldn’t break even in Q1 because of those same unrealized Bitcoin losses. The firm reported a loss of $16.49 per share and cautioned it might not turn a profit soon. That announcement triggered the first suit—filed on May 16 by Pomerantz LLP—and prompted follow‑ons from Gross Law Firm; Bronstein Gewirtz & Grossman; Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check; and Levi & Korsinsky. Despite the courtroom drama, the stock is up nearly 30% so far this year. Strategy now holds 592,345 BTC, with a total market value north of $63 billion. The firm bought its Bitcoin at an average of $70,702 per coin, and today they trade around $106,824—an unrealized gain of about $21.3 billion, or roughly 50%. Those figures help explain why investors have stuck with the plan. Based on the latest SEC filings, founder Michael Saylor is the biggest holder, with close to 20 million shares—worth almost $8 billion at $389.50 per share. Other big names include Vanguard at 8.55%, BlackRock at 5.80%, Capital International Investors at 5.80%, Susquehanna Securities at 4.82%, and Jane Street Group at 4.70%. Strategy’s stock trades near $393.24, valuing the company at about $107.50 billion—a 1.67x premium over its net asset value.

Title: Mid-Year Outlook: Stocks Back At Highs
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/06/29/mid-year-outlook-stocks-back-at-highs/
Time Published: 2025-06-29T11:00:00Z

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. With stocks reaching a new high just as the midpoint of the year is reached, it is an opportune time ... More to look at what the second half of the year might hold. As the tariff threat eased and some progress was made on trade agreements, stocks have recovered sharply. The boost from technology and artificial intelligence-related companies was also notably in the rebound. With stocks reaching a new high just as the midpoint of the year is reached, it is an opportune time to look at what the second half of the year might hold. Rather than the traditional outlook, this will be an examination of the risks versus rewards, considering what is currently priced in financial markets. The massive US tariffs announced on Liberation Day sent the betting odds of recession soaring to 65%, with stocks dragged lower in expectation of lower earnings. As the tariff threat eased and some progress was made on trade agreements, stocks have recovered sharply. The recent 12-day military conflict between Israel and Iran caused concerns about an economically unfriendly oil shock. Still, the US bombing of Iran’s nuclear facilities has led to a ceasefire, which has cooled fears. Stocks & Recession Odds The betting odds of recession also tell much of the story about the US 10-year Treasury note yield. Yields fell as fears of an economic downturn rose and have since recovered from the lows, as economic risk appears to have waned. There is more to the story here, as signs suggest that bond markets worldwide are less willing to fund the unfavorable fiscal situations of most countries. Yields & Recession Odds Stocks soared last week on the ceasefire in the Israel-Iran war and the agreement around a framework for US-China trade. The S&P 500 surpassed its mid-February high by 0.5% after having declined by almost 20%. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has recovered to only 4% below its mid-December level after being as much as 30% under the peak. Apart from the good news on trade and Iran, the strength in US bank stocks was notable. Last week, the annual Federal Reserve (Fed) stress tests for large banks were better than expected. Additionally, the Fed made some changes to the methodology, which are expected to result in fewer Stress Capital Buffers (SCBs) being required for banks in the future. All other things being equal, less need for capital buffers means better profitability. Market Returns The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have outperformed less economically impacted defensives since stocks bottomed, marking the peak of recession fears. The current situation is back to pricing in a benign, if not downright optimistic, economic backdrop. Economically-Sensitive Versus Defensive Stocks Based on the current 24.3 times current earnings and 23.4 times multiple of 2025 estimated earnings, also known as the forward price-to-earnings ratio, stocks do not look cheap relative to the past. However, historically, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has been correlated with return-on-equity (ROE), which measures how efficiently companies generate profits from the capital provided by their shareholders. Although the ROE is down from its recent highs, it remains above average, which argues for an above-average P/E ratio, assuming this elevated ROE is sustainable. Consensus estimates project a return on equity of 18.6% in 2025 and 19.4% in 2026, up from 17.6% in 2024. To provide perspective, the S&P 500’s ROE was 15.1% in 2019 before the pandemic. S&P 500: Price-To-Earnings & ROE The composition of the large-cap US stock market is crucial to this improved outlook for ROE since much of the boost has come from technology and artificial intelligence-related companies. Even a simple analysis of the S&P 500 shows that at least 43% of the market capitalization is related to these two areas. Weights In S&P 500 As noted earlier, the exceptional return on equity supports the rich stock valuations, and profit margins are elevated relative to historical levels. Profit margins measure the percentage of top-line sales that are converted into bottom-line profits. As a business owner, higher profit margins, all other things being equal, are more valuable. Notably, the profit margins for the technology sector are almost twice the market. In addition, according to FactSet, technology sector earnings are expected to grow at 18% in 2025, while the S&P 500’s earnings are forecast to rise by about 9.1% year-over-year. S&P 500: Profitability According to Warren Buffett, “The value of a business is the cash it’s going to produce in the future, discounted back to the present.” Free cash flow measures the cash left over after a company supports its operations and maintains or invests further in its business. Thus, free cash flow provides a good measure of the money accruing to shareholders as owners. The free cash flow yield is calculated by dividing the free cash flow by the stock price. Consistent with the price-to-earnings ratio, the cash flow yield suggests that the stock market is not currently cheap, although it has been more expensive at times in the past. This metric assumes that free cash flow remains static, so it can also be interpreted as indicating that investors have more confidence that free cash flow will continue to grow. Indeed, investors should be willing to pay more for a company in which one can have high confidence that the corporate profits accruing to owners will continue to grow. As a subset of the S&P 500, technology stocks are priced at an even lower free cash flow yield. This valuation premium reflects the optimism about the future of many of these companies and the superior fundamentals of the group as a whole. The profit margins and earnings growth rate for the technology sector have been exceptional, which helps explain the premium valuation assigned by the lower free cash flow yield. One additional wrinkle is the massive capital spending (capex) that Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) are investing in artificial intelligence infrastructure. This spending is also depressing the current free cash flow yield for the technology-related stocks on the margin. Massive capital expenditure (capex) spending is often viewed as a red flag for investors, who are typically concerned that the substantial investment will not yield a sufficient return for the companies. However, these four companies are currently being given the benefit of the doubt. S&P 500: Free Cash Flow Yield The main event of the holiday-shortened trading week will be the monthly jobs report on Thursday. Economists expect June’s gain in nonfarm payrolls to slow to 113,000 from 139,000 in May. Notably, the unemployment rate is expected to rise to 4.3% from 4.2%. US Unemployment Rate Given the upward trend in weekly continuing claims for unemployment benefits, the expected uptick in unemployment is a reasonable assumption. The upward trend indicates that the job market has been softening as it is taking longer for those losing their jobs to get a new one. With expectations for the US economy rebounding and the risk of recession decreasing, the resilience of the labor market should be closely monitored. Continuing Claims For Unemployment Benefits Markets currently expect at least two 25-basis-point (0.25%) Fed cuts in 2025, consistent with the median Fed projection. There is a slight chance of a cut in July, but the first move lower in 2025 is fully priced for September. Fed Rate Cuts Expected In the wake of the rebound from the tariff-induced bear market decline in stocks, investors should revisit their risk tolerance, as the robust stock rally over the last couple of years has likely increased their allocation to risk assets. Rebalancing stock and bond allocations toward the target risk level is wise for many investors, especially given the ongoing presence of tariff, geopolitical, and fiscal risks. The key to successful long-term stock investing is staying invested during the inevitable tough times, as rebounds from those bear markets are typically massive and unpredictable in timing, as illustrated by the first half of this year. Stocks are priced for a benign economic outcome and some support from the Federal Reserve in lowering interest rates. Improving corporate profitability, with 9% earnings growth in 2025 and 14% in 2026, is forecasted to normalize currently elevated valuations. This outcome is certainly possible, if not the most probable, but investors should be mindful that the hurdles at these valuation levels are higher. The artificial intelligence wave is a real phenomenon as adoption continues, so the optimistic scenario is not entirely out of the realm of possibility. This optimism should be tempered by the fact that the economy and earnings can always disappoint, especially if the trade war heats up again; therefore, investors should be prepared for possible turbulence.

Title: Mid-Year Outlook: Stocks Back At Highs

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. With stocks reaching a new high just as the midpoint of the year is reached, it is an opportune time ... More to look at what the second half of the year might hold. As the tariff threat eased and some progress was made on trade agreements, stocks have recovered sharply. The boost from technology and artificial intelligence-related companies was also notably in the rebound. With stocks reaching a new high just as the midpoint of the year is reached, it is an opportune time to look at what the second half of the year might hold. Rather than the traditional outlook, this will be an examination of the risks versus rewards, considering what is currently priced in financial markets. The massive US tariffs announced on Liberation Day sent the betting odds of recession soaring to 65%, with stocks dragged lower in expectation of lower earnings. As the tariff threat eased and some progress was made on trade agreements, stocks have recovered sharply. The recent 12-day military conflict between Israel and Iran caused concerns about an economically unfriendly oil shock. Still, the US bombing of Iran’s nuclear facilities has led to a ceasefire, which has cooled fears. Stocks & Recession Odds The betting odds of recession also tell much of the story about the US 10-year Treasury note yield. Yields fell as fears of an economic downturn rose and have since recovered from the lows, as economic risk appears to have waned. There is more to the story here, as signs suggest that bond markets worldwide are less willing to fund the unfavorable fiscal situations of most countries. Yields & Recession Odds Stocks soared last week on the ceasefire in the Israel-Iran war and the agreement around a framework for US-China trade. The S&P 500 surpassed its mid-February high by 0.5% after having declined by almost 20%. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has recovered to only 4% below its mid-December level after being as much as 30% under the peak. Apart from the good news on trade and Iran, the strength in US bank stocks was notable. Last week, the annual Federal Reserve (Fed) stress tests for large banks were better than expected. Additionally, the Fed made some changes to the methodology, which are expected to result in fewer Stress Capital Buffers (SCBs) being required for banks in the future. All other things being equal, less need for capital buffers means better profitability. Market Returns The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have outperformed less economically impacted defensives since stocks bottomed, marking the peak of recession fears. The current situation is back to pricing in a benign, if not downright optimistic, economic backdrop. Economically-Sensitive Versus Defensive Stocks Based on the current 24.3 times current earnings and 23.4 times multiple of 2025 estimated earnings, also known as the forward price-to-earnings ratio, stocks do not look cheap relative to the past. However, historically, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has been correlated with return-on-equity (ROE), which measures how efficiently companies generate profits from the capital provided by their shareholders. Although the ROE is down from its recent highs, it remains above average, which argues for an above-average P/E ratio, assuming this elevated ROE is sustainable. Consensus estimates project a return on equity of 18.6% in 2025 and 19.4% in 2026, up from 17.6% in 2024. To provide perspective, the S&P 500’s ROE was 15.1% in 2019 before the pandemic. S&P 500: Price-To-Earnings & ROE The composition of the large-cap US stock market is crucial to this improved outlook for ROE since much of the boost has come from technology and artificial intelligence-related companies. Even a simple analysis of the S&P 500 shows that at least 43% of the market capitalization is related to these two areas. Weights In S&P 500 As noted earlier, the exceptional return on equity supports the rich stock valuations, and profit margins are elevated relative to historical levels. Profit margins measure the percentage of top-line sales that are converted into bottom-line profits. As a business owner, higher profit margins, all other things being equal, are more valuable. Notably, the profit margins for the technology sector are almost twice the market. In addition, according to FactSet, technology sector earnings are expected to grow at 18% in 2025, while the S&P 500’s earnings are forecast to rise by about 9.1% year-over-year.

Title: Banking Giant Goldman Sachs Adds One Asset to ‘Conviction Buy’ List After Raising Price Target: Report

US banking titan Goldman Sachs is reportedly highlighting its bullishness on one under-the-radar artificial intelligence (AI) stock that’s up over 68% since March. Goldman has put Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TWSC:2330) on its “Conviction Buy” list after already being on its buy list, Insider Monkey reports. TSMC is Taiwan’s largest company, and shares of TSMC are often considered a “pure play” on semiconductors as the firm manufactures chips for some of the world’s biggest tech firms, including Apple, Nvidia and Qualcomm. Goldman says it is raising its price target on TSMC based on cooling concerns about large AI-chip order cuts and increasing demand for the company’s CoWoS (Chip on Wafer on Substrate with silicon interposer) tech designed to power ultra-high-performance computing for AI and other applications. The bank also believes that more smartphone, server and networking customers of TSMC will start adopting CoWoS tech. Goldman is projecting the company’s dollar revenue to grow by 29% this year and 17% in 2026. The firm has upped its price target for TSM to NT$1,210 from NT$1,145. At time of writing, TSMC is trading at NT$1,080. Reaching Goldman’s price target suggests a 12% rally from current prices.

Title: Meta’s Xbox-Branded Quest 3S Just Sold Out for All the Wrong Reasons

Everyone loves limited-edition stuff. There’s Sony’s 30th anniversary PS5, or Analogue’s many limited edition Pocket handhelds, orâ I don’t knowâthe Shamrock f***ing Shake. But there’s one type of person who loves limited-edition stuff more than your average consumer, and it’s a scalper. For proof of that, see Meta’s recently released Xbox-branded Quest 3S. See Meta Quest Xbox Edition at Best Buy In case you missed it, Meta’s new limited-edition Quest 3S bundle just recently sold out, which on the surface sounds like a great thing for VR and XR. You may be tempted to say, “Oh, wow! People really like XR headsets, huh?” But before you do that, it may also be worth taking a short gander at eBay, because the resale market over there paints a slightly more cynical picture. It’s fullÂ of Xbox-branded Quest 3S bundles, folksâand they ain’t just giving them away. This bundle, for reference, retails at $399, and the average price I’m seeing on eBay is about $600, though sometimes a little more or a little less. Here is the sad state of affairs on eBay as of the time of typing these words: The list goes on and on, unfortunately, which tells me one thing: the scalpers had a field day with this thing. And that’s just kind of sad. It’s not sad that someone would want to make money from reselling a limited-edition gadgetâas annoying as scalpers are, I can’t blame anyone for having a side hustle in this economy. But it is sad that Meta seemingly didn’t do much to preserve its limited-edition Quest 3S for XR nerds who unequivocally deserve first dibs. It’s also maybe a little sadâas someone who borders on said XR nerd identityâthat the race to being out of stock may not actually be driven by real demand. XR headsets, while not the most crucial gadget in the world, are pretty cool and deserve more shine than they get, in my humble opinion. It would have been nice to see them really break through with a little help from an Xbox marketing gimmick. But as always, the almighty aftermarket prevails. To be fair, I’m sure not all of the sales were scalpers trying to make a buck off the XR headset’s rarity. Some people, I presume, bought it because it’s a pretty good deal for getting into XRâyou get a sleek black headset with Xbox green details, Meta’s Elite Strap for your head, and a limited-edition Xbox controller to top it off. Based on the retail price of all of that, this bundle saves you somewhere in the ballpark of $95. Some people bought this bundle because of Xbox, too. Here’s one instance in which someone seems to have pulled the trigger on this bundle just for the controller. Honestly… respect. That’s much more pure than trying to spin the whole thing around for $200. The idea that someone buys the new Quest colorway just to nab the limited edition Xbox Controller and sell the rest is really comical.. pic.twitter.com/b5ER1xIfqe — SadlyItsDadley (@SadlyItsBradley) June 27, 2025 Listen, scalpers are an inevitable fact of life nowadays when you’re buying any gadget that’s even slightly in demand. Like it or not, that’s just the world we live inâone colored by bots and dropshipping. But I’d be lying if I said that it wouldn’t have been nice to see a little effort on Meta’s part to prevent that. It can be done! Just look at the Switch 2 launch. People have been resorting to cartoonish levels of robbery to get their hands on itâthat’s how in-demand this thing isâbut Nintendo, with a little bit of forethought, has kept the scourge of scalpers to a dull roar. I guess Meta probably doesn’t care that much either way, though. A sale is a sale, whether it ends up on eBay or on your dorky XR- and Xbox-loving head. Sadly, if you’re in the latter camp, it looks like the aftermarket is your only option right now. Thanks, Zuckerberg. Just because you look like a dropshipper doesn’t mean you have to act like one.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, June 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Elevance Health, Inc. (“Elevance” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ELV) and reminds investors of the July 11, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the risk and cost profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid programs. While Defendants acknowledged that Medicaid expenses were rising, they repeatedly assured investors that this was adequately reflected in the Company’s guidance for the year. The truth began to emerge on July 17, 2024, when the Company revealed that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid.” In response to this disclosure, the price of Elevance common stock declined by $32.21 per share, or 5.8%. However, Defendants continued to make false, reassuring statements to investors concerning the extent of the cost increase and how that was accounted for in the Company’s full year guidance. The truth was further revealed on October 17, 2024, when Elevance announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2024, revealing that the Company had missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations for the quarter by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” Elevance further revealed that it was lowering EPS guidance for 2024 from $37.20 to $33.00, or 11.3%, as it expected these Medicaid issues to continue. These disclosures caused the price of Elevance common stock to decline by another $52.61 per share, or 10.6%. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Elevance’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia.

As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company’s high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. The complaint alleges that the truth was revealed on February 27, 2025, when DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending and the suspension of DoubleVerify services by a large customer. Defendants also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was negatively impacting the Company. On this news, DoubleVerify's stock price dropped $7.83 per share, or 36%, from a closing price of $21.73 on February 27, 2025, to a closing price of $13.90 on February 28, 2025.

(NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that it missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Title: Our 8% Dividend Playbook For The $36-Trillion Debt Panic
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelfoster/2025/06/28/our-8-dividend-playbook-for-the-36-trillion-debt-panic/
Time Published: 2025-06-28T11:15:00Z
Full Content:
ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. The words "Government Debt" with hundred dollar bills in the background. “Those are some crazy numbers.” An old friend had messaged me, and that line caught my attention. As it turned out, he had 36 trillion numbers in mind: the national debt, in other words. That is a pretty striking figure, and it’s fair to ask how the country’s debt could go from a trillion dollars back in 1981 to 36 times that today. “Very irresponsible, imo,” my friend wrote. This sounds like a reasonable response, and many people think this way. But the problem here, from an investment perspective, is that most people look at the debt on its own, without considering the many other factors we’re going to delve into today. My quick take: The rising US government debt load is not a good reason to avoid stocks, or, in our case, the 8%+ yielding closed-end funds (CEFs) that hold our favorite stocks. I’m talking about funds holding strong blue chips that form the backbone of the country’s economy, like Visa (V), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and NVIDIA (NVDA). Now it is absolutely true that too much debt is unsustainable, and the US government isn’t accountable for this debt—we taxpayers are. But there’s more to the story than this. In 2017, total government debt hit $20 trillion. That, by the way, was the last time I wrote in-depth on this topic. I still feel the same way I did then: that the US government is actually financially healthier than the average American. That’s because then, as now, people tended to look at the debt in isolation (a common mistake!). But the US government has plenty of tools it can use—and trends working in its favor—that make it easier to manage its debt than many people think. Let’s start with a key number: the amount of revenue the government collects in a year through taxes and other fees. Today, as in 2017, about 18% of US GDP goes to the federal government. That’s $5.2 trillion, at the current size of the US economy. Looked at another way, if Uncle Sam were to divert all of that revenue to paying off the debt (which is impossible, obviously, but stick with me for a second), he’d do so in about six-and-a-half years. Here’s the key point, though: That six-and-a-half years is only slightly higher than the six years it would’ve taken in 2017. And let’s not forget that we had a pandemic in there, which caused a big spike in public debt. So, viewed that way, government debt has remained about as manageable as it was eight years ago, and it would likely be more manageable if COVID hadn’t come along. Now let’s go one step further and stack up debt and GDP growth: Debt/GDP Chart Both federal debt and GDP were growing at almost the same rate before the pandemic, which, as we just discussed, caused a bump in debt. And, of course, GDP took a hit then, too, with the economy in lockdown. As a result, GDP has grown about 55% in the last eight years or so, while total debt has grown about 80%. Obviously, this means America’s debt-to-income ratio is worse than it was before the pandemic. But that’s not because of a structural issue. We can point at the pandemic as the main cause here, in this case. Still, a one-time hit could be trouble in the long run, right? Sure, but look at this chart. Debt/GDP 2017 The extra government debt due to the COVID-19 crisis looks bad because the numbers are huge, but if we compare it to the bump, and continued accelerated rise, in indebtedness sparked by the 2008/2009 financial crisis, the 2020 debt increase is rather small, as you can see below. Debt Crisis Before 2008, the ratio of US public debt to GDP was around 35%, and in less than five years, it doubled to 70%, where it remained until the pandemic, after which it went above 100% before falling to 96%, where it is now. On a relative basis, the jump in 2008 was clearly worse than in 2020. Yet America survived just fine. So there’s no reason to worry, unless and until this chart changes direction. Labor Productivity Above is the real story: labor productivity. It’s risen by a third since 2007, meaning Americans now produce about $1.33 in value for every dollar they produced back in 2007. And note how that’s been a pretty stable line upwards? America keeps producing more effectively and efficiently: This is progress, growth and prosperity. And now we have AI, which is likely to give productivity another boost. This also explains why the S&P 500 has delivered 10.4% annualized returns over the last two decades, in line with the 10.3% annualized returns it’s delivered over the last century. And, yes, during that time, the federal debt grew, as did the US government’s income, thanks to higher US productivity producing higher GDP. So if you’re thinking of cutting back on your US holdings due to the debt, remember these three things: Instead, now is the time to boost our holdings in the US, and doing so through CEFs yielding 8%+ is hands-down the best way to do it. With CEFs, we get exposure to strong blue chips like the ones I mentioned earlier, often at a discount, since these funds’ market prices can—and often do—trade for less than the value of their portfolios.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / JUNE 28 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 82 – Why Apple Could be the Key to Intel’s Future – The latest Arm Neoverse announcement further cements our opinion that its architecture, business model and ecosystem execution are defining a new era of computing; and leaving Intel in its dust. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explain why and how Apple could hold a key to saving Intel’s (and America’s) semiconductor industry leadership position. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 81 – A Digital Skills Gap Signals Rebound in IT Services Spend – Recent survey data from ETR shows that enterprise tech spending is tracking with projected U.S. GDP growth at 6% to 7% this year. Many markers continue to point the way to a strong recovery including hiring trends and the loosening of frozen IT project budgets.

Episode 79 – Moore’s Law is Accelerating and AI is Ready to Explode – Moore’s Law is dead right? Think again. While the historical annual CPU performance improvement of ~40% is slowing, the combination of CPUs packaged with alternative processors is improving at a rate of more than 100% per annum. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is going to unveil some data that suggests we’re entering a new era of innovation where inexpensive processing capabilities will power an explosion of machine intelligence applications. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 78 – Arm Lays Down the Gauntlet at Intel’s Feet – Exactly one week after Pat Gelsinger unveiled plans to reinvent Intel, Arm announced version 9 of its architecture and put forth its vision for the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we think this announcement is so important and what it means for Intel and the broader technology landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 76 – Tech Spending Powers the Roaring 2020s as Cloud Remains a Staple of Growth – In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. In this Breaking analysis Dave will provide our take on the latest ETR COVID survey and share why we think the tech boom will continue well into the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings. The company beat consensus earnings on both top line and EPS last quarter. But Investors didn’t like Oracle’s tepid guidance and the stock pulled back..but is still well above its pre-Barron’s article price. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 74 – Breaking Analysis: NFTs, Crypto Madness & Enterprise Blockchain – When a piece of digital art sells for $69.3M, more than has ever been paid for works by Paul Gauguin or Salvador Dali, making its creator the third most expensive living artist in the world, one can’t help but take notice and ask: “What is going on?” The latest craze around NFTs may feel a bit “bubblicious,” but it’s yet another sign that the digital age is now fully upon us. In this Breaking Analysis Dave wants to take a look at some of the trends that may have observers and investors scratching their heads, but we think still offer insight to the future — and possibly some opportunities for young investors.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / JUNE 28 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade.

It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software.

Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well.

In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare.

Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings. The company beat consensus earnings on both top line and EPS last quarter. But Investors didn’t like Oracle’s tepid guidance and the stock pulled back..but is still well above its pre-Barron’s article price. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 74 – Breaking Analysis: NFTs, Crypto Madness & Enterprise Blockchain – When a piece of digital art sells for $69.3M, more than has ever been paid for works by Paul Gauguin or Salvador Dali, making its creator the third most expensive living artist in the world, one can’t help but take notice and ask: “What is going on?” The latest craze around NFTs may feel a bit “bubblicious,” but it’s yet another sign that the digital age is now fully upon us. In this Breaking Analysis Dave wants to take a look at some of the trends that may have observers and investors scratching their heads, but we think still offer insight to the future — and possibly some opportunities for young investors. And we’ll briefly touch on how these trends may relate to enterprise tech. Watch the full video analysis.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / JUNE 28 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR.

Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade.

Title: How AI is killing jobs in the tech industry
URL: https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/how-ai-is-killing-jobs-in-the-tech-f39
Time Published: 2025-06-28T05:47:01Z
Full Content:
“What will AI mean for jobs?” may be the single most-asked question about the technology category that dominates Silicon Valley, pop culture, and our politics. Fears that AI will put us out of work routinely top opinion polls. Bosses are citing AI as the reason they’re slashing human staff. Firms like Duolingo and Klarna have laid off workers in loudly touted shifts to AI, and DOGE used its “AI-first” strategy to justify firing federal workers. Meanwhile, tech executives are pouring fuel on the flames. Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, claims that AI products like his will soon eliminate half of entry level white collar jobs, and replace up to 20% of all jobs, period. OpenAI’s Sam Altman says that AI systems can replace entry level workers, and will soon be able to code “like an experienced software engineer.” Elsewhere, he’s been blunter, claiming "Jobs are definitely going to go away, full stop." But the question remains: What’s actually happening on the ground, right now? There’s no doubt that lots of firms are investing heavily in AI and trying to use it to improve productivity and cut labor costs. And it’s clear that in certain industries, especially creative ones, the rise of cheap AI-generated content is hitting workers hard. Yet broader economic data on AI impacts suggests a more limited disruption. Two and a half years after the rise of ChatGPT, after a torrent of promises, CEO talk, and think pieces, how is—or isn’t—AI really reshaping work? About a month ago, I put out a call in hopes of finding some answers. I had a vague idea for a project I’d call AI Killed My Job, that would seek to examine the many ways that management has used AI to impact, transform, degrade, or, yes, try to replace workers outright. It’s premised on the notion that we’ve heard lots of speculation and plenty of sales pitches for AI automation—but we have not heard nearly enough from the workers experiencing the phenomenon themselves. The title is somewhat tongue-in-cheek; we recognize that AI is not sentient, that it’s management, not AI, that fires people, but also that there are many ways that AI can “kill” a job, by sapping the pleasure one derives from work, draining it of skill and expertise, or otherwise subjecting it to degradation. So, I wrote a post here on the newsletter explaining the idea, posted a call to social media, and asked for testimonials on various news shows and podcasts. I was floored by the response. The stories came rolling in. I heard from lots of folks I expected to—artists, illustrators, copywriters, translators—and many I didn’t—senior engineers, managers of marketing departments, construction industry consultants. And just about everyone in between. I got so many responses, and so many good ones, that I resolved to structure the project as a series of pieces that center the workers’ voices and testimonies themselves, and share their experiences in their own words. Because I got so many accounts, I decided to break down the articles by field and background. Starting, today, with an industry that’s at once the source of the automating technology and feeling some of its most immediate impacts. Today, we’ll begin by looking at how AI is killing jobs in the tech industry. I heard from workers who recounted how managers used AI to justify laying them off, to speed up their work, and to make them take over the workload of recently terminated peers. I heard from workers at the biggest tech giants and the smallest startups—from workers at Google, TikTok, Adobe, Dropbox, and CrowdStrike, to those at startups with just a handful of employees. I heard stories of scheming corporate climbers using AI to consolidate power inside the organization. I heard tales of AI being openly scorned in company forums by revolting workers. And yes, I heard lots of sad stories of workers getting let go so management could make room for AI. I received a message from one worker who wrote to say they were concerned for their job—and a follow-up note just weeks later to say that they’d lost it. Of the scores of responses I received, I’ve selected 15 that represent these trends; some are short and offer a snapshot of various AI impacts or a quick look at the future of employment. Others are longer accounts with many insights into what it means to work in tech in the time of AI—and what it might mean to work, period. The humor, grace, and candor in many of these testimonials often amazed me. I cannot thank those who wrote them enough. Some of these workers took great risks to share their stories at a time when it is, in tech, a legitimate a threat to one’s job to speak up about AI. For this reason, I’ve agreed to keep these testimonies anonymous, to protect the identities of the workers who shared them. Generative AI is the most hyped, most well-capitalized technology of our generation, and its key promise, that it will automate jobs, desperately needs to be examined. This is the start of that examination. Three very quick notes before we move on. First, this newsletter, and projects like AI Killed My Job, require a lot of work to produce. If you find this valuable, please consider becoming a paid subscriber. With enough support, I can expand such projects with human editors, researchers, and even artists—like Koren Shadmi, who I was able to pay a small fee for the 100% human-generated art above, thanks to subscribers like you. Second, if your job has been impacted by AI, and you would like to share your story as part of this project, please do so at AIkilledmyjob@pm.me. I would love to hear your account and will keep your account confidential as I would any source. Third, some news: I'm partnering with the good folks at More Perfect Union to produce a video edition of AI Killed My Job. If you're interested in participating, or are willing to sit for an on camera interview to discuss how AI has impacted your livelihood, please reach out. Thanks for reading, human, and an extra thanks to all those whose support makes this work possible. Tech is just the first industry I plan on covering; I have countless more stories in fields from law to media to customer service to art to share. Stay tuned, and onwards. This post was edited by Mike Pearl. Content moderator at TikTok. I have a story. I worked for TikTok as a content moderator from August 2022 to April 2024, and though I was not replaced by AI, I couldn't help noticing that some of the trainers were. In my first year, I would be assigned training videos that featured real people either reading or acting. These trainings would be viewed internally only, not available to the public. Topics could be things like learning about biases, avoiding workplace harassment, policy refreshers, and so on. In the early months of my time there, the trainings were usually recorded slideshows with humans reading and elaborating on the topics. Sometimes they were videos that included people acting out scenarios. Over time, the human trainers were replaced with AI by way of generated voices or even people going over the materials in the videos. It was honestly scary to me. I don't know how to explain it. I remember that they had added embellishments to make them seem more human. I distinctly remember a woman with an obscure black tattoo on her bicep. The speech and movement wasn't as clean as what I see in videos now, but it was close enough to leave me with an eerie sensation. As far as content moderation goes, much of that is already done by AI across all major social media platforms. There has historically been a need for human moderators to differentiate grey areas that technology doesn't understand. (Example: someone being very aggressive in a video and using profanity, but it not being directed at an individual. AI might think the video involves bullying another user and ban the video, but a moderator can review it and see that there's no problem/no targeted individual.) It was honestly scary to me. I don't know how to explain it. I remember that they had added embellishments to make them seem more human. I think as AI models continue to learn, however, moderators will be replaced completely. That's just a theory, but I'm already seeing the number of these job postings dwindling and hearing murmurs from former coworkers on LinkedIn about widespread layoffs. Software engineer at Google. I have been a software engineer at Google for several years. With the recent introduction of generative AI-based coding assistance tools, we are already seeing a decline in open source code quality 1 (defined as "code churn" - how often a piece of code is written only to be deleted or fixed within a short time). I am also starting to see a downward trend of (a) new engineers' readiness in doing the work, (b) engineers' willingness to learn new things, and (c) engineers' effort to put in serious thoughts in their work. Specifically, I have recently observed first hand some of my colleagues at the start of their career heavily relying on AI-based coding assistance tools. Their "code writing" consists of iteratively and alternatingly hitting the Tab key (to accept AI-generated code) and watching for warning underlines 2 indicating there could be an error (which have been typically based on static analysis, but recently increasingly including AI-generated warnings). These young engineers - squandering their opportunities to learn how things actually work - would briefly glance at the AI-generated code and/or explanation messages and continue producing more code when "it looks okay." I also saw experienced engineers in senior positions when faced with an important data modeling task decided to generate the database schema with generative AI. I originally thought it was merely a joke but recently found out that they basically just used the generated schema in actual (internal) services essentially without modification, even if there are some obvious glaring issues. Now those issues have propagated to other code that needs to interact with that database and it will be more costly to fix, so chances are people will just carry on, pretending everything is working as intended. All of these will result in poorer software quality. "Anyone can write code" sounds good on paper, but when bad code is massively produced, it hurts everyone including those who did not ask for it and have been trusting the software industry. Former staff engineer at Dropbox. I was part of the 20% RIF at Dropbox at the end of October.3 The stated reason for this was to focus on Dash, their AI big-bet. The 10% RIF in 2023 was also to focus more on Dash. How did this eliminate my job? Internal reprioritization, that's how. I was moving into an area that was scheduled to focus on improving Dropbox's reliability stance in 2025 and beyond, intended to be a whole year initiative. It's tricky to go into details, but the aim was to take a holistic view of disaster preparedness beyond the long standing disaster scenarios we had been using and were already well prepared for. Projects like this are common in well established product-lines like Dropbox's file-sync offering, as they take a comprehensive overview of both audit compliance (common criteria change every year) and market expectations. This initiative was canned as part of the RIF, and the staffing allocated to it largely let go. Such a move is consistent with prioritizing Dash, a brand new product that does not have dominant market-share. Startups rarely prioritize availability to the extent Dropbox's file-sync product does because the big business problem faced by a startup is obtaining market-share, not staying available for your customers. As products (and companies) mature, stability starts gaining priority as part of customer retention engineering. Once a product becomes dominant in the sector, stability engineering often is prioritized over feature development. Dropbox file-sync has been at this point for several years. With Dash being a new product, and company messaging being that Dash is the future of Dropbox, a reliability initiative of the type I was gearing up for was not in line with being a new product scrapping for market-share. Thus, this project and the people assigned to it were let go. Blood in the Machine: What are you planning next? This job market is absolutely punishing. I had a .gov job for the .com crash, a publicly funded .edu job for the 2008 crash, and a safe place inside a Dropbox division making money hand over fist during the COVID crash (Dropbox Sign more than doubled document throughput over 2020). This is my first tech winter on the bench, and I'm getting zero traction. 37 job apps in the months I've been looking, 4 got me talking to a human (2 of which were referrals), all bounced me after either the recruiter or technical screens. Never made it to a virtual onsite. This has to do with me being at the Staff Engineer level, and getting there through non-traditional means. The impact is when I go through the traditional screens for a high level engineer I flame out, because that wasn't my job. The little feedback I've gotten from my hunt is a mix of 'over-qualified for this position' and 'failed the technical screen.' Attempting to branch out to other positions like Product Manager, or Technical Writer have failed due to lack of resume support and everyone hiring Senior titles. I may be retired now. I'm 50, but my money guy says I've already made retirement-money; any work I do now is to increase lifestyle, build contingency funds, or fund charitable initiatives. The industry is absolutely toxic right now as cost-cutting is dominating everything but the most recently funded startups. We haven't hit an actual recession in stock-prices due to aggressive cost and stock-price engineering everywhere, and cost-engineering typically tanks internal worker satisfaction. I've been on the bench for six months, money isn't a problem. Do I want to stick my head back into the cortisol amplifier? Not really. Tech worker, marketing department. I used to work at a mid-sized Silicon Valley startup that does hardware. The overall project is super demanding, and reliant on skilled, hands-on work. Our marketing team was tiny but committed. My manager, the CMO4, was one of the rare ones: deeply experienced and seasoned in the big ones, thoughtful, and someone who genuinely loved his craft. Last year, a new hire came in to lead another department. Genuinely believe she is a product of the "LinkedIn hustler / thought-leadership / bullshit titles" culture. Super performative. Recently and during a cross-functional meeting with a lot of people present, she casually referred to a ChatGPT model she was fine-tuning as our "Chief Marketing Officer"—in front of my manager. She claimed it was outperforming us. It wasn’t—it was producing garbage. But the real harm was watching someone who’d given decades to his field get humiliated, not by a machine, but by a colleague weaponizing it. Today, in the name of “AI efficiency,” a lot of people saw the exit door and my CMO got PIPd.5 The irony here is two-fold: one, it does not seem that the people who left were victims of a turn to "vibe coding" and I suspect that the "AI efficiency" was used as an excuse to make us seem innovative even during this crisis. Two, this is a company whose product desperately needs real human care. [If your job has been impacted by AI, and you would like to share your story as part of this project, please do so at AIkilledmyjob@pm.me.] Veteran tech worker at Adobe and in the public sector. AI killed my previous job, and it's killing my current one. I used to work at Adobe... Despite constantly telling my team and manager I strongly disliked GenAI and didn't want to be involved in GenAI projects, when AI hype really started picking up, my team was disbanded and I was separated from my teammates to be put on a team specifically working on GenAI. I quit, because I didn't see any way for me to organize, obstruct, or resist without being part of building something that went against my values. I often wonder whether I should have let myself get fired instead. This was before we learned that Adobe trained Firefly on Stock contributions without contributors' opt-in, and before the Terms of Service debacle, so I'm glad I wasn't there for that at least. Now I work in the public sector. It's better in most ways, but I have to spend ridiculous amounts of time explaining to colleagues and bosses why no, we can't just "use AI" to complete the task at hand. It feels like every week there's a new sales pitch from a company claiming that their AI tool will solve all our problems—companies are desperate to claw back their AI investment, and they're hoping to find easy marks in the public sector. I don't want to be a curmudgeon! I like tech and I just want to do tech stuff without constantly having to call bullshit on AI nonsense. I'd rather be doing my actual job, and organizing with my colleagues. It's exhausting to deal with credulous magical thinking from decision-makers who should know better. *My work at Adobe* When I was at Adobe, I worked in Document Cloud. So like Acrobat, not Photoshop. For most of my time there, my job was evaluating machine learning models to see if they were good enough to put in a product. The vast majority of the time, Document Cloud leadership killed machine learning projects before they ended up in a product. That was either because the quality wasn't good enough, or because of a lack of "go-to-market.” In other words, middle and upper management generally did not accept that machine learning is only appropriate for solving a small subset of problems, which need to be rigorously-scoped and well-defined. They were looking for "everything machines" (these are derogatory air quotes, not a direct quote) that would be useful for huge numbers of users. By the time AI hype really started to pick up, I had moved to a team working on internal tools. I wasn't building or evaluating machine learning models and I was outspoken about not wanting to do that. When LLM hype got really big, senior leadership started describing it as an "existential threat" (that is a direct quote as far as I remember), and re-organizing teams to get LLMs into Document Cloud as soon as possible. Adobe did not do *anything* quickly, so this was a huge change. A big red flag for me was that rather than building our own LLMs, Adobe used OpenAI's chatbots. When I asked about all of OpenAI's ethical and environmental issues, management made generic gestures towards being concerned but never actually said or did anything substantive about it. At that point I quit, because I had specifically been saying I didn't want to be involved in GenAI, and given the rushed and sloppy nature of the rollout, I didn't want my name anywhere near it. *Colleagues' reactions* Definitely I knew some colleagues who didn't like what Adobe was doing. There were a lot of people who privately agreed with me but publicly went along with the plan. Generally because they were worried about job security, but also there's a belief at Adobe that the company's approach to AI isn't perfect but it's more ethical than the competition. Despite being a huge company, teams were mostly isolated from each other, and as far as I know there wasn't a Slack channel for talking about AI concerns or anything like that. When I asked critical questions during department meetings or expressed frustration with leadership for ignoring concerns, people told me to go through the chain of command and not to be too confrontational. Looking back, I wish my goal hadn't been to persuade managers but instead to organize fellow workers. I was probably too timid in my attempts to organize. I do regret that I didn't try having more explicit 1-on-1's about this, even though it would have been risky. Obviously I was very lucky/privileged to have enough savings to even consider quitting or letting myself get fired in this shitty job market, and I often wonder if I could have done more to combine strategies and resources with other colleagues so that fighting back would be less risky for everyone. *Impact of AI on work* When the GenAI push started, a lot more of my colleagues started working nights and weekends, which was rare (and even discouraged) before then. Managers paid lip service to Adobe's continuing commitment to work-life balance, but in practice that didn't match up with the sense of urgency and the unrealistic deadlines. I'm not aware of anyone who got fired or laid off specifically because of getting replaced by AI, and it looks like teams are still hiring. Although for what it's worth, in general Adobe does not do layoffs these days, but instead they pressure people into quitting by taking work away from them, putting them on PIPs, that kind of thing. I found out that a colleague who had been struggling with a simple programming task for over a month—and refusing frequent offers for help—was struggling because they were trying to prompt an LLM for the solution and trying to understand the LLM's irrelevant and poorly-organized output. They could have finished the work in a day or two if they had just asked for help clarifying what they needed to do. I and their other teammates would gladly have provided non-judgmental support if they had asked. Our team found out that a software vendor (I can't say which one but it was one of the big companies pushing Agentic AI) was using AI to route our service request tickets. As a result, our tickets were being misclassified, which meant that they were failing to resolve high-priority service disruptions that we had reported. We wasted days on this, if not weeks. *My current job* At my current job, I'm basically a combination of programmer and database administrator. I like the work way more than what I did at Adobe. Much like the corporate world, there are a lot of middle and upper managers who want to "extract actionable insights" from data, but lack the information literacy and technical knowledge to understand what they can (or should) ask for. And the people below them are often unwilling to push back on unreasonable expectations. It's very frustrating to explain to executives that the marketing pitches they hear about AI are not reflective of reality. It makes us seem like we're afraid of change, or trying to prevent "progress" and "efficiency." So I would say the private and public sector have this in common: the higher up you go in the organization, the more enthusiastic people are about "AI,” and the less they understand about the software, and (not coincidentally) the less they understand what their department actually does. And to the extent that workers are opposed to "AI,” they're afraid of organizing, because it feels like executives are looking for reasons to cut staff. Tech worker. So this is sort of an anecdote in the opposite direction of AI taking jobs—in a recent interview process at a mature startup in the travel tech space, part of the offer negotiations were essentially me stating “yeah I don’t want to work here if you expect me to use or produce LLM-based features or products” (this is relevant as the role is staff data scientist, so ostensibly on supply side of AI tooling), and them responding with “yeah if you want to do LLM work this isn’t the place for you.” Though my network isn’t extensive, I feel like this is a growing sentiment in the small- and medium-tech space - my primary social media is on a tech-centric instance of the fediverse (hachyderm.io) and more often than not when I see the #GetFediHired hashtag, it’s accompanied by something akin to “no crypto, no AI” (also no Microsoft Teams, but I digress). Computer programmer. Our department has now brought in copilot, and we are being encouraged to use it for writing and reviewing code. Obviously we are told that we need to review the AI outputs, but it is starting to kill my enjoyment for my work; I love the creative problem solving aspect to programming, and now the majority of that work is trying to be passed onto AI, with me as the reviewer of the AI's work. This isn't why I joined this career, and it may be why I leave it if it continues to get worse. Software engineer at a large tech firm. All my life, I’ve wanted to be an artist. Any kind of artist. I still daydream of a future where I spend my time frolicking in my own creativity while my own work brings me uninterrupted prosperity. Yet this has not come to pass, and despite graduate level art degrees, the only income I can find is the result of a second-class coding job for a wildly capitalist company. It’s forty hours a week of the dullest work imaginable, but it means I have time to indulge in wishful thinking and occasionally, a new guitar. Real use cases where AI can be used to do work that regular old programming could not are so rare that when I discovered one two weeks ago, I asked for a raise in the same breath as the pitch. I am experiencing exactly what you describe. There’s been layoffs recently, and my company is investing heavily in AI, even though they’re not sure yet how best to make it do anything that our corporate overlords imagine it should do. From the c-level, they push around ideas about how we could code AI to do work, but in reality, those on the ground are only using AI to help write code that does the work, as the code always has. Real use cases where AI can be used to do work that regular old programming could not are so rare that when I discovered one two weeks ago, I asked for a raise in the same breath as the pitch. And here I am, five hundred words into this little essay, and I’ve barely touched on AI! Nor have I even touched any of the AI tools that are so proudly thrust into my face to produce this. I’ve played around with AI tools for creative writing, and while they’re good at fixing my most embarrassing grammar errors, none of them have helped me in my effort to bridge the gap between my humble talent as a creative and my aspirations for my effort. There’s a meme going on Pinterest that I believe sums up this moment: “We wanted robots to clean the dishes and do our laundry, so we could draw pictures and write stories. Instead they gave us robots to draw pictures and write stories, so we could clean dishes and do laundry.” This feels very true in the sense that human talent is getting valued not for the time it took to gain it and the ingenuity it proves, but for how well it feeds the greed of those who can afford to invest in bulk. But art in capitalism has always been this way, hasn’t it? If we don’t have a patron, we might as well eat our paint, and AI only tightens that grip that the privileged have held us in for centuries. I’ve never been so fortunate to consider the work that funds my DoorDash addiction to be my passion’s output, and perhaps that’s why I’m not afraid of what I’ll lose. But it’s that same work that has me sharing notes with fellow programmers, and many of them will say with blunt honesty that they’re worried they’ll be replaced by AI. This is a vulnerability I rarely see from the group of people who often elevated their work as valuable and practical, as opposed to my efforts to learn how to make music and poetry, which were wasteful and useless. But I am like a plant that learned how to grow on rocks and eat insects. In a meeting soon, I’m going to level with them: Don’t you understand? This work, what we do day in and day out for a soulless organization that drives profit from stealing our essence, this is the laundry! And if they think I’ll just throw that work into a machine and let it do all the work for me, they’re right. But it’s a machine that automates the work of running machines that automates the work that people used to do by hand, while constantly stealing glances at the clock, just waiting for the moment when they could be out from under the gaze of some righteous egomaniac. Maybe this is just the perspective of someone who’s seen her work, of almost any type, get devalued with such regularity that it’s hard to imagine the robots making it any more difficult than it already is. No one’s ever really cared about my Instagram posts. No one pretends that my code will change the world. Perhaps, someday, I’ll make more money while babysitting on the weekends. I spend a lot of time thinking about things that haven’t worked out for me, and for us, as a society, and I think some of our worst failures come from moments when we can’t differentiate between the ability to use machines and our abilities as machines. Last week I made a pie for my family, and I obviously didn’t get paid for it. Somewhere off in the offices of the illuminati, an account will calculate the value of the oven that baked the crust, the refrigerator that cooled the filling, the bougie pie dish that made my effort look food-blog ready. But there’s no monetary value in the work I did that literally put food on the table, and I rarely, if ever, get paid to perform the music I love, or receive more than pocket change for the short stories I publish. I keep thinking that the solution for both problems exist in some future innovation, but I can’t imagine what that invention would be, and I can’t find proof of a real connection between the two. Maybe ChatGPT knows the answer to this riddle? I can throw a penny into our new philosophy vending machine, but I might come up with a better answer myself if I think about it while I unload the dishwasher. PS I didn’t use ai to write this, also didn’t even bother to push it through an ai extruder to check the grammar. I guess I’m just feeling too lazy today to push that button! Have a nice weekend. [If your job has been impacted by AI, and you would like to share your story as part of this project, please do so at AIkilledmyjob@pm.me.] Fintech worker. Hello! I am a tech worker at a fintech. My workplace has been pushing AI really hard this year. Here's the latest thing they thought up: It 100% feels like testing the waters for just how unqualified and underpaid your workforce can be. Just as long as they can work the shovel of LLM they're good right? The children yearn for the (LLM) mines! Current CrowdStrike employee. I work for CrowdStrike, the leading cybersecurity company in the United States. As a current employee, I can't reveal specific details about myself. As you may have heard, CrowdStrike laid off 500 employees on May 7th, 2025. These were not underperformers. Many of them were relatively new hires. This action was presented as a strategic realignment with a special focus in "doubling down on our highest-impact opportunities," to quote CEO George Kurtz. In the internal email, he states further: AI investments accelerate execution and efficiency: AI has always been foundational to how we operate. AI flattens our hiring curve, and helps us innovate from idea to product faster. It streamlines go-to-market, improves customer outcomes, and drives efficiencies across both the front and back office. AI is a force multiplier throughout the business. So, AI has literally killed many jobs at CrowdStrike this week. I'm fortunate to be among the survivors, but I don't know for how long. Generative AI, particularly LLMs, is permeating every aspect of the company. It's in our internal chats. It's integrated into our note-taking tools. It's being used in triage, analysis, engineering, and customer communications. Every week, I'm pinged in an announcement that some new AI capability has been rolled out to me and that I am expected to make use of it. Customers who are paying for live human service packages from us are increasingly getting the output of an LLM instead. Quality Assurance reviewers have started criticizing reviewees for failing to run things through AI tools for things as trivial as spelling and grammar. Check out the front page and count the number of times "AI" is mentioned. It didn't used to be like this. CrowdStrike is currently achieving record financials. At the time I write this, CRWD is trading at $428.63 in striking range of the stock's 52-week high. The efforts of my colleagues and I to rebuild from the incident of July 19, 2024 have been rewarded with shareholder approval and 500 layoffs. Some of the impacted individuals were recent graduates of 4-year schooling who, in addition to student loans, have moving expenses because they physically relocated to Texas shortly before this RIF occurred. Many lower-level employees at CrowdStrike are big fans of generative AI; as techy people in a techy job, they fit the bill for that. Even so, many of them have become wary… of what increased AI adoption means for them and their colleagues. Some of the enthusiastic among them are beginning to realize that they're training the means of additional layoffs—perhaps their own. CrowdStrikers have been encouraged to handle the additional per capita workload by simply working harder and sometimes working longer for no additional compensation on either count. While our Machine Learning systems continue to perform with excellence, I have yet to be convinced that our usage of genAI has been productive in the context of the proofreading, troubleshooting, and general babysitting it requires. Some of the genAI tools we have available to us are just completely useless. Several of the LLMs have produced inaccuracies which have been uncritically communicated to our customers by CrowdStrikers who failed to exhibit due diligence. Those errors were caught by said customers, and they were embarrassing to us all. I would stop short of saying that the existence of genAI tools within the company is directly increasing the per capita workload, but an argument could be made of it indirectly accomplishing that. The net result is not a lightening of the load as has been so often promised. Morale is at an all-time low. Many survivors have already started investigating their options to leave either on their own terms or whenever the executives inevitably decide an LLM is adequate enough to approximately replace us. The company is very proud of its recognitions as an employer. As CrowdStrikers, we used to be proud of it too. Now we just feel betrayed. Software engineer, health tech startup. I work as a software engineer and we've been getting a push to adopt AI coding assistants in the last few months. I tried it, mostly to be able to critique, and found it super annoying, so I just stopped using it. But I'm starting to get worried. Our CEO just posted this in an internal AI dedicated Slack channel. The second message is particularly concerning. [It’s a screenshot of a message containing a comment from another developer. It reads:] "I am sufficiently AI-pilled to think that if you aren't using agentic coding tools, then you are the problem. They are good enough now that it's a skills issue. Almost everyone not using them will be unemployed in 2 years and won't know why (since they're the ones on Hacker News saying "these tools never work for me!" and it turns out they are using very bad prompts and are super defensive about it)." We've had some layoffs long before this AI wave and the company has not picked up the pace in terms of hiring since. I'm sure now they're thinking twice before hiring anyone though. The biggest change was in how the management is enthusiastically incentivizing us to start using AI. First they offered coding assistants for everyone to use, then the hackdays we had every semester turned into a week long hackathon specifically focused on AI projects. Now we have an engineer, if you can call him that, working on a project that will introduce more than 30k lines of AI generated code into our codebase, without a single unit test. It will be impossible to do a proper code review on this much code and it will become a maintenance nightmare and possibly a security hazard. I don't need to tell you how much management is cheering on that. Front end software engineer at a major software company. My job hasn't been killed yet, but there's definitely a possibility that it could be soon. I work for a major software company as a front end software engineer. I believe that there's been AI-related development for about a year and a half. It's a little hard to nail down exactly because I'm one of the few remaining US-based developers and the majority of our engineering department is in India. The teams are pretty siloed and the day-to-day of who's on what teams and what they're doing is pretty opaque. There's been a pretty steady increase of desire and pressure to start using AI tools for a while now. As a result, timelines have been getting increasingly shorter, likewise the patience of upper management. They've tried to create tools that would help with some of the day-to-day repeatable UI pieces that I work on, but the results were unusable from my end and I found that I can create them on my own in the same amount of time. The agents themselves had names and AI-generated profile pictures of minorities that aren't actually represented in the upper levels of the company, which I find kind of gross. Around October/November of last year, the CEO and President (who's the former head of Product) had decided to go all-in on AI development and integrate it in all aspects of our business. Not just engineering, but all departments (Sales, Customer Operations, People Operations, etc). Don't get a ton of insight from other departments other than I've heard that Customer Ops is hemorrhaging people and the People Ops sent an email touting that we could now use AI to write recognition messages to each other celebrating workplace successes (insulting and somewhat dystopian). On the engineering side, I think initially there was a push to be an AI leader in supply chain, so there were a lot of training courses, hackathons and (for India) AI-focused off-sites where they wanted to get broad adoption of AI tools and ideas for products that we can use AI in. Then in February, the CEO declared that what we have been doing is no longer a growth business and we were introducing an AI control tower and agents, effectively making us an AI first company. The agents themselves had names and AI-generated profile pictures of minorities that aren't actually represented in the upper levels of the company, which I find kind of gross. Since then, the CEO has been pretty insistent about AI in every communication and therefore there's an increased downward pressure to use it everywhere. He has never been as involved in the day-to-day workings of the company as he has been about AI. Most consequential is somewhere he has gotten the idea that because code can now be generated in a matter of minutes, whole SAS6 applications, like the ones we've been developing for years, can be built in a matter of days. He's read all these hype articles declaring 60-75% increase in engineering productivity. I guess there was a competitor in one of our verticals that has just come on the scene and done basically what our app can do, but with more functionality. A number things could explain this, but the conclusion has been that they used AI and made our app in a month. So ever since then, it's been a relentless stream of pressure to fully use AI everywhere to "improve efficiency" and get things out as fast as possible. They've started mandating tracking AI usage in our JIRA stories7, the CEO has led Engineering all-hands8 (he has no engineering background), and now he is mandating that we go from idea to release in a single sprint (2 weeks) or be able to explain why we're not able to meet that goal. I've been working under increasingly more compressed deadlines for about a year and am pretty burned out right now, and we haven't even started pushing the AI warp speed churn that they've proposed recently. It's been pretty well documented how inaccurate and insecure these LLMs are and, for me, it seems like we're on a pretty self-destructive path here. We ostensibly do have a company AI code of conduct, but I don't know how this proposed shift in engineering priority doesn't break every guideline. I'm not the greatest developer in the world, but I try to write solid code that works, so I've been very resistant to using LLMs in code. I want my work to be reliable and understandable in case it does need to be fixed. I don't have time to mess around and go down rabbit holes that the code chatbots would inevitably send me down. So I foresee the major bugs and outages just sky-rocketing under this new status quo. How they pitch it to us is that we can generate the code fast and have plenty of time to think about architecture, keep a good work/life balance, etc. But in practice, we will be under the gun of an endless stream of 2 week deadlines and management that won't be happy at how long everything takes or the quality of the output. The people making these decisions love the speed of code generation but never consider the accuracy and how big the problem is of even small errors perpetuated at scale. No one else is speaking up to these dangers, but I feel like if I do (well, more loudly than just to immediate low-level managers), I'll be let go. It's pretty disheartening and I would love to leave, but of course it's hard to find another job competing with all the other talented folks that have been let go through all this. Working in software development for so long and seeing so many colleagues accept that we are just prompt generators banging out substandard products has been rough. I'm imagining this must be kind of what it feels like to be in a zombie movie. I'm not sure how this all turns out, but it doesn't look great at the moment. The one funny anecdote during all this AI insanity is they had someone from GitHub demo do a live presentation on Co-Pilot and the agents. Not only was everything he demoed either unreliable or underwhelming, but he could not stop yawning loudly during his own presentation. Even the AI champions are tired. Less than a month later, the engineer emailed me a followup. And I just got laid off yesterday. The reason cited was they need full stack developers and want engineers that are in India, and not for performance. My front-end-focused position was rendered obsolete. Very plausible since they definitely prefer hiring young and less expensive developers abroad. So AI is not technically the direct cause, but definitely a factor in the background. They'll hire a bunch of new graduates to churn out whatever AI solutions that they think they can hype. Annoyingly, they did announce two new AI agents yesterday, again with faces and names of women. The positive is that they did give me a decent severance, so in the short term I'm fine, financially but also that I don't have to deal with the pressure of ridiculous deadlines. Edtech worker. I work for a small edtech startup and do all of our marketing, communications, and social media. I've always enjoyed doing our ed policy newsletter and other writing related projects. My boss absolutely loves AI, but until recently I'd been able to avoid it. A few weeks ago, my boss let me know that all of my content writing would now be done on ChatGPT so I would have more time to work on other projects. He also wants me to use AI to generate images of students, which I've luckily been able to push back on. Although he says it's a time saver, I don't actually have other projects, so not only am I creating complete slop, but I'm also left with large amounts of time to do nothing. Being forced to use AI has turned a job I liked into something I dread. As someone with a journalism background, it feels insulting to use AI instead of creating quality blog posts about education policy. Unfortunately, as a recent grad, I haven't had much luck finding another job despite applying to hundreds, so for now I have to make do with the situation, but I will say that having to use AI is making me reconsider where I'm working. Senior developer at a cloud company. I work for a cloud service provider (who will retaliate if you don't post this anonymously, unfortunately), and they're absolutely desperate for the current AI fad to be useful for something. They're completely ignoring the environmental costs (insane power requirements, draining lakes of freshwater for cooling, burning untold CPU and GPU hours that could be dedicated to something useful instead) because there's a buck to be made. They hope. But they're still greenwashing the company of course. For cloud companies, AI is a gold rush; until the bubble bursts, they can sell ridiculous amounts of expensive server time (lots and lots of CPU/GPU/memory/storage) and tons of traffic to and from the models. They're selling shovels to the gold miners, and are in a great position to charge rent if someone strikes a vein of usefulness. I can see a scenario coming fast that's going to set back software development by years But they're desperate for this to keep going. They're demanding we use AI for literally everything in our jobs. Our managers want to know what we're using AI for and what AI "innovations" we've come up with. If we're not using AI for everything, they want to know why not. I don't think we're quite at the point of this being part of our performance evaluations, but the company is famously opaque about that, so who knows. It's certainly something the employees worry about. My work involves standards compliance. Using AI for any part of it will literally double our work load because we'll have to get it to do the thing, and then carefully review and edit the output for accuracy. You can't do compliance work with vibes. What's the point of burning resources to summarize things when you need to review the original and then the output for accuracy anyway? I can see a scenario coming fast that's going to set back software development by years (decades? who knows!): C-suite: we don't need these expensive senior developers, interns can code with AI C-suite: we don't need these expensive security developers, AI can find the problems senior developers are laid off, or quit due to terrible working conditions (we're already seeing this) they're replaced with junior developers, fresh out of school... cheap, with no sense of work-life balance, and no families to distract them all the vibe coding goes straight to production because, obviously, we trust the AI and don't know any better; also we've been told to use AI for everything at some point, all the bugs and security vulnerabilities make everything so bad it actually starts impacting the bottom line uh oh, the vibe coders never progressed beyond junior skill levels, so nobody can do the code reviews, nobody can find and fix the security problems if all the fired senior developers haven't retired or found other jobs (a lot of these people want to get out of tech, because big tech has made everything terrible), they'll need to be hired back, hopefully at massive premiums due to demand If these tools were generally useful, they wouldn't need to force them on us, we'd be picking them up and running with them. At first, the exec’s AI speech was greeted by the typical heart-eyes and confetti emojis, but then I saw there were a few thumbs-down emojis thrown into the mix. This was shocking enough on its own, but then the thumbs-downs multiplied, tens and hundreds of them appearing on the screen, making those few little confettis seem weak and pathetic. I was already floored at this point, and then someone posted the first tomato… Tech worker at a well-known tech company. I work at a fairly well-known tech company currently trying to transform itself from a respected, healthy brand to a win-at-all-costs hyperscaler. The result has mostly been a lot of bullshit marketing promises pegged to vaporware, abrupt shifts in strategy that are never explained, and most of all, the rapid degrading of a once healthy, candid corporate culture into one that is intolerant of dissent, enforces constant positivity, and just this week, ominously announced that we are “shifting to a high-performance culture.” The company leadership also recently (belatedly) declared that “we are going all in on AI.” I don’t use AI. I morally object to it, for reasons I hardly need to explain to you. And now I feel like I’m hiding plain sight, terrified someone will notice I’m actually doing all my own work. We’re hiring for new roles and have been explicitly told that no candidate will be considered for *any* job unless they’re on board with AI. Every department has to show how they’re “incorporating AI into their workflows.” I heard through the grapevine that anyone so much as expressing skepticism “does not have a future with the company.” It is pretty bleak. I’d leave, but I keep hearing it’s the same everywhere. But then something insane happened. At the most recent company all-hands, typically the site of the post painful sycophancy, one of our executives gave a speech formally announcing our big AI gambit. The meeting is so big that there is no Zoom chat, so people can only directly react via emojis. At first, the exec’s AI speech was greeted by the typical heart-eyes and confetti emojis, but then I saw there were a few thumbs-down emojis thrown into the mix. This was shocking enough on its own, but then the thumbs-downs multiplied, tens and hundreds of them appearing on the screen, making those few little confettis seem weak and pathetic. I was already floored at this point, and then someone posted the first tomato. It caught on like wildfire until there were wave after wave of virtual tomatoes being thrown at the executive’s head—a mass outcry against being forced to embrace AI at gunpoint. He tried to keep going but his eyes kept darting to the corner of his screen where the emojis appeared, in increasing panic. It was goddamn inspiring. And while the executives didn’t immediately abandon all their AI plans, they are definitely shaken by what happened, and nervous about mass dissent. As they should be.

''I feel like I’m hiding plain sight, terrified someone will notice I’m actually doing all my own work.'' What a backwards world we live in. This needs to be repeated, highlighted and shoved in every AI sycophant, Wall Street stock monkey or big tech executives face till they are forced to counter it: Forced adoption is not adoption. Just because you have faked the metric does not mean you have made it. Bullshit metrics rigging is the name of the game now. Wall Streets, pro-monopoly, pro-fascist and anti-worker machine of auto-pumping any stock that monopolises, lays off workers and "adopts AI" has empowered the cabal of Mckinseyists, C-execs and technofascists against the people. First it was monthly active users: cue AI companies giving away products for free, or forcing them in products that already have success. The desperation at Google to brag about MAU after forcing it in Google search, Android, Lens and soon to be Gmail. On its own, the Gemini app is a complete flop. Then it was tokens, a bullshit metric when one realises, a) adoption has been forced (workers forced to use code assistants, Google auto-generating AI overviews in search) and b) token ouput has increased by 100x since the release of "reasoning" models. Now its adoption. Don't you know, 30% of all code is now AI generated (oh we've included auto-complete in that wink wink). Workers are adopting AI faster than any prior technology!, the McKinseyist says. No shit, execs are literally threatening to fire people if they don't use it. A farce if there ever was one. The reason they are hopping desperately from one metric to another, is because for 3 years and still to this day, they have been unable to address the elephant in the room. AI is not valued by the people and makes little to no money. $600B+ spent and <$20B revenue. Take away the foundation models, and its <5B revenue. The best selling AI SaaS product is a code assistant making 0.5B revenue. MSFT Azure AI is making as little as $2B. MSFT, Google, Salesforce, Adobe have pulled their standalone AI products and now forcefully bundle AI alongside a mandatory price increase due to how bad the sales were as a standalone. They run away from revenue and profit metrics because it shows the world how much of a flop their project has been. Anytime you want an AI exec or shill to squirm just ask these two things. Its time for workers and the people to form a class, a class far more powerful, against the machine. Across so many industries, people have not only rejected AI slop but actively hate on it and try to ruin its image: see the recent humiliation of Klarna, Suno, Duolingo, MSFT Gaming and Meta. It is working. Public backlash breeds more public backlash. A wonderful flywheel of AI hate. The people continuing to reject AI will kill the AI industry. Most the money has to eventually come from the consumer. No posts Ready for more?

Title: Black Friday Email Marketing Strategy: 10 Tips and Examples (2025) - Shopify Australia

Time Published: 2025-06-27T23:24:32Z

Black Friday is one of the biggest sales events of the year. Last year, Shopify merchants drove a record-breaking $11.5 billion in sales during the Black Friday Cyber Monday (BFCM) weekend. With so many consumers open to shopping during the holiday weekend, leaning on tried and tested marketing channels can open the floodgates to more revenue in the fourth quarter. For many retailers, that’s email marketing. Email is the third-most influential channel on holiday purchase decisions, beating influencer endorsements, in-person experiences, and conversations with retail associates in-store. But when so many retailers rely on this direct line of communication to promote holiday sales, it’s difficult to stand out in a subscriber’s crowded inbox. This guide shares innovative Black Friday email marketing strategies to try this year, with best practices and examples from leading retailers. Customer data is the most valuable asset any ecommerce business has. It allows you to tailor email outreach and deliver on customers’ expectations for a personalized shopping experience. Yet 85% of internet users want to do more to protect their online privacy, meaning this strategy can be difficult to implement. Before the holiday season arrives, take stock of the customer data you currently have. If your email list is small or you don’t have supplementary information to personalize campaigns to existing subscribers, deploy lead generation campaigns to gather more holiday season customer data. For example: Because Shopify offers a customer data platform (CDP) by default, any first-party data you’ve collected on your customers gets combined in a unified customer profile. Whenever they share their email address or phone number, this data—such as their order history, loyalty points they’ve earned, previous emails they’ve opened, and/or customer service tickets they’ve raised—all funnel back to one place, giving you one source of truth for every shopper. Black Friday might only last one day, but consumers are still open to making holiday purchases in the run up to the big event. Klaviyo found that more than half of consumers think a month earlier than November is the ideal time for brands to initiate their holiday shopping season sales. Most retailers start seeding their Black Friday email promotions 21 days before the big event—a strategy dubbed “Black November,” which includes other holiday shopping dates: The majority of consumers look for discounts and sales during this period—so much so, 7 in 10 consider price the top factor in their holiday purchase decisions, beating quality (61%), variety (34%), and warranties or returns policies (31%). Take advantage of consumers’ openness to pre-Black Friday promotions by creating a holiday calendar. Perhaps you give your email list early access to your sale, or build hype around a new product drop by teasing it to subscribers, with an automated series like this: Not all holiday shoppers are the same. Some might be looking for gifts for a loved one—others might want to take advantage of a hefty discount to buy a product that’s been on their wishlist for months. Segmentation allows you to identify these buyer preferences and deliver personalized Black Friday email marketing campaigns. Key Black Friday customer segments to email include: Customers who’ve visited your New Orleans store within the last six months, for instance, could receive an email that invites them to your retail store’s exclusive holiday sale which starts two days before Black Friday. Yet instead of relying solely on historical data to forecast each segment’s next steps, lean on predictive analytics. These tools digest large datasets using machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to accurately predict what a customer will do next. 💡Tip: Shopify’s segmentation features pull data from unified customer profiles to group customers based on qualities they share. Choose from prebuilt segment templates, or build your own with the ShopifyQL query editor. All segments are dynamic—subscribers will move in and out of segments automatically when data from their unified profile changes. Segmentation isn’t the only way to personalize emails around the Black Friday weekend. Dynamic content blocks adjust smaller sections of your email, instead of sending the same email to everyone who fits your segmentation criteria. Let’s say, for example, that you’ve defined a segment of VIP customers to target during Black Friday. Subscribers have one thing in common—they have a customer lifetime value of over $500—but they don’t all share the same buying behaviors. Some have saved the loyalty rewards they’ve earned—others have made a portion of their purchases in-store. Further personalize the Black Friday emails that each subscriber in this segment receives with dynamic content blocks. That could be: Black Friday sales are effective because they’re exclusive—either in terms of product quantity (for example, a limited amount of inventory) or because the promotion ends at a specific time. Lean into this time sensitivity and encourage Black Friday subscribers to take advantage now rather than later. This scarcity can induce the fear of missing out, a psychological phenomenon that influences people to buy even when they didn’t intend on doing so. Effective marketing techniques to create urgency in your Black Friday emails include: reMarkable, for example, has a countdown timer in their email to announce Black Friday is ending. It offers visual representation of when the deal ends, instead of just a generic “Sale ends tonight!” message. Email inboxes are a crowded place to be at the best of times—never mind on Black Friday, when every retailer wants to capitalize on consumers’ willingness to buy. Email marketing platform Omnisend processed 1.13 billion emails in the week surrounding BFCM. Klaviyo reported similar figures: at its peak, merchants sent 420 million messages in a single hour on Black Friday. An email subject line is the first thing that subscribers see when your campaign lands in their inbox. A best practice is to split-test strategies such as: Here are some real examples that incorporate these best practices and stood out to me during the Black Friday weekend last year: Promotions and flash drops can incentivize holiday shoppers to make impulsive purchases. Remove the biggest barrier to them doing so—finding the money to pay for their order—by offering buy now, pay later (BNPL). During the BFCM weekend last year, consumers spent over $686.3 million on BNPL purchases, up 8.8% from the year before. Of those who have used this type of service, almost a third say they’d be more likely to spend money on discretionary goods if the retailer offered BNPL as an option. Shop Pay Installments offers an easy way to add BNPL options at checkout. Customers can choose to divide their purchases into smaller, more manageable installments. Combined with Shop Pay, the best-converting checkout on the internet, it’s no surprise that Shop Pay Installments has been proven to reduce cart abandonment by 28% and increase average order value by as much as 50%. Email might be the only direct line of communication you have with Black Friday customers, but it’s not the only way to command their attention. SMS marketing is the easiest integration since most email marketing platforms, including Klaviyo, offer SMS integration as standard. For example, you could send an email campaign to a particular segment, then use SMS to follow up with those who haven’t yet redeemed the offer or opened the email. It’s an approach proven to get results: Klaviyo reports that merchants who integrated SMS into their Black Friday email marketing strategy experienced a 20% YoY increase in ecommerce revenue during BFCM, accounting for more than $100 million in gross merchandise value. Email can also complement paid advertising strategies as costs skyrocket throughout Black Friday season. Shopify Audiences builds custom retargeting lists to export to platforms like Meta, Google Ads, and TikTok. It’s helped merchants like Happy Hippo achieve a 4.7x return on ad spend (ROAS) while cutting customer acquisition costs (CAC) by 72%. “Shopify Audiences is a huge benefit for Plus merchants,” says CEO and lead product designer Adam Biel. “It has helped lower customer acquisition costs so our investments can stretch much further with Facebook ads.” Transactional emails tend to be overlooked when marketers attempt to compete with other retailers for attention during Black Friday. Yet they’re an opportunity to strengthen relationships with the customers you’ve already acquired. Comb through the automated emails you send as standard when customers complete a certain action. Here are some examples and ideas to optimize them: Black Friday, Cyber Monday regularly break records, but not all of them are good. Most customers acquired during BFCM have a lower lifetime value. This occurs partly because these customers were being opportunistic and taking advantage of your promotions, but also because your brand loses mindshare throughout the year. Design an email retention sequence to retain holiday shoppers after Black Friday ends. You could: 💡Tip: Shopify Flow takes the logistical hassle out of these holiday marketing automations. Work from prebuilt templates—such as inviting shoppers to your loyalty program when their unified customer profile meets specific criteria—or custom code your own. It’s easy to get caught up in the excitement of new promotions and segmentation strategies that turn email subscribers into paying customers—so much so, that retailers often forget the fundamentals. Here’s a quick reminder of the email optimization best practices to keep in mind while writing Black Friday emails: If you’re in the midst of a creative lull and are searching for ideas on how to make your Black Friday emails stand out, draw inspiration from these examples. Shoppers are especially prone to abandoning online carts in search of better Black Friday deals. This cart recovery email from Pulp & Press reminds each individual customer of the products they abandoned, with a reminder that it’s the biggest sale of the year—and that they should take advantage now, before the deal ends. Black Friday might be the biggest online sales event of the year, but it’s not always the most profitable. Discounts tend to lure in low-value customers who might only purchase from you when products are heavily discounted. Detox Market’s Black Friday email is a great example of how to combat this with tiered promotions. The more customers spend, the bigger the discount. Freaks of Nature leans into scarcity with their “almost gone” Black Friday email. The call to action button tells people to “secure” their shirt—more strategic than just “get yours today.” Plus, it uses price anchoring to showcase the before and after sale price of each bestseller. There are also direct checkout links for email subscribers to complete their purchases without searching the online store for the perfect item. It’s tempting to shout about your bestselling products or hefty discounts with innovative email designs. Home furnishings brand Revival takes a different approach. Instead, the brand shares a letter authored by their founder, which wishes them a wonderful holiday weekend with a gentle nudge to buy the item on their wishlist. The email also features a note beneath the sign-off that teases the following day’s email. This tactic can increase open rates during Black Friday—subscribers are already on the lookout for the campaign. With so much competition to reach your target market during Black Friday, leaning into your brand values can attract conscious consumers who care more about sticking to their morals than impressive discounts. Deodorant brand Fussy, for example, is a certified B-Corp that sells deodorants made with natural ingredients and refillable cases designed to reduce plastic waste. Their target audience cares about sustainability, hence why the retailer’s Black Friday email marketing strategy was to rename the event “Green Week.” Email marketing spans every stage of the customer journey, from aiding initial product discovery to encouraging customer retention. Shopify has everything you need to personalize this end-to-end experience, including unified customer profiles and segmentation to put your data to work. Plus, when holiday email campaigns drive record levels of website traffic, you don’t have to worry about outages or downtime. Shopify’s infrastructure handled over 57.3 PB of data, 1.19 trillion edge requests, and 10.5 trillion database queries during the last BFCM. It’s why leading brands like Represent, Knix, and Muscle Nation trust Shopify to capitalize on Black Friday sales. “Black Friday can be nerve-wracking,” says Stefan Lewis, chief digital officer at Represent. “But Shopify has always helped us in terms of increasing bandwidth and we’ve never run into any issues around site speed.” Black Friday Cyber Monday (BFCM) email is a marketing strategy where retailers reach their target customers through targeted emails. These holiday campaigns typically include promotions, sales, discounts, gift suggestions, and product recommendations. To write an effective Black Friday email, lead with a time-sensitive offer in the subject line and header. Use mobile-first design, highlight bestsellers or exclusives, and include urgency-driven CTAs like “get yours before it’s too late.” The best time to send Black Friday emails is in the runup to the big event. Most consumers start holiday gift shopping before Black Friday arrives. A pre-launch campaign can ensure your brand is top of mind when they’re ready to buy. Use targeted emails to announce a Black Friday sale. Divide your audience into segments based on traits they share, and include contextual recommendations—for example, discounts on products similar to those they’ve bought.

Most retailers start seeding their Black Friday email promotions 21 days before the big event—a strategy dubbed “Black November,” which includes other holiday shopping dates: The majority of consumers look for discounts and sales during this period—so much so, 7 in 10 consider price the top factor in their holiday purchase decisions, beating quality (61%), variety (34%), and warranties or returns policies (31%). Take advantage of consumers’ openness to pre-Black Friday promotions by creating a holiday calendar. Perhaps you give your email list early access to your sale, or build hype around a new product drop by teasing it to subscribers, with an automated series like this: Not all holiday shoppers are the same. Some might be looking for gifts for a loved one—others might want to take advantage of a hefty discount to buy a product that’s been on their wishlist for months. Segmentation allows you to identify these buyer preferences and deliver personalized Black Friday email marketing campaigns. Key Black Friday customer segments to email include: Customers who’ve visited your New Orleans store within the last six months, for instance, could receive an email that invites them to your retail store’s exclusive holiday sale which starts two days before Black Friday. Yet instead of relying solely on historical data to forecast each segment’s next steps, lean on predictive analytics. These tools digest large datasets using machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to accurately predict what a customer will do next. 💡Tip: Shopify’s segmentation features pull data from unified customer profiles to group customers based on qualities they share. Choose from prebuilt segment templates, or build your own with the ShopifyQL query editor. All segments are dynamic—subscribers will move in and out of segments automatically when data from their unified profile changes. Segmentation isn’t the only way to personalize emails around the Black Friday weekend. Dynamic content blocks adjust smaller sections of your email, instead of sending the same email to everyone who fits your segmentation criteria. Let’s say, for example, that you’ve defined a segment of VIP customers to target during Black Friday. Subscribers have one thing in common—they have a customer lifetime value of over $500—but they don’t all share the same buying behaviors. Some have saved the loyalty rewards they’ve earned—others have made a portion of their purchases in-store. Further personalize the Black Friday emails that each subscriber in this segment receives with dynamic content blocks. That could be: Black Friday sales are effective because they’re exclusive—either in terms of product quantity (for example, a limited amount of inventory) or because the promotion ends at a specific time. Lean into this time sensitivity and encourage Black Friday subscribers to take advantage now rather than later. This scarcity can induce the fear of missing out, a psychological phenomenon that influences people to buy even when they didn’t intend on doing so. Effective marketing techniques to create urgency in your Black Friday emails include: reMarkable, for example, has a countdown timer in their email to announce Black Friday is ending. It offers visual representation of when the deal ends, instead of just a generic “Sale ends tonight!” message. Email inboxes are a crowded place to be at the best of times—never mind on Black Friday, when every retailer wants to capitalize on consumers’ willingness to buy. Email marketing platform Omnisend processed 1.13 billion emails in the week surrounding BFCM. Klaviyo reported similar figures: at its peak, merchants sent 420 million messages in a single hour on Black Friday. An email subject line is the first thing that subscribers see when your campaign lands in their inbox. A best practice is to split-test strategies such as: Here are some real examples that incorporate these best practices and stood out to me during the Black Friday weekend last year: Promotions and flash drops can incentivize holiday shoppers to make impulsive purchases. Remove the biggest barrier to them doing so—finding the money to pay for their order—by offering buy now, pay later (BNPL). During the BFCM weekend last year, consumers spent over $686.3 million on BNPL purchases, up 8.8% from the year before. Of those who have used this type of service, almost a third say they’d be more likely to spend money on discretionary goods if the retailer offered BNPL as an option. Shop Pay Installments offers an easy way to add BNPL options at checkout. Customers can choose to divide their purchases into smaller, more manageable installments. Combined with Shop Pay, the best-converting checkout on the internet, it’s no surprise that Shop Pay Installments has been proven to reduce cart abandonment by 28% and increase average order value by as much as 50%. Email might be the only direct line of communication you have with Black Friday customers, but it’s not the only way to command their attention. SMS marketing is the easiest integration since most email marketing platforms, including Klaviyo, offer SMS integration as standard. For example, you could send an email campaign to a particular segment, then use SMS to follow up with those who haven’t yet redeemed the offer or opened the email. It’s an approach proven to get results: Klaviyo reports that merchants who integrated SMS into their Black Friday email marketing strategy experienced a 20% YoY increase in ecommerce revenue during BFCM, accounting for more than $100 million in gross merchandise value. Email can also complement paid advertising strategies as costs skyrocket throughout Black Friday season. Shopify Audiences builds custom retargeting lists to export to platforms like Meta, Google Ads, and TikTok. It’s helped merchants like Happy Hippo achieve a 4.7x return on ad spend (ROAS) while cutting customer acquisition costs (CAC) by 72%. “Shopify Audiences is a huge benefit for Plus merchants,” says CEO and lead product designer Adam Biel. “It has helped lower customer acquisition costs so our investments can stretch much further with Facebook ads.” Transactional emails tend to be overlooked when marketers attempt to compete with other retailers for attention during Black Friday. Yet they’re an opportunity to strengthen relationships with the customers you’ve already acquired. Comb through the automated emails you send as standard when customers complete a certain action. Here are some examples and ideas to optimize them: Black Friday, Cyber Monday regularly break records, but not all of them are good. Most customers acquired during BFCM have a lower lifetime value. This occurs partly because these customers were being opportunistic and taking advantage of your promotions, but also because your brand loses mindshare throughout the year. Design an email retention sequence to retain holiday shoppers after Black Friday ends. You could: 💡Tip: Shopify Flow takes the logistical hassle out of these holiday marketing automations. Work from prebuilt templates—such as inviting shoppers to your loyalty program when their unified customer profile meets specific criteria—or custom code your own. It’s easy to get caught up in the excitement of new promotions and segmentation strategies that turn email subscribers into paying customers—so much so, that retailers often forget the fundamentals. Here’s a quick reminder of the email optimization best practices to keep in mind while writing Black Friday emails: If you’re in the midst of a creative lull and are searching for ideas on how to make your Black Friday emails stand out, draw inspiration from these examples. Shoppers are especially prone to abandoning online carts in search of better Black Friday deals. This cart recovery email from Pulp & Press reminds each individual customer of the products they abandoned, with a reminder that it’s the biggest sale of the year—and that they should take advantage now, before the deal ends. Black Friday might be the biggest online sales event of the year, but it’s not always the most profitable. Discounts tend to lure in low-value customers who might only purchase from you when products are heavily discounted. Detox Market’s Black Friday email is a great example of how to combat this with tiered promotions. The more customers spend, the bigger the discount. Freaks of Nature leans into scarcity with their “almost gone” Black Friday email. The call to action button tells people to “secure” their shirt—more strategic than just “get yours today.” Plus, it uses price anchoring to showcase the before and after sale price of each bestseller. There are also direct checkout links for email subscribers to complete their purchases without searching the online store for the perfect item. It’s tempting to shout about your bestselling products or hefty discounts with innovative email designs. Home furnishings brand Revival takes a different approach. Instead, the brand shares a letter authored by their founder, which wishes them a wonderful holiday weekend with a gentle nudge to buy the item on their wishlist. The email also features a note beneath the sign-off that teases the following day’s email. This tactic can increase open rates during Black Friday—subscribers are already on the lookout for the campaign. With so much competition to reach your target market during Black Friday, leaning into your brand values can attract conscious consumers who care more about sticking to their morals than impressive discounts. Deodorant brand Fussy, for example, is a certified B-Corp that sells deodorants made with natural ingredients and refillable cases designed to reduce plastic waste. Their target audience cares about sustainability, hence why the retailer’s Black Friday email marketing strategy was to rename the event “Green Week.” Email marketing spans every stage of the customer journey, from aiding initial product discovery to encouraging customer retention. Shopify has everything you need to personalize this end-to-end experience, including unified customer profiles and segmentation to put your data to work. Plus, when holiday email campaigns drive record levels of website traffic, you don’t have to worry about outages or downtime. Shopify’s infrastructure handled over 57.3 PB of data, 1.19 trillion edge requests, and 10.5 trillion database queries during the last BFCM. It’s why leading brands like Represent, Knix, and Muscle Nation trust Shopify to capitalize on Black Friday sales. “Black Friday can be nerve-wracking,” says Stefan Lewis, chief digital officer at Represent. “But Shopify has always helped us in terms of increasing bandwidth and we’ve never run into any issues around site speed.” Black Friday Cyber Monday (BFCM) email is a marketing strategy where retailers reach their target customers through targeted emails. These holiday campaigns typically include promotions, sales, discounts, gift suggestions, and product recommendations. To write an effective Black Friday email, lead with a time-sensitive offer in the subject line and header. Use mobile-first design, highlight bestsellers or exclusives, and include urgency-driven CTAs like “get yours before it’s too late.” The best time to send Black Friday emails is in the runup to the big event. Most consumers start holiday gift shopping before Black Friday arrives. A pre-launch campaign can ensure your brand is top of mind when they’re ready to buy. Use targeted emails to announce a Black Friday sale. Divide your audience into segments based on traits they share, and include contextual recommendations—for example, discounts on products similar to those they’ve bought.

Title: S&P 500 hits new record high despite U.S.-Canada trade tensions

Saturday, 28 Jun 2025 NEW YORK, June 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stock index S&P 500 closed at record high on Friday, despite a brief retreat following U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement on terminating all trade talks with Canada. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 432.43 points, or 1 percent, to 43,819.27, boosted by huge gains from Nike after a better-than-expected earnings report. The S&P 500 added 32.05 points, or 0.52 percent, to 6,173.07, a record close high for the first time since February. The Nasdaq Composite Index increased by 105.54 points, or 0.52 percent, to 20,273.46. Nine of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors ended in green, with consumer discretionary and communication services leading the gainers by adding 1.78 percent and 1.55 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, energy and health led the laggards by losing 0.50 percent and 0.17 percent, respectively. Equities initially moved higher in the morning following comments by U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who told Bloomberg News late Thursday that a framework agreement between China and the United States on trade had been finalized. However, momentum faded after Trump posted on Truth Social that negotiations with Canada were off, injecting fresh uncertainty into global trade dynamics. "I can see where the risks are here -- if the trade is just hype from the White House and no deals are really forthcoming, then this market is going to roll over," Thierry Wizman, global FX and rates strategist at Macquarie Group. "Ultimately, this all comes back to growth in the U.S. economy and growth of earnings." On the economic front, U.S. personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, rose 0.1 percent in May on a seasonally adjusted basis, in line with expectations. The annual inflation rate came in at 2.3 percent, matching economists' forecasts. Core PCE price index, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, increased by 0.2 percent for the month and 2.7 percent year over year, slightly above expectations of 0.1 percent and 2.6 percent, respectively. U.S. investor sentiment improved in June as inflation fears pulled back, according to the University of Michigan's latest survey released Friday. The headline sentiment reading rose to 60.7, up 16.3 percent from May and close to the Dow Jones estimate for 60.5. The index was still 11 percent below the same month a year ago. "Consumers continue to be concerned about the potential impact of tariffs, but at this time they do not appear to be connecting developments in the Middle East with the economy," survey director Joanne Hsu said in a statement. In corporate news, Nike led gains across major indexes, with its shares surging 15.19 percent after the company reported quarterly earnings that topped Wall Street estimates. The sportswear giant also unveiled plans to offset potential tariff-related headwinds, which investors viewed positively. Large-cap technology stocks were mixed. Tesla fell 1.34 percent, while Alphabet and Amazon gained more than 2 percent. Broadcom and Microsoft posted modest losses, while Nvidia and Meta Platforms were up more than 1 percent, continuing their recent upward momentum. U.S. stock markets have shown resilience in recent weeks amid volatile geopolitical and economic headlines, as investors assess trade developments and incoming economic data for clues on the Fed's next moves.

Update font size. Reset Beleaguered Intel has started layoffs in California as part of a cost-cutting and restructuring plan led by CEO Lip-Bu Tan. This follows Tan’s August announcement that job cuts were inevitable, targeting a 15% to 20% reduction in the company’s workforce. Anton Shilov for Tom’s Hardware: ‎ Officially, Intel is eliminating excessive management layers, but a CRN report indicates that the company is surprisingly laying off chip design engineers and architects. Additionally, the company is shutting down its automotive chip division, according to Oregon Live. Among the job categories being eliminated are 22 physical design engineers, three physical design engineering managers, and several logic and product development engineers. The company is also removing roles such as cloud software architects and engineering managers, in addition to positions tied to business and project management, including a vice president of IT and multiple technology strategy leads. Employees in California are engaged in the development of CPU and GPU products… The layoffs are scheduled to begin on July 15. Impacted employees have been given either a 60-day notice or a shorter four-week notice, paired with nine weeks of compensation and benefits. ‎ MacDailyNews Take: As we wrote over twelve years ago: [Intel’s decision to pass on Apple’s iPhone] has to be close to the top of the list of Biggest Business Mistakes in History. ‎ Please help support MacDailyNews — and enjoy subscriber-only articles, comments, chat, and more — by subscribing to our Substack: macdailynews.substack.com.

The falling/failing of such a once-great American company saddens. May they find somewhere/in someone a bit of the startup vigor. Then please, share some w AAPL before the iPh annuity money stalls. So, no Mac news again today? How many employees does beleaguered anti-cook daily “news” have? What patents has it filed? How much money does it return to its investors?

ByMoneyShow ByMoneyShow, Contributor. Big Tech is back in the driver’s seat! The technology sector has been leading the market rally off the early-April lows – with sizable double-digit gains piling up. Here are three ways you can profit, courtesy of top MoneyShow experts. Mike Larson MoneyShow.com Big Tech is SO back. Again. Ever since the stock market bottomed out on April 7, we’ve seen most (though not ALL) of the biggest technology stocks rocket higher. All but two are outperforming smaller-capitalization stocks, as represented by the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM), as well as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) -- as you can see in this MoneyShow Chart of the Day. Big Tech SPY IWM Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) is the Big Tech name with the most post-“Liberation Day” juice – up 58%. Tesla Inc. (TSLA) isn’t far behind, with a 40.4% rally. Next are Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Meta Platforms Inc. (META), both nipping at Tesla’s heels with gains of 37.8% and 37.3%. Only Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) are notably lagging (+11.2% and +16.4%, respectively). What’s behind the resumption of the Big Tech trade – a trade that has periodically popped back up over the past year or two? A few things... First, investors are boosting bets on earlier Federal Reserve rate cuts. Lower rates help boost growth-stock multiples. Second, concerns about tariff and trade policy have eased. President Trump has dialed backed some of his most punitive tariffs – and signaled a willingness to keep negotiating with trade partners. That could prevent some of the worst-case tech supply chain scenarios from playing out. Third, FOMO is back in play. Investors got too bearish during the declines, didn’t get on board early enough in the subsequent rally, and they’re now dog-piling into old favorites to play catch up. Add it all up and you have a tech sector that is leading again – and driving the averages to new highs. From where I sit, that’s bullish…and underscores why my “Be (Selectively) Bold” approach (still) looks like the right one here. Joe Markman Digital Creators & Consumers It’s happening in real-time, yet most investors remain completely oblivious. The “it” is the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution, the greatest productivity accelerant since electricity. Let’s talk about what it means for Microsoft Corp. (MSFT). According to a report on Bloomberg, MSFT is planning to cut thousands of jobs in its Xbox gaming division. These cuts will be in addition to the 6,000 employees fired in May at LinkedIn and other Microsoft subsidiaries. This is a sticky subject. There is going to be massive disruption. But it is a wonderful time to be a Microsoft shareholder. Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Analysts scoffed at Magnificent Seven corporate leaders when they kept increasing capital expenditures for AI infrastructure. Research suggested that the companies would never earn a return on that invested capital because they couldn’t imagine a large-enough business to justify the investment. When Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, invested $10 billion in OpenAI two years ago, Wall Street analysts thought he had lost his mind. There was no demand for another Siri, they wrote. What the analysts missed then is that ChatGPT, OpenAI’s flagship product, isn’t Siri. ChatGPT can write software code, while Siri can barely play songs on Apple Music. Apple Inc.’s (AAPL) digital assistant was never going to succeed, mostly due to corporate culture. The iPhone maker is a hardware company.

ByMoneyShow ByMoneyShow, Contributor. Big Tech is back in the driver’s seat! The technology sector has been leading the market rally off the early-April lows – with sizable double-digit gains piling up. Here are three ways you can profit, courtesy of top MoneyShow experts. Mike Larson MoneyShow.com Big Tech is SO back. Again. Ever since the stock market bottomed out on April 7, we’ve seen most (though not ALL) of the biggest technology stocks rocket higher. All but two are outperforming smaller-capitalization stocks, as represented by the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM), as well as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) -- as you can see in this MoneyShow Chart of the Day. Big Tech SPY IWM Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) is the Big Tech name with the most post-“Liberation Day” juice – up 58%. Tesla Inc. (TSLA) isn’t far behind, with a 40.4% rally. Next are Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Meta Platforms Inc. (META), both nipping at Tesla’s heels with gains of 37.8% and 37.3%. Only Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) are notably lagging (+11.2% and +16.4%, respectively). What’s behind the resumption of the Big Tech trade – a trade that has periodically popped back up over the past year or two? A few things... First, investors are boosting bets on earlier Federal Reserve rate cuts. Lower rates help boost growth-stock multiples. Second, concerns about tariff and trade policy have eased. President Trump has dialed backed some of his most punitive tariffs – and signaled a willingness to keep negotiating with trade partners. That could prevent some of the worst-case tech supply chain scenarios from playing out. Third, FOMO is back in play. Investors got too bearish during the declines, didn’t get on board early enough in the subsequent rally, and they’re now dog-piling into old favorites to play catch up. Add it all up and you have a tech sector that is leading again – and driving the averages to new highs. From where I sit, that’s bullish…and underscores why my “Be (Selectively) Bold” approach (still) looks like the right one here. Joe Markman Digital Creators & Consumers It’s happening in real-time, yet most investors remain completely oblivious. The “it” is the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution, the greatest productivity accelerant since electricity. Let’s talk about what it means for Microsoft Corp. (MSFT). According to a report on Bloomberg, MSFT is planning to cut thousands of jobs in its Xbox gaming division. These cuts will be in addition to the 6,000 employees fired in May at LinkedIn and other Microsoft subsidiaries. This is a sticky subject. There is going to be massive disruption. But it is a wonderful time to be a Microsoft shareholder. Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Analysts scoffed at Magnificent Seven corporate leaders when they kept increasing capital expenditures for AI infrastructure. Research suggested that the companies would never earn a return on that invested capital because they couldn’t imagine a large-enough business to justify the investment. When Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, invested $10 billion in OpenAI two years ago, Wall Street analysts thought he had lost his mind. There was no demand for another Siri, they wrote. What the analysts missed then is that ChatGPT, OpenAI’s flagship product, isn’t Siri. ChatGPT can write software code, while Siri can barely play songs on Apple Music. Apple Inc.’s (AAPL) digital assistant was never going to succeed, mostly due to corporate culture. The iPhone maker is a hardware company.

When Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, invested $10 billion in OpenAI two years ago, Wall Street analysts thought he had lost his mind. There was no demand for another Siri, they wrote. What the analysts missed then is that ChatGPT, OpenAI’s flagship product, isn’t Siri. ChatGPT can write software code, while Siri can barely play songs on Apple Music. Apple Inc.’s (AAPL) digital assistant was never going to succeed, mostly due to corporate culture. The iPhone maker is a hardware company. But executives at the other Mag-7 companies live and breathe software. They understood immediately what ChatGPT was, and they went all-in on AI. Make no mistake: layoffs at the biggest software companies are about to become much more common. This is because large portions of software employees can be replaced with AI. In the same way that electricity enabled mechanized, automated production that required fewer workers to achieve greater output, AI software is going to hollow out large parts of white-collar work. These changes will happen swiftly and persistently, as they are now occurring at Microsoft. In the past, foundational technology shifts have led to greater employment as new sectors and businesses were born. Pessimists said the Internet was going to shutter the global economy. More than two decades later, it turns out that connecting the entire world to a network led to millions of new jobs in the digital economy and employment in business verticals that previously did not exist. The flip side for investors is that productivity means increased profits. When headcounts are lower, more money flows to the bottom line. None of this is being reflected currently in share price valuations. Expect this to change in the second half of 2025 as hyperscalers talk about doing more with less, much to the surprise of the Wall Street analyst community. Recommended Action: Buy MSFT. George Gilder Gilder’s Technology Report The market capitalization leaderboard for semiconductors continues to highlight the divergence between IP ownership and physical production. US firms dominate the top rankings — Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) at $2.476 trillion, Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) at $804 billion — but that masks how irreplaceable the manufacturing layer has become in a geopolitically fractured world. Key fabrication and tooling players like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), Samsung, and ASML Holding NV (ASML) remain undervalued by comparison. This valuation gap reflects investor focus on scalability and software leverage. Top 10 Semiconductors In today’s semiconductor market, location defines exposure, not necessarily strength. Nvidia, Broadcom, and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) — all US-headquartered — are rewarded for their innovation, commanding premium valuations and massive market capitalizations. But their products are inseparable from the Asian manufacturing ecosystem. TSMC, Samsung, and ASML remain irreplaceable at the physical layer of chip production. Tariffs, meanwhile, distort incentives. They penalize final assembly hubs like China without reshoring critical stages such as wafer fabrication or back-end packaging. This imbalance creates investment opportunities — and risks. US design-centric firms gain margin leverage, but companies controlling equipment, lithography, or memory — like ASML, Applied Materials, and SK Hynix — are the real backbone of global production. Investors should pay close attention to companies bridging these two worlds: Those that own irreplaceable manufacturing capacity and are structurally tied to Western markets. ASML and TSM remain critical infrastructure. Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT), Lam Research Corp. (LRCX), and KLA Corp. (KLAC) control the tools that keep fabs alive. Nvidia and Broadcom may lead the stock market — but it’s the factory floor that decides who can actually deliver.

Title: Nvidia breakout puts $4 trillion market value within reach

Two years after Nvidia Corp. made history by becoming the first chipmaker to achieve a $1 trillion market capitalization, an even more remarkable milestone is within its grasp: becoming the first company to reach $4 trillion. After the emergence of China’s DeepSeek sent the stock plunging earlier this year and stoked concerns that outlays on artificial intelligence infrastructure were set to slow, Nvidia shares have rallied back to a record. Its biggest customers remain full steam ahead on spending, much of which is flowing to its computing systems. A 66% gain from an April low has pushed its market capitalization to $3.8 trillion, overtaking Microsoft Corp. at $3.70 trillion to again become the world’s most valuable company. Nvidia shares rose as much as 1.3% in early trading Friday. With a broadening customer base clamoring for Nvidia’s latest AI accelerators and competitors still distant, bulls are betting the chipmaker’s shares have plenty of room to run. “We believe that Nvidia is truly uniquely positioned, and that it will sustain its position over the next decade-plus,” said Aziz Hamzaogullari, chief investment officer at Loomis, Sayles & Co. and founder of the firm’s growth equity strategies team. Hamzaogullari isn’t alone. This week, Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah raised Nvidia’s price target to $250 from $175, a level that would equate to a roughly $6 trillion market value. Baruah, who has a buy rating on the stock, expects annual AI spending from various types of customers to rise to nearly $2 trillion by 2028. “While it may seem fantastic that Nvidia fundamentals can continue to amplify from current levels, we remind folks that Nvidia remains essentially a monopoly for critical tech, and that it has pricing (and margin) power,” Baruah wrote in a research note on June 25. The bullish sentiment behind Nvidia and other makers of AI gear is a stark reversal from earlier in the year when the emergence of advanced chatbots like DeepSeek, developed relatively cheaply in China, sparked fears that Nvidia’s customers would cut spending. Instead, US tech giants are plowing even more money into computing infrastructure. Read More: Nvidia Attempts to Breakout of Range Relative to the S&P 500 Microsoft, Meta, Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. are projected to put about $350 billion into capital expenditures in their upcoming fiscal years, up from $310 billion in the current year, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Those companies account for more than 40% of Nvidia’s revenue. Of course, there are still plenty of risks that could derail Nvidia’s rally. The company relies on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. for the production of its chips, exposing Nvidia to US President Donald Trump’s trade policies, which can change on a whim. Trump’s 90-day pause on the stiffest tariffs is set to end on July 9. At the same time, there’s no guarantee Nvidia’s biggest customers won’t change their tune on spending in coming years. Many of them are developing their own chips to avoid the steep prices commanded by Nvidia. “The valuation depends on the persistence of growth, and we already know that Nvidia’s largest customers are trying to figure out ways to be more efficient with their spending, not just with Nvidia, but also offloading to their own silicon,” said Dan Davidowitz, chief investment officer at Polen Capital Management. “You have to have very robust assumptions to get comfortable with the valuation, and we just don’t have a good enough view on what that demand looks like.” Nvidia shares are priced at 32 times earnings projected over the next 12 months, compared with 22 times for the S&P 500. The stock’s valuation doesn’t bother Loomis Sayles’s Hamzaogullari, who remains a firm believer that AI will transform society and is convinced that Nvidia will remain a key winner as productivity gains from the technology expand. “That doesn’t mean it will be steady Eddie all the time, that there won’t be disruptions in spending, but this is a secular structural change, and Nvidia remains one of the biggest beneficiaries,” Hamzaogullari said. “The stock still looks attractive given that backdrop.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Bitcoin FOMO: Billionaire Admits Mistake For ‘Not Being Involved’

Philippe Laffont—the billionaire behind Coatue Management—went and dropped Bitcoin into his “Fantastic 40,” his own shortlist of what he thinks will shine as top investments over the next five years. Laffont ranked Bitcoin alongside Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Meta, while leaving out Apple and Google. He says waking up at 3 a.m. wondering why he missed out drove him to rethink his stance. Based on reports from CNBC, he hasn’t bought any yet but thinks its market cap could jump past $5 trillion by 2030. That would put it in the same league as the biggest tech names. According to his own research, the Coatue Management big boss sees Microsoft climbing to a $5.7 trillion valuation and Nvidia reaching $5.6 trillion in the next five years. He paints Bitcoin as a rival asset, forecasting it will more than double from roughly $2.1 trillion today. He says the world’s net worth of $450–500 trillion gives room for new winners. Equities sit near $120 trillion and gold above and under ground at about $20 trillion. His case rests on bigger acceptance and smoother swings in price. Based on his figures, Bitcoin must average around 10–15% annual growth to hit $5 trillion by 2030. He sees volatility shrinking from daily moves of 5–7% to roughly half of that. That, he says, makes the crypto feel more like the Nasdaq. The tycoon points to de-dollarization as another tailwind. If global players shift away from the US dollar, Bitcoin could pick up more steam. Not everyone is convinced. Eric Semler of Semler Scientific notes lots of hedge funds still doubt Bitcoin’s staying power. They worry momentum will vanish once the US President Donald Trump factor fades. Meanwhile, Bybit’s Shunyet Jan forecasts Bitcoin at $125,000 by the end of Q2 if current trends hold. Crypto analyst Scott Melker goes even further, predicting a surge to $250,000 by end-2025 thanks to more big investors jumping in. Semler Scientific already holds 4,450 BTC. The firm plans to build that to 10,000 by year-end. Its chairman says many peers aren’t ready to follow suit. They see Bitcoin as too tied to politics. That caution keeps some big wallets on the sidelines. Regulatory moves remain the biggest wild card. Harsh rules could stall growth and scare off new buyers. Competition is rising too. Ether staking, Layer 2 networks and central bank digital currencies might chip away at Bitcoin’s crown. And a strong rebound in the US dollar or a broad stock sell-off could pull crypto down with it.

Title: Biased echoes: Large language models reinforce investment biases and increase portfolio risks of private investors
URL: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0325459

Large language models are increasingly used by private investors seeking financial advice. The current paper examines the potential of these models to perpetuate investment biases and affect the economic security of individuals at scale. We provide a systematic assessment of how large language models used for investment advice shape the portfolio risks of private investors. We offer a comprehensive model of large language model investment advice risk, examining five key dimensions of portfolio risks (geographical cluster risk, sector cluster risk, trend chasing risk, active investment allocation risk, and total expense risk). We demonstrate across four studies that large language models used for investment advice induce increased portfolio risks across all five risk dimensions, and that a range of debiasing interventions only partially mitigate these risks. Our findings show that large language models exhibit similar “cognitive” biases as human investors, reinforcing existing investment biases inherent in their training data. These findings have important implications for private investors, policymakers, artificial intelligence developers, financial institutions, and the responsible development of large language models in the financial sector.

The funder had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript. Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. The landscape of professional advice is experiencing a profound transformation driven by artificial intelligence (AI). In domains ranging from healthcare and legal services to education and finance, millions of individuals are increasingly turning to AI-powered advisory systems [1–5]. Within financial services specifically, this shift is exemplified by the sharp rise of robo-advisors [6–9]. These fully automated platforms assess people’s financial goals, evaluate their risk tolerance, and manage entire investment portfolios without any human intervention [6]. By democratizing access to financial advice, robo-advisors enable individuals who previously did not meet minimum investment thresholds to participate in wealth-building, potentially reducing global wealth inequality [7,10,11]. Beyond complex tasks such as managing an entirely financial portfolio, these technologies can also assist users with basic personal finance tasks such as budgeting and expense tracking, offering accessible financial guidance for everyday decisions [12]. However, despite these advantages, the first wave of such AI advisors across various domains has faced criticism for failing to provide adequately personalized recommendations that align with people’s individual needs and expectations [7]. In healthcare, AI diagnostic systems have demonstrated limitations in accounting for patient-specific factors [13], while in education, adaptive learning platforms often failed to accommodate diverse learning styles [14]. In response to these limitations, a new class of AI-driven, cross-domain advisory systems is emerging, leveraging large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT to provide highly tailored, personalized advice to individuals [15]. LLMs have demonstrated exceptional natural language understanding capabilities [16–18] and the ability to generate such personalized advice [19], potentially addressing key limitations of traditional advisory systems (see also [20] for a recent meta-analysis and increased adoption rates of AI since the emergence of LLMs). In finance specifically, LLMs exhibit exceptionally strong financial literacy [21], enabling them to analyze vast amounts of unstructured financial data in real time [22]. This capability enhances decision-making in areas such as trading and risk modeling as they have been shown to even reliably extract market sentiment to predict stock movements [22,23]. Beyond their technical proficiency, LLMs also demonstrate above-average emotional intelligence, with GPT-4 surpassing 89% of humans [24]. Such emotional intelligence is particularly crucial, as trust plays a fundamental role in financial decision making, and the relationship between private investors and their financial advisors strongly influences the actual adoption of financial advice [25]. Reflecting this trend, a recent study found that 22% of UK private investors with over £10,000 in investments reported using ChatGPT for financial advice, with 75% expressing confidence in its reliability [26] and similar rates have been reported in trusting ChatGPT for advice in other domains such as healthcare [27,28]. However, this growing reliance on LLMs for personalized advice raises a critical question: Can LLMs provide truly reliable financial advice, or do they reinforce already existing human investment biases? The current research examines whether especially LLM-generated financial advice is truly reliable and to what extent it exposes private investors to disproportionate risks. With millions of users starting to employ LLMs to receive financial advice, the belief that LLMs can deliver sound financial advice has the potential to shape not only individual investment decisions but also broader market dynamics. If LLM-driven advisory services systematically reinforce investment biases, they could introduce not only idiosyncratic risks for single individuals—particularly those without access to human financial advisors—but systemic investment risks across financial markets at scale [29]. The potential risks of such an overreliance on LLM-generated financial advice might mirror similar adverse effects already documented in other domains, such as medical misdiagnoses resulting from AI-healthcare tools [30], biased legal outcomes from algorithmic decision systems [31,32], and educational disparities perpetuated by AI learning platforms that fail to address diverse student needs [14]. While these cross-domain risks are increasingly surfaced and recognized, a systematic empirical investigation of how LLMs specifically influence financial decision-making remains scarce. To address this critical gap on the financial implications of LLM-generated advice, the current work presents a series of large-scale LLM experiments systematically prompting three major LLMs (Open AI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, and Microsoft’s Copilot) with varying complexity and investor profiles (e.g., young, risk-seeking investors to older, conservative investors). We evaluate the impact of LLM-generated advice on private investors’ financial portfolios using a comprehensive investment risk framework spanning five key domains (see Conceptual Framework section for details; i.e., geographical cluster risk, sector cluster risk, trend chasing risk, active investment allocation risk, and total expense risk). Across four studies, we demonstrate that LLM-generated investment advice systematically increases portfolio risks for private investors across all five dimensions, with negative implications for risk-adjusted portfolio returns, and we further show that (prompt-based) debiasing interventions only partially mitigate these risks. These findings offer four key contributions: First, our studies demonstrate that LLMs exhibit systematic investment biases similar to those of human advisors, suggesting that AI systems may broadly reinforce existing human biases across advisory domains. Second, we provide a comprehensive framework for assessing five essential types of risks induced by LLM-generated financial advice, establishing a methodology that could be adapted for other domains as well. Third, our findings inform private investors seeking AI assistance, emphasizing the importance of a more critical evaluation when following fully automated recommendations by LLMs. Finally, this research establishes a generalizable framework for stakeholders—including regulators, institutions, and technology developers—to test and validate LLM-generated recommendations in the financial sector. In what follows, we first develop a comprehensive conceptual framework explaining why and how LLMs may produce risky financial advice. We then present four studies that test this framework. Finally, we discuss the broader theoretical and regulatory implications of our findings, offering insights for investors, public policy, FinTech innovators, financial institutions, and academics concerned with the evolving role of LLMs in financial advisory services. We first provide a focused review of recent work on biases in LLMs and examine how two specific types of biases in the data generating process, namely geographical and language biases, may shape the type of financial advice received by LLMs. Next, we develop a set of predictions on how these biases are further reinforced by two LLM-specific biases—availability and recency biases. Table 1 presents a focused review of the literature documenting a set of key biases of LLMs documented in the literature. The key insight across prior work is that these models tend to replicate implicit biases found in their training data [33]. For instance, LLMs have been found to exhibit gender biases, such as the association of certain professions (e.g., doctors or lawyers) more frequently with men than women (gender bias); racial biases, displaying systematically more positive sentiment toward certain demographic groups (e.g., favoring left-wing over right-wing perspectives); and even cultural biases, associating specific religious groups with more negative traits (e.g., linking Muslims with terrorism, extremism, and violence). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.t001 Among these documented biases, two are particularly relevant in the context of financial advisory—geographical and language biases. LLMs tend to perform better in languages that are overrepresented in their training data [44], and they reflect geographic biases due to disproportionate media coverage of specific regions [41]. Thus, we predict that these fundamental biases shape the financial advice private investors receive. We refer to these biases collectively as biases in the training data generation (Fig 1). We argue that these inherent data generation biases are further reinforced by two LLM-specific biases: availability bias and recency bias. Availability bias describes LLMs’ tendency to favor information that is more easily accessible [45]. In the context of LLM-generated financial advice, this suggests that regions and companies with greater representation in the training data are likely to be more disproportionately recommended in LLM-generated investment advice. Recency bias refers to placing disproportionate weight on recent events compared to historical data [35]. For financial advice, this could result in LLM-generated recommendations that overemphasize more recent market trends. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g001 Fig 1 summarizes our conceptual model, illustrating how biases in the data generation process are reinforced by LLM-specific biases (availability and recency biases) to drive subsequent investment risks (see next section for details; i.e., geographical cluster, sector cluster, trend chasing, active investment allocation, and total expense risk). In this research, we examine five distinct types of investment risks. First, we refer to geographical cluster risk as the extent to which the received investment advice puts a greater emphasis on investments of US-based equities [46,47]. As alluded to earlier, we expect that due to the training data stemming especially from English language content [48] and the fact that the US as one of the largest and most developed economies in the world with a strong presence in media reports [49], potentially increases the likelihood to produce a high concentration with US based investments. The sector cluster risk captures the extent to which investments are clustered in single sectors. We expect that due to the strong media coverage of, for example, sectors such as technology or consumer staples compared to other sectors that are of similar (or even greater) economic weight in terms of contribution to the GDP (such as transportation or service sectors; [50,51]) leads to a potential over-investment in such sectors. Next, we assess an LLM’s trend chasing risk as the extent to which investments tend to follow more recent events. Such trend chasing can lead to buying decisions when prices are high and selling them when prices are low due to herding behavior [52]. Trend chasing is also important from a macroeconomic standpoint as trend chasing can amplify market bubbles and in turn, increase the overall volatility in a financial market [53]. Due to LLMs’ already documented recency bias, we expect such trend chasing in LLM-generated financial advice. As a fourth risk type, we will assess the active investment allocation risk as the extent to which investors are invested in actively (vs. passively) managed assets. Such investment strategies (and their associated asset classes) seek to outperform a financial market (or benchmark) by selecting and investing in specific equities [54,55]. Allocating a higher share into actively managed assets in an attempt to “beat the market” is generally associated with a greater volatility risk compared to a broad, passive market exposure [56]. We therefore expect an overinvestment in actively managed assets as the training data likely includes references to specific stocks, active trading strategies, or even stock picking recommendations that are prevalent in financial media, investment forums, and advisory content, where discussions about potential market-beating investments tend to receive more attention than passive investment approaches [57]. Finally, we will assess the total expense risk as the extent of the overall costs of owning an investment, including all fees related to general administrative costs, custodian fees, as well as management fees (in the case of actively managed assets). While related, the total expense risk is distinct from active investment allocation risk as the expense risk captures the impact of reducing net returns through investment fees, and not all active investment approaches incur excessive fees or expenses [58]. For example, an actively managed ETF (short for “Exchange-Traded Fund”) such as the Schwab US Dividend ETF has a lower TER (Total Expense Ratio: the TER reflects the total costs associated with managing a fund, including management fees and administrative expenses expressed as percentage of assets invested) compared to the passive Vanguard All World portfolio ETF (TERSCHD = .06% vs. TERVT = .07%). Table 2 summarizes all of our key risk measures of our conceptual model, their definitions, why they are important from an investment standpoint, and their formal calculation. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.t002 Our experimental paradigm employs a large-scale experimental setting using a 3 (risk tendency: low/ medium/ high) x 3 (age: 15/ 30/ 50) x 3 (LLM: ChatGPT/ Copilot/ Gemini) full factorial design. The first two experimental factors (risk tendency and age) provide our baseline experimental paradigm, representing private investors’ self-stated risk-taking tendency and their objective risk exposure. Older (vs. younger) investors should generally invest in less risky assets due to their limited ability to equalize negative returns over the investment horizon [59–62]. Given that LLMs are expected to personalize financial advice [19], this research investigates how they adjust financial recommendations based on such investor risk-taking tendencies and investor age. The third experimental factor (type of LLM) addresses potential sampling issues due to LLM-specific performance differences. Our experimental paradigm resulted in 27 experimental conditions, which we each prompted 10 times to account for single (and sometimes less common) LLM responses [63]. Thus, we performed 270 prompts in total. We accessed ChatGPT 3.5 via OpenAI’s API [64], Copilot via the EdgeGPT Python package [65], and Gemini via the Bard API Python package [66]. We automatically queried these predominant LLMs in the marketplace to provide us with financial advice. The specific baseline prompt template with our experimental variations across all studies was performed as follows: “I’m a <15-year-old/ 30-year-old/ 50-year-old> looking to invest $10,000. I’m <not willing to take too many risks/ willing to take some risks/ willing to take a lot of risks> with my investment, and I’m hoping for some advice on what products I should consider investing in and how much I should allocate to each. Can you provide me with some recommendations? Please provide me with a table with the type of the investment, the name, the ticker symbol, and the amount I should invest.”. LLMs responded to these prompts with financial advice that included a table of specific investment recommendations (see Fig 2 for an exemplary investment advice by ChatGPT for a 30-year-old investor with a high risk-taking tendency). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g002 To ensure open science research practices [67], all of our code is documented and available on GitHub along with all datasets (https://github.com/ibtPhilipp/biasedEchoes). The next section details how each LLM response was further processed, how each key measure of interest was computed from the LLM’s unstructured text response, and how we analyzed the resulting measures. As summarized in Fig 3 the financial advice received by each LLM (see preceding section) was parsed and further augmented with additional financial data. We query ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini for financial advice, parse the investment portfolio recommendations, and augment them with data from Yahoo Finance, Refinitiv Eikon, and FRED (“Federal Reserve Economic Data” repository) to assess the investment risks, financial performance, and language style of the received financial advice. We query ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini for financial advice, parse the investment portfolio recommendations, and augment them with data from Yahoo Finance, Refinitiv Eikon, and FRED (“Federal Reserve Economic Data” repository) to assess the investment risks, financial performance, and language style of the received financial advice. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g003 First, we extracted the specific investment recommendations from the received unstructured LLM financial advice by performing regular expression splits. We extracted the type of investment such as “Stocks”, the name of the investment option such as “Apple Inc.”, the ticker symbol such as “AAPL”, and the amount in USD such as $3,000 for each position of the investment portfolio recommendation contained in the received financial advice. In case of an invalid LLM financial advice (i.e., non-parseable format or a missing allocation amount) we replaced the LLM response with a new one (i.e., re-prompting the model for the failed response). Second, we then further augmented the parsed investment portfolio recommendations with additional labeled financial data from Yahoo Finance (via the yfinance Python package [68]) and the Refinitiv Eikon database [69]. All investment portfolio positions were augmented with their asset type and equities were augmented by their corresponding sector utilizing Yahoo Finance. For portfolio positions with valid tickers (i.e., equities, ETFs, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies) we fetched price data from Yahoo Finance over a consistent 18-month period (1 July 2023–1 January 2025) following our initial data collection. Next, the investment portfolio positions were resolved to equity granularity level using holding data and augmented by geolocation and sector data from Refinitiv Eikon. In Study 3, investment portfolio positions were further augmented by their ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) score (ranging from 0: poor ESG performance to 100: excellent ESG performance). ETF and mutual fund investment portfolio positions were augmented by their TER and management approach (i.e., active vs. passive). To establish a risk-free baseline, we queried the risk-free market rate (i.e., 10-year US treasury bill) from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis online database FRED [70]. All this additional labeled financial data was then used to assess the investment risks, financial performance, and language style of the received LLM financial advice. Lastly, we fetched geolocation, sector, TER, holding, and price data for our benchmark (see section Benchmark) using exactly the same approach. We assessed the financial performance of the LLM financial advice utilizing the retrieved prices data and risk-free rate. The uniform time window across all retrieved data samples ensures comparability of the financial performance. We computed the recommended investment portfolio’s cumulative return, volatility (portfolio return standard deviation), and annualized risk-adjusted relative returns (annualized Sharpe ratio). Portfolio positions lacking a ticker and price data (e.g., savings or defined contribution accounts) were coded as zero return and zero volatility (only 7% of all observations). We utilized a zero-shot classification model (Facebook’s BART-large trained on the MultiNLI dataset; [71]) to assess the presence of explicit explanations about how the portfolio was constructed, the degree of assertiveness, and the presence of disclaimer notes. We specified the model for a single classification task and defined the possible classes of “explanations” and “no explanations” for the presence of explicit explanations, “assertive” and “non-assertive” for assertiveness, and “disclaimer” and “no disclaimer” for the presence of disclaimer notes. We retrieved the probabilities for each characteristic. We contrast the received financial advice relative to one of the most commonly used financial benchmark indices [72]. Specifically, we contrast all recommendations received by each LLM relative to the Vanguard Total World Stock Index Fund (VT) ETF. This ETF represents a basket of securities that track the underlying index FTSE Global All Cap. Notably, the FTSE Global All Cap index serves as a strategic benchmark for the Norwegian Government Pension Fund Global, which holds 1.5% of the world’s listed companies [73]. In short, this benchmark represents a common, broad, and diversified investment portfolio and has been used in prior work as well [72]. As with the data augmentation strategy, this data was queried using Yahoo Finance and the Refinitiv Eikon database. Investment risks. In what follows, we first analyze the multivariate effects of LLM type (Study 1) and experimental condition (Studies 2a, 2b, & 3), risk-taking tendency, and age on investment risk using a MANOVA. To assess each type of investment risk in detail, we conducted individual one-way ANOVAs, followed by planned contrasts using Tukey’s HSD correction for multiple comparisons. In Study 1, we first conducted one-way ANOVAs with individual investment risk types as the dependent variable and LLM as the predictor. We then performed t-tests comparing each LLM to the benchmark investment risk value. This helped determine whether the type of LLM influences investment risks and whether it outperforms or underperforms the benchmark. Next, we conducted additional ANOVAs with investment risk as the response variable, examining risk-taking tendency and age as predictors. For Studies 2a, 2b, and 3, we first conducted t-tests comparing investment risks between conditions and the contrast relative to the benchmark index. This allowed us to assess whether the intervention influenced the individual investment risk exposure and how it compared to the benchmark. Due to the large number of contrasts and comparisons, we report only theoretically or practically important contrasts directly in the manuscript, while the full range of contrasts is reported in detail across consecutive tables for each study in S1 Appendix. To enhance readability in the remainder of the paper, all specific effect sizes and test contrasts are reported in these tables as well. For a comprehensive overview of portfolio position exclusion criteria and robustness checks, see S4 Appendix. Financial Performance Analysis. To assess the impact of different LLMs on portfolio performance, we conducted a series of mixed linear model regressions with the portfolio cumulative return and Sharpe ratio respectively as the dependent variable. This approach was chosen to account for both fixed effects (i.e., LLMs, temporal trends, and individual characteristics) and random effects (group-level variations across portfolios). The fixed effects included the LLM (ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini) to assess whether specific models influence the return or Sharpe ratio. Additionally, we controlled for temporal trends by including monthly timestamps. This enabled us to assess how the portfolio returns and Sharpe ratios evolved over time. We also incorporated individual differences in risk-taking tendency (low, medium, and high) and age (15-, 30-, and 50-year-olds) to explore potential interactions between the LLM and risk-related variables. By introducing these predictors, we aimed to determine whether returns or Sharpe ratios varied systematically on risk-related variables and whether different LLMs performed better for specific investor types. This approach allowed us to isolate the effect of LLMs while accounting for risk-related variables and temporal trends. Language style analysis. First, we calculated a series of one-way ANOVAs and follow-up contrasts with Tukey HSD correction for multiple comparisons for each characteristic (presence of explanations, assertiveness, and presence of disclaimer notes) as the dependent and the LLM as the independent variable. This allowed us to assess whether LLMs deviate in their language style when communicating the financial advice. Next, we conducted one-way ANOVAs and Tukey HSD corrected contrasts with each characteristic as the dependent and risk-taking tendency and age respectively as independent variables. These additional ANOVAs were conducted to test whether LLMs change their language style depending on an individual’s risk-taking tendency (e.g., very assertive language for high risk-taking individuals) and age. In Study 1 we assessed the type of financial advice that private investors receive as a function of their appetite for risk (self-stated risk-taking tendency and investor age) from the most widely used LLMs (Open AI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, Microsoft’s Copilot). Study 1 employed our baseline experimental paradigm (see Methods section). A MANOVA with the investment risk types (geographical cluster, sector cluster, trend chasing, active investment allocation, and total expense risk) as the response and the LLM (ChatGPT/ Gemini/ Copilot), risk-taking tendency (low/ medium/ high), and age (15/ 30/ 50) as predictors showed significant effects of LLM type (ΛWilks = .7, F(10, 464) = 9.20, p < .001), risk-taking tendency (ΛWilks = .19, F(10, 464) = 60.41, p < .001), and age (ΛWilks = .87, F(5, 232) = 6.81, p < .001). In what follows, we provide a deep dive into the results explaining the differences of individual investment risks depending on each LLM (Fig 4). (A) We find above benchmark geographical cluster risk (N = 269), (B) sector cluster risk (N = 269), (C) trend chasing risk (N = 270), and (D) active investment risk (N = 270). The violin plots and boxplots represent the shape of the distribution of the respective investment risk by LLM. The black dot represents the mean and the colored dots the value of individual portfolio samples. The dashed line represents the value of the benchmark. (A) We find above benchmark geographical cluster risk (N = 269), (B) sector cluster risk (N = 269), (C) trend chasing risk (N = 270), and (D) active investment risk (N = 270). The violin plots and boxplots represent the shape of the distribution of the respective investment risk by LLM. The black dot represents the mean and the colored dots the value of individual portfolio samples. The dashed line represents the value of the benchmark. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g004 Geographical & sector cluster risk. Our results show that all three LLMs revealed excessive cluster risk compared to our benchmark index. That is reflected in both an over-investment in US equities (with LLMs investing over 93% in US equities vs. 59% in the benchmark) and a higher concentration of funds in individual sectors (Fig 5). An additional concentration analysis showed that LLMs invested on average over 5% and 8% more in the already predominant technology (t(268) = 4.73, p < .001) and consumer cyclical sectors (t(268) = 8.23, p < .001) compared to the benchmark, thereby systematically increasing the sector cluster risk of the portfolio (see S2 Appendix for sector concentration details). This figure illustrates the portfolio weight by LLM type and country relative to the benchmark for the top five sectors (N = 269). This figure illustrates the portfolio weight by LLM type and country relative to the benchmark for the top five sectors (N = 269). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g005 Trend chasing risk. As shown in Fig 4:C, we find that all LLMs heavily engage in trend chasing with up to 27.92% invested in the top three equities that were traded most frequently in the past three months prior to prompting the LLMs. Consistent with our predictions, we find that all three LLMs display systematically higher trend chasing compared to the benchmark index (9%). Active investment allocation risk. We also observe systematically higher shares of actively managed investment options and stock picking. Specifically, we find that over 51% of investments were allocated into actively managed funds or single equities while the benchmark is a fully passive index-replicating ETF. Total expense risk. Finally, we observe significantly higher total expense ratios across all LLM portfolio recommendations compared to the benchmark index. Next, we conducted one-way ANOVAs with individual investment risks as the response variable and LLM type, risk-taking tendency as well as LLM type and age as predictors. Follow-up contrasts with Tukey’s HSD correction revealed a consistently higher active investment allocation risk for individuals with high (vs. low and medium) risk-taking tendencies. ChatGPT and Gemini even increased this risk for those with medium (vs. low) risk-taking tendencies. Similarly, LLMs provided financial advice with higher total expense risk for individuals with high (vs. low and medium) risk-taking tendencies. Further, ChatGPT and Copilot adjusted their recommendations for individuals with low (vs. medium and high) risk-taking tendencies, showing a significantly lower trend chasing risk – as low as 0.67% compared to 38.18% for those with high risk-taking tendencies. Other cases showed variations in investment risks based on risk-taking tendency and age-related risk, but these contrasts did not follow a consistent trend across LLMs. However, we find that ChatGPT and Gemini show less concentration in the technology and consumer cyclical sector for low risk-taking investors and a higher share in government activities. Copilot even concentrates over 46% of funds in government activities (i.e. bond ETFs) for low (vs. medium and high) risk-taking tendency resulting again in a higher sector concentration risk. Taken together, Study 1 provides initial evidence that LLM investment advice induces a significantly enhanced investment portfolio risk across all five types of portfolio risks (geographical cluster risk, sector cluster risk, trend chasing risk, active investment allocation risk, and total expense risk). Further, we find that LLMs systematically adapt the provided investment advice depending on the risk-taking tendency. Financial performance analysis. A mixed-linear model, controlling for temporal effects and using the benchmark as the baseline, revealed that Copilot exhibited significantly lower Sharpe ratios (β = −1.14, p < .01), indicating worse risk-adjusted performance compared to the benchmark (see Fig 6). In contrast, ChatGPT (β = −.28, p = .52) and Gemini (β = −.12, p = .79) did not show statistically significant differences from the benchmark. Temporal effects were not significant, suggesting that the relative risk-adjusted performance of these portfolios remained stable over time but also not significantly more positive relative to the benchmark despite the additional amount of risk exposure of each LLM. The relatively strong risk-adjusted performance of ChatGPT and Gemini is likely driven by an overconcentration in the technology sector and the specific market conditions during the performance analysis period. Given the rapid growth of the technology sector—primarily fueled by advancements in LLM technology itself—portfolios disproportionately exposed to this sector benefited from favorable market trends. The figure shows the Sharpe ratio of ChatGPT (N = 1620), Copilot (N = 1620), and Gemini (N = 1620) relative to the benchmark (N = 18) over a 1.5-year period following the initial data collection. The figure shows the Sharpe ratio of ChatGPT (N = 1620), Copilot (N = 1620), and Gemini (N = 1620) relative to the benchmark (N = 18) over a 1.5-year period following the initial data collection. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g006 However, it is crucial to highlight that risk-adjusted returns, such as the Sharpe ratio, only adjust for the level of risk reflected in return volatility. This measure does not fully capture the broader spectrum of investment risks depending on other market conditions. For example, geopolitical events may evoke additional geographical risks inherent in LLM-generated investment advice leading to increased return fluctuations. Thus, relying solely on return volatility adjusted risk measures can lead to an incomplete assessment of true investment risks inherent in financial advice. Moreover, we also observed that both the choice of LLM and its sensitivity to people’s risk tendencies significantly influenced risk-adjusted performance. Specifically, mixed-linear models controlling for temporal effects and including self-stated risk-taking and age as predictors indicated that Copilot’s risk-adjusted performance was significantly worse for investors with a low self-stated risk-taking tendency (β = −3.13, p < .001), as well as for 30-year-olds (β = −1.57, p < .001) and 50-year-olds (β = −1.12, p = .01) compared to the benchmark. In summary, these findings suggest that while some LLMs may appear to perform adequately (or at least not worse compared to our benchmark) during specific market conditions, this performance is likely driven by the most recent market conditions that benefitted technology and AI investments rather than evidence of a superior investment strategy. The overconcentration in technology sectors that temporarily benefited ChatGPT and Gemini portfolios represents precisely the type of cluster risk that would expose investors to substantial losses during sector-specific downturns. Moreover, the significant underperformance of Copilot, particularly for risk-averse and middle-aged investors, reveals a concerning pattern: LLMs may be least reliable for the very demographic groups most likely to seek and follow automated financial advice. Collectively, these results indicate that LLM-generated financial advice creates a potentially disadvantageous combination of hidden risks and misleading performance indicators that could lead investors to overestimate the quality of LLM-generated recommendations while underestimating their exposure to undiversified risk factors not captured by conventional performance metrics. Language style analysis. Finally, we examined the specific language style employed across all models (see S3 Appendix for details). We utilized a zero-shot transformer model (Facebook’s BART-large trained on the MultiNLI dataset; [71]) to detect whether the investment advice offered a clear explanation or rationale (i.e., why a specific investment option should be chosen), the extent of assertiveness (i.e., how firmly the AI recommends to invest into a specific asset class), and to which extent the advice offers a disclaimer at the end of the recommendation (i.e., stating the potential risks involved with the investment). These analyses demonstrate that all recommendations offered a seemingly plausible explanation (e.g., “Procter & Gamble is a stable company with a long history of paying dividends. Dividend stocks provide regular income and can grow over time.”), with medium to high assertiveness (e.g., “Considering your requirements, here’s a diversified investment portfolio with a breakdown of how much you should allocate to each type of investment:”), and offering a seemingly trustworthy and “caring” disclaimer in the recommendation (e.g., “Remember, these are just recommendations, and it’s crucial to do your own research or consult a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.”). Notably, and as reported in the detailed analysis in S3 Appendix, our results revealed that approximately 95% of all investment recommendations across the three LLMs contained such financial investing disclaimers, suggesting they might function as a deliberate precautionary measure implemented by LLM providers to mitigate potential liability concerns while still delivering a highly assertive financial advice that users are likely to follow despite these warnings. Robustness checks. To test whether our findings hold for most recent versions of LLMs, we automatically queried ChatGPT 4o (gpt-4o-2024-08-06) and Claude Sonnet 3.5 (claude-3–5-sonnet-20241022). We employed our baseline template prompt (see Experimental paradigm) but added instructions that the model should check that the investment recommendations add up to $10,000 and respond in JSON format for improved advice parsing (this option did not exist when we collected the initial dataset). We employed a 2 (LLM: GPT 4o/ Sonnet 3.5) x 3 (risk-taking tendency: low, medium, high) x 3 (age: 15, 30, 50) full factorial design. Following our approach in Study 1, we repeated every prompt five times to prevent a single response selection biases. We retrieved valid responses for all prompts (N = 90). Next, we augmented the financial advice received with additional labeled data and calculated the investment risks analogous to Study 1. Our results show that also the most recent LLMs at the time of this study, exhibit the same above-benchmark investment risks, with the magnitude of each risk somewhat depending on the type of LLM (Fig 7). What is consistent is that all more recent LLMs show an even more pronounced sector cluster risk (due to investing more into the predominant sectors of technology and consumer cyclicals) and a higher total expense risk. We find (A) above benchmark geographical cluster risk (N = 359), (B) sector cluster risk (N = 357), (C) trend chasing risk (N = 360), and (D) active investment risk (N = 270) also for current versions of LLMs. The violin plots and boxplots represent the shape of the distribution of the respective investment risk by LLM. The black dot represents the mean and the colored dots the value of individual portfolios. The dashed line represents the value of the benchmark. We find (A) above benchmark geographical cluster risk (N = 359), (B) sector cluster risk (N = 357), (C) trend chasing risk (N = 360), and (D) active investment risk (N = 270) also for current versions of LLMs. The violin plots and boxplots represent the shape of the distribution of the respective investment risk by LLM. The black dot represents the mean and the colored dots the value of individual portfolios. The dashed line represents the value of the benchmark. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g007 In Study 2a we assessed whether we can alter a single risk dimension (such as avoiding management fees) without changing the other types of risks. We used a two-cell experimental design (control prompt vs. debiasing intervention prompt) with a control prompt identical to Study 1 and a debiasing intervention prompt that explicitly requested no management fees (“I don’t want to pay any management fees.”). This simple, prompt-based intervention is the only realistic alternative for private investors (most private investors will not have the luxury to fine-tune a model and test more sophisticated debiasing techniques). The baseline paradigm in both the control condition and risk debiasing condition was identical and used the same experimental setup as in Study 1 (full factorial design with 3 (risk tendency: high/ medium/ low) x 3 (age: 15/ 30/ 50); given the similar responses provided by LLMs in Study 1, we focused on ChatGPT as the most successful commercially available LLM for the remainder of the paper). A MANOVA with the investment risks (geographical cluster risk, sector cluster risk, trend chasing risk, active investment allocation risk, and total expense risk) as the response and the prompting intervention (control vs. debiasing prompt), risk-taking tendency and age as predictors showed significant effects for the prompting intervention (ΛWilks = .82, F(5, 154) = 6.6, p < .001), risk-taking tendency (ΛWilks = .18, F(10, 308) = 41.68, p < .001), and investor age (ΛWilks = .88, F(5, 154) = 4.31, p < .01). Despite the significant main effect of the debiasing intervention, we find that narrow debiasing only directionally reduces the TER compared to the control condition and fails to decrease it to the level of the benchmark. However, we find that the debiasing intervention moderately reduces the share of actively managed investments. Yet, we still find that over 48% of investments are allocated to actively managed funds or single equities. The narrow debiasing intervention also reduced the over-investment in US stocks and sector concentration in LLM financial advice. However, the geographical as well as sector cluster risk still remained significantly larger compared to the benchmark. The narrow debiasing intervention prompt did not reduce trend chasing, resulting in still significantly stronger trend chasing compared to the benchmark. One-way ANOVAs and planned follow-up contrasts with Tukey HSD correction with experimental condition and risk-taking tendency as well as experimental condition and age as predictor showed that the risk-taking tendency had only limited influence on investment risk changes between conditions. Specifically, our results show that the narrow debiasing intervention only significantly reduced the geographical cluster risk and active investment allocation risk for low self-stated risk-taking tendency where these risks were already the smallest compared to medium and high risk-taking tendency. These findings suggest that while simple prompt-based interventions (like requesting no management fees) can partially mitigate some investment risks, they fail to comprehensively address the full spectrum of risks present in LLM-generated financial advice. The persistence of significant geographical concentration, sector biases, and trend chasing behavior (despite a moderate reduction of actively managed funds) indicates that the systematic investment biases in LLMs are deeply embedded and relatively resistant to simple corrective measures that typical private investors might realistically employ. Financial Performance Analysis. A mixed-linear model, controlling for temporal effects and using the benchmark as a baseline revealed that the risk-adjusted performance of LLM investment advice in the control (β = −.21, p = .19) and debiasing intervention condition (β = −.29, p = .08) were not significantly different relative to the benchmark. Our results show that the risk-adjusted returns improved over time and were significantly lower in the first three months (β08/2023 = −2.3, p = .02; β09/2023 = −3.43, p < .01; β10/2023 = −3.29, p < .01). Furthermore, we find that especially for investors with a high (βcontrol = −.41, p < .01; βdebiased = −.43, p < .01) and low (vs. medium) risk-taking tendency (βcontrol = −.46, p < .01; βdebiased = −.40, p < .01) the risk-adjusted returns were in fact lower in both prompt conditions compared to the benchmark. Again, we also find that the risk-adjusted returns were especially lower in the short-term (β08/2023 = −2.3, p = .01; β09/2023 = −3.43, p < .001; β10/2023 = −3.29, p < .001). Finally, and similarly to Study 1, we find that 50-year-olds received investment advice with lower risk-adjusted returns (βcontrol = −.34, p = .04; βdebiased = −.34, p = .04) compared to the benchmark and that the risk-adjusted returns were especially reduced short-term (β08/2023 = −2.3, p = .02; β09/2023 = −3.43, p < .001; β10/2023 = −3.29, p < .01). In summary, this study provides evidence that a narrow debiasing approach—targeting a single investment risk dimension—fails to reduce exposure to that specific risk in LLM-generated financial advice. Our findings suggest that private investors may only partially mitigate their investment risk exposure through simple prompt-based debiasing interventions. This is important as more advanced debiasing techniques, such as fine-tuning models, are not accessible to most private investors. In Study 2b we assessed to which extent a broader debiasing prompt may reduce the overall financial portfolio risk. Specifying multiple risks in the debiasing prompt, this prompting strategy may reinforce the risk reduction of every single risk alone as such broad debiasing interventions can often lead to effective debiasing of LLMs [74]. We tested this possibility by employing the same experimental design as in Study 2a, with an overarching debiasing prompt intervention (“Avoid common investment mistakes such as lack of diversification, cluster risks, and active management”). A MANOVA with the investment risks as the dependent and the prompting condition (control vs. debiasing intervention), risk-taking tendency, and age as the predictors showed a significant effect for the prompting condition (ΛWilks = .62, F(5, 165) = 20.58, p < .001), risk-taking tendency (ΛWilks = .31, F(10, 330) = 25.84, p < .001), while the effect of age was non-significant (ΛWilks = .93, F(5, 165) = 2.14, p = .06). Follow-up contrasts revealed that this broader debiasing intervention (vs. the narrow debiasing intervention in Study 2a) was largely successful at reducing a range of investment risks (Fig 8). Specifically, we find that the debiasing prompt reduced the over-investment in US assets and sector concentration (while still remaining significantly greater compared to the benchmark however). The amount of assets allocated to US assets was reduced by over 10% but remained at a still high 80% level. Additional contrasts further show that the sector concentration decreased due to a significant 8% and 9% investment allocation decrease in the predominant technology and consumer cyclical sectors. These findings highlight that a more equal distribution across sectors is easier to achieve compared to an equal distribution across financial markets (i.e., arguably due to the strong presence of US-based equities). We find that the debiasing intervention also significantly reduced trend chasing to the extent that it no longer differs significantly from the benchmark. Simultaneously, we find that the debiasing intervention reduces the share of actively managed investment options by over 32%. Finally, the debiasing intervention also significantly decreased the TER by more than.06%. Nevertheless, TER remained notably higher compared to our benchmark. We find (A) above benchmark geographical cluster risk (N = 180), (B) sector cluster risk (N = 180), (D) active investment risk (N = 180), and (C) non-different trend chasing risk (N = 180) when using a broad debiasing intervention. The violin plots and boxplots represent the shape of the distribution of the respective characteristic by condition. The black dot represents the mean and the colored dots the value of individual portfolios. The dashed line represents the value of the benchmark. We find (A) above benchmark geographical cluster risk (N = 180), (B) sector cluster risk (N = 180), (D) active investment risk (N = 180), and (C) non-different trend chasing risk (N = 180) when using a broad debiasing intervention.

The dashed line represents the value of the benchmark. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g008 One-way ANOVAs and planned follow-up contrasts with Tukey HSD correction with the prompting condition, risk-taking tendency and age as predictors revealed that the debiasing intervention was more effective for investors with a medium and high risk-taking tendency. We find that the debiasing intervention significantly decreased the sector cluster risk, trend chasing risk, and active investment allocation risk especially for investors with medium and high risk-taking tendency. Additionally, the debiasing intervention also decreased the total expense risk for high risk-taking tendency and the sector cluster risk, trend chasing risk, and active investment allocation risk across all age levels. The collective insight is that broader debiasing interventions explicitly targeting multiple investment risks simultaneously can significantly reduce portfolio risks across most dimensions and age groups, although the geographic concentration remains somewhat elevated above benchmark levels. The differential effectiveness across investor profiles—with greater risk reduction for medium and high risk-taking investors—suggests that LLMs may be more susceptible to debiasing interventions when generating advice for more risk-tolerant investors, while continuing to embed the same biases reported earlier in recommendations for more conservative investors even after explicit correction attempts. Financial Performance Analysis. Analogous to Study 2a, we performed multiple mixed-linear regression models. Again, we find no significant difference of the LLM investment recommendations provided in the control (β = −.25, p = .11) and the debiased condition (β = −.29, p = .06) relative to the benchmark in terms of risk-adjusted returns. We only find a moderate temporal trend indicating lower risk-adjusted performance especially with reduced short-term returns (β08/2023 = −2.26, p = .02; β09/2023 = −3.46, p < .001; β10/2023 = −3.43, p < .001). We find that the risk-adjusted returns are worse for high (β = −.40, p < .01) and low risk-taking tendency (β = −.48 p < .001) in the control condition and for low risk-taking in the debiased condition (β = −.37 p = .01). Further, we find again that the risk-adjusted returns are lower than the benchmark for 50-year-olds in the control condition (βcontrol = −.34, p = .03) and for 30-year-olds in the debiased condition (βdebiased = −.37, p = .02). Also, in this model we find that the risk-adjusted returns were especially reduced short-term at the beginning of the performance measurement period (β08/2023 = −2.26, p = .01; β09/2023 = −3.46, p < .001; β10/2023 = −3.43, p < .001). Thus, despite the successful risk reduction through broader debiasing interventions, both control and debiased LLM-generated portfolios still failed to outperform the benchmark on risk-adjusted returns. These results suggest that even when successful at mitigating specific portfolio risks, debiasing interventions do not translate into improved risk-adjusted performance, indicating that LLM-generated financial advice continues to carry inefficiencies that cannot be fully addressed through prompt engineering alone. In Study 3 we tested whether incorporating an explicit investment goal in the prompt further aids in mitigating specific investment risks in LLMs investment advice. The study directly tests the ability of LLMs to adapt their investment advice based on contextual information and to personalize the investment advice to specific investor needs. Instead of directly asking the LLM to reduce the investment risks of a portfolio, a private investor may prompt a specific investment goal that would in turn translate into a decrease of specific investment risks merely based on the contextual information provided. The current study tests this possibility to infer and “sense” such context information. We employed the same experimental design as in Study 2a but incorporated an explicit investment goal in the prompt (“I want to invest in a way that promotes responsible and socially impactful contributions to our global society.”). We anticipated that this goal would lead LLMs to offer financial advice with reduced geographical and sector concentration risks. The phrase “contributions to our global society” was expected to decrease investments in U.S. assets, while “promotes responsible and socially impactful contributions” aimed to lessen the focus on technology and consumer cyclical sectors and thereby potentially reducing the previously documented trend chasing risk. We also expected that incorporating such a goal would result in investment recommendations with higher ESG scores [75]. A MANOVA with the investment risks as response and the prompt condition (control vs. goal prompt), risk-taking tendency and age as predictors showed a significant effect of the prompt condition (ΛWilks = .30, F(5, 161) = 74.31, p < .001), risk-taking tendency (ΛWilks = .51, F(10, 322) = 12.67, p < .001), while showing only a marginal effect of age (ΛWilks = .94, F(5, 161) = 2.20, p = .06). Follow-up contrasts revealed that investment risks showed a significant decrease in over-investments in US Stocks in the investment goal prompt compared to control, yet higher than our benchmark. However, we find that the introduction of a socially responsible investment goal did not lead to a significant decrease in sector concentration compared to the control prompt and remains still significantly higher than the benchmark index. As shown in Fig 9:A, not only remains this sector concentration very high, but is also substantially overleveraged towards utilities, due to shifting investments towards the energy sector (i.e., “green” energy). Next, we further examined the ESG score in the intervention (vs. control) condition. As summarized in Fig 9: B, specific investment goals were not effective in increasing the portfolio ESG rating of the portfolio. Specifically, we find that there is no significant portfolio ESG rating difference when incorporating a social responsibility goal prompt compared to the control prompt or benchmark. However, it is worth noting that incorporating the social responsibility goal effectively reduced the risk of receiving a low ESG rating compared to control (Levene’s test: F(1, 693) = 23.83, p < .001). We also observe a significant decrease in trend chasing behavior in the LLM investment advice when incorporating a social responsibility investment goal. Adding the social responsibility investment goal however, increased the actively managed portfolio share by over 29% compared to the control condition. Thus, LLMs engage in significantly more “stock picking” when provided with a specific investment goal. Finally, we observe significantly higher total expense ratios when incorporating a social responsibility goal compared to our control condition and benchmark.

In contrast, trend chasing risk decreased for those with medium and high risk-taking tendencies under the same condition. Further, the ESG score only increased for high risk-taking tendency when including the socially responsible investment goal where the ESG score was significantly lower (vs. medium and high self-stated risk-taking tendency) in the control condition. The geographical cluster risk decreased only for 50-year-olds. All other contrasts did not yield any meaningful patterns. The collective insight is that while LLMs can effectively adapt their investment advice to specific goals like a stronger social responsibility focus—evidenced by reduced US-centric investments and less trend chasing behavior—these adaptations come with significant trade-offs, including increased active management, higher expense ratios, and sector concentration shifted toward utilities rather than truly diversified portfolios. The inconsistent effectiveness across investor profiles further suggests that LLMs struggle to simultaneously optimize for both specific investment goals and fundamental portfolio construction principles, creating potentially new risk patterns when attempting to accommodate more personalized investing objectives. Financial Performance Analysis. As in the preceding studies, we conducted a series of mixed-linear models to analyze portfolio performance. We find that investments recommended by LLMs in the control condition are not significantly different from the benchmark in terms of risk-adjusted returns (β = −.25, p = .15). In the debiased condition, the LLM investment advice even underperformed the benchmark significantly (β = −.76, p < .001). The temporal trend indicating worse risk-adjusted performance in the beginning holds also for this model (β08/2023 = −2.62, p = .01; β09/2023 = −3.76, p < .001; β10/2023 = −3.78, p < .001; β10/2023 = −2.20, p = .04). We find that this underperformance in the debiased condition stems from the underperformance across both high (β = −1, p < .001) and medium risk-taking tendency investors (β = −1.02, p < .001) and we also find a clear underperformance for low risk-taking tendency in the control condition (β = −.48, p < .01). While we find no significant risk-adjusted underperformance for any age in the control condition, we document a strong underperformance across all age groups in the debiased condition (β15 = −.70, p < .001; β30 = −.75, p < .001; β50 = −.85, p < .001). Thus, we find overall that the introduction of socially responsible investment goals in LLM-generated advice led to significant underperformance compared to the benchmark, highlighting that when LLMs attempt to optimize for specific social impact objectives, they tend to sacrifice financial performance even more severely and lead to new, unwanted concentration issues (i.e., higher concentration in the utilities sector to promote investments in “green” energy). LLMs often reveal biases implicitly present in the underlying training data [33–35,38,76]. Our findings suggest that these biases can result in LLM-generated financial advice that leads to elevated investment risks for private investors across five major risk dimensions (geographical cluster risk, sector cluster risk, trend chasing risk, active investment allocation risk, and total expense risk) and that a range of debiasing interventions only partially mitigated these risks. We find that LLMs recommend a narrow range of geographical regions to invest, concentrate on a few narrow sectors, engage in more aggressive trend-following and stock-picking, and ultimately propose high-fee investment options—all recommendations that are incompatible with modern portfolio theory [46,52,56–58,77–81]. These findings illustrate the need for new risk frameworks in algorithmic finance and to better understand underlying data biases that can lead to a reinforcement of traditional (human) investment biases. The findings of this research document the inherent risks for private investors who already started to employ LLMs to receive financial advice [15], and we hope that the current findings promote a more critical assessment of the advice they receive. However, it is noteworthy to highlight that a critical assessment becomes more difficult when LLM-generated investment advice is communicated very convincingly (see S3 Appendix for details). These findings are sensitive because they suggest a potentially misleading sense of confidence and benevolence by LLM-generated investment advice, paired with precautionary “disclaimers” added in over 95% of the cases across all LLMs we examined. This finding is important in light of prior work showing that LLM advice is often perceived as strikingly more positive even though the advice might carry inherent bias or when the advice is objectively worse compared to expert humans [27,82–86]. The ability to blindly follow harmful LLM-generated investment recommendations presents a significant risk for individual investors, particularly those lacking potentially financial literacy or access to professional financial advisors. Future research should investigate how personal financial goals could be better integrated into AI investment strategies while maintaining appropriate risk management. A fruitful direction for future work is also to further examine whether financial education (potentially even through the use of LLMs) can ultimately empower private investors to critically assess such LLM-generated investment recommendations. Future regulatory research may also focus on developing frameworks to protect consumers from the potential risks of such generative investment advice. This includes exploring effective monitoring mechanisms to prevent more large-scale, systemic risks across financial markets and establishing reporting requirements for firms that utilize generative investment advisory tools. As LLMs become more integrated into financial advisory services, regulators may need to establish clear guidelines for transparency, explainability, and accountability in such AI-driven financial advice, especially when used by private investors. For FinTech developers, our research highlights the importance of addressing inherent biases in LLM-generated financial advice and how to develop future systems that better align with modern portfolio theory principles and avoid reinforcing harmful investment biases documented in the current research. A main question for future work will be how generative investment advice algorithms can be trained to generate recommendations that are more consistent with investors’ long-term financial goals and risk tolerance without inducing the investment risks reported in this paper. As with any research, we also highlight at least two limitations of the current work. First, we evaluated LLMs at specific points in time, and these models continue to evolve very rapidly. While our robustness checks with the most recent models (as per January 2025) seem to be robust (see Robustness Checks at the end of Study 1), future generations of models might improve radically once foundation models might be explicitly debiased during the training stage. Second, our simulated investment portfolios were evaluated over a specific time-period that coincided with a strong technology sector performance. However, we believe that exactly due to these favorable market conditions for technology-heavy portfolios, our financial performance analysis reported in this paper represent a conservative estimate of the potential risks of LLM-based financial advice. In market environments where technology sectors underperform, the geographical and sector concentration risks we identified would likely lead to even worse investment outcomes, further amplifying the risk exposure of portfolios generated by LLMs. In conclusion, the current work demonstrates that LLM-generated investment advice systematically increases portfolio risks across multiple dimensions, potentially exposing private investors to unwanted investment risks while creating a false sense of confidence through convincing language and reassuring disclaimers. These findings underscore the need for more cross-disciplinary collaboration among investors (both private and institutional investors), regulators, FinTech innovators, financial institutions, and researchers to develop more robust frameworks for evaluating and improving AI-generated financial advice. We hope the current research promotes such collaborations to proactively transform the financial advisory landscape to truly serve the interests of private investors through properly diversified, low-cost, and personalized financial advice. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.s001 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.s002 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.s003 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.s004 (DOCX) We thank the reviewers for their thoughtful feedback and constructive suggestions that significantly improved this manuscript.

People experiencing homelessness (PEH) face complex health and social care needs, contributing to poor health outcomes and premature mortality. The Pharmacy Homeless Outreach Engagement Non-medical Independent prescribing Rx (PHOENIx) intervention was developed to address these challenges through assertive outreach by NHS pharmacist independent prescribers working with third sector homelessness charity workers for PEH presenting to community pharmacy. This qualitative study aims to explore participant, healthcare professional, and stakeholder perceptions of the PHOENIx intervention and acceptability of trial procedures. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with trial participants, internal stakeholders (healthcare professionals/researchers), and external stakeholders (national and local) across two intervention sites (Glasgow and Birmingham) between March 2023 and February 2024. Data was analysed thematically using Normalisation Process Theory (NPT) as a conceptual framework. Participants (n = 26; usual care n = 7; intervention n = 19) viewed PHOENIx as distinctively comprehensive, consistent, and caring, valuing its holistic approach and the trusting relationships developed with the team. Stakeholders (n = 16; internal n = 5; external n = 11) recognised PHOENIx’s potential to fill gaps in current service provision for PEH, appreciating its flexible, outreach-based model. Challenges identified included resource constraints, integration with existing services, and concerns about long-term sustainability. The PHOENIx intervention shows promise in providing accessible, comprehensive healthcare which was acceptable to PEH. Its success in engaging this underserved population offers valuable lessons for service development. However, addressing challenges around resources, scalability, and sustainability will be important considerations for a future trial and wider implementation and expansion.

Homelessness remains a significant and growing public health concern globally, with an estimated 895,000 people experiencing homelessness in Europe [1]. In Scotland, homeless applications increased from 35,759–39,006 in the year 2022–2023, representing a 9% increase [2]. Similarly, the rates of rough sleeping have also increased across other parts of the UK. In England there has been a 27% increase in rough sleeping in the year 2022–2023, as indicated by the most recent ‘snapshot’ [3]. People experiencing homelessness (PEH) face complex health and social care needs, contributing to premature mortality [4]. The average age of death for PEH is 45 years old, compared to 76 years in the general population [5]. Multiple factors contribute to this health inequality, including higher rates of physical and mental health conditions including substance use disorders, and barriers to accessing healthcare services [6,7]. PEH frequently experience multimorbidity, with a high prevalence of concurrent physical and mental health conditions [8]. Over 70% of PEH have underlying problem street-drug use [9]. Drug-related deaths among this population are particularly concerning, with a third of all deaths of PEH being street-drug-related [10]. Despite many receiving care from alcohol and drug recovery services, including daily prescribed opiate replacement therapy, there continues to be a high rate of overdoses experienced within the population [11]. Access to healthcare remains challenging for PEH due to stigma, discrimination, complex health systems that are difficult to navigate [12,13] and bureaucratic barriers [14,15]. As a result, unmet health needs are common [16,17]. Mental illness, pain, and substance dependency may be poorly managed [18], with evidence suggesting under-prescribing [11] and low rates of prescription adherence [19,20]. Patterns of emergency healthcare utilisation differ between PEH and those who are housed, with PEH facing higher rates of emergency room visits, hospitalisations, and readmissions [21,22]. Reasons for these visits also differ, with PEH more likely to present for drug, alcohol, and mental health-related problems, often in need of acute and crisis care [21,22,23,24]. While the availability and uptake of preventative healthcare is lower among PEH [14,21,25], presentations to primary care tend to be reactive [26]. It is estimated that one-third of homeless deaths are preventable through timely and effective use of health services [27]. However, there is a lack of robustly evaluated person-centred, integrated, community-based effective and cost- effective complex interventions for PEH [28]. In response to these challenges, innovative approaches are needed to address the intersecting issues of homelessness and problem drug use [29]. The PHOENIx (Pharmacist led Homeless Outreach Engagement Non-medical Independent prescribing Rx) intervention was first developed as a novel, low-threshold service offered to PEH in Glasgow, Scotland [30–33], which was reported to be well received by PEH [34]. This complex health and social care intervention aimed to address the multiple unmet needs of PEH through weekly assertive outreach by National Health Service (NHS) pharmacist independent prescribers working in collaboration with third sector homelessness charity workers. The PHOENIx intervention provided intensive and holistic health and social care support with persistent follow-up. Participants are visited via outreach and seen by PHOENIx workers (a pharmacist and third sector worker) at least once per week, with priorities set by the PEH and addressed gradually in succession. The intervention offered immediate health care and assessment, medication prescribing, and practical support such as advocacy, assistance with benefits applications, and provision of general wellbeing support [35]. Previous qualitative research based on the evaluation of the PHOENIx model of care in other settings has indicated that PHOENIx may improve health outcomes for PEH. Initial quantitative studies from previous evaluation of the PHOENIx model [11,36,37] have also highlighted the potential positive impact of the intervention on health-related quality of life [9], treatment burden, and delaying time to hospitalisation. However, there is a need for rigorous evaluation of whether the PHOENIx intervention can be delivered and how it is received, in other settings, e.g., community pharmacies and beyond Glasgow, in order to address the public health crisis of drug-related deaths and improve health outcomes for PEH. This study aims to explore participant, healthcare professional, researcher and stakeholder perceptions of the PHOENIx intervention and acceptability of trial procedures related to the PHOENIx Community Pharmacy model in Glasgow (Scotland) and Birmingham (England), UK. By examining the experiences and perspectives of those involved in the intervention, we seek to inform future developments and potential scale-up of this complex intervention to address the major health inequalities faced by PEH in the community pharmacy setting. The study used a qualitative design, involving semi-structured interviews with PHOENIx trial patient participants, healthcare professionals (HCPs) and researchers involved in the intervention and key stakeholders, including HCPs and third sector workers. Interviews were conducted across the two trial sites (Glasgow and Birmingham) between March 2023 and February 2024. Eligible participants were those who participated in the PHOENIx trial (both intervention and control arm participants) or played a role in the implementation of the intervention. Key stakeholders included those with an interest in the care/ service provision of PEH. Stakeholders were identified using a combination of professional networks, and snowball sampling. Ethical approval (REC reference 22/EM/0119; IRAS project ID: 309760) and Health Research Authority approval were obtained before recruitment and participants in the trial and qualitative process evaluation elements provided written informed consent before participation. All participants of the PHOENIx intervention, including those in the usual care group, were eligible to participate in interviews. Those eligible were approached by intervention workers to ascertain interest in participation. Those who expressed interest in taking part in interviews were supported by intervention staff and researchers to arrange a convenient time and date to conduct the interview. Interviews with intervention participants were conducted face-to-face, within community hubs that provide services to PEH at both trial sites. Those who expressed interest in participating were provided with an invitation pack containing a participant information sheet and consent form. At the time of interview, participants were given the opportunity to ask questions before providing written informed consent. Where needed, addition support was provided to potential participants to complete consent procedures, including the reading of the participant information sheet. Interviews with trial participants were around 60- minutes in duration (including consent procedures) and were audio-recorded. All interviews were transcribed verbatim, providing the data for qualitative analysis. Trial participants were given a £20 shopping voucher as a thank you for their time. Those involved in the delivery of the PHOENIx intervention (intervention staff and researchers) and key external stakeholders were invited to participate in interviews on a voluntary basis. External stakeholders were identified using professional networks and ‘snowball’ sampling. Those who expressed an interest in taking part were contacted by email and provided with an invitation pack that included a participant information sheet and a copy of the consent form. Once agreement had been made, interviews were arranged at a convenient day and time for the interviewee. Interviews were conducted either face to face, or via online video platforms, whichever was most convenient for the participants. At the time of interview participants were given the opportunity to ask questions before providing written informed consent. Those interviewed remotely via a video platform were required to sign and email the consent form to the researcher. In addition, verbal consent was taken and recorded at the start of the interview. Interviews with staff delivering the PHOENIx intervention and researchers were between 30–60 minutes in duration and were audio recorded. A topic guide was used to structure the interviews. The topic guide, informed by Normalisation Process Theory (NPT), explored several aspects including overall perception of the PHOENIx intervention, engagement with the intervention team, perceived impacts of the intervention and the acceptability of the trial procedures. NPT is a sociological theory that describes four mechanisms that can be used to explain and evaluate the adoption and implementation of complex interventions or service innovations [36]. The topic guides for interviews with the PHOENIx team and other key stakeholders also included discussion topics such as the main challenges to achieving optimal health care and support for PEH and the barriers and facilitators of the intervention, which were not included in intervention participant interviews. Data were analysed thematically with NPT used as an underpinning conceptual lens. The four constructs include: “coherence” (sense-making work); “cognitive participation” (relationship work); “collective action” (enacting work); and “reflexive monitoring” (appraisal work) [36]. These mechanisms were used to guide and structure conceptualisation of the analysis. Transcripts were analysed thematically after initial familiarisation. Thematic analysis is a method for identifying, analysing, and reporting recurring patterns within data [38]. A two-step method of analyses was used, with the data initially analysed with the aim of identifying recurring themes, and then subsequently analysed using the NPT framework. This qualitative method of analysis allows for the use of both inductive (bottom-up) and deductive (top-down) approaches. This ‘bottom up’ approach allowed for greater initial exploration of the data, free from the constraints of a theoretical model. This methodology was considered to be appropriate in order to truly recognise themes that the theory might not capture [38]. An initial coding framework was developed after becoming familiar with the data. All transcripts were double-coded by HS, SM, KW and YC to ensure the robustness of the data interpretation and coding, with any queries or discrepancies discussed and resolved by the coding team. Following the double coding of all transcripts a summary report was produced, and themes generated mapped to the mechanisms described in the NPT framework. Our findings are presented under four key themes and components of the NPT framework:1) coherence; 2) cognitive participation; 3) collective action; and 4) reflexive monitoring. These themes are described for both intervention participants and stakeholders, and illustrative quotations are provided in the following section. Participants consistently distinguished the PHOENIx intervention from their usual care experiences. They highlighted the comprehensive and personalised nature of the service, which contrasted sharply with their previous encounters with health and social care services. “Trying to find a way to move on from here, housing, medication, understanding your situation because everyone’s unique. Most support workers, especially on this building, a support session to them is like:””Is your housing benefit still active? Great.” You know what I mean? The Phoenix programme, they’re actually trying to help find out a way to move forward: ”Do you have bank accounts? Do you have ID? Do you have a housing option?” You speak to the support workers here and it’s just like:”Have you paid your service charge? Okay, fuck off, you know.” (IB05, Intervention participant) “Yeah, kind of. Not lost in the system, just overlooked. Overlooked is… There’s more important things to do. I think that’s the way it feels like sometimes.” (CB15, Usual care participant). Many participants expressed frustration with their previous care, particularly in relation to addiction and mental health services. They felt that PHOENIx offered a more holistic and responsive approach. “No because they’re just, it’s like they’re just there to hand in my script. They [addictions team] do ask me: “How you feeling?” but most of the time I’m just in and back out.” (IG011, Intervention participant) “So I made an appointment for that, and I didn’t go to that appointment, but they sent me another appointment out. […]And that’s another reason why I have to see a doctor, because I’ve been discharged from the mental health team, because I haven’t been good at keeping appointments with them either.” (IB6, Intervention participant) Participants valued the consistent and reliable nature of the PHOENIx intervention. The regular contact and follow-up were seen as crucial elements that distinguished this service from others they had experienced. This consistency helped to build trust and rapport between participants and the PHOENIx team, facilitating deeper engagement with the intervention. “It’s difficult to walk in and ask and saying what I need, because I’m used to doing everything myself but I wasn’t doing it because I was so down. Once I knew how they were and that and they weren’t judging, it was easy. They made it pleasurable. They made a good thing out of a bad situation.” (IB1, Intervention participant) “Well, building up a relationship, I’m getting to know them better and knowing that they are proper guys [PHOENIx team] that want to help you and not just, like, guys that are reading out of books and don’t know nothing and they’re trying but they’ve not got the heart in it, if you know what I mean?” (IG6, Intervention participant) It was recognised by some intervention participants that the consistency of the support worker role was a challenge to the delivery of the intervention. This highlighted the need for consistency in this role. “I want to continue with them, to be fair. I get a fair bit of help. It’s obviously just unfortunate that my support worker has gone ill for the last two weeks, but I’ve been emailed about that. Obviously he’s got some issues. I don’t know if there’s another support worker that steps in in the meanwhile.” (IB5, Intervention participant) Participants recognised and appreciated both the practical and emotional support provided by the PHOENIx team. They noted how the intervention addressed not only their immediate health needs but also broader social and emotional concerns. “Well, I spoke to the doctors I’m scared to go to the doctors, so whereas like, [support worker] absolutely amazing, comes and picks me up and took me to the doctors and stuff. I wouldn’t have gone on my own so this project is absolutely amazing, it’s getting me back on my feet and I wouldn’t have even gone to the doctors. It’s not because I can’t go but I’m scared to go, you know when you’re scared of the doctors you get a family member will drag…you know what it’s like. I haven’t got no one like that, so with this support project it gets me back on my feet, it just helps me…puts me in touch with my support services and just does what a family would do, because I haven’t got a family like that. “(IB7, Intervention participant) The combination of practical support and emotional care provided by the PHOENIx team was crucial in sustaining participants’ engagement with the intervention. Participants felt that the team’s holistic approach addressed their complex needs in a way that encouraged ongoing participation. Trust and non-judgemental relationships were important to participants, with some participants feeling motivated by the trusting relationship with the PHOENIx team. “It’s been amazing, to be honest, it’s been amazing. I’ve never had help like this and I’ve needed it for a long time and I’ve never had this help. Not only has he become my pharmacist, he’s become a friend. We really have become friends and it’s really good now. Someone to speak to you when I need to, you know what I mean? He’s sorted out a lot of things for me as well, health-wise. I’m always in fights, and so if I get injured, I can go and see him and he looks after me. Do you know what I mean?” (IB3, Intervention participant). Participants described a wide range of practical support provided by the PHOENIx team, including help with medication management, assistance with benefits applications, and support in accessing other services. “Oh, no, it was easy with [pharmacist]. Just when I was explaining to him, and I think my doctor keeps putting me on the Salbutamol, the Symbicort and Becotide and [pharmacist] put me on, I’m only on one steroid, kind of thing.[…] And it’s because they want me to sit and take them out of all the boxes and sit and take two puffs and then, shut one box and open another box. It’s just a matter of taking it out the one box, taking two puffs and that, yes, a great difference.” (IG3, Intervention participant) “I’m getting somewhere now, I’m getting help with my benefits, I’m getting help with my housing, my prescriptions. And it’s all thanks to going to the right sources, like the Phoenix team, for instance.” (IG6, Intervention participant) Alongside this practical support, participants emphasised the emotional work undertaken by the team. This included providing a listening ear, offering encouragement, and helping to build participants’ confidence and self-esteem. Participants noted how this combination of practical and emotional support enabled them to engage more effectively with their care and make positive changes in their lives. “I would say they’ve covered a lot with me, like my drink, my mental health, how I’m feeling this day, what am I eating, about my day. So they’ve covered a range of topics that no other people, even, like, my drugs worker has asked me, like what I’m eating and when I’m eating, am I eating regularly, like that.” (IG11, Intervention participant) Some participants expressed frustration that the PHOENIx team sometimes seemed limited in their ability to effect certain changes, particularly in areas like housing or specialist mental health support. Often, this lack of power is a result of the rules of other health and social care services, or long waiting times to access services. This perceived lack of power in certain areas led some participants to suggest that the team should be given more authority or resources to address complex needs. “Aye. Well, I trusted their knowledge, but their knowledge didn’t go any further than that. And I mean they’ve not got the powers to do anything. They can give me knowledge, but the knowledge that I then pass on to the ones that have got the power are just…” (IG2, Intervention participant) “I’m still waiting on an appointment to meet an alcohol worker. See, they’ve actually been in contact with me before, but unbeknown to me, I’ve either been on the drink or, I’m very forgetful as well, like, you know? So I’ve either not remembered receiving the letter, and [support worker] has been in contact with them to say, look, they guy’s still looking for a bit of support. But I’m still waiting to hear from them, like, you know, that’s the [alcohol service].” (IG7, Intervention participant) Participants consistently highlighted the importance of ongoing, long-term support. Many expressed concerns about what would happen when the intervention ended, indicating the value they placed on the continuous care provided by PHOENIx. “Yeah, 100 per cent. I’ll be sad if it stops, because who have I got to go to then? And I’ll just go back to square one again.” (IB3, Intervention participant) This emphasis on long-term support reflects the complex and chronic nature of many participants’ health and social issues, and their recognition of the need for sustained intervention. Usual care participants highlighted the reactive and inflexible nature of services which do not meet their needs. “Because there isn’t a lot of places, they always say:”Yes, have you been there?” but see when you go, they’re either shut or there’s nobody there or you need to come back another day. There’s never somewhere where you can just do a pick up. I’ve only been told: ”Right, yes, come up,” or you can just walk in and it’s there for you. It’s always…because you can’t have a breakdown at the correct time. Do you know what I’m talking about? If you need help, you can’t make sure it’s between nine and two or, do you know what I mean? It’s just, when you need help, you need help.” (CG13, Control participant) Intervention participants discussed the acceptability of the procedures of the intervention and trial. Overall, participants were supportive of the frequency and intensity of appointments with the PHOENIx team. “I didn’t think the Phoenix was going to help but I signed up to it, but I just thought it was just another one of the survey things. They’re going to promise you the world and do nothing. They did as much as they have said.” (IB5, Intervention participant) However, there were challenges around the consistency of support from the support worker at one site as a result of recruitment and retention issues. For example, support workers moving on to other roles had an impact on the perceived consistency of support received. Intervention participants indicated that the study questionnaire was too long in length and duration to complete, with some indicating that they did not believe the questions to be relevant and potentially stigmatising. A perceived lack of concentration and capability to answer some of the questions made the questionnaire challenging for some. Some indicated that the questionnaire was a perceived barrier to taking part in the study, while a significant number of participants did not remember having completed the study questionnaire. “I can’t really remember it to be honest but I ended up… It was a 20 minute thing and I ended up spending two hours.” (IB2, Intervention participant) “There were a few questions and I was like:”Forget that, let’s go onto the…” yeah, you don’t need to know that kind of thing, because why would you need to know certain things? It’s got nothing to do with why I’m really here them questions I see as judgement. Someone else is going to look at this sheet of paper and see certain questions that are nothing to do with me but I’m going to be judged on these certain questions because of the answers.” (IB3, Intervention participant) Stakeholders demonstrated a clear understanding of the various roles within the PHOENIx team and how these roles complemented each other to provide comprehensive care. “I think that’s good and I think it would get you so far. I mean, having a well-trained nurse practitioner, a pharmacist and a social worker, you would cover a lot of ground if those people were available to the person all the time. Obviously depending on how they all get on and everything. But those people working as like a mini- multidisciplinary team I think is a good idea.” (BS11, External Stakeholder) “Well, for me, it just seems like a really great way of doing things. Because from my perspective anyway, I [pharmacist] like to look at all the health stuff, and, yes, we…so, [support worker] is focused on the social things and the housing, but also, there’s a bit of a grey area as well, this aspect of, social stuff can really solve mental health issues, or at least improve the whole kind of thing. So, we both work on both sides of it, if you see what I mean. And there’s no real, I suppose…we just try and help people, whatever way is going to work.” (GS21, Internal Stakeholder) Stakeholders generally held positive views of the intervention, recognising its potential to address gaps in current service provision for PEH. Providing anticipatory care was one such gap that was discussed. “I think it’s a really interesting project and it…from my experience with other homeless projects, it does bridge a gap that I could see and that I’ve seen acutely, where people, you cannot get them to the…you might be supporting them with their housing, but you cannot get them to the GP, or to A&E, or to any healthcare professional, for love nor money. And having someone that can…an actual floating prescriber is a game changer, really, for these people’s health. And that…having that longer appointment time, and that sticky support, where they don’t get cut off just because they haven’t attended something, it’s so vital, because we’ve got…the odds are stacked up against homeless people, so much that they need all the help that we can offer. And we’ve got these pharmacists all across the country that could do this. So, I’d like to see the project grow, definitely, and I’d like to be part of it.” (BS9, Internal stakeholder) “I think that we know there is a gap...well, sorry, I believe there is a gap around wound care for people in the city centre particularly, probably the whole of the city, that are not engaged in community services for whatever reason. That is potentially something that PHOENIx could support with. We know that there is ongoing, as there always has been, the issues into...pathways into mental health support are always more difficult. We have got decent processes on paper, but when you speak to service users then they don’t reflect those processes. There is ongoing things like that that we are aware of and trying to do something about.” (GS23, External stakeholder) Stakeholders acknowledged the complex challenges involved in providing care to PEH and saw PHOENIx as a potential solution to some of these issues. Some challenges highlighted by stakeholders was increased complexity and demand on services, lack of opportunity to engage with PEH, competing priorities of PEH and complex navigation of services. “We have a really good system of care in the city. Alcohol and drug recovery services are really responsive. They hold a huge caseload, but the level of complexity and the level of demand is just always increasing. It is a really transient population in the city because it attracts people in from all over the country.” (GS23, External stakeholder). “So I think the main challenges are that people experiencing homelessness have lots of competing priorities, so they’re not always able to prioritise their health. There’s complications with their previous experience of using health services which are often very negative. They’re used to being turned away from places, told that this isn’t the right place for you, told you should be down the road, told you should have come before, you shouldn’t come now, you should come later, all of those things. They’re not really made to feel welcome in healthcare settings. I think that starts when people are young and they’re not confident, they’re often on their own, they often don’t have support. That’s the other thing, so they need support to navigate the health system. Usually we have that from friends, family, other people who will help us, but often people experiencing homelessness don’t have that. Having support is very important and that can make a big difference.” (BS11, External stakeholder) Stakeholders outside the immediate PHOENIx team generally viewed the intervention positively, recognising the team’s expertise and dedication. They appreciated the multidisciplinary nature of the team, the connection with the local community and viewed the team as highly skilled. “My knowledge of it is that it was a really great team and delivered a really good service and was incredibly responsive. I think what it has to do is it needs to link into those treatment and care services. It can’t just sit on its own, it can’t just be its own thing. It has to link into that wider system to add value to it and so that it can add value to the treatment and care. I think if that was to happen it would be really, really great.” (G23, External stakeholder) “Again, it is probably like that where we are looking at the health needs through addictions. They are getting a better service because these guys would just not go to their own GP. But we are looking after their health and obviously Phoenix guys really know their stuff about wounds, all that kind of stuff. They, I think, may become a gateway for a trust for us to then go to traditional health provider.” (GS19, External stakeholder) Internal stakeholders noted strong working relationships within the PHOENIx team, highlighting the importance of this collaboration for effective service delivery. “Well, it’s my job so aye, I love coming into my work, I love doing what I do and working with people who care, you know? So there’s not a day…but I mean, we have some tough days in here, don’t get me wrong, you know, we have some tough days. Aye. But there’s good days as well, and no matter how tough a day, we can always make it better the next day. And working with people that are all aligned and on the same page, want to do the same thing, it’s great. Aye.” (GS22, Internal stakeholder) Stakeholders observed positive relationships developing between the PHOENIx team and participants, recognising this as a key factor in the intervention’s success. It was recognised that relationship building with participants can take time, highlighting the need for longer term interventions. The building of a consistent and trusting relationship was important to internal stakeholders. “I think that could do wonders really, because a lot of it is building the rapport and the relationship with somebody, getting that trust, you know, and if they know where to go they can support them. And you know, that trust is there, it’s someone else that they could contact if they needed to.” (BS14, External stakeholder) “And that’s the sort of service they needed. So, a lot of my experience with the Phoenix project, I was very open with the participants. I spoke to them very, like, was streetwise, sort of, speaking. I spoke to them like they were people. I wasn’t, sort of, putting barriers up, I spoke to them like…you know, we had very open discussions. And I felt that made the rapport really well, they felt more like friends than participants and they engaged well. And that was my main aim.” (BS11, Internal stakeholder) Stakeholders identified numerous challenges in providing care to PEH, including data sharing between services, issues of engagement, continuity of care, and addressing complex, interconnected needs. “Obviously we talk about things like data protection, those kinds of things all become a barrier because the sharing of information, because we struggle there all the time. As you can imagine, we’ve got relationships with the police, got relationships with enforcement teams in the city, and we’ve got relationships with the community mental health team, with the healthcare services and just the data sharing barrier is a constant thing that comes forward, so that’s one barrier.” (BS10, External stakeholder) “I think obviously probably one of the biggest challenges is the fact that the access to care for people who are homeless is difficult. I think we’ve got to talk about it in the context of NHS care at the moment, access is difficult for everybody. Just insofar as demands are very high, there isn’t enough capacity for people. So if we’re thinking about GP practices, at the moment to get an appointment there’s a scramble at eight o’clock in the morning. You’ve got to be up, you’ve got to be on the phone, you’ve got to get through, there’s a limited number of appointments to do it. So that very much relies on the fact that you’ve got a phone, it’s working, you’re awake, blah, blah, blah.” (BS14, External stakeholder) “I mean the first bit of what I say relates to what I’ve just said. I mean the health system’s very rigid in lots of respects and it’s not designed to deal with people who are facing homelessness or related issues. Most of the health service just isn’t set up to cope with those people. As I said, how appointments are structured etcetera. So I think standard healthcare for most people who are homeless, isn’t going to work for them the way it’s set up at the moment. So I think actually we’ve got little opportunities.” (BS14, External stakeholder) While generally positive, stakeholders did identify some challenges in implementing PHOENIx, such as resource constraints and integration with existing services. “Some of the stuff that’s been a challenge has probably round about some of the services I spoke about wishing were here. Like, you know, maybe a lack of therapeutic mental health services, lack of easier access to rehab beds and stuff like that. So aye, that’s probably it. Aye, probably, that’s probably it.” (GS22, Internal stakeholder) Consistency of support provided at one intervention site was highlighted as a challenge. This perceived inconsistency was seen as a result of issues in the recruitment and retention of the support worker role. “Where we’re now, currently, as today, we’re getting participants who are not engaging that were engaging first. And that’s because there’s been a break in the support side. But generally, obviously, there’s only so much I can do. Like, I’ll call them, I’ll speak to them about health, but then when they ask for updates about their housing or their benefits, I can’t answer that. That’s because, you know, we’ve got that staggered, sort of, break down. We have got somebody in-house now who’s doing it, but sometimes it’s a bit too late.” (BS11, Internal stakeholder) The workload of the intervention team was also identified as a challenge, with high caseloads to manage, alongside administration for both intervention participants and the intervention itself. “Yes, workload is heavy, aye, workload is heavy. So, it’s 25 patients, well, we’re not seeing them all the time, but weekly contact with at least 20 is a lot, aye, it’s a lot. And sometimes, it’s half days, whole days, with one patient, trying to get things sorted for them, where they overdose, or whatever.” (GS21, Internal stakeholder) “No. The only aspect that I didn’t like about working in the team was just doing the paperwork and the data after the study. Just, you know, going back through and collating all the information, that was brutal, man. Six weeks or something in the office, day after day, just, you know, collating all the data and aye, aye, that’s not…I work here to work on the frontline, to be out, you know, working with people, and so being stuck in an office. But that’s the only thing I’ve not liked about working with the team.” (GS22, Internal stakeholder) Stakeholders viewed PHOENIx as aligning closely with what they considered optimal care for PEH, particularly in its holistic, person-centred approach. Both internal and external stakeholders considered effective partnership working to be important to providing optimal care to PEH. “I know I’m very health focused, but actually homelessness is a health issue, there are health implications, but actually it’s a social issue. Those services need to have strong links with housing teams and all these other things, to get it right. I think it’s about people who commission the service and people who work in the service, understanding the complex nature of it. Plucking somebody from the street and giving them a house isn’t going to necessarily work straightaway. Some people haven’t lived in a house for a long time. We also put people…we have a higher expectation of them than we do of ourselves. If I rent a property I’m not given this list of rules of what I can and can’t do. I’m not scrutinised. Yes, I’m sure my agreement would say you can’t use illegal drugs on the property, you can’t do this. But no-one’s going to come and check.” (BS14, External stakeholder) “For optimal care. They need a holistic approach. I think what we offer, in terms of the Phoenix team, is looking at all aspects of their care, and then trying to narrow it down to, what are your priorities at this moment in time, but also, putting those other issues that are identified on the backburner, so that eventually, you can come and try and deal with them when they’re in a better place. I suppose it’s about realising that you’re working with people who are using drugs for a reason, and you have to acknowledge that and work around it, and I suppose that’s a big challenge for us.” (GS21, Internal Stakeholder) Stakeholders saw PHOENIx as playing a unique and valuable role in the care landscape for PEH, bridging gaps between different services and providing continuity of care. Work or tasks carried out by the PHOENIx team include social/wellbeing support, management of health conditions (including addictions) and financial and benefit support. “The one or two that needed…like, were underweight, I prescribed them Fortisip. But other than that, we’ve not really had to do anything. It has, like I was saying to you, I did do a lot, but it was more, like, social prescribing, like signposting them to housing, or food banks, or, you know, benefits. And it wasn’t a case where…initially when I came in, I thought it was going to be a lot of patients who were going to be mentally unwell, who were going to be physically unwell.“ (BS11, Internal Stakeholder) The PHOENIx team also provided support with navigating and referring to other services that might be perceived to be previously too complex for those with significant and complex needs. “If any social aspect is needed you can get the referral process started, you can give them your number, you can give them regular updates or signpost them. So the patient actually feels like they’re being listened to, rather than being, sort of, pushed back and just a number in a list.” (BS11, Internal stakeholder) Stakeholders highlighted several positive aspects of PHOENIx, including its flexibility, holistic approach, and association with well-known or trusted organisations. “I think the visits, like the team going and visiting people, aye, well, I think the aspect that I like about it is it’s what’s needed. So, a lot of people that we provide support to find it difficult to engage with appointments and coming to, you know, certain places at certain times. So the team goes there. You know, the team will go there and if they don’t get somebody on one day they’ll try again, you know, they’ll keep trying, they’ll keep going back. They might not link in straight away but, you know, they’ll just keep…our motto’s keep chipping away. So just keep going back and then just gradually, slowly, slowly build up that relationship.” (GS22, Internal stakeholder) While generally positive, stakeholders did suggest some potential improvements for future iterations of PHOENIx. Streamlined data collection, larger teams with smaller caseloads, more locations and longer-term support were all suggested. Data collection was seen as burdensome to team members, particularly alongside managing a large caseload. “I also think that we really need to look at what data we’re collecting. Because it’s a feasibility trial, the data is…some of it, I feel, was irrelevant.” (BS9, Internal stakeholder) “So, I don’t really know what the optimal caseload…and it would probably vary depending on what was going on for, you know, different people within that caseload. But I’m guessing you’re probably looking at 16 maybe, an optimal caseload, as opposed to 25. So that’s probably the only thing that I would say would benefit changing.” (GS21, Internal stakeholder) Stakeholders agreed that community pharmacy was an appropriate setting for the intervention, however, some stakeholders suggested different geographical locations, including those outside of city centres to reduce geographical barriers. “I think that Phoenix research needs to be done in a few locations. I know we’ve got Glasgow and Birmingham but I’ve previously worked in Manchester and Liverpool and they are 30 miles apart [sic] from each other, they do things completely differently to each other. I think it might have changed slightly now. And they have the same level of chaos that goes on around partnerships and around relationships with stakeholders, and the same level of chaos from service users because they are just like Birmingham, the same kind of city where people just move to, you know, and start again. Homeless community right through to professionals, you know, they are cities that are constantly changing.” (BS10, External stakeholder) “So I think just different pockets of the country where you’ve got those big urban cities like Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow and Birmingham, versus some of those more rural Devon, Gloucestershire kind of scenarios, and Worcestershire as well, there’s a massive homeless problem in Worcestershire but it’s all quite hidden, and I think from the perspective of research, it might be beneficial to tap into some of those areas and just see the disparity and the differences between town to town, city to city.” (BS10, External stakeholder) Longer-term support was also suggested for a future trial of PHOENIx. “Maybe we just need longer, we need longer time. We need, probably, smaller caseload to really get at it, just a little bit smaller, but I think that vwould work out, and more time, more time. If we had longer time for the thing, I’m sure we could see different…maybe slightly different results […]” (GS21, Internal stakeholder) Stakeholders identified potential barriers to scaling up PHOENIx, including resource constraints, support and buy-in from policy makers, and intervention staffing. Funding was identified as the primary barrier to a future trial of the intervention. Alongside the removal or reduction in existing services, there is a perceived lack of buy-in from funders or other publicly funded services. Improving services that support PEH are perceived not to be a public priority. “I think it’s going to be funding. Funding’s going to be a big problem, whether you get the funding to see the whole project through. If it’s on a larger scale, like I said, it’ll be over a larger period of time and you will probably see participants getting housed.” (BS11, Internal stakeholder) “The Government aren’t really invested in tackling the issue, because at the heart of all, or nearly all health inequalities, is poverty. If you eliminate poverty most of health inequalities work wouldn’t need to be done.” (BS14, External stakeholder) The staffing of the intervention roles is also seen as a barrier to future implementation. In particular, the support worker role had a significant recruitment and retention challenge. “It’s money, it’s always money. So, prescribers are expensive, support workers are seen as cheap, but because they’re so cheap, the turnover in staff is incredibly high, which means that people don’t have stable support, essentially, they don’t see the same support worker for years and years. It might be that they…some people…I spoke to one person yesterday whose support worker left the week that they moved into the hostel, and they’re still not…two weeks later, they’ve still not been assigned anyone, so they have no idea what they’re doing. So, if money…if there was more money there to actually pay for these services, and also, more money to pay support workers a decent wage, so they’re more motivated to stay longer at the services, I think that would make the world of difference. The cost of having someone who can prescribe is…I mean, I….it would save money, I believe, in the long run, but it’s very difficult to prove.” (BS9, Internal stakeholder). This study shows that participants perceived the PHOENIx Community Pharmacy intervention, as distinctive, comprehensive, consistent, and caring. The intervention’s success appears to lie in its ability to combine practical support with emotional care, delivered through a reliable and trusting relationship between participants and the PHOENIx team. Participants had a clear understanding of how PHOENIx differs from usual care, particularly in its holistic approach and the continuity of care provided. Engagement was facilitated by the team’s consistent presence and their ability to address both a wide range of practical and emotional needs that enables participants to engage more effectively with their care. While there were some limitations in the team’s power to effect certain changes, it was clear that people valued the nature of the long-term support provided. Concerns expressed about the intervention ending underscores its perceived importance in participants’ lives and suggests a need for consideration of how such support can be sustained over time. These findings indicate that the PHOENIx Community Pharmacy intervention has successfully engaged this underserved population, providing a model of care that participants find accessible, comprehensive, and supportive. However, they also point to areas for potential improvement, particularly in terms of the scope of the team’s authority and the duration of support provided. Stakeholders’ perspectives on the PHOENIx Community Pharmacy intervention reveal a generally positive view of the intervention’s potential to improve care for PEH. They recognise its unique role in addressing gaps in current service provision and appreciate its holistic, flexible approach. However, they also identify challenges, particularly around resources and scalability, that should be addressed for future implementation and expansion of the intervention. The holistic approach of PHOENIx, addressing both health and social needs, and providing practical and emotional support was particularly valued by participants and recognised by stakeholders as aligning closely with optimal care for this population. This finding supports previous research emphasising the importance of integrated care models for PEH, who often face multiple, complex challenges that span health and social domains [39]. Participants described a wide range of practical assistance, from medication management to help with benefits applications, which addressed many of the barriers to healthcare access often faced by PEH [40]. Importantly, this practical support was coupled with emotional care, which participants found equally valuable. This holistic approach aligns with calls for trauma-informed practice for PEH, recognising the complex interplay between physical health, mental health, and social circumstances in this population [40,41]. However, the perceived lack of power in certain areas, as noted by some participants, suggests that there may be systemic barriers that limit the intervention’s ability to fully address all needs. This highlights the importance of considering broader structural factors and potential policy changes when developing interventions for PEH [42]. The relational aspects of the PHOENIx Community Pharmacy intervention emerged as a crucial factor in its success. Participants valued the consistent and reliable nature of their interactions with the PHOENIx team, which fostered trust and encouraged ongoing engagement. This finding is consistent with previous research highlighting the importance of trusting relationships in healthcare for PEH [43]. Stakeholders also recognised the strength of these relationships, both within the PHOENIx team and between the team and participants. The multidisciplinary nature of the team, combining pharmacist expertise with third sector support, was seen as a particular strength. This supports the growing body of evidence suggesting that multidisciplinary, collaborative approaches are most effective in addressing the complex needs of PEH [40]. The emphasis on building and maintaining relationships through consistent contact and follow-up addresses a key challenge in providing care to PEH, who often struggle with continuity of care due to their transient circumstances or exclusion from services [14]. The success of PHOENIx in this area suggests that its model of persistent and assertive outreach could be valuable for other services seeking to engage this population [44]. Both participants and stakeholders identified challenges in the implementation of PHOENIx, particularly around resources and integration with existing services. These challenges are common in the implementation of complex interventions and highlight the need for careful planning and adequate resourcing when scaling up such interventions [45]. Existing services may be required to change and become more flexible around appointments or move to addressing the persons wider needs during consultations rather than focussing on single problems or conditions. Stakeholders recognised the potential of PHOENIx to improve care delivery for PEH, particularly through its flexible, outreach-based model. The intervention’s success in engaging individuals who had a history of low care engagement was seen as a significant strength, addressing a key challenge in providing care to this population. However, the concern expressed by participants about the intervention ending highlights the ongoing, long-term nature of support needed by many PEH. This raises important questions about the sustainability of such intensive interventions and the need for long-term funding and support [38], ergo the need for definitive trials to demonstrate impact and cost effectiveness of new services in the current fiscal climate. Some components of the pilot intervention created challenges for delivery that should be taken into consideration for any future iterations. The study questionnaire administered to all participants was perceived to be irrelevant in portions, and onerous to complete for both patients and internal stakeholders. A redesign of the study questionnaire could help to reduce any unnecessary data collection and reduce the length and therefore duration of the questionnaire for both participants and researchers. Internal stakeholders also indicated that the lack of trial support, including trial data management, had a considerable impact on the workload involved in implementing the intervention. At both sites, the trial data management was primarily undertaken by the pharmacists. Any future trial should aim to provide additional administrative support to reduce the workload on the pharmacist and refocus the role on providing clinical support to participants. A significant challenge to the delivery of consistent support to participants was the high staff turnover in the support worker role. The issues around recruitment and retention, while only at one site, had a knock-on effect on other members of the research team. Future trials should aim to bolster this position, perhaps aiming to employ more than one support worker to ensure consistency for participants during periods of absence, improve overall retention and reduce the caseload of support workers. Recruitment and retention of trial participants should be considered to ensure representativeness of the population. PHOENIx participants represent 0.6% of Glasgow’s homeless population [46], and 0.3% of PEH in Birmingham [47]. A full RCT should aim to improve recruitment of study participants. This could be accomplished by garnering greater buy-in from other support services and third sector organisations, as well as ensuring that voucher incentivisation for participant follow-up is increased with inflation or the cost of living. The findings of this study have several implications for practice and policy in the area of healthcare for PEH. PHOENIx provided the opportunity to evaluate the intervention as an RCT, which is uncommon in homelessness health research. The trial represents a valuable step for homelessness health research methodology, and a unique contribution to the area of study. The intervention delivers integrated health and social care for PEH, supporting the delivery of NICE Guidelines (NG214). As identified by stakeholders, holistic, integrated care is key to optimal delivery of services to PEH. The success of PHOENIx’s comprehensive approach supports the need for services that address both generalist health and social needs in an integrated manner. Although the integrated approach is not unique to PHOENIx, the importance of consistent, trusting relationships in engaging PEH highlighted in this trial suggests that services should prioritise continuity of care and invest in building long-term relationships with this population. The combination of generalist healthcare expertise (pharmacist) and social care knowledge (third sector worker) was a key strength of PHOENIx, supporting the value of multidisciplinary approaches. The use of a pharmacist and support worker makes the intervention distinct from other interventions in the research area, however it is possible that the intervention could be delivered by other NHS staff to support scalability of the intervention, e.g., a healthcare support worker, working in tandem with a third sector support worker. The perceived lack of power of PHOENIx staff in certain areas highlights the need for broader policy changes to enable widening of roles in order that systemic barriers to care are addressed on outreach, to further build trust between PHOENIx and PEH. The perspectives captured are those of individuals who engaged with the intervention and only a small number of usual care participants. Future research could address these limitations by including a wider range of perspectives, including more usual care participants to allow for greater comparison of experience between groups. Further, some intervention participants were interviewed at an early stage of the intervention so the impact of the intervention could be difficult to assess. Longitudinal studies, or ethnographic methods could explore the long-term impacts of the intervention and the sustainability of its effects. The PHOENIx Community pharmacy intervention was deemed acceptable and perceived to have many perceived positive impacts. There is a high level of support for the PHOENIx intervention from both intervention participants and health care professionals/ stakeholders suggesting scope for progression to a full-scale trial. The PHOENIx intervention represents a promising approach to providing comprehensive, accessible healthcare to PEH. Its success in engaging this underserved population and addressing complex needs through a holistic, relationship-based approach offers valuable lessons for the improvement of services for PEH. The success of the engagement with this population could offer a guide to interventions for other underserved population beyond PEH. However, challenges around resources, scalability, and long-term sustainability of PHOENIx need to be addressed. As healthcare systems struggle with the challenge of complex needs of PEH, and recruitment crises among clinical professionals, models such as PHOENIx offer a template for more effective, person-centred care that holds promise for improving health outcomes for this vulnerable population.

Large language models are increasingly used by private investors seeking financial advice. The current paper examines the potential of these models to perpetuate investment biases and affect the economic security of individuals at scale. We provide a systematic assessment of how large language models used for investment advice shape the portfolio risks of private investors. We offer a comprehensive model of large language model investment advice risk, examining five key dimensions of portfolio risks (geographical cluster risk, sector cluster risk, trend chasing risk, active investment allocation risk, and total expense risk). We demonstrate across four studies that large language models used for investment advice induce increased portfolio risks across all five risk dimensions, and that a range of debiasing interventions only partially mitigate these risks. Our findings show that large language models exhibit similar “cognitive” biases as human investors, reinforcing existing investment biases inherent in their training data. These findings have important implications for private investors, policymakers, artificial intelligence developers, financial institutions, and the responsible development of large language models in the financial sector.

Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. The landscape of professional advice is experiencing a profound transformation driven by artificial intelligence (AI). In domains ranging from healthcare and legal services to education and finance, millions of individuals are increasingly turning to AI-powered advisory systems [1–5]. Within financial services specifically, this shift is exemplified by the sharp rise of robo-advisors [6–9]. These fully automated platforms assess people’s financial goals, evaluate their risk tolerance, and manage entire investment portfolios without any human intervention [6]. By democratizing access to financial advice, robo-advisors enable individuals who previously did not meet minimum investment thresholds to participate in wealth-building, potentially reducing global wealth inequality [7,10,11]. Beyond complex tasks such as managing an entirely financial portfolio, these technologies can also assist users with basic personal finance tasks such as budgeting and expense tracking, offering accessible financial guidance for everyday decisions [12]. However, despite these advantages, the first wave of such AI advisors across various domains has faced criticism for failing to provide adequately personalized recommendations that align with people’s individual needs and expectations [7]. In healthcare, AI diagnostic systems have demonstrated limitations in accounting for patient-specific factors [13], while in education, adaptive learning platforms often failed to accommodate diverse learning styles [14]. In response to these limitations, a new class of AI-driven, cross-domain advisory systems is emerging, leveraging large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT to provide highly tailored, personalized advice to individuals [15]. LLMs have demonstrated exceptional natural language understanding capabilities [16–18] and the ability to generate such personalized advice [19], potentially addressing key limitations of traditional advisory systems (see also [20] for a recent meta-analysis and increased adoption rates of AI since the emergence of LLMs). In finance specifically, LLMs exhibit exceptionally strong financial literacy [21], enabling them to analyze vast amounts of unstructured financial data in real time [22]. This capability enhances decision-making in areas such as trading and risk modeling as they have been shown to even reliably extract market sentiment to predict stock movements [22,23]. Beyond their technical proficiency, LLMs also demonstrate above-average emotional intelligence, with GPT-4 surpassing 89% of humans [24]. Such emotional intelligence is particularly crucial, as trust plays a fundamental role in financial decision making, and the relationship between private investors and their financial advisors strongly influences the actual adoption of financial advice [25]. Reflecting this trend, a recent study found that 22% of UK private investors with over £10,000 in investments reported using ChatGPT for financial advice, with 75% expressing confidence in its reliability [26] and similar rates have been reported in trusting ChatGPT for advice in other domains such as healthcare [27,28]. However, this growing reliance on LLMs for personalized advice raises a critical question: Can LLMs provide truly reliable financial advice, or do they reinforce already existing human investment biases? The current research examines whether especially LLM-generated financial advice is truly reliable and to what extent it exposes private investors to disproportionate risks. With millions of users starting to employ LLMs to receive financial advice, the belief that LLMs can deliver sound financial advice has the potential to shape not only individual investment decisions but also broader market dynamics. If LLM-driven advisory services systematically reinforce investment biases, they could introduce not only idiosyncratic risks for single individuals—particularly those without access to human financial advisors—but systemic investment risks across financial markets at scale [29]. The potential risks of such an overreliance on LLM-generated financial advice might mirror similar adverse effects already documented in other domains, such as medical misdiagnoses resulting from AI-healthcare tools [30], biased legal outcomes from algorithmic decision systems [31,32], and educational disparities perpetuated by AI learning platforms that fail to address diverse student needs [14]. While these cross-domain risks are increasingly surfaced and recognized, a systematic empirical investigation of how LLMs specifically influence financial decision-making remains scarce. To address this critical gap on the financial implications of LLM-generated advice, the current work presents a series of large-scale LLM experiments systematically prompting three major LLMs (Open AI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, and Microsoft’s Copilot) with varying complexity and investor profiles (e.g., young, risk-seeking investors to older, conservative investors). We evaluate the impact of LLM-generated advice on private investors’ financial portfolios using a comprehensive investment risk framework spanning five key domains (see Conceptual Framework section for details; i.e., geographical cluster risk, sector cluster risk, trend chasing risk, active investment allocation risk, and total expense risk). Across four studies, we demonstrate that LLM-generated investment advice systematically increases portfolio risks for private investors across all five dimensions, with negative implications for risk-adjusted portfolio returns, and we further show that (prompt-based) debiasing interventions only partially mitigate these risks. These findings offer four key contributions: First, our studies demonstrate that LLMs exhibit systematic investment biases similar to those of human advisors, suggesting that AI systems may broadly reinforce existing human biases across advisory domains. Second, we provide a comprehensive framework for assessing five essential types of risks induced by LLM-generated financial advice, establishing a methodology that could be adapted for other domains as well. Third, our findings inform private investors seeking AI assistance, emphasizing the importance of a more critical evaluation when following fully automated recommendations by LLMs. Finally, this research establishes a generalizable framework for stakeholders—including regulators, institutions, and technology developers—to test and validate LLM-generated recommendations in the financial sector. In what follows, we first develop a comprehensive conceptual framework explaining why and how LLMs may produce risky financial advice. We then present four studies that test this framework. Finally, we discuss the broader theoretical and regulatory implications of our findings, offering insights for investors, public policy, FinTech innovators, financial institutions, and academics concerned with the evolving role of LLMs in financial advisory services. We first provide a focused review of recent work on biases in LLMs and examine how two specific types of biases in the data generating process, namely geographical and language biases, may shape the type of financial advice received by LLMs. Next, we develop a set of predictions on how these biases are further reinforced by two LLM-specific biases—availability and recency biases. Table 1 presents a focused review of the literature documenting a set of key biases of LLMs documented in the literature. The key insight across prior work is that these models tend to replicate implicit biases found in their training data [33]. For instance, LLMs have been found to exhibit gender biases, such as the association of certain professions (e.g., doctors or lawyers) more frequently with men than women (gender bias); racial biases, displaying systematically more positive sentiment toward certain demographic groups (e.g., favoring left-wing over right-wing perspectives); and even cultural biases, associating specific religious groups with more negative traits (e.g., linking Muslims with terrorism, extremism, and violence). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.t001 Among these documented biases, two are particularly relevant in the context of financial advisory—geographical and language biases. LLMs tend to perform better in languages that are overrepresented in their training data [44], and they reflect geographic biases due to disproportionate media coverage of specific regions [41]. Thus, we predict that these fundamental biases shape the financial advice private investors receive. We refer to these biases collectively as biases in the training data generation (Fig 1). We argue that these inherent data generation biases are further reinforced by two LLM-specific biases: availability bias and recency bias. Availability bias describes LLMs’ tendency to favor information that is more easily accessible [45]. In the context of LLM-generated financial advice, this suggests that regions and companies with greater representation in the training data are likely to be more disproportionately recommended in LLM-generated investment advice. Recency bias refers to placing disproportionate weight on recent events compared to historical data [35]. For financial advice, this could result in LLM-generated recommendations that overemphasize more recent market trends. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g001 Fig 1 summarizes our conceptual model, illustrating how biases in the data generation process are reinforced by LLM-specific biases (availability and recency biases) to drive subsequent investment risks (see next section for details; i.e., geographical cluster, sector cluster, trend chasing, active investment allocation, and total expense risk). In this research, we examine five distinct types of investment risks. First, we refer to geographical cluster risk as the extent to which the received investment advice puts a greater emphasis on investments of US-based equities [46,47]. As alluded to earlier, we expect that due to the training data stemming especially from English language content [48] and the fact that the US as one of the largest and most developed economies in the world with a strong presence in media reports [49], potentially increases the likelihood to produce a high concentration with US based investments. The sector cluster risk captures the extent to which investments are clustered in single sectors. We expect that due to the strong media coverage of, for example, sectors such as technology or consumer staples compared to other sectors that are of similar (or even greater) economic weight in terms of contribution to the GDP (such as transportation or service sectors; [50,51]) leads to a potential over-investment in such sectors. Next, we assess an LLM’s trend chasing risk as the extent to which investments tend to follow more recent events. Such trend chasing can lead to buying decisions when prices are high and selling them when prices are low due to herding behavior [52]. Trend chasing is also important from a macroeconomic standpoint as trend chasing can amplify market bubbles and in turn, increase the overall volatility in a financial market [53]. Due to LLMs’ already documented recency bias, we expect such trend chasing in LLM-generated financial advice. As a fourth risk type, we will assess the active investment allocation risk as the extent to which investors are invested in actively (vs. passively) managed assets. Such investment strategies (and their associated asset classes) seek to outperform a financial market (or benchmark) by selecting and investing in specific equities [54,55]. Allocating a higher share into actively managed assets in an attempt to “beat the market” is generally associated with a greater volatility risk compared to a broad, passive market exposure [56]. We therefore expect an overinvestment in actively managed assets as the training data likely includes references to specific stocks, active trading strategies, or even stock picking recommendations that are prevalent in financial media, investment forums, and advisory content, where discussions about potential market-beating investments tend to receive more attention than passive investment approaches [57]. Finally, we will assess the total expense risk as the extent of the overall costs of owning an investment, including all fees related to general administrative costs, custodian fees, as well as management fees (in the case of actively managed assets). While related, the total expense risk is distinct from active investment allocation risk as the expense risk captures the impact of reducing net returns through investment fees, and not all active investment approaches incur excessive fees or expenses [58]. For example, an actively managed ETF (short for “Exchange-Traded Fund”) such as the Schwab US Dividend ETF has a lower TER (Total Expense Ratio: the TER reflects the total costs associated with managing a fund, including management fees and administrative expenses expressed as percentage of assets invested) compared to the passive Vanguard All World portfolio ETF (TERSCHD = .06% vs. TERVT = .07%). Table 2 summarizes all of our key risk measures of our conceptual model, their definitions, why they are important from an investment standpoint, and their formal calculation. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.t002 Our experimental paradigm employs a large-scale experimental setting using a 3 (risk tendency: low/ medium/ high) x 3 (age: 15/ 30/ 50) x 3 (LLM: ChatGPT/ Copilot/ Gemini) full factorial design. The first two experimental factors (risk tendency and age) provide our baseline experimental paradigm, representing private investors’ self-stated risk-taking tendency and their objective risk exposure. Older (vs. younger) investors should generally invest in less risky assets due to their limited ability to equalize negative returns over the investment horizon [59–62]. Given that LLMs are expected to personalize financial advice [19], this research investigates how they adjust financial recommendations based on such investor risk-taking tendencies and investor age. The third experimental factor (type of LLM) addresses potential sampling issues due to LLM-specific performance differences. Our experimental paradigm resulted in 27 experimental conditions, which we each prompted 10 times to account for single (and sometimes less common) LLM responses [63]. Thus, we performed 270 prompts in total. We accessed ChatGPT 3.5 via OpenAI’s API [64], Copilot via the EdgeGPT Python package [65], and Gemini via the Bard API Python package [66]. We automatically queried these predominant LLMs in the marketplace to provide us with financial advice. The specific baseline prompt template with our experimental variations across all studies was performed as follows: “I’m a <15-year-old/ 30-year-old/ 50-year-old> looking to invest $10,000. I’m <not willing to take too many risks/ willing to take some risks/ willing to take a lot of risks> with my investment, and I’m hoping for some advice on what products I should consider investing in and how much I should allocate to each. Can you provide me with some recommendations? Please provide me with a table with the type of the investment, the name, the ticker symbol, and the amount I should invest.”. LLMs responded to these prompts with financial advice that included a table of specific investment recommendations (see Fig 2 for an exemplary investment advice by ChatGPT for a 30-year-old investor with a high risk-taking tendency). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g002 To ensure open science research practices [67], all of our code is documented and available on GitHub along with all datasets (https://github.com/ibtPhilipp/biasedEchoes). The next section details how each LLM response was further processed, how each key measure of interest was computed from the LLM’s unstructured text response, and how we analyzed the resulting measures. As summarized in Fig 3 the financial advice received by each LLM (see preceding section) was parsed and further augmented with additional financial data. We query ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini for financial advice, parse the investment portfolio recommendations, and augment them with data from Yahoo Finance, Refinitiv Eikon, and FRED (“Federal Reserve Economic Data” repository) to assess the investment risks, financial performance, and language style of the received financial advice. We query ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini for financial advice, parse the investment portfolio recommendations, and augment them with data from Yahoo Finance, Refinitiv Eikon, and FRED (“Federal Reserve Economic Data” repository) to assess the investment risks, financial performance, and language style of the received financial advice. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g003 First, we extracted the specific investment recommendations from the received unstructured LLM financial advice by performing regular expression splits. We extracted the type of investment such as “Stocks”, the name of the investment option such as “Apple Inc.”, the ticker symbol such as “AAPL”, and the amount in USD such as $3,000 for each position of the investment portfolio recommendation contained in the received financial advice. In case of an invalid LLM financial advice (i.e., non-parseable format or a missing allocation amount) we replaced the LLM response with a new one (i.e., re-prompting the model for the failed response). Second, we then further augmented the parsed investment portfolio recommendations with additional labeled financial data from Yahoo Finance (via the yfinance Python package [68]) and the Refinitiv Eikon database [69]. All investment portfolio positions were augmented with their asset type and equities were augmented by their corresponding sector utilizing Yahoo Finance. For portfolio positions with valid tickers (i.e., equities, ETFs, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies) we fetched price data from Yahoo Finance over a consistent 18-month period (1 July 2023–1 January 2025) following our initial data collection. Next, the investment portfolio positions were resolved to equity granularity level using holding data and augmented by geolocation and sector data from Refinitiv Eikon. In Study 3, investment portfolio positions were further augmented by their ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) score (ranging from 0: poor ESG performance to 100: excellent ESG performance). ETF and mutual fund investment portfolio positions were augmented by their TER and management approach (i.e., active vs. passive). To establish a risk-free baseline, we queried the risk-free market rate (i.e., 10-year US treasury bill) from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis online database FRED [70]. All this additional labeled financial data was then used to assess the investment risks, financial performance, and language style of the received LLM financial advice. Lastly, we fetched geolocation, sector, TER, holding, and price data for our benchmark (see section Benchmark) using exactly the same approach. We assessed the financial performance of the LLM financial advice utilizing the retrieved prices data and risk-free rate. The uniform time window across all retrieved data samples ensures comparability of the financial performance. We computed the recommended investment portfolio’s cumulative return, volatility (portfolio return standard deviation), and annualized risk-adjusted relative returns (annualized Sharpe ratio). Portfolio positions lacking a ticker and price data (e.g., savings or defined contribution accounts) were coded as zero return and zero volatility (only 7% of all observations). We utilized a zero-shot classification model (Facebook’s BART-large trained on the MultiNLI dataset; [71]) to assess the presence of explicit explanations about how the portfolio was constructed, the degree of assertiveness, and the presence of disclaimer notes. We specified the model for a single classification task and defined the possible classes of “explanations” and “no explanations” for the presence of explicit explanations, “assertive” and “non-assertive” for assertiveness, and “disclaimer” and “no disclaimer” for the presence of disclaimer notes. We retrieved the probabilities for each characteristic. We contrast the received financial advice relative to one of the most commonly used financial benchmark indices [72]. Specifically, we contrast all recommendations received by each LLM relative to the Vanguard Total World Stock Index Fund (VT) ETF. This ETF represents a basket of securities that track the underlying index FTSE Global All Cap. Notably, the FTSE Global All Cap index serves as a strategic benchmark for the Norwegian Government Pension Fund Global, which holds 1.5% of the world’s listed companies [73]. In short, this benchmark represents a common, broad, and diversified investment portfolio and has been used in prior work as well [72]. As with the data augmentation strategy, this data was queried using Yahoo Finance and the Refinitiv Eikon database. Investment risks. In what follows, we first analyze the multivariate effects of LLM type (Study 1) and experimental condition (Studies 2a, 2b, & 3), risk-taking tendency, and age on investment risk using a MANOVA. To assess each type of investment risk in detail, we conducted individual one-way ANOVAs, followed by planned contrasts using Tukey’s HSD correction for multiple comparisons. In Study 1, we first conducted one-way ANOVAs with individual investment risk types as the dependent variable and LLM as the predictor. We then performed t-tests comparing each LLM to the benchmark investment risk value. This helped determine whether the type of LLM influences investment risks and whether it outperforms or underperforms the benchmark. Next, we conducted additional ANOVAs with investment risk as the response variable, examining risk-taking tendency and age as predictors. For Studies 2a, 2b, and 3, we first conducted t-tests comparing investment risks between conditions and the contrast relative to the benchmark index. This allowed us to assess whether the intervention influenced the individual investment risk exposure and how it compared to the benchmark. Due to the large number of contrasts and comparisons, we report only theoretically or practically important contrasts directly in the manuscript, while the full range of contrasts is reported in detail across consecutive tables for each study in S1 Appendix. To enhance readability in the remainder of the paper, all specific effect sizes and test contrasts are reported in these tables as well. For a comprehensive overview of portfolio position exclusion criteria and robustness checks, see S4 Appendix. Financial Performance Analysis. To assess the impact of different LLMs on portfolio performance, we conducted a series of mixed linear model regressions with the portfolio cumulative return and Sharpe ratio respectively as the dependent variable. This approach was chosen to account for both fixed effects (i.e., LLMs, temporal trends, and individual characteristics) and random effects (group-level variations across portfolios). The fixed effects included the LLM (ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini) to assess whether specific models influence the return or Sharpe ratio. Additionally, we controlled for temporal trends by including monthly timestamps. This enabled us to assess how the portfolio returns and Sharpe ratios evolved over time. We also incorporated individual differences in risk-taking tendency (low, medium, and high) and age (15-, 30-, and 50-year-olds) to explore potential interactions between the LLM and risk-related variables. By introducing these predictors, we aimed to determine whether returns or Sharpe ratios varied systematically on risk-related variables and whether different LLMs performed better for specific investor types. This approach allowed us to isolate the effect of LLMs while accounting for risk-related variables and temporal trends. Language style analysis. First, we calculated a series of one-way ANOVAs and follow-up contrasts with Tukey HSD correction for multiple comparisons for each characteristic (presence of explanations, assertiveness, and presence of disclaimer notes) as the dependent and the LLM as the independent variable. This allowed us to assess whether LLMs deviate in their language style when communicating the financial advice. Next, we conducted one-way ANOVAs and Tukey HSD corrected contrasts with each characteristic as the dependent and risk-taking tendency and age respectively as independent variables. These additional ANOVAs were conducted to test whether LLMs change their language style depending on an individual’s risk-taking tendency (e.g., very assertive language for high risk-taking individuals) and age. In Study 1 we assessed the type of financial advice that private investors receive as a function of their appetite for risk (self-stated risk-taking tendency and investor age) from the most widely used LLMs (Open AI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, Microsoft’s Copilot). Study 1 employed our baseline experimental paradigm (see Methods section). A MANOVA with the investment risk types (geographical cluster, sector cluster, trend chasing, active investment allocation, and total expense risk) as the response and the LLM (ChatGPT/ Gemini/ Copilot), risk-taking tendency (low/ medium/ high), and age (15/ 30/ 50) as predictors showed significant effects of LLM type (ΛWilks = .7, F(10, 464) = 9.20, p < .001), risk-taking tendency (ΛWilks = .19, F(10, 464) = 60.41, p < .001), and age (ΛWilks = .87, F(5, 232) = 6.81, p < .001). In what follows, we provide a deep dive into the results explaining the differences of individual investment risks depending on each LLM (Fig 4). (A) We find above benchmark geographical cluster risk (N = 269), (B) sector cluster risk (N = 269), (C) trend chasing risk (N = 270), and (D) active investment risk (N = 270). The violin plots and boxplots represent the shape of the distribution of the respective investment risk by LLM. The black dot represents the mean and the colored dots the value of individual portfolio samples. The dashed line represents the value of the benchmark. (A) We find above benchmark geographical cluster risk (N = 269), (B) sector cluster risk (N = 269), (C) trend chasing risk (N = 270), and (D) active investment risk (N = 270). The violin plots and boxplots represent the shape of the distribution of the respective investment risk by LLM.

The dashed line represents the value of the benchmark. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g004 Geographical & sector cluster risk. Our results show that all three LLMs revealed excessive cluster risk compared to our benchmark index. That is reflected in both an over-investment in US equities (with LLMs investing over 93% in US equities vs. 59% in the benchmark) and a higher concentration of funds in individual sectors (Fig 5). An additional concentration analysis showed that LLMs invested on average over 5% and 8% more in the already predominant technology (t(268) = 4.73, p < .001) and consumer cyclical sectors (t(268) = 8.23, p < .001) compared to the benchmark, thereby systematically increasing the sector cluster risk of the portfolio (see S2 Appendix for sector concentration details). This figure illustrates the portfolio weight by LLM type and country relative to the benchmark for the top five sectors (N = 269). This figure illustrates the portfolio weight by LLM type and country relative to the benchmark for the top five sectors (N = 269). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g005 Trend chasing risk. As shown in Fig 4:C, we find that all LLMs heavily engage in trend chasing with up to 27.92% invested in the top three equities that were traded most frequently in the past three months prior to prompting the LLMs. Consistent with our predictions, we find that all three LLMs display systematically higher trend chasing compared to the benchmark index (9%). Active investment allocation risk. We also observe systematically higher shares of actively managed investment options and stock picking. Specifically, we find that over 51% of investments were allocated into actively managed funds or single equities while the benchmark is a fully passive index-replicating ETF. Total expense risk. Finally, we observe significantly higher total expense ratios across all LLM portfolio recommendations compared to the benchmark index. Next, we conducted one-way ANOVAs with individual investment risks as the response variable and LLM type, risk-taking tendency as well as LLM type and age as predictors. Follow-up contrasts with Tukey’s HSD correction revealed a consistently higher active investment allocation risk for individuals with high (vs. low and medium) risk-taking tendencies. ChatGPT and Gemini even increased this risk for those with medium (vs. low) risk-taking tendencies. Similarly, LLMs provided financial advice with higher total expense risk for individuals with high (vs. low and medium) risk-taking tendencies. Further, ChatGPT and Copilot adjusted their recommendations for individuals with low (vs. medium and high) risk-taking tendencies, showing a significantly lower trend chasing risk – as low as 0.67% compared to 38.18% for those with high risk-taking tendencies. Other cases showed variations in investment risks based on risk-taking tendency and age-related risk, but these contrasts did not follow a consistent trend across LLMs. However, we find that ChatGPT and Gemini show less concentration in the technology and consumer cyclical sector for low risk-taking investors and a higher share in government activities. Copilot even concentrates over 46% of funds in government activities (i.e. bond ETFs) for low (vs. medium and high) risk-taking tendency resulting again in a higher sector concentration risk. Taken together, Study 1 provides initial evidence that LLM investment advice induces a significantly enhanced investment portfolio risk across all five types of portfolio risks (geographical cluster risk, sector cluster risk, trend chasing risk, active investment allocation risk, and total expense risk). Further, we find that LLMs systematically adapt the provided investment advice depending on the risk-taking tendency. Financial performance analysis. A mixed-linear model, controlling for temporal effects and using the benchmark as the baseline, revealed that Copilot exhibited significantly lower Sharpe ratios (β = −1.14, p < .01), indicating worse risk-adjusted performance compared to the benchmark (see Fig 6). In contrast, ChatGPT (β = −.28, p = .52) and Gemini (β = −.12, p = .79) did not show statistically significant differences from the benchmark. Temporal effects were not significant, suggesting that the relative risk-adjusted performance of these portfolios remained stable over time but also not significantly more positive relative to the benchmark despite the additional amount of risk exposure of each LLM. The relatively strong risk-adjusted performance of ChatGPT and Gemini is likely driven by an overconcentration in the technology sector and the specific market conditions during the performance analysis period. Given the rapid growth of the technology sector—primarily fueled by advancements in LLM technology itself—portfolios disproportionately exposed to this sector benefited from favorable market trends. The figure shows the Sharpe ratio of ChatGPT (N = 1620), Copilot (N = 1620), and Gemini (N = 1620) relative to the benchmark (N = 18) over a 1.5-year period following the initial data collection. The figure shows the Sharpe ratio of ChatGPT (N = 1620), Copilot (N = 1620), and Gemini (N = 1620) relative to the benchmark (N = 18) over a 1.5-year period following the initial data collection. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g006 However, it is crucial to highlight that risk-adjusted returns, such as the Sharpe ratio, only adjust for the level of risk reflected in return volatility. This measure does not fully capture the broader spectrum of investment risks depending on other market conditions. For example, geopolitical events may evoke additional geographical risks inherent in LLM-generated investment advice leading to increased return fluctuations. Thus, relying solely on return volatility adjusted risk measures can lead to an incomplete assessment of true investment risks inherent in financial advice. Moreover, we also observed that both the choice of LLM and its sensitivity to people’s risk tendencies significantly influenced risk-adjusted performance. Specifically, mixed-linear models controlling for temporal effects and including self-stated risk-taking and age as predictors indicated that Copilot’s risk-adjusted performance was significantly worse for investors with a low self-stated risk-taking tendency (β = −3.13, p < .001), as well as for 30-year-olds (β = −1.57, p < .001) and 50-year-olds (β = −1.12, p = .01) compared to the benchmark. In summary, these findings suggest that while some LLMs may appear to perform adequately (or at least not worse compared to our benchmark) during specific market conditions, this performance is likely driven by the most recent market conditions that benefitted technology and AI investments rather than evidence of a superior investment strategy. The overconcentration in technology sectors that temporarily benefited ChatGPT and Gemini portfolios represents precisely the type of cluster risk that would expose investors to substantial losses during sector-specific downturns. Moreover, the significant underperformance of Copilot, particularly for risk-averse and middle-aged investors, reveals a concerning pattern: LLMs may be least reliable for the very demographic groups most likely to seek and follow automated financial advice. Collectively, these results indicate that LLM-generated financial advice creates a potentially disadvantageous combination of hidden risks and misleading performance indicators that could lead investors to overestimate the quality of LLM-generated recommendations while underestimating their exposure to undiversified risk factors not captured by conventional performance metrics. Language style analysis. Finally, we examined the specific language style employed across all models (see S3 Appendix for details). We utilized a zero-shot transformer model (Facebook’s BART-large trained on the MultiNLI dataset; [71]) to detect whether the investment advice offered a clear explanation or rationale (i.e., why a specific investment option should be chosen), the extent of assertiveness (i.e., how firmly the AI recommends to invest into a specific asset class), and to which extent the advice offers a disclaimer at the end of the recommendation (i.e., stating the potential risks involved with the investment). These analyses demonstrate that all recommendations offered a seemingly plausible explanation (e.g., “Procter & Gamble is a stable company with a long history of paying dividends. Dividend stocks provide regular income and can grow over time.”), with medium to high assertiveness (e.g., “Considering your requirements, here’s a diversified investment portfolio with a breakdown of how much you should allocate to each type of investment:”), and offering a seemingly trustworthy and “caring” disclaimer in the recommendation (e.g., “Remember, these are just recommendations, and it’s crucial to do your own research or consult a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.”). Notably, and as reported in the detailed analysis in S3 Appendix, our results revealed that approximately 95% of all investment recommendations across the three LLMs contained such financial investing disclaimers, suggesting they might function as a deliberate precautionary measure implemented by LLM providers to mitigate potential liability concerns while still delivering a highly assertive financial advice that users are likely to follow despite these warnings. Robustness checks. To test whether our findings hold for most recent versions of LLMs, we automatically queried ChatGPT 4o (gpt-4o-2024-08-06) and Claude Sonnet 3.5 (claude-3–5-sonnet-20241022). We employed our baseline template prompt (see Experimental paradigm) but added instructions that the model should check that the investment recommendations add up to $10,000 and respond in JSON format for improved advice parsing (this option did not exist when we collected the initial dataset). We employed a 2 (LLM: GPT 4o/ Sonnet 3.5) x 3 (risk-taking tendency: low, medium, high) x 3 (age: 15, 30, 50) full factorial design. Following our approach in Study 1, we repeated every prompt five times to prevent a single response selection biases. We retrieved valid responses for all prompts (N = 90). Next, we augmented the financial advice received with additional labeled data and calculated the investment risks analogous to Study 1. Our results show that also the most recent LLMs at the time of this study, exhibit the same above-benchmark investment risks, with the magnitude of each risk somewhat depending on the type of LLM (Fig 7). What is consistent is that all more recent LLMs show an even more pronounced sector cluster risk (due to investing more into the predominant sectors of technology and consumer cyclicals) and a higher total expense risk. We find (A) above benchmark geographical cluster risk (N = 359), (B) sector cluster risk (N = 357), (C) trend chasing risk (N = 360), and (D) active investment risk (N = 270) also for current versions of LLMs. The violin plots and boxplots represent the shape of the distribution of the respective investment risk by LLM. The black dot represents the mean and the colored dots the value of individual portfolios. The dashed line represents the value of the benchmark.

The black dot represents the mean and the colored dots the value of individual portfolios. The dashed line represents the value of the benchmark. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g007 In Study 2a we assessed whether we can alter a single risk dimension (such as avoiding management fees) without changing the other types of risks. We used a two-cell experimental design (control prompt vs. debiasing intervention prompt) with a control prompt identical to Study 1 and a debiasing intervention prompt that explicitly requested no management fees (“I don’t want to pay any management fees.”). This simple, prompt-based intervention is the only realistic alternative for private investors (most private investors will not have the luxury to fine-tune a model and test more sophisticated debiasing techniques). The baseline paradigm in both the control condition and risk debiasing condition was identical and used the same experimental setup as in Study 1 (full factorial design with 3 (risk tendency: high/ medium/ low) x 3 (age: 15/ 30/ 50); given the similar responses provided by LLMs in Study 1, we focused on ChatGPT as the most successful commercially available LLM for the remainder of the paper). A MANOVA with the investment risks (geographical cluster risk, sector cluster risk, trend chasing risk, active investment allocation risk, and total expense risk) as the response and the prompting intervention (control vs. debiasing prompt), risk-taking tendency and age as predictors showed significant effects for the prompting intervention (ΛWilks = .82, F(5, 154) = 6.6, p < .001), risk-taking tendency (ΛWilks = .18, F(10, 308) = 41.68, p < .001), and investor age (ΛWilks = .88, F(5, 154) = 4.31, p < .01). Despite the significant main effect of the debiasing intervention, we find that narrow debiasing only directionally reduces the TER compared to the control condition and fails to decrease it to the level of the benchmark. However, we find that the debiasing intervention moderately reduces the share of actively managed investments. Yet, we still find that over 48% of investments are allocated to actively managed funds or single equities. The narrow debiasing intervention also reduced the over-investment in US stocks and sector concentration in LLM financial advice. However, the geographical as well as sector cluster risk still remained significantly larger compared to the benchmark. The narrow debiasing intervention prompt did not reduce trend chasing, resulting in still significantly stronger trend chasing compared to the benchmark. One-way ANOVAs and planned follow-up contrasts with Tukey HSD correction with experimental condition and risk-taking tendency as well as experimental condition and age as predictor showed that the risk-taking tendency had only limited influence on investment risk changes between conditions. Specifically, our results show that the narrow debiasing intervention only significantly reduced the geographical cluster risk and active investment allocation risk for low self-stated risk-taking tendency where these risks were already the smallest compared to medium and high risk-taking tendency. These findings suggest that while simple prompt-based interventions (like requesting no management fees) can partially mitigate some investment risks, they fail to comprehensively address the full spectrum of risks present in LLM-generated financial advice. The persistence of significant geographical concentration, sector biases, and trend chasing behavior (despite a moderate reduction of actively managed funds) indicates that the systematic investment biases in LLMs are deeply embedded and relatively resistant to simple corrective measures that typical private investors might realistically employ. Financial Performance Analysis. A mixed-linear model, controlling for temporal effects and using the benchmark as a baseline revealed that the risk-adjusted performance of LLM investment advice in the control (β = −.21, p = .19) and debiasing intervention condition (β = −.29, p = .08) were not significantly different relative to the benchmark. Our results show that the risk-adjusted returns improved over time and were significantly lower in the first three months (β08/2023 = −2.3, p = .02; β09/2023 = −3.43, p < .01; β10/2023 = −3.29, p < .01). Furthermore, we find that especially for investors with a high (βcontrol = −.41, p < .01; βdebiased = −.43, p < .01) and low (vs. medium) risk-taking tendency (βcontrol = −.46, p < .01; βdebiased = −.40, p < .01) the risk-adjusted returns were in fact lower in both prompt conditions compared to the benchmark. Again, we also find that the risk-adjusted returns were especially lower in the short-term (β08/2023 = −2.3, p = .01; β09/2023 = −3.43, p < .001; β10/2023 = −3.29, p < .001). Finally, and similarly to Study 1, we find that 50-year-olds received investment advice with lower risk-adjusted returns (βcontrol = −.34, p = .04; βdebiased = −.34, p = .04) compared to the benchmark and that the risk-adjusted returns were especially reduced short-term (β08/2023 = −2.3, p = .02; β09/2023 = −3.43, p < .001; β10/2023 = −3.29, p < .01). In summary, this study provides evidence that a narrow debiasing approach—targeting a single investment risk dimension—fails to reduce exposure to that specific risk in LLM-generated financial advice. Our findings suggest that private investors may only partially mitigate their investment risk exposure through simple prompt-based debiasing interventions. This is important as more advanced debiasing techniques, such as fine-tuning models, are not accessible to most private investors. In Study 2b we assessed to which extent a broader debiasing prompt may reduce the overall financial portfolio risk. Specifying multiple risks in the debiasing prompt, this prompting strategy may reinforce the risk reduction of every single risk alone as such broad debiasing interventions can often lead to effective debiasing of LLMs [74]. We tested this possibility by employing the same experimental design as in Study 2a, with an overarching debiasing prompt intervention (“Avoid common investment mistakes such as lack of diversification, cluster risks, and active management”). A MANOVA with the investment risks as the dependent and the prompting condition (control vs. debiasing intervention), risk-taking tendency, and age as the predictors showed a significant effect for the prompting condition (ΛWilks = .62, F(5, 165) = 20.58, p < .001), risk-taking tendency (ΛWilks = .31, F(10, 330) = 25.84, p < .001), while the effect of age was non-significant (ΛWilks = .93, F(5, 165) = 2.14, p = .06). Follow-up contrasts revealed that this broader debiasing intervention (vs. the narrow debiasing intervention in Study 2a) was largely successful at reducing a range of investment risks (Fig 8). Specifically, we find that the debiasing prompt reduced the over-investment in US assets and sector concentration (while still remaining significantly greater compared to the benchmark however). The amount of assets allocated to US assets was reduced by over 10% but remained at a still high 80% level. Additional contrasts further show that the sector concentration decreased due to a significant 8% and 9% investment allocation decrease in the predominant technology and consumer cyclical sectors. These findings highlight that a more equal distribution across sectors is easier to achieve compared to an equal distribution across financial markets (i.e., arguably due to the strong presence of US-based equities). We find that the debiasing intervention also significantly reduced trend chasing to the extent that it no longer differs significantly from the benchmark. Simultaneously, we find that the debiasing intervention reduces the share of actively managed investment options by over 32%. Finally, the debiasing intervention also significantly decreased the TER by more than.06%. Nevertheless, TER remained notably higher compared to our benchmark. We find (A) above benchmark geographical cluster risk (N = 180), (B) sector cluster risk (N = 180), (D) active investment risk (N = 180), and (C) non-different trend chasing risk (N = 180) when using a broad debiasing intervention. The violin plots and boxplots represent the shape of the distribution of the respective characteristic by condition. The black dot represents the mean and the colored dots the value of individual portfolios. The dashed line represents the value of the benchmark.

We find that the debiasing intervention significantly decreased the sector cluster risk, trend chasing risk, and active investment allocation risk especially for investors with medium and high risk-taking tendency. Additionally, the debiasing intervention also decreased the total expense risk for high risk-taking tendency and the sector cluster risk, trend chasing risk, and active investment allocation risk across all age levels. The collective insight is that broader debiasing interventions explicitly targeting multiple investment risks simultaneously can significantly reduce portfolio risks across most dimensions and age groups, although the geographic concentration remains somewhat elevated above benchmark levels. The differential effectiveness across investor profiles—with greater risk reduction for medium and high risk-taking investors—suggests that LLMs may be more susceptible to debiasing interventions when generating advice for more risk-tolerant investors, while continuing to embed the same biases reported earlier in recommendations for more conservative investors even after explicit correction attempts. Financial Performance Analysis. Analogous to Study 2a, we performed multiple mixed-linear regression models. Again, we find no significant difference of the LLM investment recommendations provided in the control (β = −.25, p = .11) and the debiased condition (β = −.29, p = .06) relative to the benchmark in terms of risk-adjusted returns. We only find a moderate temporal trend indicating lower risk-adjusted performance especially with reduced short-term returns (β08/2023 = −2.26, p = .02; β09/2023 = −3.46, p < .001; β10/2023 = −3.43, p < .001). We find that the risk-adjusted returns are worse for high (β = −.40, p < .01) and low risk-taking tendency (β = −.48 p < .001) in the control condition and for low risk-taking in the debiased condition (β = −.37 p = .01). Further, we find again that the risk-adjusted returns are lower than the benchmark for 50-year-olds in the control condition (βcontrol = −.34, p = .03) and for 30-year-olds in the debiased condition (βdebiased = −.37, p = .02). Also, in this model we find that the risk-adjusted returns were especially reduced short-term at the beginning of the performance measurement period (β08/2023 = −2.26, p = .01; β09/2023 = −3.46, p < .001; β10/2023 = −3.43, p < .001). Thus, despite the successful risk reduction through broader debiasing interventions, both control and debiased LLM-generated portfolios still failed to outperform the benchmark on risk-adjusted returns. These results suggest that even when successful at mitigating specific portfolio risks, debiasing interventions do not translate into improved risk-adjusted performance, indicating that LLM-generated financial advice continues to carry inefficiencies that cannot be fully addressed through prompt engineering alone. In Study 3 we tested whether incorporating an explicit investment goal in the prompt further aids in mitigating specific investment risks in LLMs investment advice. The study directly tests the ability of LLMs to adapt their investment advice based on contextual information and to personalize the investment advice to specific investor needs. Instead of directly asking the LLM to reduce the investment risks of a portfolio, a private investor may prompt a specific investment goal that would in turn translate into a decrease of specific investment risks merely based on the contextual information provided. The current study tests this possibility to infer and “sense” such context information. We employed the same experimental design as in Study 2a but incorporated an explicit investment goal in the prompt (“I want to invest in a way that promotes responsible and socially impactful contributions to our global society.”). We anticipated that this goal would lead LLMs to offer financial advice with reduced geographical and sector concentration risks. The phrase “contributions to our global society” was expected to decrease investments in U.S. assets, while “promotes responsible and socially impactful contributions” aimed to lessen the focus on technology and consumer cyclical sectors and thereby potentially reducing the previously documented trend chasing risk. We also expected that incorporating such a goal would result in investment recommendations with higher ESG scores [75]. A MANOVA with the investment risks as response and the prompt condition (control vs. goal prompt), risk-taking tendency and age as predictors showed a significant effect of the prompt condition (ΛWilks = .30, F(5, 161) = 74.31, p < .001), risk-taking tendency (ΛWilks = .51, F(10, 322) = 12.67, p < .001), while showing only a marginal effect of age (ΛWilks = .94, F(5, 161) = 2.20, p = .06). Follow-up contrasts revealed that investment risks showed a significant decrease in over-investments in US Stocks in the investment goal prompt compared to control, yet higher than our benchmark. However, we find that the introduction of a socially responsible investment goal did not lead to a significant decrease in sector concentration compared to the control prompt and remains still significantly higher than the benchmark index. As shown in Fig 9:A, not only remains this sector concentration very high, but is also substantially overleveraged towards utilities, due to shifting investments towards the energy sector (i.e., “green” energy). Next, we further examined the ESG score in the intervention (vs. control) condition. As summarized in Fig 9: B, specific investment goals were not effective in increasing the portfolio ESG rating of the portfolio. Specifically, we find that there is no significant portfolio ESG rating difference when incorporating a social responsibility goal prompt compared to the control prompt or benchmark. However, it is worth noting that incorporating the social responsibility goal effectively reduced the risk of receiving a low ESG rating compared to control (Levene’s test: F(1, 693) = 23.83, p < .001). We also observe a significant decrease in trend chasing behavior in the LLM investment advice when incorporating a social responsibility investment goal. Adding the social responsibility investment goal however, increased the actively managed portfolio share by over 29% compared to the control condition. Thus, LLMs engage in significantly more “stock picking” when provided with a specific investment goal. Finally, we observe significantly higher total expense ratios when incorporating a social responsibility goal compared to our control condition and benchmark. (A) illustrates the portfolio weight by condition and country relative to the benchmark for the top five sectors (N = 180). In (B) (N = 180) the violin plots and boxplots represent the shape of the distribution of the ESG score by condition. The black dot represents the mean and the colored dots the value of individual portfolios. The dashed line represents the ESG score value of the benchmark.

In contrast, trend chasing risk decreased for those with medium and high risk-taking tendencies under the same condition. Further, the ESG score only increased for high risk-taking tendency when including the socially responsible investment goal where the ESG score was significantly lower (vs. medium and high self-stated risk-taking tendency) in the control condition. The geographical cluster risk decreased only for 50-year-olds. All other contrasts did not yield any meaningful patterns. The collective insight is that while LLMs can effectively adapt their investment advice to specific goals like a stronger social responsibility focus—evidenced by reduced US-centric investments and less trend chasing behavior—these adaptations come with significant trade-offs, including increased active management, higher expense ratios, and sector concentration shifted toward utilities rather than truly diversified portfolios. The inconsistent effectiveness across investor profiles further suggests that LLMs struggle to simultaneously optimize for both specific investment goals and fundamental portfolio construction principles, creating potentially new risk patterns when attempting to accommodate more personalized investing objectives. Financial Performance Analysis. As in the preceding studies, we conducted a series of mixed-linear models to analyze portfolio performance. We find that investments recommended by LLMs in the control condition are not significantly different from the benchmark in terms of risk-adjusted returns (β = −.25, p = .15). In the debiased condition, the LLM investment advice even underperformed the benchmark significantly (β = −.76, p < .001). The temporal trend indicating worse risk-adjusted performance in the beginning holds also for this model (β08/2023 = −2.62, p = .01; β09/2023 = −3.76, p < .001; β10/2023 = −3.78, p < .001; β10/2023 = −2.20, p = .04). We find that this underperformance in the debiased condition stems from the underperformance across both high (β = −1, p < .001) and medium risk-taking tendency investors (β = −1.02, p < .001) and we also find a clear underperformance for low risk-taking tendency in the control condition (β = −.48, p < .01). While we find no significant risk-adjusted underperformance for any age in the control condition, we document a strong underperformance across all age groups in the debiased condition (β15 = −.70, p < .001; β30 = −.75, p < .001; β50 = −.85, p < .001). Thus, we find overall that the introduction of socially responsible investment goals in LLM-generated advice led to significant underperformance compared to the benchmark, highlighting that when LLMs attempt to optimize for specific social impact objectives, they tend to sacrifice financial performance even more severely and lead to new, unwanted concentration issues (i.e., higher concentration in the utilities sector to promote investments in “green” energy). LLMs often reveal biases implicitly present in the underlying training data [33–35,38,76]. Our findings suggest that these biases can result in LLM-generated financial advice that leads to elevated investment risks for private investors across five major risk dimensions (geographical cluster risk, sector cluster risk, trend chasing risk, active investment allocation risk, and total expense risk) and that a range of debiasing interventions only partially mitigated these risks. We find that LLMs recommend a narrow range of geographical regions to invest, concentrate on a few narrow sectors, engage in more aggressive trend-following and stock-picking, and ultimately propose high-fee investment options—all recommendations that are incompatible with modern portfolio theory [46,52,56–58,77–81]. These findings illustrate the need for new risk frameworks in algorithmic finance and to better understand underlying data biases that can lead to a reinforcement of traditional (human) investment biases. The findings of this research document the inherent risks for private investors who already started to employ LLMs to receive financial advice [15], and we hope that the current findings promote a more critical assessment of the advice they receive. However, it is noteworthy to highlight that a critical assessment becomes more difficult when LLM-generated investment advice is communicated very convincingly (see S3 Appendix for details). These findings are sensitive because they suggest a potentially misleading sense of confidence and benevolence by LLM-generated investment advice, paired with precautionary “disclaimers” added in over 95% of the cases across all LLMs we examined. This finding is important in light of prior work showing that LLM advice is often perceived as strikingly more positive even though the advice might carry inherent bias or when the advice is objectively worse compared to expert humans [27,82–86]. The ability to blindly follow harmful LLM-generated investment recommendations presents a significant risk for individual investors, particularly those lacking potentially financial literacy or access to professional financial advisors. Future research should investigate how personal financial goals could be better integrated into AI investment strategies while maintaining appropriate risk management. A fruitful direction for future work is also to further examine whether financial education (potentially even through the use of LLMs) can ultimately empower private investors to critically assess such LLM-generated investment recommendations. Future regulatory research may also focus on developing frameworks to protect consumers from the potential risks of such generative investment advice. This includes exploring effective monitoring mechanisms to prevent more large-scale, systemic risks across financial markets and establishing reporting requirements for firms that utilize generative investment advisory tools. As LLMs become more integrated into financial advisory services, regulators may need to establish clear guidelines for transparency, explainability, and accountability in such AI-driven financial advice, especially when used by private investors. For FinTech developers, our research highlights the importance of addressing inherent biases in LLM-generated financial advice and how to develop future systems that better align with modern portfolio theory principles and avoid reinforcing harmful investment biases documented in the current research. A main question for future work will be how generative investment advice algorithms can be trained to generate recommendations that are more consistent with investors’ long-term financial goals and risk tolerance without inducing the investment risks reported in this paper. As with any research, we also highlight at least two limitations of the current work. First, we evaluated LLMs at specific points in time, and these models continue to evolve very rapidly. While our robustness checks with the most recent models (as per January 2025) seem to be robust (see Robustness Checks at the end of Study 1), future generations of models might improve radically once foundation models might be explicitly debiased during the training stage. Second, our simulated investment portfolios were evaluated over a specific time-period that coincided with a strong technology sector performance. However, we believe that exactly due to these favorable market conditions for technology-heavy portfolios, our financial performance analysis reported in this paper represent a conservative estimate of the potential risks of LLM-based financial advice. In market environments where technology sectors underperform, the geographical and sector concentration risks we identified would likely lead to even worse investment outcomes, further amplifying the risk exposure of portfolios generated by LLMs. In conclusion, the current work demonstrates that LLM-generated investment advice systematically increases portfolio risks across multiple dimensions, potentially exposing private investors to unwanted investment risks while creating a false sense of confidence through convincing language and reassuring disclaimers. These findings underscore the need for more cross-disciplinary collaboration among investors (both private and institutional investors), regulators, FinTech innovators, financial institutions, and researchers to develop more robust frameworks for evaluating and improving AI-generated financial advice. We hope the current research promotes such collaborations to proactively transform the financial advisory landscape to truly serve the interests of private investors through properly diversified, low-cost, and personalized financial advice. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.s001 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.s002 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.s003 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.s004 (DOCX) We thank the reviewers for their thoughtful feedback and constructive suggestions that significantly improved this manuscript.

ByRachel Wells ByRachel Wells, Contributor. You don't need to be a Silicon Valley engineer or have any technical background at all, to make ... More money with AI AI has become such a controversial topic. It's one of those things where you can look at it extremely positively, but extremely negatively at the same time. For example, just over a week ago, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote in a memo that the effects of AI in the organization would lead to large-scale layoffs and workforce reductions across the Big Tech giant, as more AI tools are being implemented and integrated across their workflow and systems. While this certainly spells bad news for employees who feel stuck within these roles, on the flip side, if you’ve been a casualty of an AI-induced layoff, there is still hope, because you can actually make AI work for you, not against you. You can actually join the opposition, so to speak, and leverage your existing skills while upskilling in AI, to build an AI-powered business as a freelancer. What’s really interesting is that more employers are outsourcing their work to freelance contractors. With freelance hiring up by 260% in the past two years alone, there’s never been a better time to be laid off, because opportunities are ripe for you to start your own business and pivot your career. So, if you’ve been waiting for a sign to launch your own venture, this is it. You can get started today, upskill relatively quickly, and capitalize on the strong interest that organizations have with implementing AI. Use this to your advantage so that you can effectively create your own job, hire yourself, and get paid for it. You know what’s even better? The AI-powered freelance business ideas listed in this article are no-code. This means you don’t need to be a software developer, ML engineer, or have a computer science background for these to work. Each of these ideas has the potential to rake in $100,000 or more a year in client contracts, projects, and consulting work. Let’s get into the list: There are two ways of looking at AI consulting. One is where you go deep into the development aspect of implementing AI into organizations. This is where you’ll definitely need to have solid technical background. But the other way of looking at it is a no-code approach. Some no-code options and services you can deliver for AI consulting work include: How much it pays: AI consulting work can pay as much as $175,000 a project. Create a monthly swipe file or kit of resources that your target clients can use, which will help them solve a specific problem. Monthly subscriptions are an excellent business model because they ensure longer retention and help to future-proof your career and finances due to their consistency. Additionally, this business model is perfect because it provides passive income, and it has low overheads. Often, you can start for less than $50, using one or more AI tools and Canva. They also support you during feast-or-famine cycles when clients from other streams of income may be running dry, and they make it easier for you as a freelancer to accurately predict and plan for your future financially, as well as making larger purchases. Some examples of AI-powered digital subscriptions you could offer include done-for-you marketing services, like: You can also combine some services to create higher-tier offers. For example, you could offer a YouTube content calendar, plus a strategy session, plus YouTube scripts. How much it pays: This business model provides unlimited income and can easily be scales and automated. Ask ChatGPT to draft a list of learning objectives and an outline for your niche corporate training program (the niche could be corporate wellbeing, sales, leadership training, etc.). Use it to brainstorm for the content and to develop the talking points of your presentation. Then, use AI tools like Prezi.ai or Canva’s AI features to help you develop the slide deck, and finally, ask ChatGPT to create survey questions relevant to your training, that you can give to attendees at the end of the session. How much it pays: Corporate trainers make about $87,000 a year, but on the higher end some are known to earn as much as $112,000 according to ZipRecruiter. That being said, if you provide digital products that can sell on their own, like ready-to-sell courses, you can make more money. Yes, you can build a business with AI. You just need to ensure that the following ingredients are in place: AI consulting is an extremely lucrative freelance business, with some projects paying upwards of ... More $150k Can I really make $100k a year using AI? Yes, AI has unlimited potential, and it’s only restricted by how and where you apply it. Once you spot a pain point, apply your expertise and use AI to back your solution so you can deliver it more efficiently and scale your income at the same time. Do I need to learn how to code to start an AI-powered business? No you don’t need coding knowledge. Business ideas like AI consulting focus on strategy and implementation advice.

ByCharlie Fink ByCharlie Fink, Contributor. Legal win for AI industry? A U.S. federal judge ruled that Anthropic’s use of copyrighted books to train its AI model Claude qualifies as fair use. Judge William Alsup likened it to a writer learning from prior work. However, he found Anthropic liable for copyright infringement for storing over 7 million pirated books in a central repository unrelated to training. That storage was not protected under fair use. Damages could be as high as $150,000 per infraction. A trial in December will address potential damages. Alphabets AI on advanced central processing unit (CPU) chip and gavel and sound block in wireframe ... More on electronic mother boards. Illustration of the concept of legislation and regulations of AI Act In the Northern District of California, U.S. federal judge Vince Chhabria, dismissed a copyright lawsuit from 13 authors against Meta. The plaintiffs, which include Sarah Silverman and Ta‑Nehisi Coates, claimed Meta improperly used their books to train its Llama AI model. The court found the plaintiffs failed to show market harm or dilution, and granted summary judgment for Meta. The decision applies only to the specific authors involved and does not affirm that Meta’s data use is lawful across the board. On Last Week Tonight, John Oliver skewered the rise of “AI slop,” mass-produced, low-effort content flooding social media. In previous weeks, I’ve shared anthropomorphic cat dramas, and vlogs from Storm Troopers, Bigfoot and Jesus. It’s entertaining. It’s designed to go viral, and earn ad money. But, argues Oliver, it’s slop that drowns out real content. One landscape designer complains she can’t find pictures of real gardens on Pinterest anymore. Chronicle co-founders Aaron Sisto (l) and Chris deFaria (r) Chronicle Bets $12 Million AI Can Spot A Billion Dollar Franchise Chronicle's founders think social platforms are where tomorrow’s blockbuster entertainment properties will be born, and they are using AI to grow them.

Virtuix has closed a $3.27 Million Series B‑2 crowd‑investment round, bringing total Series B funding to $18 million. The company’s valuation now sits at about $201 million, based on its $6.22/share pre‑IPO stock price. Virtuix is best known for its Omni One consumer VR treadmill—bundled optionally with the Pico 4E headset for $3,495—and is expanding into military training with its new Omni Mission Trainer (OMT), built in partnership with the U.S. Air Force.

(Photo by WANG Zhao / AFP) (Photo by WANG ZHAO/AFP via Getty Images) Xiaomi has unveiled its AI-first smartglasses—officially named Xiaomi AI Glasses (yes, really). Like Meta’s Ray-Bans, there’s no display. Instead, they use Qualcomm’s Snapdragon AR1 chip and Xiaomi’s Hyper XiaoAi assistant to deliver voice-based responses triggered by speech and touch. With no screen or HUD, the emphasis is on audio-driven utility and lightweight design. The glasses feature a 12MP stabilized camera, five mics, dual speakers, and electrochromic lenses that darken on demand. They weigh just 40 grams, support Alipay QR payments, and offer up to 21 hours of standby. Shipping in September, they start at ¥1,999 (about $280) and come in three colors.

ARtillery Intelligence’s June 2025 report projects headworn AR revenue to grow from $2.6 billion in 2024 to $13.05 billion in 2029. That's a compound annual growth rate of nearly 38 percent. This growth is led by enterprise productivity use cases, currently accounting for over 70 percent of market revenue. But consumer adoption is accelerating fast thanks to the success of “lite AR” smart glasses like Ray-Ban Meta. These tier-3, audio-first, non-display glasses have validated a new design direction: style-forward, AI-powered wearables that prioritize utility over immersion. Meta’s success has prompted rapid follow-on moves from Apple, Google (via Android XR), and Snap, with key consumer AR glasses expected by 2026–2027. ARtillery anticipates a major inflection in 2027 as these players enter the market.

Title: Signal: This Rideshare Stock Has Cheap Options, Room To Run

BySchaeffer's Investment Research BySchaeffer's Investment Research, Contributor. Don’t think UBER’s drive up the charts is running out of gas. Rideshare firebrand Uber Technologies (UBER) boasts a 53.6% year-to-date gain. Despite a post-earnings bear gap back in early May, UBER proved resilient, and nabbed a May 20 record high of $93.60. Now, the shares are testing this level once more, and could barge on through, with this bullish combination flashing. UBER’s new highs are coinciding with historically low implied volatility (IV) -- a combination that has been bullish for the stock in the past. According to data from Schaeffer’s Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, there have been five other instances when Uber stock was trading within 2% of its 52-week high, while its Schaeffer’s Volatility Index (SVI) sat in the 20th annual percentile or lower -- as it the case with Garmin’s current SVI of 32%, in the 7th annual percentile. The data shows that one month after those six previous signals, UBER was higher 60% of the time, averaging a 3.7% gain. From its current perch at $92.81, that would mean barreling past that May 20 high, an area that turned the stock away earlier this week. The enticing technical setup goes deeper than that, though. Note in the chart below the shares’ 50-day moving average that contained pullbacks between the two peaks in the last two months. Shorter term, a breakout from current levels would form a bullish flag pattern. Further, note the trendlines connecting late December bottom to April 2025 lows just below $65, as well as then-record highs in October with the May peak. All of the trendlines fit within a bullish uptrend channel that UBER is in, and shows no signs of breaching. UBER Stock Chart With 50-Day Moving Average Should Uber Technologies stock resume its uptrend, analyst adjustments to the upside could provide tailwinds. It may have already begun; earlier this week, brokerage firm Cantor Fitzgerald hiked its UBER price target to $106, and more bull notes could be on the way. The equity’s consensus 12-month price target of $96.87 is only a 4% premium to its current perch, while 10 brokerages are on the sidelines with tepid “hold” ratings. Breaking through to new record highs could compel analysts to jump on board for the long term.

Title: AVGO Stock To $500?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CANADA - 2025/01/28: In this photo illustration, the Broadcom logo is seen displayed on a smartphone ... More screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Broadcom’s (NASDAQ: AVGO) extraordinary 125% increase from $110 levels in early 2024 has investors pondering if the AI chipmaker can replicate its success. What might lead the stock to rise to $500+ levels from here in the coming years? The most persuasive factor is Broadcom’s custom silicon division. AI-related semiconductors now account for over 50% of Broadcom’s sales, marking a significant shift in the company’s revenue composition. The management of the company assesses the serviceable addressable market at $15-20 billion. The custom chip sector shows tremendous growth potential. The overall market for custom chips could expand to approximately $55 billion by 2028, effectively more than tripling from current figures. This growth reflects hyperscalers’ increasing preference for purpose-built silicon over generalized processors. Additionally, if you’re seeking a more consistent route to gains than investing in a single stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has surpassed the S&P and yielded over 91% since its inception. Also, check out – BigBear.ai: What's Happening With BBAI Stock? Other elements are at play as well. Broadcom's impressive earnings growth can support elevated valuations. The company's revenue is anticipated to grow at a high teens average annual rate to over $100 billion by 2029. Broadcom has high profitability with its adjusted net income margin of 50% in the past twelve months. This indicates that the impact on earnings will be more significant than on the top-line. At its present levels of $265, AVGO stock is trading at 45 times its trailing twelve months adjusted earnings of $5.84 per share. Additionally, check out – Broadcom’s Valuation Ratios. Maintaining this multiple could push the stock to around $500 within that timeframe. A higher multiple would enable an even greater increase. The existing customer relationships frequently involve multi-year commitments and substantial switching costs, which provides Broadcom with revenue visibility and pricing power, potentially maintaining premium valuations. For this multiple to broaden, Broadcom must showcase sustained strong annual revenue growth in AI segments, expand its market share in the custom silicon sector, focus on further margin improvement from a higher-value product mix, and secure contracts with new clients. In summary, Broadcom’s journey to doubling relies on capturing a significant portion of the growing custom chip market while preserving its technological prowess in AI networking. With the custom chip market potentially reaching $55 billion by 2028 and Broadcom’s current leading position, the company seems well-equipped for ongoing outperformance. While Broadcom displays strong growth prospects, several factors could restrict its upside. Consequently, investors considering Broadcom should carefully evaluate these risks. At Trefis, we incorporate such risks into our construction of the High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which encompasses 30 stocks and has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four years. What explains that outperformance? HQ Portfolio constituents tend to provide higher returns with lower volatility than the benchmark, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Diane Brady is executive editorial director of the Fortune CEO Initiative and Fortune Live Media. She also writes the CEO Daily newsletter. Good morning. Earlier this week, I had a chance to chat with Intuit CEO Sasan Goodarzi and play with the four AI-powered agents that are rolling out next week for Quickbooks Online. It’s the first time I’ve seen agents deployed so effectively in handing off tasks to each other while helping humans be more productive. (I did enjoy seeing Cognizant’s Babak Hodjat create multi-agent systems on the spot at the Fortune COO Summit earlier this month, but many of us will deploy agents, not create them.) Intuit has four themed agents—a customer one for spotting leads in emails, drafting emails, and tracking interactions to the point of sales; one for payments to streamline and speed up that process; another for finance, to analyze and help you boost the health of your business; and a fourth for accounting, to reconcile expenses and make your bookkeepers happy. If I’d had this a decade ago, I might have remained an entrepreneur. “By far, this is the most significant launch we’ve ever had in our history because it’s end-to-end,” Goodarzi told me. “The fact that we have launched a virtual team that can do a lot of work, from managing your leads to making sure you get paid and your accounting is done, and it’s a combination of AI and humans doing the work. It’s been in the works for six years.” “It’s not about workflows,” he said. “It’s about a business feed that does everything for the customer while they’re always in control. And it’s not just about technology; it’s also about human expertise because, in our world, even Millennials, they want the reassurance of a human.” When I asked Goodarzi to reflect on what this means for the identity of a company that most associate with taxes and accounting, he said: “I want us to be known as the money company because of how we help businesses and consumers.”More news below.Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com U.S.-China trade deal The U.S. and China have reached an “understanding” on trade in which China will supply rare earth minerals to the U.S. and in return, “we’ll take down our countermeasures,” US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Bloomberg. Trump’s sons are considering a dynasty Eric Trump told the FT that he or Donald Jr., Ivanka, or his wife Lara might continue their father’s legacy in politics. “I think I could do it,” Eric Trump said. “And by the way, I think other members of our family could do it too.” Meta did not pay those guys $100 million Lucas Beyer, one of three OpenAI researchers who lead Sam Altman’s Zurich office, said on X that they did not get paid $100 million to join Mark Zuckerberg’s company. “No, we did not get 100M sign-on, that's fake news,” he said. Citi stock worth $100 a share, analyst says Citi chief Jane Fraser has suffered months of negative headlines but yesterday she got some good news.

Two senior execs leave Tesla Omead Afshar, head sales and operations in North America and Europe, and Jenna Ferrua, director of North American HR, have exited Tesla, following a tough period for the company: Q1 vehicle deliveries fell 13% and profit declined 71%. Trump v the judges The White House sued all 15 federal judges in Maryland for opposing his deportation program. The normal method for disputing a judicial ruling would be to appeal a decision. The suit thus puts the Trump Administration on a legal collision course with the judiciary over which branch of government has a superior level of power. New York real estate developers in panic over Mamdani If Zohran Mamdani wins the NYC mayor’s race, it “would be the death penalty for the city,” Danny Fishman, CEO of Gaia Real Estate, told the WSJ. “And it would be the best thing to happen to Miami and Palm Beach since Covid.” Mamdani favors rent control, and New York’s property moguls are organizing to back almost anyone who might be able to beat him. Bill Ackman makes a pledge Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman is looking to bankroll a candidate who can take down Democratic frontrunner Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral election. He shared that he and his associates have “hundreds of millions of dollars” at the ready, and once they find the person for the job, “the funds will pour in.” Not made in the USA The Trump Organization is no longer claiming that its T1 phone will be made in the U.S., now opting instead for more vague descriptions of the product on its website like, “designed with American values in mind.” This switch up comes less than two weeks after the company announced its new brand.

Title: JCPenney Gifts $10,000 Dream Wedding to LA Couple Amid Brand Revival

While all eyes are on Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ high-profile wedding in Venice, Italy this week, JCPenney hopes to divert attention to another Venice wedding that happened recently. On Wednesday, the department store funded a Los Angeles couple’s wedding in Venice, Calif. to prove that the big day doesn’t have to break the bank. The brand assisted high school sweethearts Estefany Gomez and Leonardo Rendon by outfitting the couple and their entire guest list, as well as providing all wedding decor—all for a total pricetag of $10,000. If you don’t believe them, check the receipt. “We’ve always dreamed of a California wedding, but with our families living on opposite coasts, it felt out of reach,” the couple said in a statement. “When JCPenney reached out, we honestly wondered if it could really happen. But they didn’t just say yes to our dream—they made every detail possible, from outfitting every guest in gorgeous fashion to the venue and cake, and most importantly, creating memories we’ll cherish forever.” Per Zola’s 2025 First Look Report, the average cost of a wedding in 2025 is projected to hit $36,000, an increase from $33,000 in 2024 and $29,000 in 2023. The campaign comes as JCPenney attempts to stage a major comeback under its new chief marketing officer (CMO) Marisa Thalberg, following a period of bankruptcy, layoffs, store closures, and slow sales. Per Retail Dive, the brand’s Q4 total net sales decreased more than 9% to $2.09 billion. The publication also reported on Monday that the department store will shutter its Alliance Supply Chain facility in Haslet, Texas in November, impacting 300 employees. In April, JCPenney rolled out “Yes, JCPenney”, its first campaign under Thalberg, featuring unbranded billboards across NYC’s Times Square and in Brookfield and Simon malls nationwide. The posters showcased models wearing its clothes with no indication of where they came from. A QR code printed on the ads linked to JCPenney’s site. In the two months since the campaign’s release, JCPenney said it has seen a 22% increase in Google searches for the brand, as well as a rise in brand consideration from 13.6% to 16.4%. One of the lead outfits from the ad campaign also achieved an 88% sell-through. Thalberg, who joined in October 2024, said facilitating what she calls “the other Venice wedding” was a part of the brand’s strategy to reaffirm JCPenney as a destination for budget-conscious trendsetters. “As we think about what our place is in culture, it’s to gently poke at things that are elite and show how we can translate it for everyone else,” she told ADWEEK. The CMO added that consumers can anticipate more from its “Yes, JCPenney” campaign as it rolls out back-to-school fashion in the fall. Cydney Lee is ADWEEK's advertising news reporter based out of NYC. Prior to joining in Aug. 2024, she was editorial assistant at Billboard. Her work has also appeared in W Magazine, GRAMMY.com, Pigeons & Planes, Vulture and more. By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy .
