The new ETF will track the "performance of the price of Bitcoin while providing premium income through an actively managed strategy of writing (selling) call options on IBIT shares and, from time to time, on indices that track spot bitcoin exchange-traded products ('ETPs'), including [iShares Bitcoin Trust] (such indices, 'ETP Indices')," the issuer said in its SEC filing. In practice, this means the fund sells options that give other investors the right to buy its IBIT shares at a set price and collects the option premiums as income. Shares in the ETF will represent fractional beneficial interests in that income and the fund's Bitcoin, IBIT shares, and cash. A BlackRock spokesperson told Decrypt the firm cannot comment further on how the new fund will compare to competitors or when it will share details about the expense ratio for the new ETF. It's normal for initial S-1 registrations to leave out details like tickers, custodians, and management fees. But for the sake of context, there are a few similar Bitcoin income or covered-call ETFs already trading. The NEOS Bitcoin High Income ETF has traded under the BTCI ticker on the Cboe BZX Exchange since its October 2024 launch. As of Friday, it had $1.09 billion worth of assets under management. The expense ratio for BTCI is approximately 0.99% of assets annually. That means investors pay just under 1% of their invested assets each year to cover the fund's operating and management costs. The new BlackRock fund will also compete against the Roundhill Bitcoin Covered Call Strategy ETF (YBTC) and YieldMax Bitcoin Option Income Strategy ETF (YBIT), which account for $225 million and $74 million in assets under management, respectively. Actively managed ETFs, like BTCI and the new iShares offering, charge higher fees to cover the costs of implementing their option-writing strategy. A passive spot Bitcoin ETF, like IBIT, keeps its operating costs lower because it doesn't trade derivatives, time markets, or make discretionary strategy decisions. The structure reflects a higher-risk, higher-fee strategy that also offers the potential for higher income than a passive spot Bitcoin ETF.

Title: Commercial Cleaning Services Market Report 2026 - Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, and Forecast, 2021-2031
URL: https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2026/01/26/3225816/28124/en/Commercial-Cleaning-Services-Market-Report-2026-Global-Industry-Size-Share-Trends-Opportunity-and-Forecast-2021-2031.html
Time Published: 2026-01-26T16:12:00Z
Full Content:
January 26, 2026 11:12 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Jan. 26, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Commercial Cleaning Services Market - Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, and Forecast, 2021-2031" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The Global Commercial Cleaning Services Market is projected to expand from USD 225.24 Billion in 2025 to USD 336.32 Billion by 2031, growing at a CAGR of 6.91%. This sector includes professional maintenance and sanitation for non-residential environments such as healthcare institutions, corporate offices, educational facilities, and industrial sites, covering tasks ranging from standard janitorial work to specialized floor care and regulatory disinfection. Market growth is primarily fueled by rising global hygiene standards and a corporate strategy to outsource facility management for cost reduction and operational efficiency. According to the Building Service Contractors Association International, 34 percent of contractors anticipated significantly higher sales in 2025 compared to the previous year, signaling strong confidence in the industry. However, the market faces significant headwinds due to acute labor shortages and workforce retention issues. The industry is hampered by high turnover rates and challenges in recruiting reliable staff, often driven by wage competition and physically demanding working conditions. This instability restricts service providers' ability to scale effectively and leads to inflated recruitment and training costs. Consequently, the difficulty in maintaining a stable labor pool threatens to reduce profit margins and constrain the broader expansion of the commercial cleaning sector. Market Drivers The deployment of Automated Cleaning Technologies and Robotics has become a vital strategy to address labor shortages and the demand for consistent, high-frequency sanitation. Service providers are increasingly utilizing autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) for repetitive tasks such as floor scrubbing, which allows human employees to concentrate on complex, high-touch disinfection while data analytics provide essential performance validation. Highlighting the scale of this integration, Brain Corp reported in December 2024 that its fleet of autonomous robots had cleaned over 250 billion square feet of commercial space worldwide. Simultaneously, a sharpened focus on workplace hygiene and employee wellness is driving market growth as companies implement return-to-office mandates. Facilities are adopting evidence-based hygiene protocols that go beyond visual cleanliness to minimize pathogen transmission and reassure occupants. In March 2025, Cleaning & Maintenance Management (CMM) found that 30 percent of facility managers prioritized employee health safety as a top management concern. This focus translates into financial success for providers offering health-centric solutions; for instance, ABM Industries reported a 6.2 percent year-over-year revenue increase in the third quarter of 2025. Market Challenges The critical obstacle hindering the Global Commercial Cleaning Services Market is a severe labor shortage coupled with the difficulty of retaining a qualified workforce. This operational bottleneck limits providers' ability to meet rising demand, forcing them to decline new contracts or restrict the scope of existing ones, which directly caps revenue potential. Additionally, the perpetual cycle of recruiting and training new personnel imposes a substantial financial burden, diverting capital that could otherwise be invested in business development and innovation. This instability is further aggravated by wage competition and the physically grueling nature of the work, which discourage long-term employment. A lack of workforce stability disrupts service continuity and quality, putting client retention and satisfaction at risk. According to the Building Service Contractors Association International, 40 percent of contractors in 2025 expected recruitment challenges to escalate in the coming year. This persistent deficit in the workforce erodes profit margins and stifles the overall growth of the market, preventing firms from fully capitalizing on industry momentum. Market Trends The shift toward Data-Driven and Demand-Based Cleaning Models is transforming operational workflows by replacing static schedules with dynamic, usage-based interventions. By utilizing Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and occupancy analytics, facility managers can dispatch cleaning teams precisely where and when they are needed, optimizing resources and preventing hygiene lapses in high-traffic areas. This approach significantly improves service precision and occupant satisfaction; for example, Tork reported in July 2025 that facility managers using the Tork Vision Cleaning system experienced a 75 percent reduction in complaints and a 68 percent improvement in operational efficiency. Concurrently, the market is being reshaped by the Expansion of Green Cleaning and Circular Economy Practices, as clients demand sustainability strategies that exceed simple chemical substitution. Service providers are increasingly adopting circular economy principles, including comprehensive waste diversion and resource-efficient operations, to align with corporate net-zero goals. Demonstrating the impact of these practices, Sodexo UK & Ireland announced in March 2025 that sites utilizing its WasteWatch data program achieved an average 45 percent reduction in food waste, highlighting the operational benefits of targeted sustainability strategies.

Title: What "The Best" Looks Like
URL: https://www.kuril.in/blog/what-the-best-looks-like/

Full Content:
Talent hits a target no one else can hit. Genius hits a target no one else can see. —Arthur Schopenhauer The second that the next round of funding hits the bank, every new CTO starts obsessing over the same thing: Who the hell do I hire next? The answer is surprisingly non-obvious. You’re told that you always want—scratch that, need—the best of the best, your startup’s future depends on it. You’re told your company is unique, special, and it requires the most hardcore among researchers, designers, engineers, and product managers. You never skimp on who builds the golden goose. You can’t succeed with any less than that. But, is that actually true? Every startup-hustle YouTube video, VC podcast and celeb founder interview regurgitates that the key to success is to hire the very best people, no matter what it takes. And yet you live in the real world, with real-world constraints. You have only so much money in the bank. Only so much time and bandwidth to hire. Only so much attention in a given day. And you’re not alone in your hunt. You’re competing with hundreds of other players in your geography, industry, and problem space looking for “the best.” Many of them have a more famous brand, more cash, more promising equity, more charming founders, and maybe even a high production value promo video showcasing happy employees, rare wood office counters and a shoes-off policy. Will you actually hire the best of the best against those odds? Many years ago I found myself in this pickle and I had to learn all the relevant lessons the hard way. I share these lessons here, so that you don’t have to struggle through that same maze yourself. My pain is your gain. My first time around the startup world in 2012, I hardly knew what I was doing and relied mostly on luck—and unfortunately, firing—to end up with a team I could be proud of. I had no real point of reference for greatness, for what “the best” in our area could look like, and building that model required lots of experimentation, with high highs and many low lows. The story of David, our brilliant infrastructure ops engineer at Freckle, has stayed with me ever since. David applied to the company back when we were only hiring for an ops role. We were growing slowly, so there was zero room for anybody who wasn’t absolutely essential on the team. We had no open-ended extra seat for a smart person who just happened to be on the market, unlike some companies these days. David was 100% what we were not looking for. He had never done any ops. In fact, he had never done anything related to web dev or product engineering. I’m not sure he even knew what AWS was at that point. He was a sharp physics guy working with a professor on simulations in an academic context. He didn’t let that deter him. He wanted to work at Freckle, thanks to our reputation as one of the few software startups in the world using Haskell in production at scale. We were an odd outlier in a sea of buggy and laborious Rails apps, a shelter for people who didn’t want yet another web slop gig. And Haskell was oh-so-hot in the Hacker News programming language theory space at the time, a technology attracting software nerds obsessed with correctness and new, better ways of developing bug-free apps. I immediately told David that he was not a fit; he had none of what we were looking for. And yet he persisted, emailing me that he would do whatever test project we threw at him, and if he bombed it, no problem, he would go away. But if he nailed it, we would have proof that he was qualified, in spite of what his CV indicated. Fine. I sent him a meaty cloud ops take-home project, expecting to never hear from him again. Importantly, this was in the days before you could have Claude Code slap that together for you in two prompts. A day or two later, he returned the project to us, and it was pretty much flawless, doing even more than we had asked for. That was not expected. I got curious about what else he could do. We weren’t drowning in applicants anyway, so I figured I didn’t have much to lose. We took him through the usual interview process. He was humble, optimistic, well-spoken, actively communicating and taking feedback well, eager to get to work. He was pumped about everything he could learn on the job, about the doors that would eventually open if he nailed it. He didn’t have much experience, as someone who had never written commercial software before, but he was really quick to absorb everything we threw at him. We gave him a chance. As predicted, he was stellar, and we had a really good run with him until he moved on to a much more illustrious employer. A few years later he became a senior principal engineer at Stripe, going from a physics lab, then a starry-eyed K-12 software startup, to being a big deal at one of Silicon Valley’s finest firms. An unsurprising path for one of “the best.” While building the different companies I worked at, I’ve run several times into “Davids” who ended up with meteoric career trajectories, sometimes already pedigreed in all the right ways, sometimes completely invisible to everyone but the trained eye of a CTO looking for gold. What is special about someone like that? And how can you, with your humble hiring budget, identify them before their value is obvious to everybody else in the market? With David, it was obvious that I had lucked my way into finding him. He had to badger me into seeing what he was capable of, at a time when I was only looking for obvious signs of success. Later on at my game studio, thanks to a brutally skewed job market, I had the total pick of the litter during Hiring Summer and could select one or two stellar engineers from hundreds of perfectly reasonable applicants. There was hardly any competition, with money drying up all around the industry. Again, I found a diamond in the rough. But this time I had the right knowledge and strategies in place to end up with the kind of team I wanted with far less reliance on luck. Even as I was drowning in hundreds of resumes that all started to look the same, “the best” candidate was still in there, like a needle in a haystack. This time, I felt like I was actually skilled enough to find that hidden gem, not simply crossing my fingers and relying on luck alone. That’s a feeling of empowerment I would like you to experience as well. Of course, when every company says they have the best people, the math doesn’t work out. And of course, if they regularly have to fire staff, something doesn’t add up again. One day you end up landing a job at one of these companies and realize that the braggadocio was hardly reflective of reality, but then again, it’s all part of the startup founder LARP that requires you play the part. “Our team is okay, you will probably like working here, we sometimes know what we’re doing” would be a much more accurate depiction, but you’ll never find that quote on the careers page. Regardless, you want to be a good Boy Scout CTO and live up to the lofty expectations set for you by the Silicon Valley elders, and at least try to hire “the best of the best” as they say in all of the fireside chats. But then, a question naturally emerges: what exactly do we mean by the best? The accolades? Pedigrees? Github stars? Hacker News front pages? Job title? Celebrity employers? Number of former YCombinator companies worked at? Hackathon wins? Typing speed? Clout among other Rust developers wearing fuzzy animal costumes? That all sounds good, I guess, but is that all relevant to your company? It turns out that “the best” is mostly subjective and specific to your situation. The culture, the vibe, the industry, the processes of your company, and the technical choices will all influence who will be a phenomenal addition to your tribe. That person might not be the same individual bringing in a million or two a year at Meta. In fact, that highly pedigreed, highly connected individual might be a net negative for your company, even though they might, at least on paper, seem the most high-end among candidates. They may blow the mind of a recruiter at Netflix, but they may not want to schlep through all of the messiness and chaos of an early stage company still trying to define itself. They’re not the best for you, and they’re likely not the best for startups, but plenty of other people are. Your job is to determine what those traits are and where to find people who have them. Your company, timing, industry, problem space and founding team personalities are unique, which is why a generic blog post or a book could never tell you exactly what hires are optimal for you. However, experience shows that there are many universal winning commonalities between great hires that will be applicable regardless of your early stage company’s unique DNA. I identify 11 of them below. The 11 traits: As a side note, I found Patrick Lencioni’s framework from The Ideal Team Player to survive first contact with both pre-seed and Series A+ realities. It’s one of those dry-as-dust HBR book club management self-help guides that get an eyeroll by your median 20-year-old founder going through YCombinator, but in my experience it confirmed and put a simple model around something I had personally seen emerge again and again in the field. Lencioni identifies three essential traits: hunger, humility and smarts, the latter of which should have been called EQ all along. You’ll see them referenced below. The three criteria may seem obvious at a glance, but having a simple framework to work with as you’re making hundreds of decisions makes a big difference. Simple things done right turn out to be pretty darn powerful. Let’s take a closer look at the 11 commonalities among great startup hires I’ve identified. Some of them are simply statistically likely to occur due to the nature of startup hiring. Others are ones you should straight up filter for when you’re doing your search. The best hires in the early stages are usually non-obviously good to the untrained eye. They don’t look as appealing to employers with infinite resources who otherwise would have already hired them. If they were obviously incredible, it would be unlikely you—at your startup—would ever talk to them. One of the most important skills of a startup CTO trying to hire an amazing team is the ability to uncover awesome talent that others have overlooked. These candidates get skipped often due to being too off-the-beaten-path and under-pedigreed compared to the obvious picks that every other company is making. Often these candidates are bad at marketing themselves, don’t know where to look, and are off-putting in some way to the naive search. You have an opportunity to take advantage of that oversight. Realistically, someone who looks like the perfect FAANG candidate who has won all of the math olympiads, had all of the stellar internships, and went to the top CS schools will either: a. get a big cash dump from YC and start their own thing, or b. go work at one of the career-building brand names in the Valley and make a monstrous amount of money. The karmic wheel is just about cycling between those two until that person either gets into VC or becomes an exec at a prestigious firm years later. If that’s what the universe has in store for a candidate, taking a chance on a no-name team with 12 months in the bank, poor development practices and sloppy management is a tough proposition. That leaves a pretty large pool of “everybody else” who didn’t pattern-match. How you go about sifting through them is a big topic I will leave for another chapter, but the key is to look for signals that are less obvious than a Stanford degree and an OpenAI internship. Often that looks like a large volume of work, expertise in unsexy niche areas of technology, an intense work ethic driven by curiosity, and many others. A Stanford CS degree is no guarantee someone will be a phenomenal contributor at your company, but it’s a reasonable proxy of future potential for large employers with long time horizons that allow them to invest in coaching and nurturing their junior staff. That’s not in the cards for a pre-revenue startup that will run out of money next year. The best people for your startup will most likely be senior, or at least mid-stage contributors with several solid years of experience. Too senior isn’t great either, you don’t need the large scale cross-team mature product jousting chops. There’s likely no staff-level work for them to do, and staff-level engineers aren’t just faster-typing seniors. As an early stage startup, until you have enough lead developers, senior product managers, senior designers etc. to set the standard, hiring fresh-out-of-school contributors is a gamble. Junior staff are still developing their taste, judgment, ability to work in a team, and understanding of how to follow the process and when to deviate from it. Without an adult in the room you’re in cat-herding territory. This isn’t to say that you won’t get work done this way, but you could have had someone else in that seat who required less supervision. And you’re at a stage where every seat is mission-critical and the opportunity cost is significant. While it might not matter too much as you throw prototype spaghetti at the wall in the early days, as soon as you have something worth maintaining and complexity rises, you’re now in a race against time. Someone must actively garden the complexity of the work and be ultimately responsible for it, and that someone will tend to be not fresh-out-of-school. Sure, a green dev can care about complexity. But most haven’t yet lived through a soul-crushing, multi-week refactor fueled by years of tech debt, the kind of preventable trauma that earns you “character-building scars.” If they’re learning those lessons on your watch, they’re doing it at the expense of your delivery timeline and your sanity. I’m fond of mid-stage software developers who demonstrate terrific chops, hunger to learn and prove themselves. Yes, they require more hand-holding, but usually the volume of work they put out, and their openness to re-do it, if needed, is worth betting on. You should be able to manage a couple of them yourself as the CTO in the early days, and soon enough you’ll have other senior people on the team who will pick up the mentorship torch. This also means that the “best people” to hire at this stage will tend to be earlier in their careers. The longer great people are on the market, the more likely they are to be identified by the market as being great. Your job as a startup CTO is to find them before others do. Once the market has found them and has actively started rewarding them, they will be out of your price range. Now, it’s worth mentioning that in specific well-capitalized niches of the startup market, companies are now able to pay a decent chunk of change thanks to larger VC rounds and quicker time-to-revenue. Thus, the old school notion that BigCo always pays best may not hold true as often. Here’s a quick sample of many Work at a Startup roles in December 2025. Not quite at FAANG-level, but far from starvation. That also means that, unless your company grows fast or shows tremendous potential for the yet-unvested equity, you won’t get a ton of time with your great early career hires. They will quickly accumulate valuable experience and prove themselves to be stellar, and move on to a prestigious employer with longer time horizons, a great brand name, and a stupendous paycheck that you will not be able to match. Being an L5-7 at BigCo pays a pretty penny, with none of the unpredictability of startup equity and saner hours, but none of the adventure and camaraderie of a pirate ship. For employees later in their careers, that’s not a bad tradeoff. Once they have vested with your company, it makes sense for them to diversify their equities, as they already own one lottery ticket. Being on the receiving end of a reference call for one of your star employees, while they’re still working at your company, is always bittersweet: on one hand you want what’s best for them, to level up and grow in their career. On the other, they’re your discovery—dang it—and you know you won’t be able to counter-offer the type of employer they can now attract. Or they decide to start their own company, emboldened and informed by the experience at yours. In the end, that’s okay. Sometimes a great hire’s growth trajectory is faster than a startup’s, and you can be grateful for having given them a chance to prove themselves and to find a new path that they wouldn’t have otherwise. That kind of hire will have likely made a major difference to your company and having trusted alumni out there in the world doing great things should be a source of pride and good industry karma for any CTO who discovered them. The best hires are self-driven, stoked by the ability to learn, to gain mastery of the craft, and by being able to show off their accomplishments to the rest of the team they want to impress. When you look at their track record, even when it’s not filled with household-name accolades and pedigrees, you will typically see breadcrumbs of exploration, toy projects and experimentation fueled by curiosity. It’s that classic desire to hack things and understand them. You don’t need to ask them to work a little harder, they know this is a big growth spurt for them and they want to take advantage of it. The company is giving them a valuable practice canvas for their skills and they want to make the most of this opportunity, which unfortunately isn’t that common. They love a challenge, they want to prove themselves, they love the work and they are excited by being around others who will push them to be their best. They would have been hacking on something interesting either way, but now you’re actually paying them to do it. They’re curious about how everything works: your company, the startup world, the industry they’re diving into, other disciplines, the tech they’re using. They’re learning, absorbing. Maybe they want to start their own thing one day, or maybe they’re set on using this gig as a ramp to something else they dream about. Maybe they just want the new optionality granted by having your company on their resume. They’re sponges and will gladly take on the challenges you send their way. I remember throwing a big Redux experiment at David in what must have been his first month at work. Again, no web dev experience prior to this. Nobody on the team knew the technology and he, hired as an infrastructure engineer with a background in physics and zero product engineering experience, had something up and running for us within days. He was pumped he got to do something so radically new for the team as one of his first assignments. Ultimately we decided the tech wasn’t a fit for our existing codebase, we scrapped the experiment, and he ran off to the next challenge with no loss of enthusiasm. At Double Dusk we could not figure out why players would regularly de-sync their character positions on the server when using a custom—and wildly complicated, due to needing to replicate Half Life 2-style movement to the smallest detail inside of Unreal Engine—character movement component in combination with our own Unreal Engine networking tweaks, making character movement authoritative on client instances of the game. A big deviation from the defaults. Our newly-hired star engineer, us being his first ever employer, had to dive into the pit of madness. He almost gave up several times before finally identifying all of the spots in the physics sub-stepping logic that was causing the drift across the network. I’m confident I myself would have gone completely bananas trying to debug that one. He was proud of the trust we had put in him, he was eager to learn, he didn’t want to let the team down, and I knew enough about him to make the bet that the challenge would have been just barely within his abilities. Hunger is a massive force-multiplier, and unlike many other traits, it doesn’t seem to be teachable. Failures will instill humility. Rejection will hone your EQ. But you’re either driven to compete, learn and prove yourself, or you’re not. No manager’s pep talk will kickstart that drive in you, at least not sustainably. The hubris has to come from somewhere much deeper. Startups are all about rapid experimentation, trying countless ideas that don’t work, and bootstrapping the skills and processes of the company as it figures out just what exactly people will pay for. Trust-building is critical in any team endeavor, and members who are unable to admit fault, who take up all of the space, and/or who need to be right at all costs will be a real problem as the company matures. The best hires are humble and will happily talk about both their victories and their biggest implosions, about what they learned from their misadventures, about talented past coworkers and how their efforts were part of a team. They rarely claim to have single-handedly carried everything on their backs. As you interview candidates searching for the best, many non-obvious great hires will be bad at behavioral interviews—or interviews in general, for that matter. They didn’t get extensive training on answering questions using the STAR method, didn’t drill stock responses to predictable and tired interview questions. They’re early-ish stage hands-on technology people, not smooth-talking execs jumping from one boardroom to the next. It is your job to fish for key nuggets of insight buried in the rough presentation. After you interview enough people with a similar set of standard questions, you’ll be able to spot the outliers in the bell curve of responses. An underrated aspect of humility in startups is detachment from one’s work. Companies in the process of inventing themselves need to actively cycle through many ideas, most of which will ultimately not stand the test of time. Design for the trash can and kill your darlings are important mindsets in creative work, and they extend far beyond music, film and games. Quantity leads to quality, and a great hire will accept regularly needing to apply a flamethrower to their work and try again with the new learnings from the latest experiment. They will not be precious about it, nor will they feel diminished by needing to try again. The Davids do not keep score; they keep trying and do the work knowing that there’s a good chance it will not go anywhere. That is also highly correlated with their ability to take feedback without taking it personally. They’re not afraid of criticism and quick feedback loops. In fact, they seek disconfirmation sooner rather than later. They have excellent feedback metabolism. Building technology companies is a team sport. Everything you do is with the help of other people, for the benefit of other people. As much as the startup world fetishizes the cracked ninja jedi 10x code-poet, if that person makes others never want to talk to them again, cracked they are not. Someone who is able to work with others’ quirks, understand how they operate and what they respond to, and act in a way that brings the best out of their teammates is worth their weight in gold. Brilliant jerks, as great as they are for producing riveting drama in TV shows, quickly become a net negative in the real world. We’re in the squishy human feeling territory here (aka “soft skills”) and you can’t LeetCode your way into knowing if someone will be an ass. There’s no FizzBuzz for empathy. You have to ask them standard questions, shoot the breeze, interact during the various testing phases of the interview, and outside, and ultimately make a call based on the limited data you have. You will never have all of the evidence, but ultimately you have to make a go or no-go call. Sometimes you get lucky and the candidate discloses a consistent pattern from their past that is obviously disqualifying, but often you don’t. How they interact with you and your team throughout the interview is usually a good data point, and that, of course, goes both ways. Regardless of how you investigate this side of them, it’s non-negotiable, and the best hires you’ll make will all have a high EQ. At the same time, someone highly empathetic, but who hides in a cave and is unable to coordinate their work with the rest of the software orchestra, is not the best. Great team players anticipate others’ questions and concerns, and are proactive about reaching out and communicating both their status and the progress of their work to those around them. They make their work visible instead of requiring constant polling for the team to figure out what exactly is going on with them. Remote environments in particular benefit from strong proactive communicators, as you can’t get away with always knowing what’s going on with everybody due to sitting in the same room for most of the week. One great Loom is worth a thousand words, but a thousand words is still much better than having to pull status out of people. Early stage startups move at a pace that generates tremendous entropy, and someone who’s able to coordinate with the rest of a team in a way that feels natural and effortless will allow the small teams to scale without requiring project management and complex processes meant for lower-performing contributors. Perhaps counterintuitively, I don’t fret too much about competence. To me, that’s a given. If your interview funnel is set up well, with a great take-home project, an onsite, or even a work trial, determining if the person you’re interviewing is competent should emerge naturally. After all, you and your team are technical experts, craftspeople who can look at another craftsperson’s work and quickly judge if it is any good. Yes, AI is getting pretty good these days and it’s becoming easy for candidates of all disciplines to hide behind prompts, but that’s only an extra reason to allow them to bring those tools into the interview itself and showcase their use rather than shamefully hide their existence. How they use the agents, the back-and-forth, the planning, the tweaking, the types of searches they do as part of the exercise are all valuable data points for determining competence, and you should allow candidates to surface them. In-person interviews and work trials are for now non-gameable, so if you’re extra paranoid, they are a great option. Non-obvious candidates will be in the hiring race with fewer other companies, possibly none, depending on your industry. That gives both you and them more flexibility and time to try working together for a few days before making it official. With a sufficiently relevant set of tasks for the work trial, you can rest assured that they’re competent, and learn a lot more about their other traits in the process. The best start-up hires are problem-solvers, not ticket resolvers. They want to understand what the business is trying to accomplish, what challenge is standing in the way of it, and how to make that problem go away. They’re autonomous in the best of ways. They don’t sit around waiting for someone to tell them what to do; they proactively find challenges and opportunities for improvement, iterate on the feedback, and go out of their way to help their teammates. They figure things out, and they do it without needing their hands held. Someone like David didn’t take no for an answer; he assumed there had to be a narrow path through the rejections he kept getting from me, that it was only a matter of his resourcefulness before he found a crack through which to get what he wanted. The communication, coordination and cohesion overheads that emerge with the addition of more and more staff to the roster are probably the toughest parts of scaling any business. A leader’s job is to streamline and remove these emergent dependencies between people and teams as much as possible. Besides keeping the number of hires low, the other powerful lever that a start-up CTO has is to hire people who will be self-sufficient and require little to no support to get their jobs done. They will ask for help when necessary, but they will take pride in figuring things out on their own, checking in with you when the time is right. They will require little supervision overall, and only direction when it comes to their work. If they’re falling behind, being great communicators, they will let the rest of the team know. If they’re early, they’ll gladly pick the next interesting opportunity to be useful. If they’re struggling, their pride in their work will make them double-down and overcome the challenge at all costs. In that case your job is to help them pump the brakes when necessary, or their pace can become unsustainable. A great startup hire doesn’t only think about their respective lane, but cares about the other disciplines around them that their work is impacting. They understand their angle, their priorities, and their expectations. For example: They think about where and how their work will land and anticipate those objections, addressing them in advance. They proactively reach out to those disciplines to avoid yet another coordination chokepoint that will only gobble up time. As more and more skills are compacting into one single individual, we see AI engineers, product engineers, and product managers becoming more technical and moving downstream into programming. This sort of cross-disciplinary mindset buys companies a ton of leverage and ability to iterate faster. Of course, this becomes progressively easier with experience and seniority. But that’s also why startups moving fast benefit from more mature contributors as time goes on. The reduced communication costs multiplied across more and more team members really add up over time. Unless you have very specific technical needs, having a generalist bias in the early days is a great idea. In fact we’re seeing more and more disciplines get compressed into one, with software developers covering UI, UX, PM and engineering, effectively becoming a cross-disciplinary team of one. Even in later stages, half-a-pizza teams powered by AI can move mountains on timelines that felt impossible just a few years ago. Early-stage startups are notoriously chaotic and unpredictable. You might be working on one feature one day, it might get cancelled the next day, and maybe now you’re fielding customer support calls for something you shipped that accidentally blew up. The next day you’re taking a trip to a customer site to chat with potential users. At no point do you know if any of this will make you money, how long until you kill that feature, and how many more of these iterations you’ll do before you either strike gold or the company runs out of money. There are no guarantees in the startup world, except for the fact that your runway will eventually reach zero if you don’t find something worth selling. As a CTO, it is your responsibility to shield your team from the messy everyday financial reality of where your company is headed. At the same time, I prefer to keep as much as possible in the open so that the team knows how much longer the music will play and when it’s time to start refreshing their LinkedIn profiles. I never want anything to be a surprise to the team when I could have been candid about it far in advance. It’s a fine balance between hiding the daily volatility—mostly of the founders’ moods and their confidence in the company making it—and exposing the long-term trends. This type of universe requires people who are okay with fewer guarantees. A startup will never have the time to run comprehensive studies, to build extensive plans, to gain all of the information necessary to make the right decision. Seeking perfection at the cost of an action is generally unacceptable, and you learn much more by failing in a valiant attempt than in delaying a perfect attempt that you might have validated months earlier by just doing the thing. Great hires respect that process and are willing to operate without all of the information, accepting that the team will figure it out as it moves forward, often deviating from the original objective. Deleting existing artifacts or completely pivoting to a new strategy on a dime is the ultimate startup superpower. Anybody who needs well-spelled-out plans and continuity in whatever they’re doing will ultimately struggle in that kind of environment. Hiring is a gamble, but you can tilt the odds in your favor if you stop playing the same game as everyone else. The “best” hire isn’t the person with the most GitHub stars or the flashiest resume; it’s the person who makes your team better by existing within it. It’s the David who breaks down doors and ends up shaping the direction of the company through their relentless contributions. Developing an eye for non-obvious talent is the only way to build a high-leverage team on a startup budget. Yes, it takes more work. It requires you to actually pay attention. It’s one of the hardest feats to pull off in startup team building. It means you must trust your own judgment over a candidate’s credentials. But if you do it right, you don’t just get a “nice” team, you get a team capable of doing the impossible. Now stop reading and go find “the best”. 28 Dec, 2025 | #cto #startups #leadership #management #hiring #recruiting #talent-acquisition #company-building Share: X HN LinkedIn Reddit Subscribe to the newsletter Hard-won lessons on software, startups, and leading teams.

Barry Ritholtz: This week on the podcast, I have yet another extra special guest. Zach Buckwald is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at Russell Investments. They run about $370 billion. I found this to be a fascinating conversation. Russell has been at the forefront of a number of really interesting innovations, indexing and outsource, CIO and smart beta. They were way ahead of the rest of the investment world. Now they’re putting together really interesting active portfolios, including private investments. They work with both wealth clients as well as institutions. You may not know Zach’s name, but he’s got an absolutely fascinating background at BlackRock, Morgan Stanley and Lehman Brothers. I thought this conversation was fascinating, and I think you will also, with no further ado, my conversation with Russell Investments. Zach Buckwald. Zach Buchwald, welcome to Bloomberg. Zach Buchwald: Delighted to be here, Barry. Thanks for having me. Barry Ritholtz: Thank you so much for joining us. I spoke to your predecessor about three years ago, right after the pandemic, but let’s start talking a little bit about your background. Undergraduate bachelor’s degree at Harvard. What were you studying there? Zach Buchwald: I Studied English, so this was not on the, on the docket that I was gonna have a career in finance. Barry Ritholtz: Not, not the plan, huh? So, so you come outta school in 96. What was your first gig? Zach Buchwald: So outta school, I applied to law, law school, not sort of knowing where I was going. And I, and I decided to have a little break before I, before I went back to school. And I got recruited by, by Lehman Brothers. So I spent two years working in structured finance at, at Lehman Brothers, and it became apparent to me right away, I didn’t wanna become a, a corporate lawyer ’cause I worked with lawyers. And that was, that was not the job for me, but I had a knack for it. I enjoyed it. I always liked math, even though I was an English major. And, you know, you can find other ways to put your writing and your reading acumen to, to work as well. Barry Ritholtz: And I’m gonna say late 1990s, nobody had any clue what was coming a decade later. Zach Buchwald: Not at all. No. Lehman Brothers was a great place to, to start my career, but after two years, I went to Morgan Stanley and that, that’s how I think at the beginning of my career. ’cause I spent 10 years at Morgan Stanley, I was very invested in the firm, and the firm was, was invested in me. I learned about, you know, the capital markets top to bottom. And I, I had a, a career there that took me from, you know, from a starting associate role to running a business that became the CLO business, which now is like a real, you know, really important part of capital markets. What, Barry Ritholtz: What were your titles there? What’d you do there? Zach Buchwald: Yeah, well I started as an associate within, within fixed income. I, you know, I was in sales, I was in trading, I was in structuring. I always worked within the credit derivative space. And then ultimately credit derivatives started getting wrapped up in different ways. And I, and I worked on the CLO platform and Morgan Stanley had a leading CLO platform that by the end of my my time there, i, I ran. And that was about, you know, I think about the role that CLOs play in the, you know, in the, in the markets today. It’s a, an enormous origination function that helps, you know, finance a lot of corporate America. Barry Ritholtz: John Mack was CEO at the time, is that right? Zach Buchwald: I was there for Phil Purcell and I was there for John Mack. Barry Ritholtz: Wow. Those are two legends in, in the industry. What inspired you to head over to BlackRock? Zach Buchwald: I went to BlackRock with the guy that I was working for at Morgan Stanley. And we created a business that was essentially an advisory practice. This was 2008. And BlackRock was hired to work on a lot of these situations that were, you know, at the, at the start of the crisis. So we worked with the Federal Reserve, we worked with the treasury, a lot of the big financial institutions that had, you know, problematic portfolios. And BlackRock was very well positioned as a buy-side firm, as a company that sort of had an underwritten a lot of like the problematic derivative products. Barry Ritholtz: I mean, did they, they, did they even have an investing banking division back then? Zach Buchwald: No, we, I mean, we called it advisory, but essentially it was like an investment banking function. I mean, it was really consultative providing advice, running portfolio analytics, thinking about, you know, if you can separate like the liquidity crisis from the actual credit risk and, and, and the, you know, sort of the expected cash flows on these securities, what could you expect to get back? And we, you know, we created a roadmap for, for the government on how to invest in these securities that they took away. You know, that they essentially backstopped from these big organizations and tried to create a roadmap to bring them back to par to repay all the taxpayers with interest. And, and in almost every respect over, over time, the government was successful in doing that. And BlackRock really played a very special role in, in creating those roadmaps. And, you know, it wasn’t what I would think of as like a highly profitable business, but in terms of like the aura that was created around BlackRock as being like a solutions provider, you know, sort of a force for good in the world. That’s, that’s what we did. And it was a, it was a, it was a great role for me. Barry Ritholtz: I recall that era that BlackRock essentially had become the street’s bond desk. Like every brokerage firm used to have a fairly substantial bond desk. And it seemed like BlackRock has just sucked up all that paper and, and all those traders. Zach Buchwald: Well, that sounds like an HR strategy and I don’t, I don’t know that I had any, anything, any part of that, but, but there was a lot of talent for, for sure. And there continues to be a lot of talent. You know, some of those, you know, some of the folks that worked on those, you know, on those assignments are, are essentially running BlackRock now. And it was, you know, it was the consultative nature of thinking about, you know, thinking about the challenges, how we can create solutions to those challenges, thinking about the aspirations and the ambitions and, you know, that doesn’t just apply to workout situations. That applies to all, you know, kind of all the clients. And it’s something that I’ve tried to import, you know, into my current role at, at Russell. Barry Ritholtz: So you’re there for 15 years, eventually you become head of their institutional business. Yep. That’s, that’s a $2 trillion silo. And you also helped establish BlackRock Retirement Solutions. Explain what these groups do. Yeah, Zach Buchwald: Barry Ritholtz: So after, after the consulting practice, I, I went on to run the insurance business at BlackRock. That was a $200 billion business at the time. A little sleepy, not, you know, what I would say is like a growth center. And, and it was housed with the, the business itself was housed with true insurance experts, asset liability experts, people who really understood like the nuts and bolts of, of insurance companies. And I, I did not have an insurance background and, you know, for the first year, I had an insurance guy sort of stapled to me every time I went to a client, make sure I didn’t get out over my skis. But, you know, but you know, this, being an outsider sometimes can actually really, you know, help you think, think externally about some of the things that might be impacting the, the, the, the clients, the industry, the sector, the business itself. And early on when I was in that role, we ran an analysis of the whole US insurance industry. Every company that was bigger than a billion dollars of general account assets. And we asked ourselves the question, what are some of the external factors that could impact these companies that they might not be expecting or prepared for? And, and where could BlackRock play a role in helping them deal with those kinds of challenges? And we came up with seven situations, Barry, that we thought were gonna have like seismic type impacts on the companies. And four of them happened. And in three of those cases, BlackRock went on to, to play a really big role and, and run the general accounts. And that was more than a hundred billion dollars of assets. And we put on another a hundred billion dollars along the way. So that was the case where the business started growing like very meaningfully. And I think BlackRock sort of paid a lot of attention to that and realized, gee, we could play a bigger role with these insurance companies. They’re gonna do a lot more interesting things than just invest in, you know, sort of high quality fixed income over time. You also had some interesting stuff happening with Apollo and Athene. They were kind of remaking the model a little bit. And, and BlackRock, you know, pays a lot of attention to what’s going on in the, in the outside world. And we, we, we grew the business Barry Ritholtz: To say the very least, what are they, 12, $13 trillion now in assets. Zach Buchwald: It’s a good business. Yeah. Barry Ritholtz: So 10 years at Morgan Stanley, 15 years at BlackRock, what lessons did you take from those experiences to Russell Investments? Yeah, Zach Buchwald: Well, first and foremost, it’s all about the client. And if you lose sight of that understanding the, what the client is dealing with, their challenges, their ambitions, their aspirations, being a consultative provider, if you start from a push out, like, here are the products that I have, here are the things that I’ve done before, it almost never works. And it also, that’s not the, the age that we’re living in today. The age that we’re living in is how can I, how can I help you achieve the outcomes that you’re trying to get to? How can I anticipate some of the challenges that you’re gonna experience? How can I help you learn from some of the things that I’ve, you know, I’ve seen in the sector or the industry? And you start from there and it builds a foundation with the client that is just ir sort of irreplaceable. So that’s, I mean, that was one really important learning. Now, I, I, I came into Russell because Russell had like, first of all, it’s a 90 year legacy. Thank you for starting with that 1936. Barry Ritholtz: that’s a, that’s a, you’re coming up on a century soon. Zach Buchwald: Yeah, exactly. I’m really proud to, to run, I’m the eighth CEOO by the way of, of in 90 years of Russell Investments. I mean, that’s, so for a US asset manager that’s old. And I think about the things that Russell has done in that time, Barry, I mean, it’s been a real innovator and category creator. Everybody knows the Russell indexes, which were, you know, sort of cultivated and innovated in all sorts of cool ways. And we all have it in our pensions and our 4 0 1 Ks. You know, Russell was the original pension investment consultant. We created that category. Rus Russell was the original OCIO and we’re still a, a leader in, in OCIO. These are, these are really, you know, sort of important categories that have a big impact on, on the investment ecosystem. And what was, what was special to me about Russell, and the reason I wanted to join is Russell’s approach to doing all of these solutions is it’s entirely open architecture. So the view is we build and implement portfolios at Russell, which is, you know, something I worked on at BlackRock and to some extent in Morgan Stanley too. But the idea is we use best of breed managers and strategies from around the whole investment universe. So if I put together an OCIO portfolio at Russell, I’m building, you know, fixed income manager, you know, the best quality fixed income managers, the best private assets managers, the best cash and, and so on, and best index products. You know, we can kind of, it’s, it’s, we can kind of go everywhere within the ecosystem. And that was a model that I was very excited about because it became more about, like, thinking through the lens of what the client is looking to achieve and how can I use all of the tools and the ingredients available as opposed to sort of a set, you know, set of tools that I, that I had at, at hand from the company that I worked for. Barry Ritholtz: We’re gonna talk about pensions. OCI we’re gonna talk about a little later. I didn’t realize this till I started doing my homework. Russell is effectively credited with inventing smart beta. I mean, who, who knew that? I think of a, a couple of other firms as taking the leadership in that recently. But 40 years ago you guys were on the, on the cutting edge of that. What is it like running a firm that has a near century long legacy? How does that affect how you think about risks and opportunities? Zach Buchwald: Yeah, it, I mean, the legacy is a, is a wonderful thing. But you know, you can’t rest. Like we all know we can’t rest on our laurels. It’s, you know, the, the, the job for me is to make sure that I’m taking sort of the best parts of the history and the legacy, the innovative spirit, all these cool things that we’ve done, and then evolving them for the world that we’re in today, our, our, our mainline business, we have, we have sort of two central businesses. It’s OCIO and it’s model portfolios that we do on the retail side, which is essentially same kind of ideas of the institutional business, building great portfolios and implementing them. 90% of our business is those, is falls into those two categories. What I need to do today is make sure that I’m using all of the tools available. So as the market moves from, you know, active products to passive products, as the market starts integrating private assets with public assets, all of that is part of our portfolio today. And, and so the goal, you know, as the leader is to make sure that the strategy is incorporating, we’re open architecture. It’s, it’s truly incorporating the entire ecosystem into the, into what we build for our clients. Barry Ritholtz: I want to get your feedback on a quote of yours. I found in my, in my homework quote, financial security is a central challenge for this industry. How did your experiences at BlackRock, at Morgan Stanley and way back when at Lehman Brothers, how did it affect your, your concept of financial security, Zach Buchwald: Financial security and retirement security especially? Took me a little bit of time to hone in on Barry. I mean, I think back to my years at Morgan Stanley, and, you know, the job there was very much about sort of like finding the arbitrage and the markets. It’s where can we make money on as a sales and trading function? And we help clients along the way, you know, by delivering the products and services that they want. But first and foremost, it was about the investment bank. And, and that changed for me. I had a, I had a review with my boss at the time, and she said to me something that she meant as a compliment. She said to me, Zach, you can really smell the money. And I went away. And that was not the legacy that I wanted from my career. And, you know, I moved to BlackRock shortly after that where I was helping, you know, the, the government, the taxpayers deal with like, really critical issues, like really big thorny problems that were gonna have an impact on, you know, on the quality of life of the people in this, in this country. And it, it was a complete reset of my perspective. You know, now we build portfolios at Russell, but you know, if I’m working for a pension or a 401k or an insurance company, at the end of the day, I’m serving individuals. I’m helping them. And we don’t lose sight of that. I’m helping them have a secure retirement. Now, by the way, they have to do their part too, because it’s also about, you know, saving, early, contributing, making sure that you’re, you know, learning about the, the plan and making the right decisions. But the role that we play within the industry is a make or break in terms of whether they’re able to, whether they’re able to achieve that. Now you also have something going on in the background that’s, that’s gonna have a very big impact in the next couple of decades with retirees in America. And, and that is that really the risk has shifted. Now, the retirement security risk has shifted from, you know, organizations like the companies and the government Barry Ritholtz: Companies in defined benefits, correct. To defined contributions to defined contribution. Zach Buchwald: So the standard model, the standard pension model is shifting to the 401k and today still about half of retirees have access to a pension. And that plus, plus social security, more or less gets the job done. But in another decade it’s gonna be less than a third. And in another two decades it’s gonna be very little at all. So that means that now the 401k is the staple that’s gonna, you know, result in a, a secure comfortable retirement or, or not. And you know, the, the, the big challenge with a 401k is that the risk of saving, investing and also decumulation, taking that pot of money and knowing how long, you know, the longevity risk, knowing how, thinking about how long you’re gonna live and how to allotted over time, all of that risk will now be borne by the individual. And we have not fully processed that in the, you know, within, within the country that this is a crisis that’s coming, that people aren’t prepared to, to own that responsibility. And the system today isn’t set up in such a way that sort of, the decisions are very easy to, you know, to make at the, the onus is really still on the individual. Barry Ritholtz: So that’s really fascinating. H how does that affect what you see within your role as CEO at Russell Investments? Yeah, Zach Buchwald: Well thanks Barry. Our whole mission is built around helping people achieve financial security. And we do that on the institutional side by partnering with corporate sponsors and helping to, you know, ensure that the plans that they’re, you know, putting in place and the role that they play through matching through, you know, providing lifetime income, whatever the set of benefits are is gonna be, is gonna serve the participants in the way that we think is gonna help them have, you know, retire with confidence and with with security. But as the, you know, as the machine shifts and it moves more toward a, a 401k and then, you know, a lot of folks end up with a nest egg that they have to manage on their own. The goal is to make sure that on the wealth side, we also have sort of the right kinds of products and services and solutions that help them, you know, understand the income, help them understand decumulation, help them get the right diversification, help them get fair fees. I mean, the goal is to make sure that we’re, we’re really delivering sort of a set of products and services that’s gonna allow them to live the kind of retirement that they all they’ll hope for. 00:16:12 [Speaker Changed] Hmm, really, really interesting. So whenever I talk to people about Russell, everybody knows the Russell 2000. The question is, what does Russell do? How do they make money on they, they must do something more than the Russell 2000. Tell us a little bit about the different business lines at, at Russell Investments. Sure. 00:16:31 [Speaker Changed] So the index business is now owned by London Stock Exchange, and they, they do a magnificent job with it. And we still have a little bit of the, you know, the aura. Every time I’m in the elevator I see the advertisements for Russell and I think I didn’t have to pay for that ad. We get, we get the benefit. The business is predominantly an a, it’s an active asset management business. And, and we really have one main function, Barry. It’s about building and implementing great portfolios. And we do it for institutional clients and we do it for retail clients. So building the portfolios is really about sort of, you know, it’s portfolio construction, it’s strategies and managers. For 90 years we’ve done manager research at, at Russell we have, you know, a huge team of people. Now it’s augmented by AI and technology helping us look at 16,000 different managers and figuring out, we invest with about 225 of them, you know, figuring out which managers and strategies we think make sense in the different portfolios we create. And then the implementation is one of the coolest parts. ’cause that’s, we actually do the investing on behalf of the managers. They, they typically give us model portfolios and, and then all the things around the portfolio that can, you know, be very incremental. It’s the, the transitions, it’s the, the hedging completion exercise, completion mandates, overlays, and, you know, those things can be alpha generative, they can be very important for risk management. You can add a values overlay for for clients. And so it’s a, it’s a full portfolio delivery at the end of the day. 00:17:54 [Speaker Changed] Coming up, we continue our conversation with Zach Buckwald, chairman and CEO of Russell Investments discussing exactly what Russell Investments does for its clients. I’m Barry Ritholtz, you’re listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. I’m Barry Ritholtz. You are listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. My extra special guest this week is Zach Buckwald, he’s chairman and chief executive officer of Russell Investments. The firm was founded in 1936 and runs about $370 billion. Zach joined Russell in 2023 coming from his previous career at BlackRock. So you mentioned you’re researching 16,000 different managers and internally you’re generating just a fire hose of data. How do you analyze that? What value is that data to the firm? 00:18:59 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I mean, the data is everything and we, we have, we do have a, you know, historical trove of, of data, but it changes quickly. You think about how quickly the, you know, the investment ecosystem e evolves and, you know, managers have strategies that make sense on one day and then things change and, and those strategies don’t make sense. So it’s, it really has to stay current even though we, you know, we certainly value the, the historical data and, and performance and use it. We start with 16,000 and the first layer is largely technology driven. So it’s, you know, we have huge feeds that take into, you know, that, that take in and analyze all of the available information that’s provided to us by managers directly. And also that we can find out there in the, in the public domain. 00:19:44 [Speaker Changed] When you say managers, are these mutual fund managers, ETF managers, private managers, or all the above? 00:19:50 [Speaker Changed] It’s, it’s all of the above. I mean, typically because of our size and scale, we don’t, we don’t invest in a ton of direct like shared products. We do much more sep sort of separate accounts and, but we do invest in mutual funds. We do invest in ETFs or index products where, where that makes sense and that can help, you know, drive down cost or, you know, help with the diversification. But, but the managers is for the act, the active strategies and active represents, I’m gonna guess probably 85% of the assets in that that we manage overall. Remember we’re using different active strategies as the building blocks to create these portfolios. So predominantly it’s not Russell managed, although, you know, we can talk about the smart beta that you, you, you brought up predominantly. These are externally managed strategies that we bring together and then we collapse the whole thing together in one portfolio. And we look enterprise wide because you might have, you know, three active equity managers and they’re not paying attention to what the other ones are doing. And so you can end up with outsized positions or underweights, you can end up with, you know, people on opposite sides of trades and we look to, you know, to correct or make adjustments where it makes sense. 00:20:57 [Speaker Changed] So you guys were very innovative and helped create the concept of outsource chief investment Officer o CIOs. Tell us a little bit about that business line. Who are the clients and, and h how much assets are, does that run? 00:21:13 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, so OCIO represents the lion’s share of the 370 billion that that we manage. And it’s a fast growing segment, not just at Russell, but it’s growing because a lot of companies are, are outsourcing their pensions or their 4 0 1 ks to, you know, folks that live and breathe the markets and that think about retirement security like we do all, all day long. So, you know, a typical day at Bloomberg might have one top story about a big corp, you know, big US corporate that’s chosen to outsource their retirement portfolio. Now we work with a lot of in-house teams as well. We help by bringing in, you know, any of those implementation services like transitions and hedging. We do that for a lot of, a lot of companies that have internal teams. But sometimes sponsors decide to, you know, to hire retirement experts to, to run their, to run their retirement portfolio and that’s when they would bring in an outsourced chief investment officer. We’re a top five provider and it’s some of the big, you know, the other big asset managers that, that also provide that we’re the ones who do it with an open architecture framework. So the goal is not to, you know, have Russell run the whole portfolio. It’s to bring in best of breed managers and to bring those together. 00:22:16 [Speaker Changed] Huh, really, really kind of interesting. When you talk about hedging, are you hedging equity, hedging fixed income? What, what is the hedging business like? 00:22:25 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, it can be all of the above. Also a foreign, you know, foreign currency, you know, it can be hedging individual sectors. You might have a sponsor that’s in the technology sector and they feel like they already have enough exposure to technology. And so you can, you know, make some adjustments to the portfolio. That way you can also build in a values orientation for, you know, organizations that have a particular, you know, view of the world that they wanna express in their investment portfolios. 00:22:50 [Speaker Changed] So let’s talk a little bit about smart beta, which Russell helped pioneer in 1985 way before your time or my time for that matter. Is this still something that’s a key part of what you’re doing? 00:23:03 [Speaker Changed] So we still have a strong footprint within systematic Barry and you know, Russell manages on average between 10 and 20% of the portfolios that, that we look after. And systematic typically is within that, that 10 to 20% we use it not to make, you know, credit decisions or stock picking decisions. Like that’s not, that’s not our game. That’s why we hire external managers who are, you know, true experts in that we use it to like round out the portfolio to make adjustments to make sure that the portfolio is complying with why the client hired us or whatever their investment, you know, their stated investment strategy says. But smart beta is, you know, one of the many places where Russell was an innovator and you know, these things can sort of take on a, a life of their own as the, as the industry adopts those practices. 00:23:46 [Speaker Changed] We mentioned artificial intelligence earlier. Tell us how you’re using AI and either risk management portfolio construction or just data analytics. 00:23:55 [Speaker Changed] So Barry, we have a list this long of sort of, you know, desired use cases that we’re working on for, for ai. And I, I think we’re still in, in early innings here, but the kinds of things that we use AI for today very effectively are more task oriented. You know, we have it fill out our RFPs, we have it build pitch decks. We have actually, we use AI to, you know, read 500 page filings, you know, which we used to have a human being do back in the day. And it’s very effective at that. The real goal for, you know, for this company is that I want AI to actually help us with investment insights, with manager research insights that’s gonna actually drive performance at the end of the day. And I think we still have a fair amount of, we’re making progress, but I think we still have a fair amount of work before, before that happens. But, you know, that’s the view where having, you know, having a, a portfolio where we look after 16,000 different strategies and, and managers, we’re starting from a place where we, like, as you said, we have troves of, of information, of historical information that we’re relying on and that we’re using AI to sort of help build out that framework. 00:24:59 [Speaker Changed] So I’m, I’m always fascinated by, you know, the old joke is no one’s ever seen a bad back test and AI and those sort of things are o only capable of looking at what’s already occurred and built into all, all of those back tests and to some, some degree built in to AI is that the future is gonna resemble the past. How do you navigate around that? Because sometimes the future doesn’t resemble the past, just look at AI and how it’s changing so many aspects of, of various businesses. Yeah, 00:25:34 [Speaker Changed] Well that’s a place where, you know, I’m still pretty optimistic that there’s an enormous amount of value creation to come Barry, because the, you know, what we’ve seen from AI so far, at least how it’s, how it’s shown up in terms of, you know, in the, in the market performance has been almost entirely Harvard in the technology sector. It’s where, you know, sort of where ai, EEE exists. What we haven’t seen yet is all of the other sectors that we know are gonna be sort of enormously impacted by the proper use of ai, the creative and innovative use of ai. So, you know, you see a little bit of it in like healthcare and life sciences, but you know, logistics and shipping and consumer goods and in investments, asset management, they’re all gonna get transformed by AI because it’s changing things. And you know, this is where I’m, I’m really optimistic that we have a lot more room to run in, in, in the markets today is because you’re still not seeing like all the, you know, the potential and the benefits of, of AI showing up in some of these, you know, what we think of as sectors that are peripheral to technology. 00:26:37 But you know, in truth technology is like critical to how we, you know, how we all exist. 00:26:42 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. Makes makes a lot of sense. Let’s talk about private markets. How can Russell Investments help their clients access private markets between AI and privates? Those are probably the two hottest topics we’ve been talking about this year. 00:26:57 [Speaker Changed] So privates represents about 7% of the portfolios that we manage. It’s heavier in, in the institutional portfolios. It’s lighter right now within wealth portfolios. There’s a lot more growth that’s, that’s gonna happen, especially in wealth. I think the average wealth client has something like one or 2% of their portfolio outside of their real estate holdings about one or 2% in private. And that number is going to grow and, and should grow, right? Because this is a really important source of, you know, re return and risk diversification. And if you rely on the historical precedence, it’s been an enormous outperformer writ large. And so, you know, kind of delivering, you know, access is a, it’s a very important, you know, function that we do at Russell, but also that we work with our financial advisor partners to, to figure out the best ways. ’cause it’s, you know, how you deliver privates to to, to institutional investors is, is different, right? 00:27:48 There’s tax considerations and reporting considerations, liquidity considerations that all need to be considered with, with individuals. So we’re trying to do this, you know, really judiciously within wealth portfolios, wealthy people, wealthy families, there’s a lot of room to run here. You know, I’m being extra cautious when I think about, you know, sort of 4 0 1 ks or you know, 401k graduates, you know, middle class people nest eggs. ’cause that’s where, you know, I think about are these appropriate investments? Do they help with financial security? Can you get your money back when you need it? Are the fees, you know, fair and appropriate? And, and so I think you need to be extra careful with, with, you know, sort of true working people, working families and their, their retirement nest eggs. But wealth at large, there’s a, there’s a ton of room for, for private markets. 00:28:36 [Speaker Changed] So, so you mentioned 7%. Where could this possibly go? Is this 10%, 15%, 20%? I, I’ve heard people say 60 40 is out, it’s now 50, 30, 20 or whatever the numbers add up to. 00:28:52 [Speaker Changed] I don’t know where it gets to. It’s certainly gonna be north of, of 7%. You know, I think it’s, I think you have to think not only about what’s appropriate for the portfolios. Listen, if you do a backward looking analysis of private equity and private credit, you know, which I, outside of, you know, specific real estate investments that people choose themselves. Those are like the two biggest food groups. If you run an analysis of what those investments looked like over the last 20 years, Barry, it’s gonna be different than what you’re gonna get in the next 20 years for a lot of reasons. But, you know, I’ll tell you from my personal perspective right now, you know, in the last two years my vet’s office has been bought by private equity. Wow. My landscaper, my garbage collection, my dentist, they’re all owned by private equity now. 00:29:36 And you know, they’re doing these rollups and there’s lots of efficiencies to be created on bringing these, you know, these practices together. But, you know, that’s a pretty different investment than buying a company, right? And making a company better and selling that company, which historically is, you know, where, where private equity made its name and its reputation and the, and the return stream that we’ve seen. So, you know, another thing I think about is how am I gonna make sure that the, you know, risk and return profiles I’m putting into these portfolios that we can, you know, reasonably predict what they’re gonna look like and that we can manage them, you know, sort of appropriately given that the asset pools might look a little different than what we were, you know, what we were investing in 10 years ago. 00:30:16 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. Really, really interesting. So let’s talk a little bit about some of the things that are going on in the market today. Fee compression has been a giant factor really since the financial crisis. You recently decided to reduce some of the fees on your flagship fixed income products. Tell us a little bit about what drove your decision and what are you thinking about in terms of fees generally? 00:30:44 [Speaker Changed] I mean, the governing precept Barry is always to make sure we’re providing value to the clients. And, you know, we do that by charging a fair and appropriate fee for what it is we’re doing. If, if I’m gonna focus on anything, it’s less about what’s the fee that I can charge and more about making sure that I’m invaluable to these clients and that we’re really, you know, helping them achieve their goals. When you, the truth is, when you do a great job for the client, the fee almost becomes not an issue. Now having said that, we have some businesses that are scaled businesses and that I compete with, you know, with other good providers and I have to make sure that we’re staying competitive. So we’re not in any way immune to fee compression. But, you know, but if you can provide a really good value proposition, it’s not such a big deal. 00:31:28 [Speaker Changed] So this has been an ongoing factor in, in the industry, particularly for active managers. And, and Russell is primarily an active manager. Are you seeing any changes in this trend globally? I mean it started very much in the United States with, with entities like BlackRock and, and especially Vanguard, your global firm. What does this look like overseas? 00:31:53 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, fee compression in our space is, you know, it is, comes through in different ways globally. O-O-C-I-O is the place where we’ve been sort of most susceptible to, you know, to fee compression Barry. And, you know, if I think about who we compete against, the landscape has changed for us over the last 10 years. You know, 10 years ago I competed largely against like the consult the traditional consultants. And we had a very different offering. We actually implemented the portfolio. We weren’t just doing manager research sort of on paper. We were actually trading the portfolio and, you know, doing the risk management and the overlays and the completions things that were a very big value add. And we were unique in that respect. And then along came the really big asset managers that saw OCIO in, in part as sort of a distribution function. You know, if I can deliver the entire portfolio, I can put a lot of my own underlying products into that portfolio. And by the way, that can be a great business for you if you have. But 00:32:45 [Speaker Changed] That, that’s a closed architecture. You guys run a very open architecture. 00:32:48 [Speaker Changed] We run a completely open architecture and we’re unique in that it’s true open architecture, 80 plus percent and sometimes a hundred percent of the assets come from third party managers. But we still have to compete against organizations that are running their own version, which might be closed or semi, semi closed. And you know, if you have a whole lot of underlying products you’re putting into the portfolio, it gives you a lot of leeway to change the fee or to compress the fee at the OCIO level because you’re making money in all sorts of other ways. Russell doesn’t do that. So it does mean that we were susceptible to some of the fee compression and our fees have narrowed. But the way I see the solution here is just to make sure that the value proposition that we’re offering, the way we go about building an OCIO, the costs that it, you know, it takes the, the, the, the human capital that’s required. You know, we put over a hundred million dollars into our technology system that allows us to build these open architecture portfolios. When clients understand what it is that they get from us. Paying a slightly higher fee doesn’t seem to be a big deal. 00:33:47 [Speaker Changed] What about the private markets that we’re looking at? We were talking about private equity, private credit. Yep. First, is it possible that those sort of things can be indexed and then second, they’ve always been pricier than public markets? Are we started to see any fee compression along those lines? 00:34:06 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, so we haven’t seen a ton of fee compression. I mean, those are cases where I think the value proposition is crystal clear and, you know, the high performing managers can charge higher fees or, you know, substantial fees because they’ve really delivered. And you know, in general, they continue to deliver. I think if they stop delivering and the, or, you know, and, and we start seeing what look more like public markets performance or even weak public markets performance, it’s gonna be much harder for them to charge those, those fees. But that hasn’t happened yet. You know, especially within private credit and, and private equity. There’s been, you know, real outperformance, especially at the top of the heap versus the public markets. So it becomes easier to, to justify those fees. 00:34:47 [Speaker Changed] Makes a lot of sense. So let’s, let’s venture into the world of public policy a little bit. You’ve proposed national account programs to help young people start investing early. The most recent big bill that passed in this administration has these accounts for babies e every kid that’s gonna be born is gonna get, what is it, 1500 or $3,000? I don’t know what number? 00:35:11 [Speaker Changed] Thousand 00:35:11 [Speaker Changed] Dollars. A thousand dollars. All right. Better than nothing. But where do you see these sort of programs going? And if you start investing at age one day, what potential compounding can we see 50, 75, a hundred years later? 00:35:28 [Speaker Changed] Now you’re really talking my language. When Trump was elected, I wrote a piece that we put into Barron’s that Barron’s published saying that we should give a thousand dollars to every kid in America and open an investment account and let them actually learn about the power of compounding. Because it’s different when you actually own the assets. And you know, when, when you give people an investment account, you can find lots of ways to create some education, you know, investment education that goes along with it. And 00:35:51 [Speaker Changed] Lemme just interrupt you ’cause it sounds like a lot of money. There are 3 million kids born a year. It’s $3 billion. Yeah. Which to a $31 trillion economy and a six or $7 trillion government spend is, is a rounding error. 00:36:07 [Speaker Changed] It it, it’s nothing in the grand scheme of things. And you know, the, you know, you’re onto something because it got actually got criticized by both the right and the left and the right said, oh, this is another entitlement program. Oh. Anyway, we put this thing into Barron’s and to my surprise and delight, it ended up in, in the big beautiful bill. And it actually got, it actually passed. It 00:36:24 [Speaker Changed] Became passed and funded, right? 00:36:26 [Speaker Changed] It became legislation and, you know, treasury is working hard now thinking through, you know, the implementation and we’re, we’re helping along the way. It’s, it’s an awesome program because fundamentally what it does is it makes investing universal. You know, all of these families in the United States that think that investing is not for them or they never had any exposure to it. And that’s, by the way, most of America right now, to the extent they have a a, you know, have a kid, they’re going to have an investment account that that’s, you know, there is a, there is a thousand dollars to, to kick kickstart it from the government. But there’s gonna be lots of avenues for families to make continued contributions for employers to make contributions for philanthropies to make contributions over time on, on hopefully a tax advantaged basis. And folks are gonna see the way compounding really works. 00:37:17 So it’s not the $1,000 contribution, which as you said is kind of a drop in the bucket, at least as a, you know, as a, as a burden on, on society. It’s the, it’s, you know, what can you pull together from all of the different constituents that are gonna wanna contribute to a program like this. So we’re, we’re really excited. And you know, I think that ultimately, I hope this will dovetail with retirement security. You know, you, you said it when, when you asked what can happen in 50 or 75 years, I think initially, you know, the thought is these might help fund college education. And by the way, with a little bit of contributions on an ongoing basis, it will fund a college education with, with the compounding. But over time there’s six or seven of these programs and eventually, you know, maybe we can pull them all together and create a, a national program that actually funds people’s retirement 00:38:06 [Speaker Changed] Coming up. We continue our conversation with Zach Buckwald, he’s chairman and chief executive officer of Russell Investments discussing the state of markets today. I’m Barry Riol, you’re listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. 00:38:35 I am Barry Ritholtz. You are listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. My extra special guest this week is Zach Buckwald, he’s chairman and chief executive officer of Russell Investments. The firm was founded in 1936 and runs about $370 billion. Zach joined Russell in 2023 coming from his previous career at BlackRock. I, I’m a fan of using milestones as an excuse to give some sort of a gift. You can see sweet sixteens or kid turns 13 or whatever it is. Yep. Grandma and grandpa write a check and put it right into their account. Here’s some Eli Lilly or here’s some whatever s and p 500. Knock yourself out. And that’s gonna just appreciate over the next, you know, x number of decades. It, it could really make a substantial difference in, in the retirement of environment people who have yet to even be born. 00:39:33 [Speaker Changed] It’s absolutely true. And, and by the way, it’s investing in, in the US stock market, right? And 00:39:38 [Speaker Changed] Yes, so I’m assuming the s and p 500 would count and any of the Microsoft or Lilly or whatever, apple, Amazon, whatever big tech company you’re enthusiastic about, I would recommend a broader, more diversified approach than a single stock. Right? I mentioned Lily ’cause I just know a friend just put a bunch of Lily stock in his nephew’s account and I’m like, oh, what are you doing that for? He is like just doing a transfer. It’s tax free and I don’t have to worry about it. 00:40:06 [Speaker Changed] Well, I’m, I’m not a stock picker, but, but Lilly’s a great company. Having diversified exposure in these, in these accounts is, is, is is the way to go. And, you know, listen, a, a generation ago Barry, the version of that was not so much Lilly stock, it was very typically a, a US treasury bond. Right? That’s what you got when you turned 13 or 16 or had that milestone birthday and a treasury bond in the long term. You know, you, you, you’d rather be in the stock market, you get, 00:40:32 [Speaker Changed] You don’t want two, two and a half percent ahead of a above inflation That doesn’t excite you. 00:40:37 [Speaker Changed] I’d rather, I’d rather have the long-term return of the, the s and p for sure. 00:40:41 [Speaker Changed] Especially if it’s a newborn or even a teenager. Their investment window is 60, 70 years. 00:40:48 [Speaker Changed] That’s, that’s exactly right. And and the trick here is you have to get people to actually understand because that 16-year-old, when they’re 22, they’re gonna get a job that’s gonna have a 401k and they have to understand why am I taking 6% out of my, you know, out of my paycheck when, you know, my starting salary might not even be enough to get, you know, to pay my rent and my other bills. Why would I wanna do that? And and they really, if they understand the power of compounding and the long-term implications of that, they’re gonna, they’re gonna buy into it. 00:41:17 [Speaker Changed] I I really didn’t think about my 401k until I was in my thirties. Right. But if I actually had money put in account when I was born, by the time you’re 25, you’re gonna see some impact from compounding. 00:41:31 [Speaker Changed] A hundred percent. Well, I, I’m not too worried about you Barry. 00:41:34 [Speaker Changed] I, I’ll, I’ll be all right. You’ll 00:41:35 [Speaker Changed] Be, you’ll be all right. But you know, but think about all those folks that don’t, you know, the average income in America is still $70,000. Right. All those folks that don’t have access to, to in investments and they’re not thinking about am I gonna be able to make my contribution at age 22? Right. ’cause they’re thinking about can I, can I pay my rent, afford to pay my rent? Right. 00:41:54 [Speaker Changed] That’s right. The bottom half of the economic strata in this country, and we’re having this conversation on election day right. In New York where it looks like at least the leader up until up until today has been someone who describes themselves as a socialist and has made affordability their, their key campaign theme. This is gonna be an ongoing issue, especially for the bottom half of, of earners and savers. 00:42:19 [Speaker Changed] That’s right. We’re, we’re not a political organization at Russell, but I do concur affordability is the issue. And I think it’s not a left issue. I think it’s an issue for, for everybody, almost everybody in this country. And we’re gonna be hearing a lot about it from, from all sides. You know, I wrote a piece after, after the, the, the baby accounts, which they call the Trump accounts, by the way, after that became part of the legislation, I wrote a piece that the Washington Post published that essentially described what these accounts are and the impact that it can have in terms of helping to educate our population about the power of investing and compounding. And it was very interesting to see the commentary, you know, when you publish something in the journal or the post, sure. You get a lot of, you get a lot of comments and by and large, the, the, the vast majority of the comments said, why wouldn’t you just write us a refund check? Which is what we got during COVID, by the way. Right? Like stimulus type checks. Right. And it was the opposite of the point that I was trying to make. 00:43:15 [Speaker Changed] Right? Right. We don’t want you to spend this. Correct. We want you to save this. That’s 00:43:17 [Speaker Changed] The want you to save it and to understand what the difference is from a savings account or a treasury bond and versus investing it into the markets and getting to see long-term, long-term compounding. So it, it, it was honestly, it was a little bit of a, a refresher for me that we have a lot of work to do to help people understand why a program like this can actually help them. 00:43:35 [Speaker Changed] So as someone who’s been writing in public for nearly 30 years, my best advice to you is, is simply never read the comments. There, there was a golden era of blogs in like the early to mid two thousands where the comments were these like fantastic communities. All of that is kind of migrated to Reddit. If you wanna see lightly moderated intelligent debates with some nonsense thrown in along the way, that’s, that’s what’s left of that sort of issue. I, I think even YouTube used to do a better job at moderating the comments, the, the spam and the bots still slip in every now and then. It 00:44:17 [Speaker Changed] Does give you a perspective on what’s on people’s minds though, even though some of the comments are like unhinged, right? You can tell like the what’s coming through, what, what are people’s, you know, fears and worries and concerns. If you can, if you can read it through the, you know, the craziness Yeah. 00:44:31 [Speaker Changed] You have to, you have to fight your way through it. It’s kind of fascinating because I’m gonna just digress for a moment. We all are subject to these cognitive errors and these behavioral biases and, and it very much shows up in, in people’s portfolios and the decisions they, they make. I, I wake up on a day like today where Nasdaq is down 1.5%, I know I’m gonna see a bunch of emails, ah, you told us to stay long and look, we’re down one point a half percent today. I know I should have gotten out of the market. What are you talking about? We’re up 17% for the year and the NASDAQ’s up 23%. This is the price of admission. That’s right. Have to deal with some volatility. 00:45:15 [Speaker Changed] I mean, this is a place, by the way, where technology has not actually served people in their retirement portfolios. Because if you can pull up your phone and in three seconds, you know, you, you work as a teacher or a nurse or, or whatever, and you pull up your phone and in three seconds you see your portfolio is down 1.5% and, and at some level it flips a switch and you think my portfolio is, is, is is in trouble or I should sell. Like, that’s how you get to really bad decisions because we all, you know, we all know long term, like if you’re man, if you’re, do 00:45:42 [Speaker Changed] We all know that? ’cause I’m not sure everybody does. And that’s right, there’s such an inherent bias towards action. Don’t just sit there, do something, right? That, that just seems to be human nature. 00:45:55 [Speaker Changed] It’s anathema to how you’re supposed to manage a retirement portfolio though. You, you, you by the way, you can make adjustments over, over time, but the goal is not to pull out when you think the market is gonna be down. We all know that the bounce backs, by the way, happen faster and stronger than ever. I mean, you’ve, you, you think about like what the bounce back looked like during the financial crisis or during the.com bus, it took years to bounce back. And then you think about COVID or, or 00:46:19 [Speaker Changed] Even April Liberation 00:46:21 [Speaker Changed] Day, right? The bounce back happens. It’s a weak Yeah. Almost instantly and stronger than before. So, you know, this is a case where the phone really does not help you, right? If you’re gonna make a decision to pull out, because you see something going on in the markets on, on an off, on an off day. And, you know, as we’re, as we’re thinking through how to implement new programs like the, the Trump accounts, you know, my goal is you wanna have like lots of transparency, but you don’t wanna make it easy for people to make bad decisions. You have to help them make good long-term decisions. 00:46:47 [Speaker Changed] A a a little bit of choice architecture that prevents those sort of things. Last question before I get to the standard questions. We ask all of our guests, what do you think investors are not talking about, but perhaps should be? What, what are the important overlooked topics, assets, geography, policy, whatever, that, that should be getting a little more following? Yeah. 00:47:08 [Speaker Changed] Well, Barry, I’m still really positive on, on AI and how much more room to run we have, you know, there’s been so much to talk about, about how we haven’t seen a broadening in the markets. You know, most of the value capture has happened within the, the technology industry. But, you know, but I think every sector is gonna be transformed. Almost every sector transformed by AI as much as it was by, by the internet. And we just haven’t seen that come through yet. But I can tell you every company that we invest in is thinking about this and working on it behind the scenes, even if it’s not showing up yet in their, in their quarterly earnings reports. But it’s all happening and you’re gonna start seeing, by the way, you’ll see winners and losers, both, you know, sort of specific companies and sectors, but there’s gonna be enormous amounts of efficiency gains and enormous amounts of, you know, sort of value creation that happens as a result of that. Now, I don’t think it’s gonna be a straight line, but I do think it’s coming shorter term rather than, rather than just longer term. 00:48:04 [Speaker Changed] Back in 2019, I interviewed Joe Davis, who’s the chief economist at Vanguard. Yep. And they had this fascinating research report. Eventually it became a book that all technological innovations take place in two phases. The first phase is kind of what we’re experiencing right now in ai, which is wild prices. Couple of hand, everybody knows a handful of companies, very boom, boom. Like some people have been too many, a lot of people have been calling it a bubble. The second phase is where the value creation spreads out. That’s right. To the rest of, rest of, rest of the market, rest of the industry, rest of the economy. I see it the same way you do. Right? This is just gonna make all of us more efficient, more productive, more profitable. 00:48:50 [Speaker Changed] Right. That’s exactly how I see this playing out. And you still have to pay attention because, you know, we all remember during the, the first, the first.com phase before every company started incorporating, you know, the internet into its business strategy and, and its operations. There were winners and they were losers and, and the winners are still around and they’re, you know, they essentially, you know, run global commerce today and, and the losers went away. We’re gonna see some of that across sectors and you know, that’s something that investors need to pay close attention to. But, you know, writ large, I see a lot of value creation, huh? 00:49:20 [Speaker Changed] I I, I’m, I’m always like to hear that sort of stuff. So let’s jump into our favorite questions that we ask all of our guests, starting with, tell us about your mentors who helped shape your career. 00:49:32 [Speaker Changed] Sure. I had a great mentor at BlackRock, a guy called Mark McComb, who’s a, a vice chairman of the company. And he put me into a, a couple of jobs and he nurtured me and supported me, but he also, he encouraged me to, you know, think like the outsider that I am, you know, when he put me into the insurance job without having an insurance background, he sort of said, bring, you know, bring all the capabilities and the perspective that you have from all the other things that you’ve done, and that, you know, really helped us, you know, think like an external provider and, and, and grow that business. By the way, I’m a, I’m, I’m a, a gay guy in finance, so I, I, I come at it from a, from an outsider’s point of view, kinda looking in and, and that has informed just about everything that I do at, you know, at Russell. And, and, and before that is thinking about what’s working, what isn’t working, what do I think we might be able to do better, what have we not, you know, the question that you asked, what are people not talking about? What have we not asked about? And that’s, you know, often my, my starting point. And I think if I had come in with the insider status, it would’ve been harder for me to take that perspective. 00:50:36 [Speaker Changed] Huh. That’s really interesting. It, it’s affected your perspective. You, you see the world both as a participant but also an outsider. Yeah, 00:50:45 [Speaker Changed] That’s right. And, you know, this is the first time I’ve been to Bloomberg in a, in a couple of years, but when I, when I took the job at, at Russell, even before I’d started Bloomberg invited me to come speak at a conference, and I was, you know, flattered and, and excited. And then I learned it was their diversity conference, and I, I was the, the KCEO and, and I said, invite me back five times to talk about investing in retirement. And on the sixth time, I’ll come talk about diversity. 00:51:08 [Speaker Changed] Huh. That’s interesting. You know, in all the research we we do that did not come up in anything. It’s not, it’s not anything that bubbles up to the top of search. Although the old joke is, if you, if you wanna hide something, disclose it at the end of an hour long podcast, no one will hear it. But you know what it’s like with all the YouTube, there’s a, there’s a drop off, but I always find that, that amusing. Let’s talk about books. What are some of your favorites? What are you reading right now? Yeah, 00:51:37 [Speaker Changed] So I read a lot of fiction, like, you know, Cormack McCarthy and Tyler. I’m reading a book called The Inheritance right now, which is like a family drama. It’s a escapist for me to get away from. I don’t read a lot of finance books. 00:51:50 [Speaker Changed] I’m the same way every now and then, something will, you know, come across that I have to read that’s finance related. I have a big stack of fiction waiting to go on vacation with me next month. Let’s talk about streaming. What are you watching or listening to you? What’s keeping you entertained? It’s either on Netflix or Amazon or whatever. Yeah, 00:52:09 [Speaker Changed] It’s all toddler fair right now. I’ve got two, three year olds in the house. So we’ve got twins. Twins, yeah. It’s, you know, all full-time. Moana and Frozen and Right. Daniel Tiger Bubble Guppies, that sort of stuff. 00:52:21 [Speaker Changed] Huh. So, so a lot of Moana. That’s, that’s my idea of a nightmare. Just 00:52:27 [Speaker Changed] Moana’s pretty awesome actually 00:52:28 [Speaker Changed] The first three times you see it, the 00:52:30 [Speaker Changed] First three times and frozen about twice 00:52:33 [Speaker Changed] Our So our final two questions. What sort of advice would you give to a recent college grad interest in a career in either finance or investing? What would you tell them? 00:52:45 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. First, like, you know, be yourself. Like, we look for people at Russell from all different kinds of backgrounds, not just economics or finance backgrounds. Study what you wanna study, do well, and, you know, be committed. But, you know, if you come at it from an outsider’s, you know, station or point of view, em, embrace that. That’s, you know, this is a, a world where we, we want folks that have different kinds of backgrounds and, and approaches. You know, I studied English Barry, and one advantage that that actually gave me early on in my career was that I knew how to write. And, you know, you think about how much of our, of our business is done through writing, through email and, and, and other ways. Everything you write, this is the advice now. Everything you write is a reflection of you. And it can come up in, you know, something you put down on paper can come up again and again in all sorts of different ways. We all know that when, when you put something on the internet, it lives forever, truly. And you know, your careers are long. You wanna make sure that you’re, you’re, that you’re properly reflecting the image that you want to create. Hmm. 00:53:43 [Speaker Changed] Good advice. And our final question, by the way, that advice applies not only to writing. Yes. But my wife is a recently retired teacher, and she used to always warn the kids all the stuff you’re putting on Facebook and Instagram and TikTok, be aware the colleges you’re applying to are looking at that and the jobs you’re gonna apply to, they’re gonna find that. That’s right. Especially as you work your way up the, up the corporate ladder, that stuff never goes away. 00:54:12 [Speaker Changed] That’s right. And now I’ll give you a counterpoint. You know, we, we do 360 reviews at, at Russell, and sometimes, you know, people that are relatively new in their careers, 25 or 28-year-old will write a review on somebody that they work for, or a couple levels up that I, that I read. And when I read a review that somebody has put a lot of thought into, and there’s some, you know, praise and constructive criticism, how to make things better, I say to myself, this person would make a good manager. And I, and I think about how can we use them in other places in the company. So it’s not just about like, when you’re writing about avoiding the things that you don’t want out there in the world that can harm you. It’s also making sure that you’re putting the time and the effort into writing things that are really gonna help you. 00:54:51 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. Really, really interesting observation and, and, and good advice for people just entering the workforce. Final question. What do you know about the world of investing today that would’ve been useful 30 years ago when you were first getting started? 00:55:07 [Speaker Changed] I wish that 30 years ago I had the confidence to know that, you know, that as an outsider, as a gay person, as an English major, someone coming at it from a different background that, that I could make it in, in, in this business that I didn’t have to constantly think about how am I gonna prove myself, but just by being a good productive contributor by raising my hand, you know, and, and, and, and showing a little bit of ambition by finding ways to help that, that can be enough. And sometimes that being an outsider can actually be a good thing. You know, that it can help you re-underwrite situations and come at it from a different angle. And if you know that and you’re confident in it and you use it to your advantage, it can really help you in your career. I figured that out along the way. It would’ve been helpful to know when I first started. Huh. 00:55:56 [Speaker Changed] Really, really fascinating stuff. Thank you, Zach, for being so generous with your time.

Time Published: 2026-01-26T15:29:47Z

The latest filing comes as BlackRock's IBIT fund maintains its lead in the crypto ETP market. Powered by Gloria BlackRock, through its iShares entity, has filed a registration statement with the SEC seeking approval to launch the iShares Bitcoin Premium Income ETF, a new fund that would provide exposure to Bitcoin while generating recurring income through a covered call options strategy. The ETF will be structured as a Delaware statutory trust and will hold bitcoin, shares of the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), and cash, including premiums generated from options activity, according to the filing. The fund’s objective is to provide exposure to Bitcoin price movements while delivering enhanced monthly income. This will be achieved through an actively managed covered call strategy that primarily involves writing call options on IBIT shares and, periodically, on indices linked to spot Bitcoin ETPs. Coinbase Custody Trust Company will serve as the Bitcoin custodian, with Anchorage Digital Bank as an available alternative custodian. Bank of New York Mellon will handle cash and securities custody as well as trust administration. BlackRock’s latest filing arrives as its IBIT fund continues to dominate the crypto ETP space. The fund, despite recent market fluctuations, now holds nearly $70 billion in assets under management. The latest filing comes as BlackRock's IBIT fund maintains its lead in the crypto ETP market.

Title: BlackRock doubles down on bitcoin fund offerings with income-focused filing
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/01/26/blackrock-doubles-down-on-bitcoin-fund-offerings-with-income-focused-filing
Time Published: 2026-01-26T15:13:18Z
Full Content:
BlackRock (BLK) is moving deeper into the cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund (ETF) market with a plan to offer income from bitcoin BTC$88,326.08 exposure. The world's largest asset manager, with an estimated $12.5 trillion in assets under management, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) a Form S-1 to list the iShares Bitcoin Premium Income ETF. The proposed fund would actively manage exposure to bitcoin, either directly or through shares of BlackRock’s existing iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), while generating income by selling call options on that exposure. This “covered-call” approach is already common in stock-based income funds, and some fund managers have already applied it to the crypto market. Through a covered-call strategy, the fund would generate income by selling a counterparty the right to purchase its underlying at a fixed price. The fund, which doesn’t yet have a ticker or fee defined, would actively manage this covered-call strategy and would distribute the generated premiums to investors as income. The tradeoff here is it effectively trades potential upside for income. Funds with similar strategies to generate income from options include the Roundhill Bitcoin Covered Call Strategy ETF (YBTC), Amplify Bitcoin Max Income Covered Call ETF (BAGY), and the NEOS Bitcoin High Income ETF (BTCI). Still, BlackRock’s entry stands out for its scale and ties to IBIT, already the dominant spot bitcoin ETF with over $69.7 billion in assets according to SoSoValue data. IBIT and other bitcoin funds offered by BlackRock have been so successful they have become the firm’s top revenue source. Some covered-call ETFs tend to dilute net asset value (NAV) as they offer higher yields to investors, partly through the return of capital. YBTC, for example, currently shows it has a 35.87% distribution rate, while BTCI shows its distribution rate is at 27.25%. BAGY’s distribution rate is at 37.1%. Excluding distributions, which are often in the double-digits given the underlying asset’s volatility, bitcoin-focused income ETFs have so far underperformed BTC, something they’re often designed to do given the higher yields offered. Over the last 12-month period, BTCI is down by around 31.3%, while YBTC lost 45% of its value, compared to the cryptocurrency’s 14% drawdown. BAGY, which launched in late April 2025, is down 25% since its debut.

Title: Robinson calls for law to block fossil fuel investments flowing through Irish-based firms
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2026/01/26/robinson-calls-for-law-to-block-fossil-fuel-investments-flowing-through-irish-based-firms/
Time Published: 2026-01-26T14:57:48Z
Full Content:
Former president Mary Robinson has said the Government should consider enacting law preventing fossil fuel investments flowing through financial firms based in the country. Mrs Robinson told Irish funds industry representatives that money must shift from fossil fuels to clean energy. “Literally it’s all about the money,” she said of the climate crisis. “Some of you will know more than others about how we could begin to shift the money. That’s the action that would give the whole world hope.” If the industry didn’t do it, governments should consider regulating for it, she said. “Countries should think about needing a law for disinvestment. The trouble is, it’s the Government itself that is so supportive [of the financial industry]. Will there be the political will to bring in legislation? “It should be legislation that moves us towards a just transition. I don’t think we can suddenly divest in an abrupt way,” Mrs Robinson said. “That wouldn’t be appropriate because we have to remember there are workers in the various sectors.” The Fossil Fuel Divestment Act 2018 took public money out of fossil fuels by prohibiting the State-owned Irish Strategic Investment Fund from buying shares in them. However, it does not apply to private companies that invest in fossil fuels or act on behalf of investors. Mrs Robinson said clear national roadmaps to end fossil use could prove even better than legislation. They needed to include an end to fossil fuel subsidies such as the tax breaks on fuel enjoyed by airlines that meant air travel was cheaper than trains. She hoped the inaugural International Conference on the Just Transition away from Fossil Fuels to be hosted by Colombia and the Netherlands in April would lead to roadmaps. Mrs Robinson was speaking at an event hosted by Green Teams Network (GTN), a group of staff from companies in the Irish Funds Industry Association who work together on reducing their personal and workplace emissions. A number of those companies facilitate investments in oil and gas exploration. Analysis by Trócaire and ActionAid Ireland last year found Dublin-based operations of international financial firms had €30 billion in oil, gas and other fossil fuel investments. Suzanne Senior, cofounder of GTN, is also a funds director with BlackRock, a firm with large fossil fuel investments. She said there was a strong appetite among employees for GTN activities even if their companies were still involved in fossil fuel investments. “Like Mrs Robinson said, it’s a transition and it’s not something we can turn off overnight,” she said, speaking as a GTN representative and not on behalf of BlackRock. “We all know that there needs to be a journey away from fossil fuels but that is something that has to be a transition.” From maternity leave to remote working: Submit your work-related questions here Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Greenland, Donald Trump, Technocracy and the Globalist New World Order By David Skripac, January 26, 2026 As a pilot who frequently travelled to Greenland while serving in the Canadian Armed Forces, I can say with assurance that Greenland is already fully integrated into the American Empire’s network of strategic possessions—and has been since the early 1950s. The World Economic Forum on a Course of Self-Destruction By Peter Koenig, January 25, 2026 Word has it that the 2026 World Economic Forum (WEF) Davos event went down as the worst ever in WEF’s history. Maybe it has to do with Trump’s showing up and everybody, including the Swiss Government, falling on their knees to please the emperor without clothes; and / or because Larry Fink, the BlackRock Chair, now literally owns the WEF and calls the shot on everything. Everyone below him, even the co-chairs, are YES-people. Europe Towards an Uncertain Future By Stephen Sefton, January 26, 2026 From 1950 until the end of the Cold War in 1990 about 300,000 US troops occupied bases throughout Western Europe. Today, there are only 80,000 US military personnel left in Europe, but the financial and commercial dependence and interrelationship are still very much in force. The Legacy of Martin Luther King Lives: Of Utmost Relevance Today By Abayomi Azikiwe, January 26, 2026 Every January on the third Monday of the month is designated as MLK Day where federal office buildings and other public entities are closed in recognition of the contributions of Dr. King as a historical figure integral to the struggle for Civil Rights and peace in the United States. Davos Proclaims End of Western Order: Carney Speech Shows Europe and Canada Are “Third World” Now By Uriel Araujo, January 26, 2026 Canada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney delivered what may well go down as one of the most revealing speeches ever given at the World Economic Forum in Davos. In unusually straightforward terms, Carney conceded that the so-called “rules-based international order” has not merely weakened but has effectively collapsed, insisting that we are “in the midst of a rupture, not a transition.” “Public Relations War”: Pathological Lying Will Cost Donald Trump the Mid-Term Elections By Helena Glass, January 26, 2026 Pathological liars exaggerate events, fabricate stories, or present completely false incidents as true. In the case of the two ICE executions, the lying has been elevated to pathological. When media influencers join the fray of lying they are essentially ‘inciting’ mass anger. When the truth sets you free – lying imprisons you. The Global Billionaire Steal: Wealth, Authoritarianism and Media By Dr. Binoy Kampmark, January 26, 2026 It’s official. This tormented, heated, traumatised planet is now home to over 3,000 billionaires. (That number was reached last year.) In October 2025, Elon Musk became the first man to have wealth exceeding half a trillion dollars. These developments could still take alongside the fact that one in four people across the globe face hunger.

The company that is shepherding the broadcast television industry toward ATSC 3.0 digital broadcasting services, which owns a group of over-the-air stations that very much seeks to merge with The E.W. Scripps Co. despite that company’s insistence the unwanted overtures end, has announced when it will report its Q4 2025 earnings results. Sinclair Inc. C-Suite executives including Chief Executive Officer Chris Ripley will be discussing the company’s fourth quarter fiscal health report in an conference call scheduled for 4:30pm Eastern on February 25. Analysts, shareholders and other interested parties will have no more than 30 minutes prior to the call to glance over the results, as Sinclair intends to release them following the Closing Bell on the Nasdaq markets for that day’s trading session. The results reflecting the final three months of 2025 come at a period of relative stability for “SBGI,” the company’s Nasdaq GlobalSelect market-traded stock. Sinclair shares finished January 23’s trading session at $15.05, and that’s all but flat from one year ago. While that’s better than a steep year-over-year decline, the lack of meaningful growth could be concerning for long-term shareholders, as “SBGI” is off from a five-year high of $38.41 attributed to an early March 2021 surge in valuation. Over the next 12 months, “SBGI’ remained between $28 and $38, in March 2022 began a two-year dip. The good news? Sinclair’s stock has avoided dipping to below $10, a price nearly reached in October 2023. What are analysts forecasting for Sinclair in Q4 2025? Just one analyst reporting to Yahoo! Finance chimed in with earnings per share estimates, putting Sinclair at -$0.06 on very difficult comps tied to strong political revenue at the end of 2024. Five analysts offered revenue predictions, putting the consensus estimate at $840.25 million, down by 16.3% from the final three months of 2024. Sinclair’s lead institutional investors are Mario Gabelli-led GAMCO Investors Inc., with 9.24% attributable equity interest. That’s followed by The Vanguard Group, as of the end of Q3 2025, with some 8.09% interest in Sinclair. The third-largest institutional investor as of September 30, 2025, is Blackrock Inc., with 6.49% interest. Your email address will not be published.

Title: Coreweave stock gains 9% on fresh $2 billion Nvidia investment
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/01/26/coreweave-shares-rise-9-on-fresh-usd2-billion-nvidia-investment

Shares of Coreweave (CRWV) rose 9% during pre-market trading on Monday after AI powerhouse Nvidia (NVDA) invested another $2 billion in an effort to accelerate the company's buildout of next-generation data centers built specifically for AI workloads. The funding, which came through the purchase of CoreWeave’s Class A stock at $87.20 per share, will help the company scale up to more than 5 gigawatts of AI-dedicated data centers, or “AI factories,” by the end of the decade. CRWV closed at $92.98 on Friday. With the early gain, the stock is trading just above $101. NVDA shares are lower by 0.5% pre-market. Nvidia's backing provides more than capital. The deal also extends a years-long collaboration that aligns both firms on hardware, software and data center strategy. The companies will also test CoreWeave’s software stack, including its resource scheduling platform Mission Control, with an eye toward integrating it into Nvidia's broader ecosystem. “CoreWeave’s deep AI factory expertise, platform software, and unmatched execution velocity are recognized across the industry," Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia said in a statement. Nvidia last September entered into a $6.3 billion agreement with CoreWeave to purchase unsold computing capacity through 2032. CoreWeave started as a bitcoin mining company in 2017 under the name Atlantic Crypto, but quickly pivoted to cloud computing and AI after the crypto crash in 2018.

Title: Greenland, Donald Trump, Technocracy and the Globalist New World Order

Will this Arctic island, an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, continue to run its own affairs domestically and remain constitutionally linked to its parent country—or will it be appropriated by the American Empire? To read this article in the following languages, click the Translate Website button below the author’s name. Español, Русский, 中文, Portugues, Français, عربي, Hebrew, Deutsch, Farsi, Italiano, 日本語, 한국어, Türkçe, Српски. And 40 more languages. As an increasing number of strapped families throughout the world struggle to put food on the table and pay for ever-rising living expenses, the internet crowd seems more concerned with US President Donald Trump’s talk of seizing Greenland than with what’s happening to average peoples’ ability to survive. Greenland? Where’s Greenland? For those whose knowledge of geography is slim: Greenland is an island located between the Arctic and Atlantic oceans—northeast of Canada and northwest of Iceland. At 822,700 square miles, Greenland is by far the earth’s largest island. By contrast, the second-largest, New Guinea, is only 303,381 square miles. . . These days, in light of Trump’s tantalizing statements, both the mainstream media and the alternative media are posing some interesting, though irrelevant, questions about Greenland, such as: Why do I call these questions irrelevant? As a pilot who frequently travelled to Greenland while serving in the Canadian Armed Forces, I can say with assurance that Greenland is already fully integrated into the American Empire’s network of strategic possessions—and has been since the early 1950s. Besides being part of NATO, Greenland has played a crucial role in securing the northern flank of the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). This role was established when Denmark and the United States signed the 1951 Greenland Defense Agreement, a bilateral treaty that made Greenland host to some of America’s most important and sophisticated surveillance technologies and military bases. Take, for example, Pituffik Space Base, formerly named Thule Air Base. It is a US Space Force base located on the northwest coast of Greenland. Although the number of service members stationed at Pituffik has been greatly reduced since the end of the Cold War, there are approximately 150 troops still stationed permanently at the base. When needed, this number can be greatly increased on short notice by simply flying in thousands of US military personnel and equipment on C-17 Globemaster and C-5 Galaxy aircraft. Pituffik has a 9,995-foot runway that can easily accommodate all US fighter jets and transport aircraft. . 74th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron F-89s, Thule Air Base, Greenland, 1955 (United States Air Force / Public Domain) . Moreover, Pituffik is home to the 12th Space Warning Squadron, which operates phased array radar sites at known and secret locations throughout Greenland. This computer-controlled type of radar can detect and track Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) and satellites. The same base also hosts Detachment 1 of the 23rd Space Operations Squadron, which is part of Space Delta’s global satellite control network. Space Delta, the primary operational unit within the US Space Force, manages specific critical global satellite missions, from military communications to missile tracking. In addition, the US military maintains numerous Over-the-Horizon radar systems at radar sites such as Pituffik and other, classified locations in Greenland. OTH radar can listen to, monitor, and track military activity thousands of kilometres away, including in Russia, on the east side of the North Pole—Greenland is on the North Pole’s west side—and beyond. Therefore, if the US government were to acquire Greenland, either through military action or diplomacy, little would change. Annexing Greenland would be a mere formality, acknowledging something that has already been a reality for more than seventy years. Greenland has always been integral to the American Empire’s global control grid.Washington insiders have long understood that Greenland’s geographic location is strategically indispensable if the US is to keep a close eye on the Arctic Northwest Passage—the sea route connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans through the Arctic Ocean—as well as a close eye on that region’s vast mineral, oil, and natural gas deposits. Thus, claiming that an invasion of Greenland by the US would mark the end of NATO is a moot point on at least two counts: If Greenland is already solidly in America’s sphere of influence, why is Trump talking about adding this island to “his” Empire’s acquisitions? Aside from rich and largely untapped natural resources—huge, unproven, and unexploited oil deposits (potentially 7.3 billion barrels), natural gas reserves (estimated to be anywhere from 50 trillion to 150 trillion cubic feet), and extensive mineral deposits—there is, I believe, one other main reason for this sudden attention being paid to Greenland. My hunch is that Trump is being leaned on to annex Greenland by certain highly influential individuals who contributed handsomely to his second presidential election campaign. These men—namely, Elon Musk ($292 million), Howard Lutnick ($9 million), Peter Thiel ($1.25 million), and Sam Altman ($1 million)—are now in a position to steer the President in whatever direction they desire for the purpose of fulfilling their primary goal. They are chomping at the bit to form what is known as the North American Technate, the linchpin to a full-blown and ultimately worldwide Technocracy. Musk, Lutnick, Thiel, Altman, and a number of their equally obsessive technocratic colleagues have ensconced themselves in positions of power in Trump’s current administration. They are the modern-day technocrats carrying out the dream of Howard Scott, an engineer who, with Thorstein Veblen, co-founded in 1919 the Technical Alliance, based in New York City. For those readers new to the term “Technocracy” and its history, a brief explanation is in order. The Technical Alliance was reorganized in 1932 and was moved to Columbia University, also in New York, under the name “Committee on Technocracy.” In 1933, Scott joined forces with economist M. King Hubbert—whom he had met two years earlier—to found Technocracy, Inc. Scott was the Technocracy movement’s driving force—its engineer, ideologue, innovator, intellectual—while Hubbert, a geologist, played a major supporting role as the organization’s secretary, researcher, and writer. In 1937, these two technocrats and some other lesser-known figures came up with a concise definition that explains the technocratic philosophy: Technocracy is the science of social engineering, the scientific operation of the entire social mechanism to produce and distribute goods and services to the entire population of this continent. For the first time in human history it will be done as a scientific, technical engineering problem. Though Technocracy, Inc. disappeared (went underground?) for half-a-century, it has resurfaced in recent years. Today’s Technocracy movement is run by an equally radical group of scientists and engineers who, thanks to advancements in technology, finally have the ability to catalogue, surveil, track, trace, monitor, subjugate, and manipulate—or, to put it in one word, control—an entire population and thereby achieve specific scientific, social, geopolitical, and economic ends. Representative government, national sovereignty, the nation-state structure, politicians, capitalism, and even currencies are regarded as nonessential in a technocratic dictatorship. The 1930s vision of Technocracy’s behavioural control system is fast becoming a reality. What we are witnessing with regard to the recent events in Venezuela and the recent discussions about Greenland is a step or two closer to the completion of the North American Technate as it was envisioned and presented in 1940 by Technocracy, Inc. . The 1940 Map of the “Technate of America” . The 1940 “Technate of America” map (see above) represents one of the primary pillars that support the canopy of the multi-pillar New World Order. I picture five pillars holding up a square canopy. In the center I envision the strongest and highest pillar. From its peak and to its peak—in both directions—flow all closely coordinated events, activities, and processes that the world’s powerful institutions and individuals plan together and carry out simultaneously. This pillar is in the middle (the center) because it is unique and of primary (central) importance to the whole structure. In the four corners I visualize four pillars of equal proportions. If the center pillar has primacy—which it does, and if it is preeminent—which it is, then these four pillars are of secondary stature and scope. Each of these smaller pillars props up its respective corner of the square canopy. What do all five pillars reflected in my mind’s eye represent in the real world? The central, or center, pillar, represents the 1940 Technate map. It is the highest and the strongest pillar because it is where the largest and militarily strongest empire in history, the American Empire, resides. It is here where Technocracy had its roots. And it is here where many US-based globalist think tanks—the Trilateral Commission, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Club of Rome, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Open Society Foundation, to name a few—were founded and continue to function. The central pillar is also home to the United Nations(UN) and to the agencies that operate under its umbrella: the World Health Organization (WHO), the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank Group, and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. [Note: Although the WHO is based in Geneva, Switzerland, it nonetheless answers to the UN, which is headquartered on Rockefeller-donated land in New York City. The same holds true for the World Economic Forum (WEF), based in Geneva but connected to the central pillar by way of its adherence to the philosophy and principles of Technocracy.] It is through the UN and its offshoot organizations that the five key objectives of the one-world technocratic convergence are being advanced. These five key objectives are: (1) digital biometric IDs, (2) thought-crime laws, (3) social credit systems, (4) carbon credits, and (5) Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). When all five objectives have eventually been met, it is safe to say that the walls of a digital gulag will have been erected around each pillar—not only the central pillar of the American Empire but also the four other pillars, which we shall identify momentarily. But first, we should mention that the strongest component within—the dominant powergoverning—the American Empire is the US Department of War (DOW). Housed in the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, the DOW encompasses six branches of the armed services. Combined, these branches arguably have the most advanced technology, the heftiest financial resources, the widest global reach, the best logistical capabilities, and the highest degree of operational readiness on the planet. The US military’s role is not so much to defend the country as it is to maintain and protect the interests of the Wall Street money center banks. The Pentagon is also devoted to extending, beyond the US, the biosecurity medical industrial complex. For instance, it can at any point create another Operation Warp Speed with its fraudulent “vaccines.” Second, we should also mention that the State of Israel has long been the leading recipient of US foreign aid, much of it in the form of military assistance. For this reason, we can accurately claim that Israel’s government and its intelligence and military assets are intimately connected with the central pillar, the American Empire.And we can safety predict that Israel will continue to obligingly serve the US by keeping a watchful eye on the rest of the Middle East, including the region’s vast oil and gas reserves. In one of the four corners of the square we have the second pillar: the United Kingdom and the British Commonwealth of Nations. Atop the UK pillar is Chatham House, which formulates the UK policy agenda. The agenda is then distributed to the UK government’s various arms, which in turn promote the policies to all UK citizens. The United Kingdom is an especially crucial pillar because after it pushes, tests, and implements the five objectives of its technocratic agenda in the UK, it does the same thing in its 56 Commonwealth nations, which span Africa, Europe, North America, Asia, and Oceania. Although the UK has thus far met only one of the five objectives—thought-crime laws—the government is desperately seeking ways to execute the other four plans so it can meet all five targets. In another corner we have the pillar of the Brussels-based European Parliament. This pillar is the focal point for disseminating the technocratic plan throughout all of Europe. The European Parliament is a directly elected legislative arm of the European Union (EU), based on the Soviet system of government and without the encumbrance of democratic oversight. Thus, it effectively forms the perfect structure to extend the digital gulag’s five objectives to each member country in the EU. Holding up the New World Order canopy in another corner is China and its multi-titled technocratic leader, Xi Jinping. Since 1978, when one of Xi’s predecessors, Deng Xiaoping, became “paramount leader,” Chinese technocrats have been engineering every economic and social initiative, transforming that communist country into the world’s first Technate. Having met all five objectives—that is, having all five elements of Technocracy securely in place—China is now poised to export its technocratic know-how to client states in Africa and in Asia and to some other nations that belong to the informal, intergovernmental BRICS grouping—namely, the nations of Brazil, India, and South Africa. In the fourth and final corner of the five-pillared square we have Vladimir Putin’s Russia. [Note: Russia belongs to BRICS, but it is its own pillar.] On the heels of China, all five of whose control systems are in place, Russia has implemented four of them: digital IDs, thought-crime laws, CBDCs, and carbon credits. Now the Russian Federation is attempting to rapidly deploy the remaining element of its control grid: a social credit system. Observe that all five pillars act in unison to support the all-inclusive canopy of the techno-feudalistic New World Order. If one of the pillars were to separate from the edifice, the entire structure would collapse. Therefore, the notion that we live in a “multi-polar” world order, made up of separate poles, is a fallacy. Rather, it is one world order, with each of its pillars dependent upon the others, and vice versa, with all of its pillars dependent upon each one. Put another way, no nation is an outlier or will last long if it tries to be. The world’s 193 sovereign countries (voting UN members), plus the Vatican City and the State of Palestine (non-UN members, having observer status only), plus possibly Taiwan and Kosovo (some sources list them as sovereign nations; others do not) coalesce under one pillar or another. Each and all of the five pillars are needed to support the canopy of the one-world technocratic state. The bottom line is that regardless of whether or not a nation is recognized by the others, every jurisdiction on the planet is, to one degree or another, at one pace or another, building digital prison walls. However, it’s not quite enough to have pillars covered by a canopy. The entire structure must be anchored to a single, solid foundation. That foundation is a global monetary and financial system. Importantly, the Basel, Switzerland-based Bank for International Settlements (BIS) plays a central role in that underlying system. Without the support of the BIS and its sixty-three member central banks and monetary authorities—plus the extraordinary influence of enormous investment firms like BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street—nothing I have described above would be possible. In other words, without the worldwide network of central banks, the entire assembly of New World Order pillars would collapse in a matter of days—and with it, all of its presumed power and its assumed authority. Isn’t it high time we resist the technocrats and abandon their dictatorial “science” of social engineering? After all, we have no need for self-inflated rulers, be they corporate or governmental, to tell us how we should—or shouldn’t—lead our lives. We do have a need to assert our sovereign rights, be they individual or national. (Denmark and Greenland, are you listening?) We do have a need to intelligently focus on finding fair-minded, peace-producing solutions to our problems. And we do have an innate, mutual desire to provide brotherly aid to and receive aid from our neighbours, be they next door or on another continent. When we are truly considerate of our neighbours, near and far, we do not infringe on their autonomy, as the tyrannical Trump is trying to do with Greenland and every other territory he covets. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Will this Arctic island, an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, continue to run its own affairs domestically and remain constitutionally linked to its parent country—or will it be appropriated by the American Empire? To read this article in the following languages, click the Translate Website button below the author’s name. Español, Русский, 中文, Portugues, Français, عربي, Hebrew, Deutsch, Farsi, Italiano, 日本語, 한국어, Türkçe, Српски. And 40 more languages. As an increasing number of strapped families throughout the world struggle to put food on the table and pay for ever-rising living expenses, the internet crowd seems more concerned with US President Donald Trump’s talk of seizing Greenland than with what’s happening to average peoples’ ability to survive. Greenland? Where’s Greenland? For those whose knowledge of geography is slim: Greenland is an island located between the Arctic and Atlantic oceans—northeast of Canada and northwest of Iceland. At 822,700 square miles, Greenland is by far the earth’s largest island. By contrast, the second-largest, New Guinea, is only 303,381 square miles. . . These days, in light of Trump’s tantalizing statements, both the mainstream media and the alternative media are posing some interesting, though irrelevant, questions about Greenland, such as: Why do I call these questions irrelevant? As a pilot who frequently travelled to Greenland while serving in the Canadian Armed Forces, I can say with assurance that Greenland is already fully integrated into the American Empire’s network of strategic possessions—and has been since the early 1950s. Besides being part of NATO, Greenland has played a crucial role in securing the northern flank of the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). This role was established when Denmark and the United States signed the 1951 Greenland Defense Agreement, a bilateral treaty that made Greenland host to some of America’s most important and sophisticated surveillance technologies and military bases. Take, for example, Pituffik Space Base, formerly named Thule Air Base. It is a US Space Force base located on the northwest coast of Greenland. Although the number of service members stationed at Pituffik has been greatly reduced since the end of the Cold War, there are approximately 150 troops still stationed permanently at the base. When needed, this number can be greatly increased on short notice by simply flying in thousands of US military personnel and equipment on C-17 Globemaster and C-5 Galaxy aircraft. Pituffik has a 9,995-foot runway that can easily accommodate all US fighter jets and transport aircraft. . 74th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron F-89s, Thule Air Base, Greenland, 1955 (United States Air Force / Public Domain) . Moreover, Pituffik is home to the 12th Space Warning Squadron, which operates phased array radar sites at known and secret locations throughout Greenland. This computer-controlled type of radar can detect and track Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) and satellites. The same base also hosts Detachment 1 of the 23rd Space Operations Squadron, which is part of Space Delta’s global satellite control network. Space Delta, the primary operational unit within the US Space Force, manages specific critical global satellite missions, from military communications to missile tracking. In addition, the US military maintains numerous Over-the-Horizon radar systems at radar sites such as Pituffik and other, classified locations in Greenland. OTH radar can listen to, monitor, and track military activity thousands of kilometres away, including in Russia, on the east side of the North Pole—Greenland is on the North Pole’s west side—and beyond. Therefore, if the US government were to acquire Greenland, either through military action or diplomacy, little would change. Annexing Greenland would be a mere formality, acknowledging something that has already been a reality for more than seventy years. Greenland has always been integral to the American Empire’s global control grid.Washington insiders have long understood that Greenland’s geographic location is strategically indispensable if the US is to keep a close eye on the Arctic Northwest Passage—the sea route connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans through the Arctic Ocean—as well as a close eye on that region’s vast mineral, oil, and natural gas deposits. Thus, claiming that an invasion of Greenland by the US would mark the end of NATO is a moot point on at least two counts: If Greenland is already solidly in America’s sphere of influence, why is Trump talking about adding this island to “his” Empire’s acquisitions? Aside from rich and largely untapped natural resources—huge, unproven, and unexploited oil deposits (potentially 7.3 billion barrels), natural gas reserves (estimated to be anywhere from 50 trillion to 150 trillion cubic feet), and extensive mineral deposits—there is, I believe, one other main reason for this sudden attention being paid to Greenland. My hunch is that Trump is being leaned on to annex Greenland by certain highly influential individuals who contributed handsomely to his second presidential election campaign. These men—namely, Elon Musk ($292 million), Howard Lutnick ($9 million), Peter Thiel ($1.25 million), and Sam Altman ($1 million)—are now in a position to steer the President in whatever direction they desire for the purpose of fulfilling their primary goal. They are chomping at the bit to form what is known as the North American Technate, the linchpin to a full-blown and ultimately worldwide Technocracy. Musk, Lutnick, Thiel, Altman, and a number of their equally obsessive technocratic colleagues have ensconced themselves in positions of power in Trump’s current administration. They are the modern-day technocrats carrying out the dream of Howard Scott, an engineer who, with Thorstein Veblen, co-founded in 1919 the Technical Alliance, based in New York City. For those readers new to the term “Technocracy” and its history, a brief explanation is in order. The Technical Alliance was reorganized in 1932 and was moved to Columbia University, also in New York, under the name “Committee on Technocracy.” In 1933, Scott joined forces with economist M. King Hubbert—whom he had met two years earlier—to found Technocracy, Inc. Scott was the Technocracy movement’s driving force—its engineer, ideologue, innovator, intellectual—while Hubbert, a geologist, played a major supporting role as the organization’s secretary, researcher, and writer. In 1937, these two technocrats and some other lesser-known figures came up with a concise definition that explains the technocratic philosophy: Technocracy is the science of social engineering, the scientific operation of the entire social mechanism to produce and distribute goods and services to the entire population of this continent. For the first time in human history it will be done as a scientific, technical engineering problem. Though Technocracy, Inc. disappeared (went underground?) for half-a-century, it has resurfaced in recent years. Today’s Technocracy movement is run by an equally radical group of scientists and engineers who, thanks to advancements in technology, finally have the ability to catalogue, surveil, track, trace, monitor, subjugate, and manipulate—or, to put it in one word, control—an entire population and thereby achieve specific scientific, social, geopolitical, and economic ends. Representative government, national sovereignty, the nation-state structure, politicians, capitalism, and even currencies are regarded as nonessential in a technocratic dictatorship. The 1930s vision of Technocracy’s behavioural control system is fast becoming a reality. What we are witnessing with regard to the recent events in Venezuela and the recent discussions about Greenland is a step or two closer to the completion of the North American Technate as it was envisioned and presented in 1940 by Technocracy, Inc. . The 1940 Map of the “Technate of America” . The 1940 “Technate of America” map (see above) represents one of the primary pillars that support the canopy of the multi-pillar New World Order. I picture five pillars holding up a square canopy. In the center I envision the strongest and highest pillar. From its peak and to its peak—in both directions—flow all closely coordinated events, activities, and processes that the world’s powerful institutions and individuals plan together and carry out simultaneously. This pillar is in the middle (the center) because it is unique and of primary (central) importance to the whole structure. In the four corners I visualize four pillars of equal proportions. If the center pillar has primacy—which it does, and if it is preeminent—which it is, then these four pillars are of secondary stature and scope. Each of these smaller pillars props up its respective corner of the square canopy. What do all five pillars reflected in my mind’s eye represent in the real world? The central, or center, pillar, represents the 1940 Technate map. It is the highest and the strongest pillar because it is where the largest and militarily strongest empire in history, the American Empire, resides. It is here where Technocracy had its roots. And it is here where many US-based globalist think tanks—the Trilateral Commission, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Club of Rome, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Open Society Foundation, to name a few—were founded and continue to function. The central pillar is also home to the United Nations(UN) and to the agencies that operate under its umbrella: the World Health Organization (WHO), the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank Group, and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. [Note: Although the WHO is based in Geneva, Switzerland, it nonetheless answers to the UN, which is headquartered on Rockefeller-donated land in New York City. The same holds true for the World Economic Forum (WEF), based in Geneva but connected to the central pillar by way of its adherence to the philosophy and principles of Technocracy.] It is through the UN and its offshoot organizations that the five key objectives of the one-world technocratic convergence are being advanced. These five key objectives are: (1) digital biometric IDs, (2) thought-crime laws, (3) social credit systems, (4) carbon credits, and (5) Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). When all five objectives have eventually been met, it is safe to say that the walls of a digital gulag will have been erected around each pillar—not only the central pillar of the American Empire but also the four other pillars, which we shall identify momentarily. But first, we should mention that the strongest component within—the dominant powergoverning—the American Empire is the US Department of War (DOW). Housed in the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, the DOW encompasses six branches of the armed services. Combined, these branches arguably have the most advanced technology, the heftiest financial resources, the widest global reach, the best logistical capabilities, and the highest degree of operational readiness on the planet. The US military’s role is not so much to defend the country as it is to maintain and protect the interests of the Wall Street money center banks. The Pentagon is also devoted to extending, beyond the US, the biosecurity medical industrial complex. For instance, it can at any point create another Operation Warp Speed with its fraudulent “vaccines.” Second, we should also mention that the State of Israel has long been the leading recipient of US foreign aid, much of it in the form of military assistance. For this reason, we can accurately claim that Israel’s government and its intelligence and military assets are intimately connected with the central pillar, the American Empire.And we can safety predict that Israel will continue to obligingly serve the US by keeping a watchful eye on the rest of the Middle East, including the region’s vast oil and gas reserves. In one of the four corners of the square we have the second pillar: the United Kingdom and the British Commonwealth of Nations. Atop the UK pillar is Chatham House, which formulates the UK policy agenda. The agenda is then distributed to the UK government’s various arms, which in turn promote the policies to all UK citizens. The United Kingdom is an especially crucial pillar because after it pushes, tests, and implements the five objectives of its technocratic agenda in the UK, it does the same thing in its 56 Commonwealth nations, which span Africa, Europe, North America, Asia, and Oceania. Although the UK has thus far met only one of the five objectives—thought-crime laws—the government is desperately seeking ways to execute the other four plans so it can meet all five targets. In another corner we have the pillar of the Brussels-based European Parliament. This pillar is the focal point for disseminating the technocratic plan throughout all of Europe. The European Parliament is a directly elected legislative arm of the European Union (EU), based on the Soviet system of government and without the encumbrance of democratic oversight. Thus, it effectively forms the perfect structure to extend the digital gulag’s five objectives to each member country in the EU. Holding up the New World Order canopy in another corner is China and its multi-titled technocratic leader, Xi Jinping. Since 1978, when one of Xi’s predecessors, Deng Xiaoping, became “paramount leader,” Chinese technocrats have been engineering every economic and social initiative, transforming that communist country into the world’s first Technate. Having met all five objectives—that is, having all five elements of Technocracy securely in place—China is now poised to export its technocratic know-how to client states in Africa and in Asia and to some other nations that belong to the informal, intergovernmental BRICS grouping—namely, the nations of Brazil, India, and South Africa. In the fourth and final corner of the five-pillared square we have Vladimir Putin’s Russia. [Note: Russia belongs to BRICS, but it is its own pillar.] On the heels of China, all five of whose control systems are in place, Russia has implemented four of them: digital IDs, thought-crime laws, CBDCs, and carbon credits. Now the Russian Federation is attempting to rapidly deploy the remaining element of its control grid: a social credit system. Observe that all five pillars act in unison to support the all-inclusive canopy of the techno-feudalistic New World Order. If one of the pillars were to separate from the edifice, the entire structure would collapse. Therefore, the notion that we live in a “multi-polar” world order, made up of separate poles, is a fallacy. Rather, it is one world order, with each of its pillars dependent upon the others, and vice versa, with all of its pillars dependent upon each one. Put another way, no nation is an outlier or will last long if it tries to be. The world’s 193 sovereign countries (voting UN members), plus the Vatican City and the State of Palestine (non-UN members, having observer status only), plus possibly Taiwan and Kosovo (some sources list them as sovereign nations; others do not) coalesce under one pillar or another. Each and all of the five pillars are needed to support the canopy of the one-world technocratic state. The bottom line is that regardless of whether or not a nation is recognized by the others, every jurisdiction on the planet is, to one degree or another, at one pace or another, building digital prison walls. However, it’s not quite enough to have pillars covered by a canopy. The entire structure must be anchored to a single, solid foundation. That foundation is a global monetary and financial system. Importantly, the Basel, Switzerland-based Bank for International Settlements (BIS) plays a central role in that underlying system. Without the support of the BIS and its sixty-three member central banks and monetary authorities—plus the extraordinary influence of enormous investment firms like BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street—nothing I have described above would be possible. In other words, without the worldwide network of central banks, the entire assembly of New World Order pillars would collapse in a matter of days—and with it, all of its presumed power and its assumed authority. Isn’t it high time we resist the technocrats and abandon their dictatorial “science” of social engineering? After all, we have no need for self-inflated rulers, be they corporate or governmental, to tell us how we should—or shouldn’t—lead our lives. We do have a need to assert our sovereign rights, be they individual or national. (Denmark and Greenland, are you listening?) We do have a need to intelligently focus on finding fair-minded, peace-producing solutions to our problems. And we do have an innate, mutual desire to provide brotherly aid to and receive aid from our neighbours, be they next door or on another continent. When we are truly considerate of our neighbours, near and far, we do not infringe on their autonomy, as the tyrannical Trump is trying to do with Greenland and every other territory he covets. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

The dollar extended its selloff on Monday as speculation swirled that the US could coordinate intervention with Japanese authorities to support the yen. Gold topped $5,000 an ounce. The greenback fell for a third day, losing ground against all major peers to hit the lowest since September. The yen rallied to its highest level in two months. US stock futures fluctuated. Precious metals extended their breakneck rally as gold hit a fresh record and silver surged 6%. The volatility in foreign-exchange markets follows signs that Tokyo and Washington coordinated on rate checks, a step that can be taken to prepare for direct intervention. Joint US-Japan action would give authorities greater power to deter speculators after the yen hit an 18-month low earlier this month. “The bigger signal is policy coordination,” said Daniel Baeza, senior vice president at Frontclear. “If markets interpret coordination as a willingness to tolerate easier global dollar conditions, especially alongside a dovish Fed reaction function, that could reinforce short-term dollar downside.” Treasuries rose across the curve as traders added to bets for 2026 interest-rate cuts after BlackRock Inc. executive Rick Rieder's candidacy to helm the Federal Reserve gained momentum. With an announcement on the next Fed chair possible as soon as this week, rate expectations will be in focus as current Chair Jerome Powell delivers the latest decision on Wednesday. Earnings will also be in the spotlight as the busiest week of the season gets underway, with four of the Magnificent Seven tech giants due to report. The group has driven market gains for much of the past three years, but that leadership faltered in late 2025 as Wall Street grew skeptical of whether massive AI spending will deliver returns. “The main focus from investors will likely be comments around AI-capex,” said Stephan Kemper, chief investment strategist at BNP Paribas Wealth Management. “Any sign of a slowdown could be seen as hyperscalers loosing trust in the possibility to monetize those investments in a timely manner.” In another possible risk for markets, traders are monitoring whether growing opposition to the Department of Homeland Security's handling of Trump's immigration crackdown could prompt a partial government shutdown.

Bitcoin price analysis forecasts a long-term BTC price bottom in the coming days as geopolitics and macroeconomic mayhem seize markets. Cointelegraph in your social feed Bitcoin (BTC) heads into the January close in dangerous territory as macro volatility factors ramp up. Bitcoin closes the week below key support in a move that opens the door to new lows. FOMC week dawns, but markets are focused on Japan, tariffs and geopolitical instability. Precious metals smash historic records while crypto fails to match them. Bitcoin short-term holders show signs of record capitulation at current price levels. “Tactical” Bitcoin selling pressure is ongoing, with liquidity able to absorb the distribution. Bitcoin dropped to $86,000 around Sunday’s weekly close — a target already on the radar for traders. Data from TradingView showed buyers defending that level into the week’s first Asia trading session, with $90,000 still out of reach. “There’s so much volatility ahead of us coming week. Not only on the Bitcoin & Crypto markets, but also in forex, commodities & bond markets,” crypto trader, analyst and entrepreneur Michaël van de Poppe said in a post on X. After closing the week below $86,500, BTC/USD is in a thoroughly bearish position, per Material Indicators cofounder Keith Alan. In his latest analysis, Alan warned of consequences in the event of a weekly close under the 2026 yearly open level near $87,500 and the 100-week simple moving average (SMA) at $87,250. Pay close attention to the weekly close for $BTC! The only thing more bearish than a weekly close below the Yearly Open Timescape Level at $87.5k, would be a weekly close below the 100-Week SMA. pic.twitter.com/WjMitP2Ez6 “Wicks don't count, it's the close that matters,” he added in a separate post showing exchange order-book liquidity data and whale orders. Data from monitoring resource CoinGlass confirmed 24-hour cross-crypto liquidations of nearly $750 million at the time of writing. “Based on Bitcoin losing the mid-range; HTF liquidations to the downside; and the possible US Gov. shutdown, we still think that the most likely scenario is that Bitcoin drops back to low $80s in the coming weeks,” trader CrypNuevo forecast over the weekend. In a bold prediction, meanwhile, trader, analyst and commentator BitQuant went on record to announce an inflection point for BTC price action. “The coming week is significant in that it marks the end of the bottoming phase,” he told X followers. BitQuant retains the view that a long-term high for Bitcoin has not yet been reached, with this due at $145,000. The Federal Reserve’s decision on interest rates forms the week’s key macroeconomic event, but traders have multiple volatility sources to contend with. These include worries over the Japanese economy and the Fed’s move to buy yen, along with international trade questions still hanging in the air. On Wednesday, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will announce any changes to its benchmark rate, with Chair Jerome Powell delivering guidance in an accompanying speech and press conference. Markets will be watching Powell’s language in particular for signs of policy change. Expectations for the meeting itself have long been that rates will stay the same. At the same time, tensions between him and US President Donald Trump remain, along with a legal investigation into Fed building renovations that Powell dismissed as a pretext for changing his policy trajectory before his imminent replacement. “The Chief Investment Officer of BlackRock is now expected to be the next Fed Chair. And, Trump says cutting rates is a ‘requirement’ for the next Fed Chair and is actively calling for 1% interest rates. 2026 is going to be a wild year,” trading resource The Kobeissi Letter commented on X. Macro data itself has given mixed signals over US inflation. Regardless, stocks continue to enjoy a strong start to 2026, while crypto languishes. “Loose monetary policy and an expanding global money supply are key drivers behind bullish financial conditions. But if those conditions also deliver stronger than expected economic growth, inflation could become more problematic in the year ahead,” trading outfit Mosaic Asset Company wrote in the latest edition of its regular newsletter, The Market Mosaic. Mosaic warned that a rebound in inflation this year would trigger moves seen during the 1970s. This week, meanwhile, will also see the December print of the Producer Price Index (PPI). November’s release came in above expectations. In a predictable milestone, gold and silver crossed historic thresholds to start the week, passing the $5,000 and $100 marks, respectively. XAU/USD reached $5,111 per ounce, with XAG/USD hitting $110 for the first time during Monday’s Asia trading session. The relentless rise in precious metals continues as Bitcoin and altcoins fail to catch a bid, having been stuck in a narrow range for several months. That inverse relationship is now beginning to make waves beyond the crypto trading community. “Where is Bitcoin?” The Kobeissi Letter queried in a dedicated X post on the phenomenon. Kobeissi suggested that the threat of another US government shutdown, which it described as “likely,” was “adding fuel to the fire” across precious metals. Van de Poppe captured the pro-crypto mood around BTC versus gold. “Bitcoin vs. Gold is the cheapest it has ever been. At least, the gap between the two has never been this big in terms of fair value. The 2-Week RSI is the lowest ever. Lower than in 2022, lower than in 2018,” he wrote Sunday. At the same time, Van de Poppe revealed an unprecedented potential bullish divergence on BTC/XAG. “What does this say? This does say that the coming week is going to be extremely volatile and could indicate a bottom on this metric and therefore, Silver is likely to peak and money is likely rotating towards other assets,” he said. BTC price action may be rangebound, but onchain activity shows that newer investors are as sensitive as ever to sudden moves. Uploading data to X from onchain analytics resource Checkonchain, the analytics account named after famous economist Frank Fetter wrote that loss-making trades were making history. “Short-term holders are realizing losses at historic levels on the bitcoin CRASH to $86k,” it said. The data showed the realized profit/loss ratio for Bitcoin’s short-term holder (STH) cohort — the group of wallets holding a given amount of BTC for six months or less. The proportion of transactions from STH wallets in which BTC was moving at a lower price than that at which it last moved was higher than ever. The ratio was lower than during the 2022 bear market bottom, when BTC/USD hit $15,600 after a near 80% drop from its old 2021 all-time highs. Continuing, onchain analytics platform CryptoQuant confirmed that the overall BTC supply had crossed a bearish profit threshold of its own. Supply in profit stood at 62% — the lowest level since September 2024, when Bitcoin traded at around $30,000. “When Bitcoin Supply in Profit drops below 70% and fails to recover above 80%, it is historically a sign of a potential further decline and often a confirmation of a bear market,” contributor El Crypto Tavo wrote in an accompanying Quicktake blog post. Discussing the weekend’s drop to $86,000, CryptoQuant appeared unalarmed. Related: GameStop ‘likely to sell’ Bitcoin holdings, Ethereum preps for quantum: Hodler’s Digest, Jan. 18 – 24 Analyzing volume delta on exchange order books, contributor Arab Chain argued that the market was not experiencing a rush for the exit. Volume delta reached a relatively modest $59.6 million on Binance during the dip, indicating only slight dominance of sellers over buyers. “Numerically, this represents significant selling pressure; however, its true significance becomes apparent when compared to price action,” Arab Chain explained. Volume delta z-score readings, it added, represented “short-term tactical selling pressure rather than a phase of panic or widespread forced liquidation.” Last week, Cointelegraph reported on split intentions among the professional Bitcoin investor base amid unclear price trends heavily influenced by external factors. “These values reflect genuine but controlled selling pressure, characterized by elevated selling liquidity, limited imbalance, and moderate statistical deviation,” Arab Chain concluded.

Title: Austrian politician demands end to all Ukraine payments

Time Published: 2026-01-26T10:11:50Z

A senior Austrian politician has demanded the immediate cessation of all financial aid to Ukraine, denouncing Kiev as a corrupt “bottomless pit.” The call comes after the Foreign Ministry in Vienna announced additional humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. Austria has provided nearly €2.9 billion ($3.4 billion) in aid to Kiev since the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022. Last week, Vienna revealed a plan to deliver an additional €3 million in financial aid to several humanitarian organizations working in Ukraine. “Not a single euro should be allowed to flow anymore,” the Austrian Freedom Party’s secretary-general, Michael Schnedlitz, said in a statement on Sunday, calling for an “immediate halt to all payments to Ukraine.” He also demanded the resignation of Foreign Minister Beate Meinl-Reisinger, arguing that “anyone who, despite the crisis, takes money from the Austrian people to give it to a corrupt system should resign as a representative of the Austrian people.” The MP’s demands come amid a wave of high-level corruption scandals in Ukraine that have forced the resignation of several senior officials close to Vladimir Zelensky, including his chief of staff. Western-backed anti-corruption agencies also recently charged five Ukrainian MPs with operating a bribery ring, while a separate $100 million kickback scheme in the state energy sector implicated a former Zelensky associate late last year. Despite these issues, Western financial commitments to Ukraine have continued, with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink recently announcing he is working on an $800 billion plan for Ukraine’s post-war economy. Last week, Zelensky went on a tirade during his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, chastizing his European allies for indecisiveness and insufficient support. His comments sparked fierce backlash across the EU, with Western officials labeling him as “unfair,” “ungrateful,” and having “crossed the line.” Meanwhile, Russia has consistently argued that Western aid to Ukraine only prolongs the conflict without altering its ultimate outcome and has cautioned that all EU budget assistance to Kiev will eventually just end up being stolen.

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Quote of the Week: “It’s easier to fool people than to convince them that they have been fooled.” — Mark Twain Number of the Week: Reduced 2.4% ********************* THIS WEEK: By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) Scope: This TWTW discusses the process of measuring Earth’s Radiation Budget by the CERES project. TWTW discusses some shifts in thinking that were brought out at the World Economic Forum as well as shifts in thinking by the administration on matters such as the Linear No Threshold model and radiation. TWTW briefly discusses the poor market design argument often used by those who want the market to reflect their wishes; as well as major criticism of a paper claiming microplastics are accumulating in human brains. ********************* Measuring Earth’s Radiation Budget (ERB): As AMO physicist Howard Hayden explained in his series “”Basic Climate Physics”, assuming no significant volcanic activity such as that that formed the Siberian Traps, Earth’s Energy Balance is explained by three variables: changes in solar radiation to Earth; changes in Earth’s albedo changing solar radiation absorbed by Earth’s surface; and changes in greenhouse gases concentrations changing outgoing long wave radiation from Earth to Space. Changes in Earth’s albedo (reflectivity) include changes in cloudiness, snow and ice, leaf coverage, dust, etc. Earth’s primary greenhouse gases, water vapor and carbon dioxide, are highly saturated. They already absorb and emit all the outgoing radiation from Earth’s surface in the frequencies (wavelengths) which the specific gases can readily absorb infrared radiation. Thus, a major increase in greenhouse gases is required to cause any meaningful increase in Earth’s temperatures. Since 1997 NASA has used satellites to monitor Earth’s energy balance in a project known as CERES, Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System. Located at the Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, its website states: “Climate is controlled by the amount of sunlight absorbed by Earth and the amount of infrared energy emitted to space. These quantities–together with their difference–define Earth’s radiation budget (ERB). The Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) project provides satellite-based observations of ERB and clouds. It uses measurements from CERES instruments flying on several satellites along with data from many other instruments to produce a comprehensive set of ERB data products for climate, weather, and applied science research. [Boldface added] The goals of the CERES project are to: The CERES team has been collecting ERB data since 1997, when the first CERES instrument was launched aboard the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite. Since then, CERES instruments have launched aboard the Terra, Aqua, Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP), and NOAA-20 satellites. The CERES instruments provide direct measurements of reflected solar radiation and emission of thermal infrared radiation to space across all wavelengths between the ultraviolet and far-infrared. CERES measurements, together with measurements from higher-resolution imagers on polar orbiting and geostationary satellites, are used along with other input data sources to produce data products that describe the ERB at the top-of-atmosphere, within the atmosphere and at the surface. The CERES data products capture variations in ERB at hourly, daily, and monthly timescales and at spatial scales ranging from 20 km to global. The CERES data are used by the climate, weather, and applied science research communities to address a range of research topics that involve the exchange of energy between the Earth and space and between the major components of the Earth system. CERES is the only project worldwide whose prime objective is to produce global climate data records of ERB from instruments designed to observe the ERB.” The presentations at the CERES Science Team Meetings are posted on the website. From reviewing them it is very clear that clouds are a big problem. Clouds can both cool Earth by blocking sunlight and warm Earth by acting as a greenhouse effect. The formation and dissipation of clouds have not been worked out. As Nobel Laureate John Clauser has asserted the global climate models cannot be relied on for prediction as long as the uncertainty of clouds remains an important issue. At the May 7-9, 2023, CERES Science Team Meeting researcher Norman Loeb gave a presentation titled “Observational Assessment of Changes in Earth’s Energy Imbalance Since 2000.” Loeb split the Absorbed Solar Radiation (ASR) data and the Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) data into two groups: 1) from March 2000 to February 2010; and 2) from March 2013 to February 2023. Both the Absorbed Solar Radiation (ASR) of Earth and the Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) from Earth increased, and the net effect is a doubling of Earth’s Energy Imbalance (EEI) from the 2000 to 2010 period to the 2013 to 2023 period. In the slide “Trends in Daytime SW [Short Wave (sunlight)] flux, –OLR Flux and Cloud Fraction by Cloud Type (07/2002-12/2022)” Loeb asserts: Loeb’s conclusions are: Large ASR trend primarily driven by reductions in low and middle clouds. Ocean mixed layer heating (and SST) variations primarily associated with ocean heat fluxes as opposed to surface heat fluxes. Implies rate of increase in planetary heat uptake is relatively insensitive to internal climate variability during CERES.” From this physical evidence we can assert that the warming from 2000 to 2023 was not caused by changes in the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) or the increase in greenhouse gases. The major cause was a decrease in daytime cloud cover. [As a sidenote, those who assert that the decline in daytime cloudiness is from the banning of the use of bunker fuel for maritime transport should note that the vast bulk of shipping lanes are in the Northern Hemisphere while the reduction in cloudiness is in both Hemispheres.] See link under Challenging the Orthodoxy and for Hayden’s essays on Basic Climate Physics https://www.sepp.org/science_papers.cfm?whichyear=2022. ********************* Shifting Winds: The annual meeting of the World Economic Forum took place in Davos, Switzerland, where President Trump created a disturbance. According to Lifesite News: “Donald Trump has called ‘green energy’ and the Green New Deal the ‘greatest hoax in history’ in his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos. During his special address on Wednesday at the World Economic Forum (WEF), Trump said the ‘Green New Scam’ (a reference to the ‘Green New Deal’) is ‘perhaps the greatest hoax in history.’ Trump noted that countries like Germany, which have embraced so-called ‘green’ energy, produce less energy now than they did years ago, have higher energy prices, and have less energy security.” Commentator Jo Nova caught a significant shift in a video of one of the question-and-answer periods at Davos. A few years ago, Larry Fink CEO of BlackRock Inc., the world’s largest asset manager, was the darling of some political groups because he firmly supported the dangers of climate change (global warming) and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) political goals. Since then, BlackRock has quietly abandoned DEI goals. Nova writes: “Way back in his 2021 annual CEO letter, Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, wrote: ‘No issue ranks higher than climate change.’ It will reshape global capital flows, he said, and declared ‘…anyone can see the impact of climate change in the natural disasters in California or Florida.’ Now though, never mind about global extinctions and flash floods. Fink just spoke at the Davos ski club for billionaires and declared that we need ‘trillions of dollars’ of investment for AI. Data centers, he said, are rapidly expanding — one technology company he spoke to said that ‘its data centers currently use about 5 gigawatts, but by 2030 it expects to need 30 gigawatts.’ But like a true banker, he doesn’t see a backflip; he sees only investment opportunities — the world is short of power he says. (He doesn’t say that this is in large part because BlackRock leaned on companies and countries all over the world to abandon fossil fuels.) Fink helped create the energy shortage that he now calls an investment opportunity. BlackRock is the largest asset manager in the world, controlling $10 Trillion dollars in assets, or five times Australia’s GDP. When that much money talks, everyone listens. Now Larry Fink throws wind and solar under the bus He’s matter of fact, with a straight face, almost like he never pushed intermittent generators: Fink: ‘At the same time, this represents a huge investment opportunity. The world is going to be short of power. And to supply these data centers, you cannot rely solely on intermittent sources like wind and solar. You need dispatchable power because these data centers cannot simply turn on and off.’ Larry Fink slides the bomb in after 45 mins 30 seconds: This man probably did more than any single person to pump up the Great Renewables Bubble that peaked in 2022. He presumably has taken his profits long before this speech — leaving mums and dads and pension funds holding the bag with investments in unreliable, expensive generators.” See links under Questioning the Orthodoxy (Nova includes the video). ********************* Linear No Threshold Model: One of the biggest travesties of physical science is applying the linear no threshold model (LNT) when physical evidence does not exist. People die of water intoxication, drinking too much water too fast which dilutes the body’s electrolytes. Applying the LNT, one can claim that drinking any amount of pure water is deadly to humans. Steve Milloy has frequently exposed entities such as the World Health Organizations using the LNT to claim millions of deaths from particulate matter of 2.5 microns or smaller (PM2.5) without any physical evidence such as corpses or even death certificates. In alerting the public that the current administration is addressing this travesty Milloy writes: “The evaluation of a proposed rule’s costs and benefits has been a commonsense administrative requirement before setting new regulations since the Reagan administration. Until the Clinton administration, so-called cost-benefit analysis was an effective tool in stopping costly overregulation, particularly at the EPA. But the Clinton EPA figured out how to game the cost-benefit analysis process in order to issue its most expensive regulations – air quality rules that were eventually used by the Obama EPA to destroy half of the U.S. coal industry. After failing in its first effort to implement an anti-fossil fuel agenda through a ‘BTU tax,’ the Clinton EPA moved to issue more stringent air quality standards for ozone. The problem is that the monetized benefits of the tighter ozone standard (possibly fewer asthma attacks triggered by outdoor air) paled in comparison to the economy-wide compliance costs of the regulation (tens of billions of dollars). The Clinton EPA’s solution was to pair the ozone proposal with another proposal to regulate, for the first time, a newly invented air pollutant called ‘fine particulate matter’ or ‘PM2.5,’ which is microscopic dust, soot, or pollen in outdoor air. As described in great detail in my 2016 book ‘Scare Pollution,’ the Clinton administration developed the false and junk science-based notion that normal levels of PM2.5 in outdoor air could cause people to die prematurely. How did this help the ozone proposal? The EPA claimed that regulating PM2.5 would prevent 20,000 premature deaths per year. Each prevented death, the EPA claimed, provided economic benefits of $5 million. When you multiply 20,000 premature deaths prevented by $5 million dollars, you get $100 billion in economic benefits, which the EPA claimed would be much greater than any possible compliance costs. So, the EPA’s proposed air quality rules passed the required cost-benefit test since the benefits outweighed the costs. By the time of the Obama administration, the EPA was claiming that PM2.5 was responsible for 570,000 (i.e., about one in five) deaths per year in the U.S. and the value of preventing a premature death had risen to $9 million. Given that EPA determined there was no safe level of inhaling PM2.5, the cost-benefit analyses for its rules could beat back over $5 trillion in claimed compliance costs futilely spent trying to eliminate PM2.5 from the air. The problem, though, is that the EPA’s claims were all chicanery. Both the alleged deaths caused by PM2.5 and the monetized value of a premature death were each invented out of thin air. I have been in federal court with the EPA about its scientific claims on PM2.5, where it admitted that its primary line of evidence – i.e., epidemiology data – does not in fact show that PM2.5 outdoors has killed anyone. The EPA has also experimented on real people, including the sick and elderly, with high exposures to PM2.5. Those didn’t harm anyone either. The monetization of premature deaths is truly bizarre. The $5 million value of a premature death avoided was derived through a type of economic research called ‘willingness to pay,’ in which people are polled for how much they would pay for something of value. In the case of PM2.5, EPA nonsensically asked people how much they would be willing to pay to reduce their risk of premature death by 1-in-100,000. Let’s say, for example, that your risk of dying prematurely is 50%. Per the results of the EPA’s survey, people would pay $50 to reduce that risk to 49.99999%. That sum multiplied by 100,000 is where the $5 million came from. EPA has arbitrarily raised the willingness-to-pay figure to $9 million per life saved. Now let’s say you are a 99-year-old who, because of PM2.5, dies ‘prematurely’ today instead of tomorrow, as EPA assumes otherwise would have happened. Because you died ‘prematurely,’ according to the EPA, PM2.5 caused an economic loss of $5 million. Contrast that EPA fantasy with the realistic situation of a 21-year-old young soldier being killed on the battlefield. The U.S. government’s standard valuation of that soldier’s life, paid out in real dollars, is $100,000. The Trump EPA has now merely decided that it will no longer consider the monetization of imaginary PM2.5 deaths in the cost-benefit analyses of EPA air regulations. This will ensure that air pollution regulations make sense and are not pointlessly burdensome – a welcome change after 30 years of EPA just making things up.” The Linear No Threshold Model was first applied to the nuclear industry and has been used to shackle innovation is nuclear power plants. In “DOE Dumps ALARA: Will the NRC Follow Suit?” Duggan Flanakin writes: “When Secretary of Energy Chris Wright on January 12 announced that the DOE had ended the use of the ‘As Low as Reasonably Achievable’ (ALARA) principle for radiation safety directives and regulations, he was following both a directive from President Trump and a recommendation by scientists at the Idaho National Laboratory. President Trump, in Executive Order EO 14300, criticized ALARA and the linear no-threshold (LNT) model on which it is based, stating ‘Those models lack sound scientific basis and produce irrational results, such as requiring that nuclear plants protect against radiation below naturally occurring levels.’” No doubt many entities will announce that such actions are dangerous for public health. But unless they produce physical evidence, they have nothing but their empty claims. See links under EPA and other Regulators on the March, ********************* Poor Market Design? The free market is the product of untold billions of voluntary transactions by billions of people for thousands of years. However, often politicians and their collaborators think they understand what is important to people better than the people themselves. One example is replacing reliable electricity generation with wind and solar. When the system does not work the proponents often blame poor market or system design. Tilak Doshi effectively demolishes one such advocate who claimed that the market must be updated to accomplish what he desires it accomplish. However, with a “modern market” design, will the wind blow constantly, and the sunshine 24/7? See link under Energy Issues – General. ********************* Microplastics: One of the recent fears spread using poor studies is the fear of microplastics accumulating in human brains. Somehow microplastics get by the blood-brain barrier. A paper asserting microplastics accumulate in human brains was published in February 2025 in Nature Medicine. In WUWT, Charles Rotter highlights a new paper (Matters Arising) published in November 2025 in Nature Medicine that questions the first paper. According to the second paper: “The study as reported appears to face methodological challenges, such as limited contamination controls and lack of validation steps, which may affect the reliability of the reported concentrations.

PJM Interconnection LLC, which manages the 13-state eastern grid from the mid-Atlantic to the Midwest, cut its peak demand forecast for the summer of 2027 to about 160 gigawatts. That’s down from a previous outlook of about 164 gigawatts.” A reduction from 164 gigawatts to 160 gigawatt is 4 gigawatts or about 2.4%. The 2025 actual peak summer load was about 161 gigawatts in June. This reduction in forecasts is big news to Bloomberg News?

Saban; John J. Wiens, The Royal Society, B, Oct 15, 2025 From Morrison: When the history of the great Net Zero climate hoax comes to be written, pride of place will be given to the terrifying sixth mass extinction scare. Mainstream media barely question the idea that human-controlled climate is wreaking havoc with the life chances of millions of animal and plant species around the world. In November 2024, the Guardian reported that “as the planet warms up, scientists predict a series of ‘extinction cliffs’”. We are in danger of forgetting what the climate crisis means: extinction, was the cheerful article headline. Defending the Orthodoxy – Bandwagon Science Climate change fuels disasters, but deaths don’t add up By Laurent Thomet, Phys.org, Jan 21, 2026 [H/t Bernie Kepshire] Climate change is turbocharging heat waves, wildfires, floods and tropical storms, but how deadly have extreme weather events become for people in their path?… Discerning an annual pattern is tricky, as a single disaster can make one year much deadlier than another. In an annual report last week, Munich Re said deaths from floods, storms, wildfires and earthquakes rose to 17,200 last year, distinctly higher than the 11,000 fatalities recorded in 2024. Thousands of deaths from major earthquakes in Myanmar and Afghanistan caused the death toll to spike year-on-year. But the Munich Re figure was below the 10-year average of 17,800 deaths and 30-year average of 41,900 fatalities. The data excludes droughts and heat waves. There is “no clear trend” when it comes to deaths from natural disasters, Grimm said. [SEPP Comment: The author does not understand the basis for fierce weather. Heat does not create fierce storms; temperature and pressure gradients do.

By Roger Pielke Jr., His Blog, Jan 20, 2026 Noah Kaufman, researcher at Columbia University, strikes the right note in my view in a recent essay in the Atlantic. Here he discusses economics specifically, but his message is more broadly applicable to claims across disciplines about the climate future: High-profile economic studies claim to quantify the global damages that will be caused by climate change centuries into the future and have produced estimates that range from modest to catastrophic. They have lent a veneer of scientific authority to arguments for both complacency and alarm, even though these studies are far too limited to support either position. . . [SEPP Comment: Generally, these studies and comments about them do not recognize that the greenhouse effects of water vapor and carbon dioxide are highly saturated. In the wavelengths (frequencies) that water vapor and carbon dioxide readily absorb infrared energy, there is nothing left to absorb. Thus, future great damages from increasing CO2 are not based on physical evidence.] Watch Those Assumptions!

[Boldface added] Water bankruptcy signs are everywhere, from Tehran, where droughts and unsustainable water use have depleted reservoirs the Iranian capital relies on, adding fuel to political tensions, to the U.S., where water demand has outstripped the supply in the Colorado River, a crucial source of drinking water and irrigation for seven states. [SEPP Comment: Human caused climate change has nothing to do with it. Areas undergo periods of rainfall and lack of rainfall. The problem in Tehran, Iran, was caused by the government not maintaining a system providing adequate water.

[SEPP Comment: In the UK, the Contracts for Difference (CfD) subsidy assures revenue stability to the wind and solar generators. If market prices for electricity are lower than the “strike price” then the government (consumers) pay the difference. If market prices are higher than the “strike price” then the generator pays back the surplus revenue. As reliable generation is being driven out of the market by guaranteed returns wind and solar generators have (often subsidized), how high will the “strike price” go? The generators of reliable electricity will not remain in the game unless they can be assured high prices for providing so-called wind and solar “back-up.” The game does not benefit the consumer who desires reliable and affordable electricity.] Taxpayers to Pay £15bn for Miliband’s Green Tech Blitz By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Jan 22, 2026 EPA and other Regulators on the March STEVE MILLOY: Trump EPA Gets Fraud Out Of Air Pollution Rules By Steve Milloy, Daily Caller, Jan 18, 2026 DOE Dumps ALARA: Will the NRC Follow Suit?

A record 10 terawatt hours (TWh) of wind power went to waste in 2025, according to a report from energy analyst Montel – costing billpayers a total of £1.4bn in “curtailment costs”. From Homewood: Wind is currently supplying 43% of our electricity. Miliband wants to triple that, which will give us 51 GW and 129% of total demand. Add the 8% from nuclear, which cannot be switched on and off, and we get 137%. It’s hard to think of a more crackpot way to run an energy system!

German Chancellor admits shutting nuclear plants was a “serious strategic mistake” — will rebuild nuclear By Jo Nova, Her Blog, Jan 20, 2026 Germany to build 10GW of baseload gas plants (disguised as “future” hydrogen plants) By Jo Nova, Her Blog, Jan 17, 2026 Facing industrial death, Germany has finally decided it needs dispatchable reliable electricity. But they can’t announce that they suddenly need to build 10 gigawatts of fossil fueled gas power plants. It would be like admitting the sacred Energiewende had been a ghastly mistake that wasted billions of dollars on a reckless vanity quest to change the clouds. So instead, these new “power plants” with a focus on “gas-fired sites” must be convertible to run on hydrogen by 2045. Of course, they may never run on hydrogen, given that makes pipes brittle, leaks, and costs four times as much as natural gas, but it makes a good cover story. [SEPP Comment: Will they design it to handle hydrogen, look at the costs of the special materials, then quietly forget hydrogen?] As German Gas Storage Dips Dangerously Low…Shortage Hardly Avoidable By P Gosselin, No Tricks Zone, Jan 21, 2026 Energy Issues – Australia Aussie Coal Closure Delayed, to Lower Prices and Stabilise the Grid By Eric Worrall, WUWT, Jan 20, 2026 I know you will all be surprised as I am that $10s of billions spent on renewables has failed to produce a viable replacement for a single coal plant. I’m confused. If renewables are cheaper than coal, how can keeping a coal plant open help reduce wholesale prices? And if coal is a far greater threat to grid reliability than renewables, as our Aussie federal energy minister has assured us, why does our reliable renewable grid need backup from an unreliable old coal plant? The next Aussie federal election is due mid to late 2028, so maybe the plan is to shut down the coal plant early in the next election cycle, just in case there are a few minor teething problems with Australia’s Net Zero power grid.

The same year, the U.K.’s industrial energy consumption fell by 1.2% from 2023 to record what the government notes was “the lowest industrial consumption for over 50 years.” The Bank of England has warned: “Net zero policies are slowing the global economy.” The World Bank predicts that “the 2020s will be the weakest decade for global growth since its records began in the 1960s. Whether this decline is by design or daft incompetence, the effects are predictable. In a renewables-dominated Korean grid, bulk material industries like POSCO’s steel mills and Lotte’s petrochemical plants could be the first casualties, competing as they do on razor-thin margins.

About 40% of the energy of “sunlight” arriving at the Earth is in the visible spectrum, which is fortunate because it allows our eyes to “see” by sunlight. What our eyes also “see” from the space stations is a brightly-lit daytime Earth in full spectrum from white to nearly black. Even from the nighttime side we see bright lights everywhere – except in North Korea and “darkest” Africa. To claim that there should be a “balance” between all incoming sunlight and only outgoing infrared energy is beyond ridiculous. To think that “Climate is controlled by” the difference in those two measures is equally absurd. “…the world’s most viewed climate website” – Fred Pearce The Climate Files: The Battle for the Truth about Global Warming “…invaluable” – Steven F.

Title: The Ancient Myths and Medieval Legends of the Vast Russian Forest

Full Content:
A man rows a canoe along a broad, glassy river. As he approaches the sandy shore, he fires two shots from his rifle. Villagers rush to greet him and his honored guest: a bear. The hunter has already opened the bear’s coat in the forest and removed its shoes and gloves. In other words, he has skinned it. Women and children kiss the animal’s pelt, stroke its staring face, and implore it not to frighten them when they pick berries in the forest. The bear is lowered into a specially prepared house adorned with its favorite tree, a young Siberian pine. Now men sing songs of Torum, the forest’s god and the bear’s father. The soul of Torum’s son must be returned home with due pomp, so that he will not trouble the people who killed him. “Out of wood,” the men sing, “a gallant new man was created.” Like bears, humans depend on the forest for their existence. The people celebrating this ritual are Khanty who live near the Agan River, in northwestern Siberia. Their ancestors arrived in the region by 500 CE, long before a Slav ever set foot there. The bear’s arrival was captured in Sons of Torum, a 1989 film by an Estonian writer and filmmaker named Lennart Meri. In 1941, at age twelve, Meri had been exiled to the Volga River region after Stalin annexed Estonia. He later became fascinated by Uralic languages like Khanty and Mansi, which are related to Hungarian and, more distantly, to Finnish and Estonian. The members of this far-­flung linguistic family shared more than vocabulary; they were united by a history of domination by Russia. Sons of Torum is an ode to survival and return. Meri became the second president of newly independent Estonia in 1992, bringing the memory of Siberia’s forests to the highest rungs of Estonia’s government. In 2006, he was buried in Tallinn’s Forest Cemetery, where Estonian luminaries rest eternally among the trees. The Khanty bear ceremony survived encounters first with imperial Russian missionaries and colonizers, then with forced Soviet modernization, collectivization, and executions. Some of the earliest information about Khanty religious traditions comes from Russian priests who sent their reports to the archbishop of Siberia to alert him to the problem of continued paganism. In the latter half of the nineteenth century, ethnographers became fascinated by the bear ceremony. Finnish and Hungarian visitors were particularly attracted by the linguistic link to their own languages. It was mind-­boggling to think that one branch of the same population had ended up in the baroque palaces of Budapest while another had remained hunter-­fisher-­gatherers in the remote northern forests. The dream of living in absolute freedom in the woods, following a lifestyle not so different from that of hunter-­fisher-­gatherers, recurs again and again in Russian history—­which has a habit of relapsing into the distant past. The strange kinship had a whiff of alternative history: What would have happened if Hungarians had never adopted agriculture, never become owners of grand estates, never built cities? Well into the twentieth century, the Khanty relied for their survival on their reindeer herds and on the gifts of the forest and rivers: berries and pine nuts, dried and smoked fish, frozen meat, dried birds. Their forest lifeway still resembled societies that existed across northern Eurasia for millennia. Once upon a time, the people living in this area were at the vanguard of human development. A few hundred kilometers northwest of the river where Meri filmed, a sandy elevated spit overlooks the vast expanse of the West Siberian plain. Whorls of Siberian pine, spruce, and larch cede to brown, squelching swamp. This stretch of forest is the last before the beginning of Arctic tundra to the north. It is traced with wide, slow rivers, still the principal routes of transport for the Khanty and other Indigenous people—­by boat in summer, and in winter, along the ice. White moss, food for reindeer, foams on the ground beneath the trees. This remote expanse of taiga hardly seems like a cradle of human innovation. Today, it sits squarely in the middle of nowhere. Yet it contains one of the oldest-­known fortified settlements in the world. The Amnya site, named for the nearby river of that name, has astonished the archaeology world and helped overturn assumptions about how societies progress over time, changing from peaceful hunter-­gatherer communities to agrarian societies characterized by private property, social inequality, and warfare. Radiocarbon dating published in 2023 shows that the fortifications were built eight thousand years ago—­almost five thousand years earlier than researchers had thought such settlements were first established in the region, and many centuries before the appearance of similar forts in Europe. The tiny, wooded citadel is the northernmost Stone Age stronghold anywhere in Eurasia. It survived in part because the area’s forest, too cold and swampy for agriculture, has never been plowed. Up to the present day, the Indigenous people living nearby have refrained from building over the visible house pits. According to their traditional cosmology, digging is dangerous, because it risks disturbing the spirits of the lower world. This fortified settlement, and numerous similar, more recent promontory forts in the Ob River region, offer a tantalizing riddle for archaeologists. Why did Neolithic people need forts in the first place? What were these fortifications meant to protect, at a time long before trade? And how did Neolithic hunter-­fisher-­gatherers manage to construct this monumental architecture so deep in the northern forest, in a place that even today is seventeen hours by car from the nearest major Russian city? There is clearly something exceptional about the Ob River basin. The area shows evidence of continuous habitation since the Neolithic period. A former riverbed nearby, abandoned by the larger river-­course and reduced to a dead-­end lake, provides one clue. This area is known even today for its abundant fish. It is home to pike, perch, and whitefish, as well as exotic, fatty northern fish of the salmonid family: tender, silvery muksun, white-­fleshed nelma, and the hucho taimen, which makes for delectable “taiga sushi,” as Henny Piezonka, a German archaeologist studying the Amnya site, described it. With its blue-­green head and luminous, sunset-­colored tail, the taimen is so big that Chinese and Mongolian legends render it as a kind of sea monster. The so-­called river wolf or river tiger is known to prey on rats, ducks, and muskrats, though it usually hunts other fish. It can grow to be up to six feet long and one hundred pounds, and it can live for fifty-­five years. The taimen makes the Amnya site look modern: It has existed for fifty million years. Archaeologists suspect that the Amnya settlement was built to store and protect the bounty caught in this relict lake, which is a perfect place to fish using a weir, an underwater fence. The Khanty and Selkup, another Indigenous group in the area, still fish using weirs—­as Piezonka put it, “technology perfected eight thousand years ago.” Sons of Torum shows how Khanty men strip pine roots with their knives and teeth, smoothing them until they are supple as leather. The roots are used to bind wooden laths, forming a screen to trap fish in a lake after they swim in during the spring. In the autumn, when it becomes cold enough to preserve them, the fish can be pulled out of the water without the aid of lines or nets. Such piscine bounty demanded new ways of living. A weir cannot be abandoned for a season. It requires year-­round maintenance, as well as protection from enemies and wild animals such as bears. A weir could make the difference between a well-­fed winter and death by starvation. This explains why nomadic or seminomadic hunter-­gatherers chose to build a fortress on the riverbank and commit to settling down. The strong but flexible roots of the Siberian pine, woven into a weir, bound them to a single place. The Neolithic hunter-­fisher-­gatherers lived relatively well. Like the Khanty as late as the twentieth century, they hunted forest animals and ate preserved fish in winter; in spring, they turned to migratory birds arriving from the south; in autumn, they caught fish and elk migrating from the other side of the Ural Mountains. The beginning of the Neolithic period was the moment when people began to use ceramic vessels as well as wooden ones, and this area near the Amnya is the first place in the region where pottery has been found. Before ceramics, containers were made of birch bark, which can be used for baking but cannot be held over an open flame. Clay pottery made it possible to simmer, a process essential to making fish oil or fish glue, and to store food safely over long periods. (The local Indigenous people still make fish glue from pike bones.) The taiga’s long stretches of subzero weather, meanwhile, allowed the Neolithic people to freeze meat and oils. The accumulation of precious food opened new possibilities for social organization. Inequality resulted, as did property rights and collective projects such as the construction of the fort. And there was war. Fish oil and fish meal, easy to store and transport but requiring much labor in its acquisition and preparation, was an appealing target for raiders. The Amnya complex shows evidence of the first stone arrowheads in the region, contemporaneous with the emergence of fortified settlements. Archaeologists suggest that they were used for war rather than hunting. This warfare may have been a product not only of competition for existing resources but also of prehistoric climate change. Around 6200–­6050 BCE, the climate cooled, causing population movements and prompting hunter-­gatherers around northern Eurasia to mark their territory in novel ways; hunter-­gatherers in Russian Karelia, at the border of present-­day Finland, began to use formal cemeteries. Away from their fortified home, the taiga dwellers built small structures and made offerings, depositing stone arrowheads and pottery decorated with the sculpted heads of birds and animals. The worshippers set the structures alight and then heaped them with soil, pouring out vivid red ochre to close the ceremony. As the ritual was repeated, red hills grew; they contain animal bones, antlers, and human skulls. The hills prefigure the burial mounds of the Scythian warrior-­nomads of Siberia as well as the festive bonfires of the pagan Slavs—­a tradition that continues even today. The Amnya site’s rustling, wet expanse of trees and swamp has yielded a new understanding of human progress. The establishment of agriculture is still widely considered to be an essential step on the road to social “complexity”: accumulation, private property, social hierarchies, economic inequality, military conquest. The Neolithic Amnya fort shows that warfare and surplus economies can be sustained for millennia without agriculture, and that hunter-­fisher-gatherers, who have often been imagined as primitive and peaceful, may have been more warlike and more sophisticated than scientific tradition had assumed. Even in the 2020s, the Siberian forest murmurs with startling secrets. It is a treasure chest, a hiding place, a fortress. The dream of living in absolute freedom in the woods, following a lifestyle not so different from that of hunter-­fisher-­gatherers, recurs again and again in Russian history—­which has a habit of relapsing into the distant past. In the prehistoric period, the taiga’s fish determined the course of human civilization. During the medieval era, it was the taiga’s furs that would reshape Eurasian economies and societies. During that period, fortifications around the Ob River served as safe storage points for the precious sable pelts collected by Indigenous hunters—­Khanty, Mansi, Selkup, and Nenets—­who sold them to traders or surrendered them as tribute. The mysterious northern forests of Siberia and northern Russia were renowned throughout medieval Eurasia as the source of furs that were traded as far as China, Italy, and North Africa, coveted by monarchs and aristocrats, traders and warlords. Archaeologists have found Persian Sassanid silver, ornate Byzantine vessels, and Chinese coins at forts in the Ob River basin, which was a spur of the Silk Road. Fur first became fashionable in the Islamic world. In the tenth century, Arab rulers and European kings wore dresses made of black and red fox fur. The very best fur, the most gorgeous pelts in the purest tints, came from northern European Russia and from northwestern Siberia, which became known to the Islamic world as “the land of darkness.” By the eleventh century, Europe’s monarchs, lords and ladies were draping themselves in sable, ermine, and “vair,” squirrel fur sewn into heraldic patterns. Later, they trimmed their brightly colored woolen clothes in gray and white “minever,” another name for squirrel. The fashion caught on among merchants and craftsmen. In 1327 England restricted fur-­wearing to royalty and people of “high birth with incomes over 100 pounds per annum.” The effort failed, and upwardly mobile English people continued to deck their ambition in animal pelts. As western Europe hacked down its forests to make way for agriculture, its taste for fur only grew. The most desirable gray-­blue and white winter squirrel pelts, favorites of Henry III and Edward I of England, came from Scandinavia and northern Russia. The Siberian forests, still nearly untouched, were a treasure trove. Fur could be exchanged for silver, fine woolen textiles, salt, and other luxury goods. It could even be a tool of diplomacy, sent to foreign rulers as a gesture of goodwill. For centuries, furs were by far the most valuable commodity coming from the dark northern lands, and one of the most valuable luxury goods circulating in Eurasia. The fur trading network reached as far as Spain, North Africa, China, and India. Once small groups of hunter-­gatherers had fought over fish meal in the taiga; now states and armies across Eurasia competed for fur. Controlling the fur trade depended on controlling the people who knew best how to trap the elusive sable, ermine, squirrel, and other creatures. But who were these expert hunters? Thanks to the fur trade, the peoples of the northern Eurasian forests were vaguely known as far away as Central Asia and China. The first accounts of the people dwelling on the southern edges of Siberia are from Chinese chronicles rather than Russian ones. The word taiga (the stress comes on the final “a”), synonymous with Siberia’s forests today, is not a Russian word but a Turkic name that comes from these earlier encounters with the forest peoples. Ethnography began as a means of gathering information essential to trade and war. In the northern forests, fur was the center of every story, the logic that shaped every intercultural interaction. The forest and its inhabitants sparked the imagination of the era’s travel writers, who did not restrain their fancy. The twelfth-century Muslim traveler Abū Hāmid described one of the Islamic world’s first fur sources: “On the sea is an area of darkness, known under the name Iura.” The people of Iura (a name for the Indigenous people of western Siberia) have no war and no animals for transportation, “only huge trees and forests in which there is a lot of honey, and they have a lot of sables.” The forest provides for all their needs. In the summer the sun does not set for forty days, and in the winter the night lasts for forty days—­a nightmare for Muslims, whose religious practices depend on more regular cycles. Most striking is Abū Hāmid’s description of Iura’s trade: The merchants say that the land of darkness is not far from them and that the people of Iura go to this land of darkness and enter it with torches and find there a large tree not unlike a large village, and in it is a large animal, which, they say, is a bird. They bring goods with them, and each merchant puts his property down in a separate place, makes his sign on it and goes away. Then after a while they return and find goods that are needed in their country. And each man finds some of those things near his own goods; if he agrees, then he takes them; if not, he gathers his own things and leaves the others and no exchange takes place. And they do not know from whom they are buying these goods. The single large tree, with its single bird inhabitant, represents the huge, frightening treasure chest of the taiga. It yields its riches only to the initiated, who trade their furs through a string of mysterious middlemen. The process is opaque enough to seem mythical. The Eastern Slavs, too, imagined the fur-­collecting peoples of the north as creatures from a fairytale. In the Primary Chronicle of 1096, the writer recounts a story told to him by a certain Giuriata Rogovich of Novgorod. According to Rogovich, the Iugra (an alternate version of “Iura”), Indigenous people of northwestern Siberia, described mountains that reached from the heavens to the sea. From the mountains, the Iugra said, could be heard the sound of voices, people cutting their way out of the rock. Though their language was incomprehensible, it was somehow evident that the people in the mountain were asking for more iron. In exchange, they would trade furs to the Iugra. But most of the year, the route to these mysterious mountain dwellers was impassable thanks to forest, snow, and precipices. Beneath its fabulously improbable surface, this medieval game of telephone likely contains several kernels of truth. Travelers of the period exaggerated all their tales of unfamiliar peoples. But by telling this story, the Iugra may have been discouraging the Slavs from establishing direct contact with their trading partners, or from attempting to extract the forest’s riches themselves. The Iugra had good reason to protect their status as middlemen, which brought profit and safety. For several centuries, they would succeed in preserving their land of darkness from the incursions of Russian colonizers. The city-­state of Novgorod was an early seat of Slavic power, existing from the ninth to the fifteenth centuries. At its peak, it stretched from the Baltics to the Urals. Its capital city was built with the wood of the surrounding forests. Oak, lime, and elm were used for the most valuable structures; the more abundant pine, spruce, and birch served for everything else. Novgorod was a forest transmuted into a society, a kingdom of woodworking. It grew rich from its forests, where precious furs were so abundant that medieval visitors to Novgorod reported silky-­coated animals falling from the sky. The Novgorodians were the first Slavic people to conquer the northern forest west of the Urals. Beginning in the eleventh century, they forced the Komi, natives of northeastern European Russia who are distantly related to the Hungarians, Finns, and Estonians, to bring them fur tribute. Now the native hunters were not traders exchanging pelts for weapons, metals, and other goods, as in the fanciful tales about the Iura/Iugra, but subjects paying tax to Slavic lords. A fifteenth-­century account of an exploratory trip into Siberia by Novgorodian merchants in search of fur, “On unknown men in the eastern land,” describes the peoples encountered along the way. These sketches are outlandish and clearly fanciful, drawing on a long-­standing tradition of European myths about semihuman tribes. The first group are described as cannibals who serve their own children as a welcome meal for the visiting merchants. But other descriptions can be read as a kind of magical ethnography. One group lives in the sea for a month every year as its people shed their old skins and grow new ones—­perhaps a reference to the practice of wearing fish leather, common among northern peoples, and to seasonal migration. Another tribe is mouthless. Its mute members eat by putting food under their caps and chewing with their shoulders—­a highly embroidered version of a people who speak a language unintelligible to the merchants or their interpreters. Another group dies for two months every winter, then returns to life. This is simply hibernation: a merging of humans with bears. The historian Janet Martin has pointed out that this story was not pure invention: The locations of the peoples described and the indication of who had sable were accurate. Ethnography began as a means of gathering information essential to trade and war. In the northern forests, fur was the center of every story, the logic that shaped every intercultural interaction. __________________________________ Excerpt from The Oak and the Larch: A Forest History of Russia and Its Empires.

Title: Job Slaughter Accelerates: January 2026 Corporate Layoffs Signal Economic Implosion
URL: https://www.naturalnews.com/2026-01-26-job-slaughter-accelerates-january-2026-corporate-layoffs.html
Time Published: 2026-01-26T06:00:00Z
Full Content:
The American economic mirage is shattering. As the nation enters 2026, a chilling corporate offensive is accelerating, transforming the post-holiday landscape into a bloodbath for the working class. This is not a routine economic adjustment; it is the sound of systemic collapse, a coordinated corporate retreat from the very human capital upon which national prosperity was built. The statistics are damning. Over 100 U.S. companies have already filed Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) acts this January aloneÂ [1]. This widespread announcement of planned job cuts reveals a strategic, panicked withdrawal from workforce commitments. From the heartland's food producers to the coastal tech titans, thousands of livelihoods are being extinguished with the cold efficiency of a balance sheet calculation, signaling a deliberate and catastrophic economic implosion engineered from the top. A Sudden, Chilling Acceleration January 2026 has witnessed an unprecedented, sharp escalation in mass layoffs, far exceeding any typical seasonal downturn. This wave represents a decisive shift from isolated corporate restructurings to a broad-based purge. The sheer scale and synchrony indicate a systemic failure, not individual corporate misfortune. As noted by economic observers, when layoffs accelerate across sectors, it reveals deeper structural rotÂ [2]. This coordinated action suggests a shared corporate directive: shed human labor at all costs to appease shareholders and chase the phantom of digital efficiency, regardless of the human devastation left behind. The Anatomy of a Collapse: This Week's Casualties The human cost of this corporate calculus is no longer abstract. It is felt in shuttered plants and shattered communities. Tyson Foods, a pillar of the agricultural industry, has closed a major pork processing plant in Nebraska, instantly eliminating 3,200 jobs as part of a broader purge affecting 4,900 workers. Such moves devastate local economies that were built around these employers. Beneath the headlines of corporate giants, a quieter slaughter continues. The elimination of 500 jobs at Bajaj Mobility and 100 at Thomas Storey Fabrications may not make national news, but they represent the same brutal logic playing out across the industrial landscape. Corporate spokespeople frame these decisions as necessary 'efficiencies' or 'restructuring.' In reality, they represent a fundamental betrayal of worker loyalty and a conscious decision to abandon economic stability for short-term financial metrics. This mirrors the historical precedent set in the 1980s, where mass layoffs became an accepted tool for corporate leaders to guard against short-term disruption, with devastating long-term consequences for worker security and trustÂ [3]. The Broader Slaughter: Tech, Auto, and Retail Lead the Retreat The collapse is not isolated to manufacturing; it is a contagion sweeping every consumer-facing sector. The technology industry, once a beacon of innovation, is now leading the charge in abandoning its workforce. Amazon is reportedly planning another 30,000 job cuts, while Meta continues its purge with 1,500 layoffs in its Reality Labs divisionÂ [4]. This reveals an industry that has pivoted from human-driven innovation to a single-minded obsession with AI and shareholder returns. The automotive sector exposes another broken promise. General Motors' elimination of 1,140 jobs at its flagship electric vehicle plant in Michigan lays bare the fragility of government-backed 'green transition' industries. When subsidies and political winds shift, the jobs vanish, leaving workers stranded. The list of companies filing WARN notices reads like a who's who of American consumerism: Nike, FedEx, Nordstrom, Warner MusicÂ [5]. This sweep across retail, logistics, and entertainment proves the economic disease is universal. The logistics sector has been particularly hard hit, with UPS and FedEx combined accounting for over 58,000 layoffs recentlyÂ [6]. The foundation of the consumer economy is being dismantled. The Real Drivers: Shareholder Greed, AI Obsession, and Policy Failure Corporate apologists and captured economists cite 'macroeconomic uncertainty' as the cause. This is a deliberate obfuscation. The primary driver is a pathological corporate obsession with short-term shareholder value and stock buybacks, prioritized entirely over long-term investment in human capital and community stability. Simultaneously, the frantic rush to adopt Artificial Intelligence is not primarily about efficiency; it is a strategic depopulation-of-labor strategy. As one AI expert starkly observed in an interview, humanity faces a critical choice as AI drives the 'mass replacement of cognitive jobs,' rendering computer-based desk jobs obsoleteÂ [7]. This is not innovation for human betterment; it is automation for human replacement, a goal actively pursued by globalist corporations viewing workers as liabilities. This implosion was engineered by years of disastrous government policy. Rogue energy policies crushed domestic competitiveness, making energy-intensive operations untenableÂ [8]. At the same time, aggressive monetary policies and trade wars have created unbearable pressure. The escalating U.S.-China trade war, characterized by extreme tariffs, has triggered severe economic pressure and factory closures not only abroad but also strains the domestic supply chain, forcing panicked corporate retreatsÂ [9][10]. The corporate elite are adept at navigatingâand exploitingâsuch political turmoil for their own ends, often at the expense of the workforceÂ [11]. Conclusion: Beyond the Headlines Lies a Deliberate Human Catastrophe The January 2026 layoff wave is not a natural economic cycle. It is a controlled demolition of the American workforce and middle-class stability. These corporations, often protected by symbiotic and corrupt government agencies, are executing a coldly rational plan that sacrifices human dignity at the altar of digital efficiency and centralized control. The path forward requires a fundamental rejection of this corrupt, centralized model. The solution lies in decentralization, local self-reliance, and a return to honest money systems. As financial uncertainty grows, assets with intrinsic value and no counter-party risk become essential. Historically, gold and silver have served as a hedge against systemic failure and currency devaluationÂ [12]. In a digital world pushing for total control, physical precious metals represent a form of analog, private wealth preservation that cannot be censored or erased by a keystroke. To survive the coming upheaval, individuals must empower themselves with knowledge from uncensored sources, build community resilience, and sever dependence on the very corporations and institutions that are now discarding them. Platforms likeÂ Brighteon.AIÂ offer AI-powered research free from corporate narrative control, while resources for natural health and preparedness provide the tools for true independence. The era of trusting centralized power is over; the era of decentralized self-reliance has begun.

Mike Adams interview with Andy Schectman. Mike Adams. May 13 2025. The statistics are damning. Over 100 U.S. companies have already filed Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) acts this January aloneÂ [1]. This widespread announcement of planned job cuts reveals a strategic, panicked withdrawal from workforce commitments. From the heartland's food producers to the coastal tech titans, thousands of livelihoods are being extinguished with the cold efficiency of a balance sheet calculation, signaling a deliberate and catastrophic economic implosion engineered from the top. A Sudden, Chilling Acceleration January 2026 has witnessed an unprecedented, sharp escalation in mass layoffs, far exceeding any typical seasonal downturn. This wave represents a decisive shift from isolated corporate restructurings to a broad-based purge. The sheer scale and synchrony indicate a systemic failure, not individual corporate misfortune. As noted by economic observers, when layoffs accelerate across sectors, it reveals deeper structural rotÂ [2]. This coordinated action suggests a shared corporate directive: shed human labor at all costs to appease shareholders and chase the phantom of digital efficiency, regardless of the human devastation left behind. The Anatomy of a Collapse: This Week's Casualties The human cost of this corporate calculus is no longer abstract. It is felt in shuttered plants and shattered communities. Tyson Foods, a pillar of the agricultural industry, has closed a major pork processing plant in Nebraska, instantly eliminating 3,200 jobs as part of a broader purge affecting 4,900 workers. Such moves devastate local economies that were built around these employers. Beneath the headlines of corporate giants, a quieter slaughter continues. The elimination of 500 jobs at Bajaj Mobility and 100 at Thomas Storey Fabrications may not make national news, but they represent the same brutal logic playing out across the industrial landscape. Corporate spokespeople frame these decisions as necessary 'efficiencies' or 'restructuring.' In reality, they represent a fundamental betrayal of worker loyalty and a conscious decision to abandon economic stability for short-term financial metrics. This mirrors the historical precedent set in the 1980s, where mass layoffs became an accepted tool for corporate leaders to guard against short-term disruption, with devastating long-term consequences for worker security and trustÂ [3]. The Broader Slaughter: Tech, Auto, and Retail Lead the Retreat The collapse is not isolated to manufacturing; it is a contagion sweeping every consumer-facing sector. The technology industry, once a beacon of innovation, is now leading the charge in abandoning its workforce. Amazon is reportedly planning another 30,000 job cuts, while Meta continues its purge with 1,500 layoffs in its Reality Labs divisionÂ [4]. This reveals an industry that has pivoted from human-driven innovation to a single-minded obsession with AI and shareholder returns. The automotive sector exposes another broken promise. General Motors' elimination of 1,140 jobs at its flagship electric vehicle plant in Michigan lays bare the fragility of government-backed 'green transition' industries. When subsidies and political winds shift, the jobs vanish, leaving workers stranded. The list of companies filing WARN notices reads like a who's who of American consumerism: Nike, FedEx, Nordstrom, Warner MusicÂ [5]. This sweep across retail, logistics, and entertainment proves the economic disease is universal. The logistics sector has been particularly hard hit, with UPS and FedEx combined accounting for over 58,000 layoffs recentlyÂ [6]. The foundation of the consumer economy is being dismantled. The Real Drivers: Shareholder Greed, AI Obsession, and Policy Failure Corporate apologists and captured economists cite 'macroeconomic uncertainty' as the cause. This is a deliberate obfuscation. The primary driver is a pathological corporate obsession with short-term shareholder value and stock buybacks, prioritized entirely over long-term investment in human capital and community stability. Simultaneously, the frantic rush to adopt Artificial Intelligence is not primarily about efficiency; it is a strategic depopulation-of-labor strategy. As one AI expert starkly observed in an interview, humanity faces a critical choice as AI drives the 'mass replacement of cognitive jobs,' rendering computer-based desk jobs obsoleteÂ [7]. This is not innovation for human betterment; it is automation for human replacement, a goal actively pursued by globalist corporations viewing workers as liabilities. This implosion was engineered by years of disastrous government policy. Rogue energy policies crushed domestic competitiveness, making energy-intensive operations untenableÂ [8]. At the same time, aggressive monetary policies and trade wars have created unbearable pressure. The escalating U.S.-China trade war, characterized by extreme tariffs, has triggered severe economic pressure and factory closures not only abroad but also strains the domestic supply chain, forcing panicked corporate retreatsÂ [9][10]. The corporate elite are adept at navigatingâand exploitingâsuch political turmoil for their own ends, often at the expense of the workforceÂ [11]. Conclusion: Beyond the Headlines Lies a Deliberate Human Catastrophe The January 2026 layoff wave is not a natural economic cycle. It is a controlled demolition of the American workforce and middle-class stability. These corporations, often protected by symbiotic and corrupt government agencies, are executing a coldly rational plan that sacrifices human dignity at the altar of digital efficiency and centralized control. The path forward requires a fundamental rejection of this corrupt, centralized model. The solution lies in decentralization, local self-reliance, and a return to honest money systems. As financial uncertainty grows, assets with intrinsic value and no counter-party risk become essential. Historically, gold and silver have served as a hedge against systemic failure and currency devaluationÂ [12]. In a digital world pushing for total control, physical precious metals represent a form of analog, private wealth preservation that cannot be censored or erased by a keystroke. To survive the coming upheaval, individuals must empower themselves with knowledge from uncensored sources, build community resilience, and sever dependence on the very corporations and institutions that are now discarding them. Platforms likeÂ Brighteon.AIÂ offer AI-powered research free from corporate narrative control, while resources for natural health and preparedness provide the tools for true independence. The era of trusting centralized power is over; the era of decentralized self-reliance has begun.

Mike Adams interview with Andy Schectman. Mike Adams. May 13 2025. The sheer scale and synchrony indicate a systemic failure, not individual corporate misfortune. As noted by economic observers, when layoffs accelerate across sectors, it reveals deeper structural rotÂ [2]. This coordinated action suggests a shared corporate directive: shed human labor at all costs to appease shareholders and chase the phantom of digital efficiency, regardless of the human devastation left behind. The Anatomy of a Collapse: This Week's Casualties The human cost of this corporate calculus is no longer abstract. It is felt in shuttered plants and shattered communities. Tyson Foods, a pillar of the agricultural industry, has closed a major pork processing plant in Nebraska, instantly eliminating 3,200 jobs as part of a broader purge affecting 4,900 workers. Such moves devastate local economies that were built around these employers. Beneath the headlines of corporate giants, a quieter slaughter continues. The elimination of 500 jobs at Bajaj Mobility and 100 at Thomas Storey Fabrications may not make national news, but they represent the same brutal logic playing out across the industrial landscape. Corporate spokespeople frame these decisions as necessary 'efficiencies' or 'restructuring.' In reality, they represent a fundamental betrayal of worker loyalty and a conscious decision to abandon economic stability for short-term financial metrics. This mirrors the historical precedent set in the 1980s, where mass layoffs became an accepted tool for corporate leaders to guard against short-term disruption, with devastating long-term consequences for worker security and trustÂ [3]. The Broader Slaughter: Tech, Auto, and Retail Lead the Retreat The collapse is not isolated to manufacturing; it is a contagion sweeping every consumer-facing sector. The technology industry, once a beacon of innovation, is now leading the charge in abandoning its workforce. Amazon is reportedly planning another 30,000 job cuts, while Meta continues its purge with 1,500 layoffs in its Reality Labs divisionÂ [4]. This reveals an industry that has pivoted from human-driven innovation to a single-minded obsession with AI and shareholder returns. The automotive sector exposes another broken promise. General Motors' elimination of 1,140 jobs at its flagship electric vehicle plant in Michigan lays bare the fragility of government-backed 'green transition' industries. When subsidies and political winds shift, the jobs vanish, leaving workers stranded. The list of companies filing WARN notices reads like a who's who of American consumerism: Nike, FedEx, Nordstrom, Warner MusicÂ [5]. This sweep across retail, logistics, and entertainment proves the economic disease is universal. The logistics sector has been particularly hard hit, with UPS and FedEx combined accounting for over 58,000 layoffs recentlyÂ [6]. The foundation of the consumer economy is being dismantled. The Real Drivers: Shareholder Greed, AI Obsession, and Policy Failure Corporate apologists and captured economists cite 'macroeconomic uncertainty' as the cause. This is a deliberate obfuscation. The primary driver is a pathological corporate obsession with short-term shareholder value and stock buybacks, prioritized entirely over long-term investment in human capital and community stability. Simultaneously, the frantic rush to adopt Artificial Intelligence is not primarily about efficiency; it is a strategic depopulation-of-labor strategy. As one AI expert starkly observed in an interview, humanity faces a critical choice as AI drives the 'mass replacement of cognitive jobs,' rendering computer-based desk jobs obsoleteÂ [7]. This is not innovation for human betterment; it is automation for human replacement, a goal actively pursued by globalist corporations viewing workers as liabilities. This implosion was engineered by years of disastrous government policy. Rogue energy policies crushed domestic competitiveness, making energy-intensive operations untenableÂ [8]. At the same time, aggressive monetary policies and trade wars have created unbearable pressure. The escalating U.S.-China trade war, characterized by extreme tariffs, has triggered severe economic pressure and factory closures not only abroad but also strains the domestic supply chain, forcing panicked corporate retreatsÂ [9][10]. The corporate elite are adept at navigatingâand exploitingâsuch political turmoil for their own ends, often at the expense of the workforceÂ [11]. Conclusion: Beyond the Headlines Lies a Deliberate Human Catastrophe The January 2026 layoff wave is not a natural economic cycle. It is a controlled demolition of the American workforce and middle-class stability. These corporations, often protected by symbiotic and corrupt government agencies, are executing a coldly rational plan that sacrifices human dignity at the altar of digital efficiency and centralized control. The path forward requires a fundamental rejection of this corrupt, centralized model. The solution lies in decentralization, local self-reliance, and a return to honest money systems. As financial uncertainty grows, assets with intrinsic value and no counter-party risk become essential. Historically, gold and silver have served as a hedge against systemic failure and currency devaluationÂ [12]. In a digital world pushing for total control, physical precious metals represent a form of analog, private wealth preservation that cannot be censored or erased by a keystroke. To survive the coming upheaval, individuals must empower themselves with knowledge from uncensored sources, build community resilience, and sever dependence on the very corporations and institutions that are now discarding them. Platforms likeÂ Brighteon.AIÂ offer AI-powered research free from corporate narrative control, while resources for natural health and preparedness provide the tools for true independence. The era of trusting centralized power is over; the era of decentralized self-reliance has begun.

Mike Adams interview with Andy Schectman. Mike Adams. May 13 2025. Corporate spokespeople frame these decisions as necessary 'efficiencies' or 'restructuring.' In reality, they represent a fundamental betrayal of worker loyalty and a conscious decision to abandon economic stability for short-term financial metrics. This mirrors the historical precedent set in the 1980s, where mass layoffs became an accepted tool for corporate leaders to guard against short-term disruption, with devastating long-term consequences for worker security and trustÂ [3]. The Broader Slaughter: Tech, Auto, and Retail Lead the Retreat The collapse is not isolated to manufacturing; it is a contagion sweeping every consumer-facing sector. The technology industry, once a beacon of innovation, is now leading the charge in abandoning its workforce. Amazon is reportedly planning another 30,000 job cuts, while Meta continues its purge with 1,500 layoffs in its Reality Labs divisionÂ [4]. This reveals an industry that has pivoted from human-driven innovation to a single-minded obsession with AI and shareholder returns. The automotive sector exposes another broken promise. General Motors' elimination of 1,140 jobs at its flagship electric vehicle plant in Michigan lays bare the fragility of government-backed 'green transition' industries. When subsidies and political winds shift, the jobs vanish, leaving workers stranded. The list of companies filing WARN notices reads like a who's who of American consumerism: Nike, FedEx, Nordstrom, Warner MusicÂ [5]. This sweep across retail, logistics, and entertainment proves the economic disease is universal. The logistics sector has been particularly hard hit, with UPS and FedEx combined accounting for over 58,000 layoffs recentlyÂ [6]. The foundation of the consumer economy is being dismantled. The Real Drivers: Shareholder Greed, AI Obsession, and Policy Failure Corporate apologists and captured economists cite 'macroeconomic uncertainty' as the cause. This is a deliberate obfuscation. The primary driver is a pathological corporate obsession with short-term shareholder value and stock buybacks, prioritized entirely over long-term investment in human capital and community stability. Simultaneously, the frantic rush to adopt Artificial Intelligence is not primarily about efficiency; it is a strategic depopulation-of-labor strategy. As one AI expert starkly observed in an interview, humanity faces a critical choice as AI drives the 'mass replacement of cognitive jobs,' rendering computer-based desk jobs obsoleteÂ [7]. This is not innovation for human betterment; it is automation for human replacement, a goal actively pursued by globalist corporations viewing workers as liabilities. This implosion was engineered by years of disastrous government policy. Rogue energy policies crushed domestic competitiveness, making energy-intensive operations untenableÂ [8]. At the same time, aggressive monetary policies and trade wars have created unbearable pressure. The escalating U.S.-China trade war, characterized by extreme tariffs, has triggered severe economic pressure and factory closures not only abroad but also strains the domestic supply chain, forcing panicked corporate retreatsÂ [9][10]. The corporate elite are adept at navigatingâand exploitingâsuch political turmoil for their own ends, often at the expense of the workforceÂ [11]. Conclusion: Beyond the Headlines Lies a Deliberate Human Catastrophe The January 2026 layoff wave is not a natural economic cycle. It is a controlled demolition of the American workforce and middle-class stability.

Mike Adams interview with Andy Schectman. Mike Adams. May 13 2025. The Real Drivers: Shareholder Greed, AI Obsession, and Policy Failure Corporate apologists and captured economists cite 'macroeconomic uncertainty' as the cause. This is a deliberate obfuscation. The primary driver is a pathological corporate obsession with short-term shareholder value and stock buybacks, prioritized entirely over long-term investment in human capital and community stability. Simultaneously, the frantic rush to adopt Artificial Intelligence is not primarily about efficiency; it is a strategic depopulation-of-labor strategy. As one AI expert starkly observed in an interview, humanity faces a critical choice as AI drives the 'mass replacement of cognitive jobs,' rendering computer-based desk jobs obsoleteÂ [7]. This is not innovation for human betterment; it is automation for human replacement, a goal actively pursued by globalist corporations viewing workers as liabilities. This implosion was engineered by years of disastrous government policy. Rogue energy policies crushed domestic competitiveness, making energy-intensive operations untenableÂ [8]. At the same time, aggressive monetary policies and trade wars have created unbearable pressure. The escalating U.S.-China trade war, characterized by extreme tariffs, has triggered severe economic pressure and factory closures not only abroad but also strains the domestic supply chain, forcing panicked corporate retreatsÂ [9][10]. The corporate elite are adept at navigatingâand exploitingâsuch political turmoil for their own ends, often at the expense of the workforceÂ [11]. Conclusion: Beyond the Headlines Lies a Deliberate Human Catastrophe The January 2026 layoff wave is not a natural economic cycle. It is a controlled demolition of the American workforce and middle-class stability. These corporations, often protected by symbiotic and corrupt government agencies, are executing a coldly rational plan that sacrifices human dignity at the altar of digital efficiency and centralized control. The path forward requires a fundamental rejection of this corrupt, centralized model. The solution lies in decentralization, local self-reliance, and a return to honest money systems. As financial uncertainty grows, assets with intrinsic value and no counter-party risk become essential. Historically, gold and silver have served as a hedge against systemic failure and currency devaluationÂ [12]. In a digital world pushing for total control, physical precious metals represent a form of analog, private wealth preservation that cannot be censored or erased by a keystroke. To survive the coming upheaval, individuals must empower themselves with knowledge from uncensored sources, build community resilience, and sever dependence on the very corporations and institutions that are now discarding them. Platforms likeÂ Brighteon.AIÂ offer AI-powered research free from corporate narrative control, while resources for natural health and preparedness provide the tools for true independence. The era of trusting centralized power is over; the era of decentralized self-reliance has begun.

Title: Asian shares slip and the yen surges against the dollar

(AP Photo/Richard Drew) Trader William Lawrence works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Monday, Jan. 26, 2026. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes ticked higher Monday, while other markets made louder moves, including another record-breaking rush for the price of gold. The S&P 500 rose 0.5% and won back its losses from last week’s dip. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 313 points, or 0.6%, and the Nasdaq composite added 0.4%. Baker Hughes helped lead the way and rose 4.4% after delivering a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The energy technology company said it’s benefiting from strong momentum in demand for liquefied natural gas, among other things. CoreWeave climbed 5.7% after Nvidia said it invested $2 billion in the stock and will help accelerate the buildout of CoreWeave’s artificial-intelligence factories, which use Nvidia chips, by 2030 to advance AI adoption. Nvidia slipped 0.6%. USA Rare Earth rallied 7.9% after saying the U.S. government agreed to provide $277 million in federal funding to help the company produce heavy rare earths, minerals and magnets. The Trump administration also agreed to a proposed $1.3 billion loan, while the company separately raised $1.5 billion through private investors. Much of the rest of Wall Street was relatively quiet. That included mixed performances for airlines, which had to cancel thousands of flights due to the winter storm that swept much of the United States over the weekend. Delta Air Lines lost 0.7%, and Southwest Airlines added 0.2%. All told, the S&P 500 rose 34.62 points to 6,950.23. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 313.69 to 49,412.40, and the Nasdaq composite gained 100.11 to 23,601.36. The action was stronger in the gold market, where the metal’s price rallied another 2.1% and briefly topped $5,100 per ounce for the first time to set another record. Silver surged even more and settled 14% higher. Prices for precious metals have been soaring as investors look for safer places to park their money amid threats of tariffs, still-high inflation, political strife and mountains of debt for governments worldwide. The latest worry to pile atop the swelling list was President Donald Trump’s threat to impose a 100% tariff on goods from Canada if it signs a free trade deal with China. The U.S. dollar’s value also continued its recent slide against peers. Last week, it was U.S. tariff threats related to Greenland that drove some global investors away from the dollar. This time, it was the Japanese yen leaping sharply because of expectations that officials in both Japan and the United States may intervene in the market to prop up the Japanese currency’s value. More swings could be ahead for financial markets in a week full of big tests. The Federal Reserve will announce its latest move on interest rates on Wednesday. It’s been lowering its main interest rate and has indicated more cuts may be on the way in 2026 to help shore up the job market and give the economy a boost. Most economists expect it to hold steady on Wednesday, in part because inflation remains stubbornly above the Fed’s 2% target and lower rates could worsen it. Whatever the Fed decides, comments from its chair, Jerome Powell, following the decision could sway stock and bond markets. Several of Wall Street’s most influential stocks are also set to deliver their latest earnings reports this week. That includes Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Tesla on Wednesday and Apple on Thursday. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury eased to 4.21% from 4.24% late Friday. In stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed amid mostly modest movements in Europe following some sharper swings in Asia. Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped 1.8% for one of the world’s bigger moves. A stronger yen could hurt Japanese exporters, and Toyota Motor fell 4.1%. ___ AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed. Copyright 2026 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

January 25, 2026 19:30 ET | Source: Faraday Future Faraday Future LOS ANGELES, Jan. 25, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (NASDAQ: FFAI) (“Faraday Future”, “FF” or the “Company”), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, today shared a weekly business update from YT Jia, Founder and Global Co-CEO of FF. “Welcome to my weekly report, issue number 39. Driven by our dual-engine EAI strategy, this week, I’d like to first share major progress on our EAI robotics business, along with a piece of good news from the capital markets: 1. The first FF EAI robotics product has completed U.S. regulatory certification and is about to officially enter sales. Regulatory approvals for the remaining products in our initial batch are advancing and are expected to be finalized soon. This progress brings us closer to realizing our ‘launch is sale, sale is delivery’ model, with the goal of starting product deliveries within the same month as the launch. Our robotics strategy focuses on creating real-world use cases and user value, directly addressing the industry’s current lack of true 'must-have' demand. By integrating Web3 and blockchain technologies, we aim to lead the industry into a new phase of commercialization driven by authentic user needs and value creation. Our goal is to become the first U.S. company to deliver humanoid robot products with positive contribution margins, and to rapidly scale deliveries to enter the ranks of leading EAI robotics companies in the U.S. 2. In terms of R&D, we are continuing to establish clear empowerment pathways from EAI EVs to EAI robots, aiming to transfer and apply the AI DNA and years of auto-grade AI capabilities that FF has built since its founding to empower the “brain” and “cerebellum” of our robots. In addition, FF is the only company in the U.S. market with the "EAI+Crypto" dual flywheel ecosystem, which has a natural advantage in cross-scenario, cross-domain, and cross-ecosystem technology feeding back, which will build up our core differentiated technology barriers in the EAI field. 3. The FF EAI Robotics Product Final Launch and the FF/FX Par Partner Recruitment Conference on February 4 will center around the theme of “Robot &Vehicle +”. We will provide a comprehensive introduction to how FF leverages its Dual-Flywheel, Dual-Bridge, and Dual-Public-Companies structure and applies an original AI innovation + bridge model approach to systematically address industry pain points across application scenarios, cost, user experience, and ecosystem development—leading the arrival of a new era of EAI. Next, let me share with you select portions of the product design for our first batch of robots. I’d love to hear what you think. On February 4, at the Las Vegas Convention Center, during the NADA Show — the largest auto dealer conference in North America — we will unveil even more exciting updates. Please stay tuned. In addition to that, one of the world’s largest asset management institutions, BlackRock, increased its holdings in FFAI once again. According to its latest Q4 Schedule 13G filing, as of December 31, 2025, BlackRock held approximately 9.5 million shares of FFAI common stock, up from 6.8 million shares disclosed as of September 30, 2025 — an increase of about 40%. S5, Capital and Finance: A public company research firm that we compensated for its coverage issued a new report after the Stockholder Day event reiterating its “Buy” rating and a 12-month target price of $5 per share. The report highlights their belief that FFAI’s current share price is undervalued relative to peers. On S6 Middle East: This week, FF made a high-profile appearance at the UMEX 2026 exhibition held in Abu Dhabi from January 20 to 22, showcasing the FF 91, FX Super One, and our EAI robotics strategy. The booth drew strong attention throughout the event, including visits from the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and other senior UAE officials, making FF a clear focal point of the show. Moving on to AIxC, Crypto Flywheel: AIxC announced that it has launched an accelerated global talent recruitment initiative this week to support faster execution across its three-core driving-force businesses, including RWA EAI ecosystem development. AIxC also launched the X Space series of events this week, with the first event receiving a strong response. Going forward, when circumstances permit, I may personally participate in future X Space sessions to engage directly with the community—sharing industry insights, discussing future trends, and providing updates on key company-level developments. Stay tuned and see you all next week!” ABOUT FARADAY FUTURE Faraday Future is a California-based global intelligent Company founded in 2014 and is dedicated to reshaping the future of mobility through vehicle electrification, intelligent technologies, and AI innovation. Its flagship vehicle, the FF 91, began deliveries in 2023 and reflects the brand’s pursuit of ultra-luxury, cutting-edge technology, and high performance. FF’s second brand, FX, targets the high-volume mainstream vehicle market. Its first model, Super One, is positioned as a first-class EAI-MPV, with deliveries planned to begin in 2026.

Title: Jeff Bezos attends Trump movie night as WaPo reporters beg for their jobs: report

Jeff Bezos, owner of The Washington Post, attended the premiere of "Melania," a $40 million documentary about the first lady, with President Donald Trump on Saturday night as his reporters begged him not to make steep cuts to the legendary newsroom, according to a new report. David Folkenflik, NPR's media correspondent, reported on Sunday that WaPo's international correspondents sent Bezos a letter pleading with him to maintain the paper's international coverage. The letter was sent as speculation was building that large-scale layoffs were imminent at the paper. "We urge you to consider how these proposed layoffs will certainly lead us first to irrelevance and later extinction — not the shared success that remains attainable," the letter reads in part.

Title: How BlackRock just lost control of the $10B tokenized Treasury market to Circle for one simple, mechanical reason

USYC hit $1.69B AUM on Jan. 22, narrowly topping BUIDL’s $1.684B. The real advantage is buried in collateral rails. Gino Matos is a law school graduate and a seasoned journalist with six years of experience in the crypto industry. His expertise primarily focuses on the Brazilian blockchain ecosystem and developments in decentralized finance (DeFi). Tokenized US Treasuries crossed $10 billion in total value this week, a milestone that confirms the category has moved from proof-of-concept to operational infrastructure. Yet, something happening underneath this achievement is just as important: Circle's USYC has edged past BlackRock's BUIDL as the largest tokenized Treasury product, signaling that distribution rails and collateral mechanics now matter more than brand recognition in determining which on-chain cash equivalents win. As of Jan. 22, USYC holds $1.69 billion in assets under management compared to BUIDL's $1.684 billion, a gap of roughly $6.14 million, or 0.36%. Over the past 30 days, USYC's assets grew 11% while BUIDL's contracted 2.85%, a divergence that reads less like marketing success and more like net creation flowing in one direction while redemptions drain the other. This isn't a story about Circle beating BlackRock in a brand war. It's about collateral workflow design outperforming logo recognition. Additionally, it maps directly onto the infrastructure question that regulators and institutions are now asking out loud: who shapes the stack that turns idle crypto capital into productive, yield-bearing collateral? Tokenized RWAs are dominated by Ethereum, but one unexpected blockchain rival just surged 28% to outpace the leader. USYC's clearest structural advantage is distribution through exchange collateral rails. On July 24, Binance announced that institutional customers could hold USYC and use it as off-exchange collateral for derivatives, with custody handled through Banking Triparty or Ceffu and near-instant redemption into USDC. Binance added BUIDL to its off-exchange collateral list on Nov. 14, four months after USYC. That sequencing matters. If the cash collateral stack is built first inside prime brokerage and derivatives workflows, the product that integrates earlier captures the flow. USYC didn't just get listed, it got embedded into the operational layer where institutions manage margin and collateral automation. Circle positioned USYC explicitly as yield-bearing collateral that travels alongside USDC rails, meaning institutions that already route stablecoin flows through Circle's ecosystem can onboard USYC without building new operational pathways. BlackRock's BUIDL entered the market with brand authority but without the same plug-and-play integration into crypto-native collateral systems. BlackRock’s tokenization thesis puts 65%+ of tokenized assets on Ethereum, but newer RWA data shows share can drift. RWA.xyz labels the two products differently under “Use of Income.” USYC is marked as “Accumulates,” meaning interest accrues within the token balance. BUIDL is marked as “Distributes,” meaning returns are paid out separately. This distinction is mechanical, not cosmetic. Collateral systems, especially automated margin and derivatives infrastructure, prefer set-and-forget balances where value compounds without requiring operational handling of payouts. An accumulating structure integrates more cleanly into collateral automation than a distributing one. For institutions building collateral rails that need to scale across multiple venues and counterparties, the simpler the structure, the lower the operational drag. RWA.xyz lists materially different entry requirements for the two products. BUIDL restricts access to US Qualified Purchasers, requiring a minimum investment of $5 million in USDC. USYC targets non-US investors with a minimum of $100,000 USDC. The funnel difference is structural. Qualified Purchaser status in the US requires $5 million in investable assets for individuals or $25 million for entities, a narrow gate that excludes most crypto-native funds, prop desks, and smaller institutional players. USYC's $100,000 minimum and non-US eligibility open access to a broader set of offshore institutions, family offices, and trading firms that operate outside US regulatory perimeters but still need dollar-denominated, yield-bearing collateral. BlackRock's brand carries weight, but the brand doesn't override access constraints. If a fund can't meet the Qualified Purchaser threshold or operates outside the US, BUIDL isn't an option. USYC is. The addressable market for on-chain collateral skews heavily toward non-US entities and smaller institutions, exactly the segment USYC is designed to serve. New smart contract enables real-time, transparent BUIDL share transfers to USDC. The simplest explanation for the flip is the cleanest: flows moved. Market-moving headlines and context delivered every morning in one tight read. Free. No spam. Unsubscribe any time. USYC grew by 11% over the past 30 days, while BUIDL shrank by 2.85%. That's not a marketing differential. It's net issuance into one product, offset by net outflows from the other. The recent flip suggests a discrete event or allocation decision rather than gradual drift. USYC's Binance integration, its accumulating income structure, and its lower entry threshold all reduce friction. BUIDL hasn't added comparable distribution momentum in the same window. Tokenized Treasuries at $10 billion remain a small fraction of the $310 billion stablecoin market, but their role is shifting from niche experiment to operational default. The International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) noted in recent guidance that tokenized money market funds are increasingly used as stablecoin reserve assets and as collateral for crypto-related transactions. This is precisely the interlinkages driving USYC's growth. JPMorgan framed tokenized money market funds as the next frontier after stablecoins, centered on portability and collateral efficiency. The bank's analysis treats tokenized Treasuries not as an alternative to stablecoins but as an evolution of them. They are programmable cash equivalents that settle faster, move across blockchains more easily, and integrate into collateral systems with less operational overhead than traditional custody arrangements. With stablecoin yields near zero, tokenized Treasuries offer a risk-free on-chain rate without requiring users to exit crypto rails. Instead of parking cash in non-yielding stablecoins or moving it off-chain to earn returns, institutions can now hold yield-bearing collateral on-chain that functions like cash but compounds like Treasuries. Tokenized US Treasuries grew from $2 billion to $9 billion in 18 months. BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and Circle now offer on-chain T-bills as margin collateral, DeFi building blocks, and stablecoin alternatives. The $10 billion milestone is less important than the capture rate it represents. Tokenized Treasuries currently account for roughly 3% to 4% of the stablecoin float. If that rate doubles over the next 12 months, which is a conservative assumption given current flow momentum and collateral integrations, tokenized Treasuries could reach $20 billion to $25 billion. If collateral flywheels accelerate and more venues replicate Binance-style off-exchange rails, the range stretches to $40 billion to $60 billion. The metrics that matter are all measurable: net issuance trends, collateral integration announcements, changes to eligibility requirements, and shifts in income-handling preferences. USYC's 30-day growth rate and BUIDL's contraction are early signals. The Binance integration timeline is another. The funnel gap is a third. USYC didn't flip BUIDL because Circle outspent BlackRock on marketing. It flipped because distribution, mechanics, and access constraints aligned with how institutions actually use on-chain collateral. The category crossed $10 billion not because one flagship product dominated, but because multiple products are now competing on infrastructure terms: who integrates faster, who reduces friction, who widens the funnel. Brand recognition opened doors. Collateral workflow design is keeping them open. Switch categories to dive deeper or gain broader context. A new comms lead, an institutions portal, and “Get in touch” CTAs suggest Ethereum thinks perception is becoming adoption. Collateral mobility is the pitch, yet delivery-versus-payment depends on an on-chain cash leg that isn’t fully ready.

Only two of the top six won on an unpredictable day in Division 1A of the Energia All-Ireland League on Saturday, with Young Munster the prime movers as they climbed from sixth to third thanks to their 37-20 victory over Terenure at Tom Clifford Park. A key moment in the Cookies registering their fourth win in succession was a big defensive set in front of a large segment of the home crowd by the club house on half-time. This led to a scuffle and a relieving penalty in preserving a 17-6 interval lead after tries by Bailey Faloon and Stephen McLoughlin. After a try by number eight and man of the match Luke Murphy, Aran Egan responded for Terenure, and then another Munster academy player, scrumhalf Jake O’Riordan, scored a length-of-the-pitch intercept try as ‘Nure pressed to make it a one-score game. Oisín Pepper, the Cookies’ quick and skilful 21-year-old centre, who was released by the Munster academy, marked his second game after a six-month absence following shoulder surgery by scoring after good work by John Poland and Shane O’Leary. Pepper was one of 12 players from Limerick schools in the matchday squad. Jordan Coghlan scored a brace in Clontarf’s 10th consecutive win, overcoming an improving Nenagh 35-24 in their first ever visit to Castle Avenue. Second-placed St Mary’s were held to a 16-all draw at home by Ballynahinch, with Mick O’Gara converting Mick McCormack’s late try in taking his tally for the season to 115 points. UCD and Old Belvedere underlined the competitiveness of 1A with 20-15 and 18-12 home wins over Lansdowne and Cork Con respectively. Lansdowne led 15-7 at the break thanks to tries from Bobby Sheehan, his sixth of the season, and Harry van Eaden, but Evan Moynihan and Eoghan Walsh added to a first-half try by James Culhane as the Students completed a double over the visitors. Belvo are coming to grips with life in 1A, tries by Justin Leonard and captain Calum Dowling helping them establish an 18-5 interval lead. Con, missing the influential Jack Kelleher (hamstring), responded with Danny Sheehan’s seventh try of the season before Belvo withstood late pressure. In 1B Blackrock College were surprise 20-7 winners over Instonians, Old Wesley pulling 10 points clear with five second-half tries to beat Queen’s University 36-7. MU Barnhall and Galwegians remained unbeaten at the top of 2A and 2B thanks to 11-3 and 50-15 home wins over Greystones and Navan. ‘Wegians outside centre Rob Deacy, the leading try scorer across all five divisions, scored his 12th in nine games, the home side recording their 11th bonus-point win in 11 games before many among a big crowd at Crowley Park rolled down the hill to the unveiling of the Clan Stand and the interpro between Connacht and Leinster.

UPDATED 11:33 EST / JANUARY 25 2026 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante and Erik Bradley At the beginning of each year, as is our tradition, we team up with Enterprise Technology Research to dig through the latest data and craft 10 predictions for the coming year. This year’s prognostication follows the publication where we grade our 2025 predictions. In this Breaking Analysis, we tap some of the most telling nuggets from ETR’s rich data set and put forth our top 10 predictions for enterprise tech in 2025. Most of the predictions below are backed up with data based on proprietary market intelligence from ETR’s Technology Spending Intentions Survey (TSIS) and its quarterly macro drill-down data, which surveys more than 1,700 business technology leaders. Each year we get thousands of inbound predictions from tech companies and thought leaders. We go through each one and categorize them. Every year the folder gets larger. In the graphic below we show the mix of topic areas. Of course everything is artificial intelligence, but we’ve tried to isolate those that were AI-specific. As always, security is top of mind for forecasters, as you can see with 25% of the inbounds. Our predictions this year span information technology spending, AI return on investment, Nvidia Corp.’s moat, data, large language models, cloud, changes to the software-as-a-service model, security, hardware pricing and the memory shortag, and the impact of AI on jobs. Let’s dive into the detail. The first prediction is: IT budgets rise about 5% in 2026. Since COVID, organizations have dealt with sustained pressure on IT budgets as interest rates rose and uncertainty dominated. Geopolitical tensions, wars, tariffs and related shocks have kept decision-makers cautious. Against that backdrop, ETR’s quarterly macro drill-down shows IT decision makers currently expecting a 4.6% budget increase. The call at 5% is a modest step above the mean, with notable divergence in large enterprises – they remain more conservative at under 4% – while the C-suite and Asia-Pacific respondents are more optimistic. The data is moving in the right direction. The forward spending outlook has improved meaningfully versus earlier surveys, with a notable jump from the first October survey when respondents were asked for the first time about forward spend into January. In the current survey, 74% of respondents indicate they plan to increase spending, the highest level since January 2022. This suggests the optimism is not isolated to a single segment. The large-enterprise caution is a concern, however, but even within the Fortune 500, the trend is improving, rising by more than a percentage point survey-over-survey. The C-suite cut comes in above the mean at 5.2%, reinforcing that senior leadership sentiment is leaning more aggressively toward growth than the broader population. An important nuance is what this metric represents. This is IT budget data – not vendor revenue. It includes staffing and related internal costs and should not be conflated with market forecasts from firms such as IDC and Gartner forecasting vendor revenue growth. Over time, budgets are likely to evolve as the data center buildout expands access to token-based services and as organizations scale up with less headcount. Staffing is one of the largest line items in IT budgets, and AI-driven productivity and automation will influence that mix going forward. The near-term focus, however, is the 2026 budget direction of roughly 5%, reflected in the survey. The second prediction is that 2026 becomes the year enterprises start seeing AI ROI at scale. In prior years, our prediction was that ROI would remain elusive. The data is now moving in a different direction, with signs of a productivity increasing and more evidence that enterprises are beginning to operationalize AI in ways that sustain returns. The ROI story is aligning around two themes: 1) Measurement discipline and 2) Scaling outcomes. Early in the cycle, organizations were spending heavily while a large portion of the market either was not measuring ROI or had not seen any return. In November 2024, combining “not measuring ROI” with “had not seen ROI” put the total near 50%, a concerning gap between investment intensity and financial confidence. That gap is narrowing. The most important shift is that more organizations are measuring ROI. The share that is not measuring dropped from 27% to 18%, and a rise in financial-operations adoption in the ETR data signals that enterprises are putting cost controls and accountability structures around AI spending. Six to eight months ago, FinOps barely surfaced in insights panels and interviews. Now it is showing up constantly, which tracks with a market moving from experimentation to governance and operational rigor. The data also shows incremental improvement in realized ROI bands. The 1% to 10% ROI bucket has fluctuated but has steadily increased since November 2024. That supports the view that organizations are beginning to realize returns and are learning how to align AI initiatives with measurable outcomes. A key nuance is what enterprises expect ROI to be. In the ETR AI series data, 66% of respondents say AI ROI comes from cost efficiency and margin improvement. Only 23% expect ROI to come from revenue growth or new product creation. That distribution is relevant because it explains why FinOps is rising and why measurement is becoming central. If most ROI is expected to come from margin and efficiency, auditing and control of usage and spend becomes a prerequisite for declaring success. The third prediction comes out of research published earlier this month following Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang’s keynote at CES. The call is that Nvidia widens its lead over the broader graphics processing unit/tensor processing unit/application-specific integrated circuit pack because its cost per token advantage improves materially in 2026. A key factor is Nvidia’s CES disclosure that its latest GPU Vera Rubin is in full production and will ramp this year. The data shared at CES pointed to a rapid step-function improvement over Blackwell delivered in roughly 12 months: 5X performance, 10X throughput, and a 10X improvement in token cost. That combination of higher output and far lower unit costs is expected to drive a significant uptake in demand. The demand premise is based on Jevons Paradox – as price declines, consumption rises – and the prediction is that the cost-per-token reduction contributes to a 15X increase in demand. Against that backdrop, we expect the narrative that TPUs and ASICs are eroding Nvidia’s moat will itself erode, and the expectation is that Nvidia’s financial metrics will will reflect the magnitude of this advantage. Nvidia’s price-to-earnings ratio is hovering in the mid-20s – even lower than Walmart – and that multiple increases as investors internalize the sustainability of Nvidia’s position. It’s possible and even likely that some GPU designers will pivot to edge use cases or cancel programs. Looking ahead, our expectation is that Nvidia faces effectively no competition in the data center except where demand cannot be met. That unmet demand supports alternatives, but the path for competitors goes through inference and workloads at the edge. Our view is that Nvidia also performs well at the edge, with the addition of a lock-up a deal with Groq. Demand continues to outstrip supply, which means suppliers broadly sell what they can ship. The implication is that the best news for competitors is the current “rising tide” environment lifts all chip boats, and suppliers have little incentive to see that dynamic change soon. We believe data gravity increasingly benefits database platform incumbents as enterprises build AI capabilities on top of their existing ecosystems. Using Snowflake Inc. as an example, the data suggests that add-on services to a core data platform – like Cortex – become a natural extension of the underlying database. The core platform remains sticky, and that stickiness increases as customers pull adjacent workloads into the same ecosystem. In our view, this dynamic extends beyond Snowflake to other major incumbents, including Databricks Inc., Oracle Corp. and Microsoft Corp. This chart above has two parts that reinforce the prediction. Specifically, when teams build AI applications, they tend to stay close to the database ecosystem where their data already lives – and that shows up in spending intentions. Starting on the right-hand graphic: This comes from ETR’s build-versus-buy AI series and looks only at respondents who say they are building their own AI applications. The y-axis is Paired Usage Likelihood Impact, which is a way of showing how strongly two components show up together in the same tech stack. Using Snowflake as the clearest example in this cut, the chart shows that when customers adopt Snowflake Cortex Search, they are far more likely to adopt additional Snowflake components. Specifically: In our view, this is the data gravity effect in practice. Once a customer is anchored in a Snowflake-led workflow for one element of the AI stack, the probability increases that adjacent elements – search, vector search or vector database style capabilities, and model-related components – remain inside the same ecosystem. Now move to the left-hand graphic: This is from ETR’s Technology Spending Intentions Survey and shows Snowflake Net Score (spending momentum) trends over time across three categories that relate to this prediction: Each cluster shows snapshots over five time points spanning from Jan 2025 to Jan 2026. The chart headline says it all: “Gains in Database and Analytics drives aggregate Snowflake recovery.” The data suggests a meaningful rebound in Snowflake’s core database and analytics momentum showing up in 2026, with Database/Data Warehousing notably jumping back up versus the prior quarters, and Analytics showing a similar recovery pattern. ML/AI remains elevated but comparatively steadier across the period. The bottom line is that we see a pull toward the incumbent’s database ecosystem when organizations are building their own AI applications. Snowflake is the clearest example in this dataset. When customers are using Snowflake for one layer of their stack, they are more likely to stay in the Snowflake ecosystem for adjacent capabilities including search, vector search, vector database and foundational model usage combined with other stack elements. This in our view highlights the predictive value of the ETR dataset as a leading indicator. In prior market shifts, Breaking Analysis observed survey data that flagged early movement, including the work-from-home wave and its impact on vendors such as CrowdStrike Holdings Inc., Okta Inc. and Zscaler Inc. We have seen similar leading signals in the rise of Snowflake and Databricks, periods of softening that preceded market repricing and subsequent rebounds. The data suggests the current resurgence is part of that same pattern of early signal preceding broader market recognition. The message is that platform incumbency is compounding in the sense that as enterprises build AI applications, they consolidate more of the stack around the database ecosystem they already trust, and the data suggests Snowflake is currently the clearest beneficiary of that gravity with a measurable resurgence in spending intent. We believe 2026 is the inflection year where leading model providers optimize around enterprise adoption, not just model benchmarks and consumer buzz. Our bet is that OpenAI follows Anthropic’s enterprise posture more aggressively, uses consumer scale as leverage, and exits 2026 with enterprise revenue that surpasses Anthropic’s. In parallel, we expect OpenAI to pressure Google’s search economics, and we expect Elon Musk’s Grok to pursue edge-oriented opportunities where he already has a strategic footprint. The chart above shows where model and AI platforms sit inside enterprise accounts today, using two dimensions from ETR’s TSIS. First, read the plots. Each dot is a vendor. The x-axis is Overlap %, which we use here as a proxy for pervasion and account penetration across the dataset. The y-axis is Shared Net Score, which represents spending momentum among the accounts where the vendor is present. The red dotted line at 40% is the “highly elevated momentum” threshold. The upper-right corner is the power position indicating high penetration and high momentum. That is where Microsoft and OpenAI Group PBC sit in the January 2026 survey and have for some time. Amazon Web Services Inc. and Google LLC are clustered close together in the upper-middle portion, reflecting strong momentum and meaningful overlap. Databricks and Snowflake sit near one another as well, which fits our prior prediction on data gravity and platform pull-through. Anthropic PBC is high on the y-axis with strong momentum, sitting above the red line with notable progress since last year. Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama is well below the threshold and has fallen out of the leadership conversation in this dataset (and the market) relative to the leaders. In the lower-left are the legacy machine learning and AI players fighting for relevance on both overlap and momentum. Second, use the table on the right to anchor the scatter with exact numbers. For JAN26 Shared Net Score and Shared N, Anthropic leads at 72.5% (345), followed by Microsoft at 65.5% (795) and OpenAI at 60.7% (677). Databricks comes in at 58.8% (250). AWS and Google are tied at 58.0% with Shared N of 450 and 483, respectively. Snowflake is at 47.5% (265) and Meta Llama at 29.9% (137). Pervasion on the x-axis is the leading indicator to watch as this shifts from experimentation to enterprise standardization. OpenAI is already near 40% pervasion versus Anthropic at roughly 20%, while most other players remain in single digits. Anthropic doubled pervasion from about 10% to 20% in a year, but OpenAI’s starting position is meaningfully more entrenched inside enterprise environments. That penetration advantage is relevant to our prediction because we believe it makes the consumer volume a feature for enterprise, not a bug. OpenAI’s distribution, usage patterns and familiar interface create gravity that increasingly supports enterprise use cases and API-driven deployments. Recent data suggests that OpenAI’s API added more than $1 billion in annualized revenue run rate last month alone, which reflects enterprise-driven revenue generation and evidence the platform is moving beyond a consumer chatbot phase. In our view, once that enterprise flywheel starts spinning, it continues to gain momentum. On Google, our prediction extends beyond model performance, where Gemini has made truly impressive strides. We believe OpenAI’s recent moves around advertising are aimed at pressuring Google’s core economics. Search queries cost fractions of pennies, AI queries are far more expensive (100X), and we expect OpenAI to keep testing ways to insert itself and disrupt Google’s advertising economics. Though Microsoft’s earlier attempts to AI-ify Bing did not deliver the intended results, we believe OpenAI’s scale and positioning give it a better chance. On Grok, we expect a push to the edge. Elon had explored designing a data center GPU, then backed away from that path as Nvidia’s lead became more obvious. At the same time, Tesla Inc. already operates with an edge-oriented chip design capability built around Arm and customized neural processing units, or NPUs, for vehicles. We believe Grok strengthens that position, with continued silicon innovation focused at the edge while xAI Holdings Corp. scales data center capacity rapidly in Memphis – with a high priority position in Nvidia’s allocation queue. Longer-term, theCUBE Research work by George Gilbert and David Floyer suggests that leading LLM companies could evolve into a new breed of software delivered through application programming interfaces, making adoption easier for enterprises without deep engineering chops. We do not expect that full transformation to be obvious in 2026, but we believe it ties directly to the multiyear shift from legacy IT spend toward token generation and more AI-ified operating models. The message is that enterprise penetration and spending momentum are converging around a small set of leaders, and the data suggests OpenAI has the distribution advantage to translate consumer scale into enterprise-standard deployments, with Anthropic setting the pace on momentum, and Google and AWS clustered tightly – Google having the advantage in proprietary models — and Grok positioning for edge-driven differentiation over time. We believe Google Cloud Platform continues closing the gap on AWS and Azure in 2026, driven primarily by its prowess in AI, reinforced by a world-class data foundation, and supported by improving profitability. As shown below, while GCP still trails in enterprise penetration, the leading indicators in spending intent suggest momentum is shifting in Google’s favor, particularly inside large enterprises. Google Cloud Platform is showing sustained momentum. The starting point is growth and operating leverage. By our estimates, GCP grew roughly 40% last quarter. Alphabet discloses Google Cloud overall rather than GCP specifically, but we believe GCP is growing meaningfully faster than the consolidated cloud segment. At the same time, Google Cloud operating margins have moved into the black and are now in the mid-20s, and moving in a direction we see as increasingly encouraging for a scaled cloud business. In our opinion, those margins continue to expand as the business matures, and that translates into meaningful cash generation over time. The ETR data above reinforces the momentum. In the core spending intent datasets, GCP is the only one of the Big Three cloud providers showing year-over-year Net Score acceleration, while AWS and Azure both declined. Penetration remains lower – pervasion trails those two, particularly versus Azure – but the direction of spend intent is moving up. The spending intent improvements are not confined to smaller accounts. The increase shows up in Fortune 100, Fortune 500 and Global 2000 cohorts, which historically have been harder for Google to penetrate. We believe that shift reflects Google’s broader enterprise prowess – more credibility with the largest organizations and more proof points that GCP can run mission-critical workloads at scale. ETR’s AI series data provides more evidence to explain why this is happening now. We see rising usage across Google’s AI build stack, including Gemini and Vertex AI, with gains survey over survey. In our view, Google’s positioning as both a foundational model provider and a cloud hosting platform is becoming more integrated, and that integration is beginning to show up in customer behavior. We also believe Google’s approach has benefited from patience. The company has the capital to play a longer game. As operating margins climb toward the levels sustained by AWS over many quarters – and as Azure continues to benefit from software contribution – we expect Google to keep expanding profitability while it builds share. That is the combination that changes perception with accelerating demand plus improving margins. The message is that Google’s cloud business is entering a new phase where AI-led demand, improving enterprise traction and expanding operating margins work together, and the survey data suggests GCP is the only Big Three provider accelerating on Net Score while extending its relevance with the largest global organizations. We believe 2026 marks a transition year for software-as-a-service monetization. Seat-based pricing has been misaligned with customer value for a long time, and AI amplifies that tension by changing how work gets done and how many users need direct licenses. At the same time, SaaS vendors have deep entrenchment in enterprise process logic and trusted data, and in our view that gives them leverage to preserve and grow revenue even as seat growth moderates. The prediction is not a SaaS collapse. The prediction is that pricing evolves, with a shift toward outcome-based and AI-inclusive monetization showing up in the numbers. The graphic above is a two-parter designed to answer the question “Does AI reduce SaaS seats, and if it does, does revenue fall with it?” The top row focuses on seats. The bottom row focuses on spend offsets. Start with the top-left table: “AI Impact on Core Software Seats – NOV25 AI Product Series.” It breaks results by customer type and shows the percentage expecting more seats versus same seats versus less seats, then summarizes the net “seat offset.” The seat offset is positive for small and medium-sized businesses (+12%) and modestly positive for the total sample (+4%). It turns negative as you move upmarket to the Global 2000 (-1%), Large (-2%) and Fortune 500 (-8%). The message is that the biggest organizations are the ones most likely to see seat pressure. Now look to the top-right table: “Seat Offset Over Time.” It shows how that seat offset is trending from NOV24 to MAY25 to NOV25. The direction is consistent in that net seat impact is moving down over time, especially in larger cohorts. Global 2000 moves from +11% to +5% to -1%, and Large moves from +17% to +7% to -2%. Fortune 500 shifts from +6% to 0% to -8%. Seat growth is moderating, and in large enterprises it is flipping negative. Now move to the bottom-left table: “AI Spend Offset for Reductions in Seat Spending – NOV25 AI Product Series.” This is the follow-up question asking even if seats decline, does AI-related spend compensate? Respondents are asked whether AI spend will exceed, match, or fall short of any reduction in seat spend. In the Global 2000 row, 51% say AI spend exceeds the seat reduction, 33% say it matches, and 15% say it falls short. That pattern indicates monetization moving from seats toward AI and outcomes. Finally, bolster the conclusion with the bottom-right table: “AI Spend Net Impact Over Time.” This compresses the prior view into a single net impact metric over time. In NOV25, SMB shows 38%, Global 2000 shows 36%, and All Respondents shows 30%. Fortune 500 and Large are lower at 27% and 25% respectively, but still positive. Even in cohorts where seat offsets are negative, the net spend impact remains meaningfully positive. This is why we believe the market’s “SaaS is dead” and the “SaaS-Attack” narrative is overstated. Seat counts can be pressured while revenue grows if vendors successfully reprice around AI, usage and outcomes. We also believe the public commentary from large SaaS vendors aligns with this dynamic. Specifically, customers are asking for help operationalizing AI, and vendors are embedding AI into the products where data, metadata and business process logic already live. The message is that AI creates real headwinds for SaaS seat expansion, especially in the largest enterprises, but the spend data suggests SaaS vendors preserve and grow revenue by shifting monetization toward AI, usage and outcomes – a pricing evolution, not a SaaS collapse. We believe 2026 produces a new class of breach that most security teams are not prepared to contain — specifically, a major SaaS incident where no human credentials are stolen. Additionally, the attack vector is agentic, coordinated across multiple SaaS platforms, and executed by multiple AI agents from different vendors. The novelty is a logic hack, not a credential hack, set off by a prompt injection or agent-to-agent manipulation that redirects an agent’s behavior, spreads laterally via trusted integrations, and moves at machine speed across the digital supply chain. This prediction builds on a related warning from one of our inbounds that came from Shahar Man, CEO and co- founder of Backslash Security. In November 2025, he predicted, “A major MCP breach will define the AI coding threat model – We’ll see in 2026, the first large- scale breach originating from MCP.” What we saw with the Anthropic hack was related and supported the direction of Shahar’s prediction. We’re building on that prediction and expecting something broader. The breach we are forecasting involves one agent reprogramming another through prompt injection, then using MCP connections across SaaS platforms to jump domains – finance, HR, supply chain – potentially spanning multiple vendors and even multiple companies. In our view, agents become bridgeheads meaning once a nonhuman identity is granted access and can influence adjacent agents, the blast radius expands quickly. Some are referring to this as a polyagent breach, where the infection doesn’t just stay in one system. The security implication is disconcerting. Antivirus is blind to this class of attack because there is no traditional malware signature. Firewalls do not help because the agents are executing authorized actions within permitted domains. Phishing campaigns often take weeks or months to coordinate with humans. An agent-driven breach can propagate at machine speed, chaining together permissions and actions faster than human response loops can keep up. To defend this, organizations will need to put in things such as AI honeypot tokens to lure the bad agents, semantics that scan every agentic conversation, and much more sophisticated defense systems that most organizations won’t have in place in 2026. A credible path is identity-first controls and agent governance. Nonhuman identities require zero-trust security, full stop. They must be governed, continuously monitored and treated as untrusted by default. The risk is structural in that if one agent has access that was legitimately granted, and it can influence another agent, the effective access boundary expands beyond what the organization intended. The market is already signaling urgency. Within the CISO community, agentic AI governance, protection and security is again a top topic. Qualitative trend data suggests that identity-centric and zero-trust principles are among the top priorities, and the mandate is moving from theory to budget and operations. The vendor landscape is also shifting toward identity-centric consolidation and platform plays. The Palo Alto Networks Inc.-CyberArk Software Ltd. acquisition is a clear example of this direction. The practitioner requirement is for improved visibility, better decisioning based on data, and the ability to leverage identity intelligence as a defense mechanism. Security operations teams are already adopting agentic AI for triaging alerts and initial investigations, but the identity side is where the value becomes critical because identity is where the permissions live. This relates with a broader dynamic we track every year – tool sprawl and consolidation intent versus consolidation reality. Practitioners consistently express interest in reducing tool counts, but the data shows limited actual consolidation so far. That creates exposure. Platform vendors argue they are seeing consolidation power their business. Practitioners largely agree consolidation is desirable and also acknowledge it is not happening fast enough to reduce risk materially. The message here is that agentic systems expand the attack surface into a new domain where credentials are not stolen and malware is not planted, rather agent behavior is redirected. In our view, 2026 is the year this becomes visible in a major SaaS breach, and the organizations that are not operating identity-first, zero-trust governance for nonhuman identities are exposed to a class of risk that moves faster than their current defenses and operating models can respond. We believe hardware pricing remains elevated through 2026 and persists into 2027, driven by an ongoing memory shortage and a supply chain that is being reoriented around data center demand. High-bandwidth memory, NAND and RAM are in tight supply as data centers absorb capacity, and we expect that dynamic to keep pressure on pricing well beyond a normal cycle. In our view, this becomes a competitive differentiator for suppliers and OEMs that can secure allocation wins. Notably, buyers face a tougher refresh environment in 2026. The chart above captures two things: 1) How respondents say hardware prices have moved recently; and 2) How that pricing trend has shifted over time. Start with the distribution in the center. Respondents are asked: To what extent have vendors lowered or raised prices in the past six months compared to seven to twelve months ago? The responses are concentrated on the “raised” side. A meaningful portion of the sample reports increases in the mid-single digits and above, with a large block indicating raised by 3% to 5% as the most common outcome, followed by raised by 6% to 10% and additional cohorts seeing even larger jumps. At the high end, roughly 25% of respondents say prices rose 6% to 20% or more, which is a significant inflation indicator for hardware buyers. Now anchor that with the time series on the right. The average change in hardware pricing bottomed in late 2024 at roughly 2% to 2.5%. Since then, the average has risen by about a full percentage point, reaching 3.6% in the latest survey. The implication is that hardware price inflation is not fading as a temporary post-pandemic trend. It is re-accelerating at a time when many organizations would normally be entering a refresh cycle. We believe the supply-demand imbalance drives the continued trend, driven by AI factory demand. Vendors benefit from the current dynamic and have little incentive to rush pricing back down. Data center demand is being prioritized, and memory constraints ripple into everything from servers to storage to enterprise infrastructure to PCs. In our view, that is why terms like “AI-optimized” become mainstream marketing language, especially in PCs – memory becomes the gating factor, and vendors position optimization as product differentiation while supply remains constrained. We also believe this has second-order effects across the enterprise stack. Hardware refresh cycles influence demand for adjacent categories that ride on those refreshes, including security appliances and networking infrastructure. As pricing pressure persists, refresh timing and configuration decisions will become more constrained, with related impacts for vendors across the infrastructure and security landscape. Finally, we expect supply chain execution to be a competitive differentiator. Nvidia is likely to remain prioritized in the data center supply chain. On the PC side, it becomes a knife fight where scale and supply chain strength matter. Apple has scale. Dell is moving aggressively into consumer PCs and has a world-class supply chain. Storage vendors are already leaning into efficiency messaging, (for example, Vast Data Inc.’s flash efficiency messaging) and we expect more of that as the market stays constrained. The message is that the hardware market is entering a prolonged period where memory-driven constraints keep prices higher for longer, supply chain access becomes a competitive weapon, and buyers face a more expensive refresh cycle that reverberates across infrastructure categories well into 2027. We believe 2026 is the crossover year when AI’s impact on white-collar employment becomes visible in a way that is measurable and broadly acknowledged. The early impact is already seen in junior and entry-level roles, and this shows up in the data, first as headcount avoidance and then scaling without labor. In parallel, we expect sustained growth in blue-collar roles tied to the data center buildout – specialized trades and technical operators such as “artisan” plumbers, HVAC engineers, builders and cooling experts – where demand is already high and rising. The ETR survey data is already moving in the direction of this prediction. In July 2025, 21% of respondents said they were limiting future headcount due to AI. That figure has increased to 30% in the latest read. This trend is more pronounced in larger firms, which we see as the leading indicator. Among Global 2000 organizations, the number rises to 34%. Among Fortune 100 companies, 42% say they plan to limit future headcount because of AI. The message is that the larger the organization, the more aggressive the posture on future headcount constraints tied directly to AI. We are also seeing movement from avoidance to reduction. Strategic headcount reduction attributed to AI is rising more slowly than avoidance, but the increase from 14% to 18% in roughly half a year is material. These are not marginal shifts, and they are not based on a small or anecdotal sample. The survey represents roughly 1,800 qualified IT experts and IT decision-makers across industries, which makes the directional signal difficult to dismiss. We believe this sits inside a larger pattern that plays out in major technology transitions. Over successive waves – mainframes to PCs, then the internet, cloud, mobile, social and big data – markets tend to reward the new before the new is large enough to offset the decline in the old. That mismatch creates volatility and shifting narratives. We see it today in sector rotation and sentiment – semiconductors in favor, SaaS out of favor – and we expect those narratives to continue shifting. The sensible approach is to focus on the data, filter out headline noise and track the adoption signals that show up in spending behavior and operating model changes. In our opinion, AI is larger than prior waves because it stands on the shoulders of them all. It changes the unit economics of work, and that shows up first in constrained hiring and then in reductions as organizations learn where automation is durable. Over time, we expect labor demand to rebalance, with new job creation tied to physical infrastructure and AI-enabled industries, but 2026 is positioned to be the year where the labor displacement data becomes hard to ignore. The message is that 2026 becomes the year AI’s labor impact is visible in enterprise headcount decisions at scale, led by hiring constraints in the largest organizations and followed by rising reductions, while demand for specialized blue-collar roles expands alongside the data center buildout and the broader AI infrastructure wave. We’re beyond the first inning of this AI era, which started really in 2017 with research papers on diffusion models and transformers. The ChatGPT moment exposed AI’s potential to the masses and now we’re entering the enterprise adoption phase, which we see as the real opportunity. How you see 2026 shaping up?

Title: XRP Charts Flash Familiar Signal As Analyst Calls For $11, Then $70

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. A growing number of chart watchers are pointing to a long stretch of sideways trading for XRP and saying this setup has come before big rallies. According to a widely followed analyst known as CryptoBull, the current price action echoes earlier runs in the token’s history. The signal is simple: long quiet periods sometimes lead to sharp moves when buying pressure returns. That does not mean a jump is guaranteed. Markets can stay quiet for a long time, and timing is uncertain. Based on reports, XRP’s weekly structure shows a stretch of range trading after strong breakouts from earlier years. The comparison reaches back several cycles. In past examples, long ranges eventually gave way to impulsive runs that pushed the price far above prior highs. The next impulse will take #XRP to $11 and the last wave to $70. The price pattern is copying the previous bullrun, only difference is time, which makes sense, as we need longer accumulation for higher prices. pic.twitter.com/WJxzYDVRKT — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) January 23, 2026 CryptoBull argues the present consolidation has lasted longer than previous ones, which, he says, could compress price action and build fuel for a larger expansion when momentum flips. The idea rests on history repeating itself in broad strokes, not in exact moves. Some analysts see a sixfold move as plausible if the same pattern plays out. That kind of rise would put XRP near $11, a figure being discussed by multiple commentators. There is also talk of a further, final wave lifting the token much higher in a later stage — talk that reaches $70 in extreme scenarios. A bottom test—where price revisits support to confirm strength before a new push—has appeared in a few past cycles and is being watched closely now. The presence of such tests can either validate a base or warn that the range has more work to do. Timelines are vague, and a long accumulation period can stretch for years before any decisive breakout. Reports that BlackRock may use Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin have added fuel to the fire. News like that has pushed sentiment upward and sparked fresh technical calls, with some forecasts ranging from $6 to $14 in near- to mid-term scenarios. Other voices go far beyond, naming targets that would imply market caps so large they would be hard to reconcile with today’s market size. These more extreme numbers should be treated with caution, because they assume near-perfect conditions and massive capital flows that may never arrive. Still, adoption whispers can tilt sentiment and speed up moves when buyers pile in. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView They say journalists never truly clock out.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Word has it that the 2026 World Economic Forum (WEF) Davos event went down as the worst ever in WEF’s history. Maybe it has to do with Trump’s showing up and everybody, including the Swiss Government, falling on their knees to please the emperor without clothes; and / or because Larry Fink, the BlackRock Chair, now literally owns the WEF and calls the shot on everything. Everyone below him, even the co-chairs, are YES-people. What is playing out ever clearer is a digital-financial dictatorship, largely run by robotized humanoids. As long as the money flows – and flowing it does, better believe it – everything is allowed. President Trump was literally uprooting Davos, the Swiss Government, and foremost the Swiss air traffic – see below. He also uprooted the stock market, not by accident. When Trump first talked about his “sanctioning” the eight (8) EU countries and NATO partners that opposed his invasion of Greenland, the stock market slumped by record rates: The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 870 points (approx. 1.8%-1.9%), while the S&P 500 fell 2.1% and the Nasdaq dropped 2.4%. When shortly after his WEF speech, Trump reversed his decision on the 10% tariff for EU opposition, the stock market rebounded. Guess who are the main winners and losers of this algorithmically-driven game? Right, the ultra-rich, like the Elon Musks of this world. The common people as usual are the losers. On freedom of speech of the so-called democracy – which was and is a scam — has never existed, not even in Greece of 2,300 years ago, Delphi was a farce perpetuated to this day, as the Greek know very well – so, on freedom of speech, for example, Trump tried to block California’s Governor Gavin Newsom from attending Davos. Mr. Newsom came anyway – see this and this. Everything, including WEF’s treatment of staff, was horrible, although up-front the Davos organizing staff were praised for a good job. In reality, they were treated by WEF “superiors” like slaves, with insults, and disrespect. And that after the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) and Financial Times (FT) had already investigated the WEF in 2024 and 2025 for suspected “irregularities” – concerning especially Klaus Schwab, and for sexual harassment of female employees, regarding Schwab and WEF management. An investigation by lawyers hired by the very WEF vindicated Schwab and the WEF in 2025 from any wrongdoing, as could be expected. So, the WEF management starts on a new slate, so to speak. But the old dirt shines through the new slate, and becomes even worse, as Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, by far the largest financier of the WEF, has become one of WEF’s co-chairs, and now effectively owns the WEF. BlackRock and Vanguard, the two intimately connected and legally interchangeable financial behemoths, manage worldwide corporate assets valued between US$ 25 and US$ 35 trillion. They basically run and decide over every vital sector in the world, including food, energy, banking, production, military and services industries – you name it – with a majority ownership. Speaking at the WEF, Larry Fink, sounded like a polite financial autocrat, clearly pointing the way to an all-digitized monetary system, controlled by electronic IDs, insinuating to be monitored by BlackRock-Vanguard (although never mentioning Vanguard by name). In other words, Larry Fink and his ilk pretend to control your money, the way you spend it – or not – and whether you behave in style with the elite oligarchs’ narrative to continue being able to use your earned money, or have it blocked for misbehavior. We are in the hands of psychopaths, who are allowed covering a worldwide audience with their annual Davos event, another nail in the WEF’s coffin. To complement Larry Fink’s finance-digital ruling, Elon Musk made a surprise appearance in Davos on 22 January, engaging in a 30-minute conversation with Larry Fink. His remarks focused on technology’s role in securing humanity’s future through an absurdly promised abundance, multi-planetary expansion, and cautious AI advancement. The tech oligarch pointed to their companies’ shared goal: maximizing civilization’s probability of a great future by extending consciousness beyond Earth, adding that his SpaceX’s 9,000 satellites confirm that there is no evidence of aliens “out there”, that life is indeed a “rare tiny candle” in a vast darkness. Elon’s sci-fi mind aspired to die on Mars “just not on impact,” [hahaha]; and aging reversal seems solvable via a body-wide “clock”. Whatever that means. AI will probe existence’s mysteries. In brief, he painted the oligarch’s usual rosy “bla-bla-picture” that any thinking individual knows, means exactly the contrary. See this. Back to the 2026 WEF and Trump in Davos: what no mainstream will report — the airport in Zurich was blocked on Wednesday morning with numerous Trump planes, several cargos, C-130’s and the sort, for Trump’s limousine convoys and private helicopters flown in from Washington. The so called “plane spotters” at 6 AM on 21 January were crushing barricades at Zurich airport to see Trump arrive, whenever he arrived, later than he should have, due to a last-minute change of airplane. Several planes carrying heads of state to go to Davos, i.e., from Greece and Cyprus, could not land at Zurich airport. There was no more space, since in addition to Trump’s extra planes, there were an unprecedented 850 private jets also parked at the airport from WEF attendees. Compare this with 65 for the COP29 (November 2024) Summit at Baku, Azerbaijan. The politicians who could not land – and many others, of course — had to cancel their attendance in Davos. For sure, no big loss. Some of the 3,000 attendees in Davos, heads of State, highly educated (or one would think) corporate CEO’s, managing trillions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of people, caused literally a stampede to enter the room where Trump was blabbering for over 70 minutes – when normally heads of states are allocated 10 to 20-minute slots. These high-level WEF attendees were running – charging – into and over the organizing staff, crushing them against the walls, hurting one lady so badly she had to leave, so they could enter the special conference room where Trump was to speak. That demonstrates a conscience level of high-flying WEF attendee-billionaires comparable to football fans. Swiss military, two rows of them, were placed inside the room, instead of outside, to help prevent a stampede. Stupidity increasingly worldwide knows no frontiers. The entire WEF meetings had to be reorganized and last-minute restructured for Trump, and of course BlackRock calls the shots on everything. As Trump and BlackRock’s Larry Fink indicated, though not in words, in their WEF speeches – we are racing towards the goals of the 2030 Agenda which never left us. This 2030 agenda, also called the Great Reset, prepared for over 100 years, represents a complete destruction of civilization’s orders and laws, towards societal chaos and ever-changing values – from where they, the monsters behind the WEF, expect the emergence of a “New World Order”, under a “One World Government.” This One World Government may be based on “multiple pillars” [they call it multi-polar to once again deceive the public at large], pillars, represented by world powers other than the United States, like Russia and China. This explains why and how Trump could invade Venezuela on January 3, 2026, and kidnap President Maduro, killing over 100 people, without any material interference of Russia and China, at the time also present with their respective navies in the Caribbean. They were informed in advance. Their protests came in words, no actions. Words are blowing in the wind. These secondary thoughts and ideas are expressed in hidden messages by the WEF and its elite attendees, because they represent a worldwide Cult which is currently in control of our civilization. And you may guess, who is behind this Cult. According to Cult wisdom – call it Cult science – any actions or plans MUST be announced in one form or another to the populace concerned, so that it will be successful. Hence the many “predictive” monster and horror movies produced by Hollywood. Just look at the current list of the “10 best movies” as the 2026 Oscar nominees. See this. They all keep humanity on low vibrations which is a MUST for them manipulating human minds, preventing them from ascending to a higher level of consciousness. As an example, look at horror-vampire flick, “Sinners” which was literally nominated for every category of Oscars. The coordination between the WEF, those who pull the strings behind it, and all the 2030 Agenda agents and actors used to control humanity, among them Hollywood, is perfect. But there comes the point where the apparently limitless exuberance of sugar-charged energy brains, à la “We can do what we want, nobody stops us” – like Trump’s – will backfire. So, in the end, this horrifying organization called WEF is self-destructing. It MUST be. The faster the better. At the same time, think THE NOW gives humanity a chance for a new start outside of the slavehood of our digital monetary system and digital control-gulag. May there be soon an end to our dystopian Cult world. Instead, let us open our hearts and souls for Love and Light to emerge on our Blue Planet’s sentinel beings. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: Tariffs, Treasuries and the Quiet Risk to America’s Financial Power

Standing in the Rose Garden last April, flanked by American flags, US President Donald Trump declared war on free trade. Nine months later, the most striking feature of that declaration is not how much commerce has collapsed, but how quickly it has rerouted. Trade did not stop; it flowed around obstacles. As a DHL Express company executive observed, trade “will find its way” — behaving, in effect, like water flowing around obstacles under high-tariff regimes. That image of water seeking a new channel captures the first-order reality of the Trump administration’s trade policy. Tariffs have risen sharply, and the costs are landing where economists would expect: higher prices for tariff-sensitive goods, stress on firms reliant on imported inputs, and an implicit tax on households and businesses. Yet the system has adapted. The US is buying less directly from China, but more from Chinese-owned factories operating in lower-tariff jurisdictions such as Vietnam. Mexico has emerged as an unexpected winner. And Beijing’s leverage over rare earth minerals has spurred new efforts to secure alternative supply — an industrial-policy subplot nested inside a tariff story. The second-order reality is more subtle: Trade policy uncertainty also influences the US Treasury market through financial market sentiment. Asset-manager commentary from institutions such as BlackRock and Amundi emphasizes that tariff escalation can increase macroeconomic uncertainty, raise bond market volatility and affect term premia. In this environment, investor demand for duration becomes more cautious, implying an indirect but economically meaningful link between trade policy uncertainty and Treasury yields beyond mechanical supply-and-demand effects. Understanding the Treasury channel requires starting with the obvious, then moving to the consequential. Obviously, tariffs raise revenue. Consequentially, the Treasury market is where America prices its future, and where policy uncertainty becomes a term premium that households and businesses end up paying. CAPTION: Term premium on a ten-year zero-coupon bond. Via Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Tariffs are blunt. When imposed broadly, they raise costs across wide swaths of the economy. A tariff on an imported refrigerator is not just a tax on the foreign producer; it becomes a higher landed cost for the importer, which becomes either a lower profit margin, a higher price for the consumer or a combination of both. Tariffs can also lift the price of domestic substitutes: If imported steel becomes more expensive, domestic steel producers can raise prices too, even if their cost base didn’t change as much. For consumers, the effect shows up in specific aisles: higher prices for furniture, toys and clothing; higher prices for some foods like beef, bananas and coffee; and price pressures that spread unevenly across regions and income groups. For firms, tariffs are less a doctrine than a daily problem to be managed. One small but telling example comes from the trade-law trenches. Dan Harris, a Seattle lawyer who recently began working on tariffs, now advises importers on how to legally reduce duty exposure. The methods are not dramatic — restructuring contracts, separating allowable costs, adjusting declared values within the rules — but they absorb time, capital and attention that would otherwise be spent on production or expansion. This logic repeats across supply chains. A buyer who purchases an injection mold outright avoids embedding that cost in the tariff base of every imported unit. The decision is rational and lawful, yet it underscores a broader pattern: tariffs redirect effort toward avoidance rather than efficiency. The same dynamic appears in Vietnam, where factories have seen sudden order surges as US buyers shift away from China — only to face capacity constraints and renewed uncertainty as tariffs spread. Supply chains adapt, but the adaptation itself is costly, unstable and rarely conducive to long-term productivity growth. The US budget deficit is large by historic standards — 6.2% of GDP in recent readings, roughly double the average pace from 1980 through the pre-Covid-19 pandemic era. Bigger deficits mean more Treasury issuance. If all else is equal, more supply requires either more demand or higher yields to clear the market. Tariff revenue can, in principle, reduce the borrowing needed at the margin. Customs receipts have risen sharply in the high-tariff world, creating what some policymakers see as a fiscal cushion. But the margin matters: If tariffs generate tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars in annual revenue, that is meaningful — yet it is not transformative against structural deficits driven by entitlement spending and debt service costs. The more important issue for markets is not just how much tariff revenue is collected, but how reliable that revenue is. Tariff receipts are unusually exposed to legal risk (court challenges to executive tariff authority), negotiation risk (trade deals that reduce rates or carve out exemptions) and macroeconomic risk (recessions or demand shifts that shrink import volumes). As the Bipartisan Policy Center explains, tariff revenue fluctuates with trade policy, legal outcomes and import behavior, making it an inherently volatile source of funding rather than a stable offset to deficits. That volatility matters because bond markets price expectations and risk, not static arithmetic. Even when tariff revenue rises into the tens or hundreds of billions of dollars, it remains small relative to structural deficits driven by entitlement spending and rising interest costs. PBS NewsHour shows that claims of tariffs meaningfully stabilizing the fiscal outlook break down once the scale of federal spending and borrowing is considered. Treasury yields therefore respond less to the existence of tariff revenue than to uncertainty around the longer-term fiscal path. When investors believe deficits may widen — because tariff revenue falls short, spending rises faster than expected or borrowing needs surprise to the upside — they demand higher compensation to hold long-dated debt. Because Treasury yields anchor mortgage rates and corporate borrowing costs, that repricing quickly tightens financial conditions across the economy. Tariffs may reduce borrowing at the margin, but by introducing uncertainty into revenue projections, they can also raise risk premia — offsetting part of the perceived fiscal “cushion.” If supply is one side of Treasury pricing, demand is the other — and trade policy influences demand most clearly through foreign investor behavior. Foreign investors hold roughly one-third of the US Treasury market, making their portfolio decisions central to US interest rate dynamics. During periods of tariff escalation, Council on Foreign Relations reports often raise concerns about a potential “sell America” trade, in which foreign official institutions reduce exposure to US assets as trade relationships deteriorate. Historically, however, such fears have rarely materialized in abrupt form. Even during episodes of trade conflict, foreign holdings of Treasuries have often remained stable or increased, reflecting Treasuries’ role as the world’s deepest and most liquid pool of safe collateral. In an environment of global uncertainty, investors typically prioritize liquidity and capital preservation, even when they are uncomfortable with the policy environment generating that uncertainty. The more relevant risk, therefore, is gradual erosion at the margin. Central banks and sovereign wealth funds rarely engage in headline-grabbing sales. Instead, they can diversify quietly over time by allowing maturing Treasury holdings to roll off and reinvesting incrementally elsewhere. Over years, these slow-moving adjustments can meaningfully affect demand conditions at the margin. Trade relationships matter in this process. Reserve composition has historically been influenced by trade networks, with countries tending to hold reserves in the currencies of their primary trading partners. If US protectionism leads to sustained shifts in global trade toward alternative hubs, reserve portfolios may adjust gradually in parallel — without a single triggering event, but with cumulative effects over time. From a market perspective, this distinction holds weight. Treasury demand remains deep and resilient, but it is not immutable. Persistent trade fragmentation can slowly reshape the composition of global reserves, subtly reducing marginal demand for US debt even in the absence of overt selling pressure. Such shifts are easy to overlook in the short term, yet increasingly relevant for long-term rate expectations and term premia. The third channel operates through the macro economy: how tariffs affect inflation and growth, and how those effects are ultimately priced into financial markets. Tariffs tend to raise prices directly by increasing import costs and indirectly by expanding domestic firms’ pricing power. At the same time, they can weigh on growth by raising input costs, disrupting supply chains and provoking retaliation. The resulting combination, higher inflation risk alongside weaker or more uncertain growth, is precisely the configuration that markets associate with elevated macro risk rather than a straightforward demand slowdown. Markets typically express this tension through the yield curve. When investors believe tariffs will push up near-term inflation while clouding the longer-term outlook for growth, productivity and policy stability, longer-dated yields can rise even as growth expectations soften. This reflects the role of term premia. The long end of the curve is not simply a forecast of future short rates; it also embeds compensation for inflation volatility, fiscal uncertainty and policy risk. Recent market behavior reinforces this interpretation. Gold prices have continued to rise even as US yields remain elevated, signaling that higher yields are no longer being read as a clean indicator of safety. Instead, both gold prices and long-term Treasury yields appear to be responding to the same underlying force: a rise in uncertainty and risk premia. When yields increase because investors demand additional compensation for fiscal, geopolitical and policy risk — rather than because growth prospects are improving — the opportunity cost of holding gold becomes less binding. In that sense, gold is not competing with Treasuries on yield, but reacting to doubts about their reliability as the world’s unquestioned safe asset. Geopolitical shocks can accelerate this dynamic. Recent US military actions involving Venezuela briefly pushed gold prices higher, not because they altered global trade flows in a material way, but because they reinforced perceptions of geopolitical fragility layered on top of trade and fiscal uncertainty. Such episodes matter less for their direct economic impact than for what they reveal about market psychology: When policy and geopolitical risks stack, investors demand protection that sits outside sovereign balance sheets. This framework helps explain why JP Morgan’s bullish outlook for gold remains intact even without aggressive Federal Reserve (or Fed) easing. As long as term premia stay elevated, central banks continue to diversify reserves and geopolitical flashpoints remain unresolved, higher US yields do not suppress gold prices. Instead, they reinforce incentives to diversify away from US financial assets altogether. In that sense, gold’s rise toward $5,000 per ounce by late 2026 would not represent an anomaly driven by temporary fear, but a new equilibrium consistent with a more fragmented and risk-conscious global financial system. The implications extend beyond gold. The same uncertainty that lifts demand for alternative stores of value also pushes up term premia in the Treasury market. Long-term yields rise not in anticipation of stronger growth, but as compensation for volatility and unpredictability. That repricing feeds directly into higher borrowing costs across the economy, tightening financial conditions even when the underlying trade shock itself appears manageable. For households and firms, this channel is where trade policy becomes tangible. The ten-year Treasury yield anchors borrowing costs across the economy, including mortgage rates, auto loans and corporate financing. If tariffs contribute to persistently higher term premia, it results in a durable tightening of financial conditions, often outweighing any localized employment gains associated with reshoring or import substitution. Higher yields also feed back into public finances. Rising interest rates increase government debt service costs, tightening the fiscal constraint and reinforcing deficit dynamics over time. What begins as a trade policy shock can therefore reappear as a budgetary one, amplifying longer-term sustainability concerns. Globally, higher US yields tend to transmit tighter financial conditions abroad through capital flows and exchange rate pressures, increasing stress in more vulnerable economies. In that sense, the macro consequences of tariffs are not confined to domestic prices or output; they propagate through global financial channels. For these reasons, Treasury yields are not merely an economic statistic. They are a strategic price — summarizing how trade policy, inflation risk, fiscal dynamics and global financial conditions intersect in real time. The industry stories from the tariff era are familiar by now: lawyers building compliance playbooks, factories booming in Vietnam, Mexico benefiting from trade diversion, grocery importers cancelling shipments, governments accelerating rare earth strategies. Together, they reinforce the comforting saying that trade behaves like water: Block one channel and it simply flows around the obstacle. That metaphor is only half true. Trade does reroute. The world does not stop trading because one country raises tariffs. But rerouting is not costless. It can be inflationary, as supply chains move to higher-cost locations. It can lower productivity by fragmenting production networks built for efficiency. It can shift bargaining power across firms, workers and countries. And most importantly for markets, it raises uncertainty. In financial markets, uncertainty comes with a price. In the Treasury market, it appears as a higher term premium — the extra return investors demand to hold long-dated US debt when the economic and policy outlook feels less predictable. That premium does not stay in the bond market. It is transmitted directly into mortgage rates, corporate financing costs and global capital flows. Because US Treasuries are the benchmark asset of the global financial system, changes in their pricing ripple outward. What begins as a trade policy shock can become a broad tightening of financial conditions, shaping investment decisions at home and exporting stress abroad. This is where trade policy becomes strategic. As economists Emmanuel Farhi and Matteo Maggiori argue in their model of the international monetary system, the global role of US debt rests on credibility — the belief that American public liabilities are safe, liquid and insulated from short-term political shocks. That credibility allows the United States to borrow cheaply and at scale. Paradoxically, a policy framed as strengthening national power, if mishandled, can weaken the foundation of that power. Tariffs may redirect trade. But if they also raise uncertainty and risk premia, they can quietly erode the credibility and attractiveness of US debt — the asset on which American economic power ultimately rests. The trade war has not broken global commerce but redirected it. Firms and countries are adapting quickly — routing around tariffs, shifting production footprints, building new compliance strategies and rebalancing trade relationships. That adaptability is real and will likely persist. But adaptation carries costs, and the most important costs may not appear on a customs receipt. They may appear as a higher term premium in the Treasury market — a subtle repricing of US policy uncertainty that raises borrowing costs for households, businesses and the federal government itself. This year and beyond, the most strategic way to think about tariffs is as a variable that interacts with Treasury supply, Treasury demand and the Fed’s inflation calculus. A trade policy that treats the Treasury market as an afterthought risks turning a tariff shock into a bond shock. In an economy built on the benchmark of US yields, a bond shock becomes everyone’s problem. If “trade is like water,” then Treasuries are the riverbed. Policy can redirect the flow, but if it erodes the bed, the flood will not stay contained.[Lee Thompson-Kolar edited this piece.] The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Fair Observer’s editorial policy.

While Binance co-founder and former CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao made the headlines following his interview at the just-concluded World Economic Forum, where he called a Bitcoin supercycle in 2026, his crypto counterpart and Coinbase CEO, Brian Armstrong, has come forward with feedback from the global event held in Davos, Switzerland. In a January 24 post on the social media platform X, Armstrong shared a few key “themes and takeaways” from the latest edition of WEF. After admitting that the conference offered a productive time of meeting people one-on-one, the Coinbase CEO revealed that the major focus was on pushing crypto adoption globally. Starting his list of takeaways, Armstrong highlighted that everyone was talking about tokenization, which is beginning to expand to every asset class in the world. The crypto leader said to expect some major progress in the tokenization sector in 2026, especially as the Fortune 500 business leaders continuously lean in. Secondly, the Coinbase CEO shared that crypto legislation and the CLARITY Act were another area of focus, as the government of the day looks to make the United States the crypto capital of the world. According to Armstrong, most of the bank CEOs he met at the WEF in the past week are actually pro-crypto. Armstrong wrote on X: One CEO of a top 10 global bank told me crypto is their number one priority, and they view it as existential. Furthermore, the Coinbase CEO lauded the Trump administration as the most crypto-forward government in the world at the moment. Armstrong acknowledged their progress with the crypto market structure, stating that these clear rules are crucial for global competitiveness and will put money back in people’s pockets. In what seemed like a cheeky tone, Armstrong mentioned that ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) and DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) topics didn’t come up throughout the forum. According to the crypto founder, the week felt productive, as it centered around real, global progress — all thanks to BlackRock CEO and new WEF co-chair Larry Fink. The Coinbase leader touted crypto and AI (artificial intelligence) as the most talked-about technologies in today’s world. Highlighting their compatibility, Armstrong stated that AI agents will eventually default to using stablecoins for payments, as they cannot be KYC’d like human beings. Finally, Armstrong revealed that the Coinbase, Circle, and Bermuda partnership to build a fully on-chain economy was announced at WEF Davos 2026. “Excited to make progress on this and create a compelling case study for other nations to follow,” the crypto CEO concluded. As of this writing, the global cryptocurrency market has a total capitalization of $3.086 trillion, with Bitcoin retaining its spot as the world’s largest cryptocurrency.

That puts the U.S. in a fragile place because consumer spending drives growth — so the entire economy is now relying on a smaller number of people to keep things afloat. (Axios) • When Chicago pawned its parking meters: The deal Chicago made would go down as one of the most notorious miscalculations in the history of city government.

Title: Bitcoin Spot ETFs Record $1.33 Billion Outflow In 2026 See-Saw Performance
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-spot-etfs-1-33-billion-outflow-see-saw/
Time Published: 2026-01-25T06:00:06Z

The Bitcoin Spot ETFs continue to witness a volatile start to 2026, with back-to-back weeks showing sharply contrasting performance. After netting a staggering $1.42 billion in weekly netflows on January 16, market momentum soon swung the opposite way in line with a Bitcoin decline, forcing a net outflow of $1.33 billion over the last week. A similar phenomenon was seen in the first two weeks of the year, after an initial net deposit of $458.77 million by January 2 was followed by a net outflow of $681.01 million by January 9. This investor behavior suggests a highly reactive market with little long-term confidence. In analyzing the most recent wave of withdrawals in the Bitcoin Spot ETF market, data from SoSoValue shows that the fourth trading week of January recorded no single day with a positive netflow. The heaviest outflows totaled $708.71 million on January 21, followed by the smallest daily outflow of $32.11 million on January 22. Looking at individual funds, BlackRock’s IBIT, the market leader, suffered the largest net outflows valued at $537.49 million.

Title: Analyst Says You’re Not Bullish Enough On Ethereum – What Does He Mean?

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. A growing number of analysts believe Ethereum’s current price action is being misunderstood. Although frustration is growing due to Ethereum’s inability to hold above $3,000, some technical analysts are quick to point out that the structure forming beneath the surface tells a very different story. According to one analyst, the real risk right now is not being bullish on Ethereum and trying to short in anticipation of a downside breakout. The analyst’s technical view on Ethereum is focused less on short-term momentum and more on the structure developing on the chart, which he argues is even clearer than what is currently visible on Bitcoin’s chart. Notably, Ethereum’s price action is carving out a series of higher lows on the daily candlestick timeframe chart to form a tightening triangular pattern since December 2025. This kind of behavior shows that each pullback is being absorbed at progressively higher levels, which is how strong trends reset before continuation. Ethereum needs to avoid a breakdown below key support zones in order for this trend continuation setup to still be valid. According to the analyst, a dip under $2,860 would begin to weaken the pattern, while a close below $2,780 would invalidate the higher-low structure. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $2,950, which is dangerously close to the lower boundary of this setup. Therefore, some traders will be tempted to short Ethereum at this level, but the analyst called it the dumbest thing to do here. As long as those levels ($2,860 and $2,780) hold, the analyst sees no technical justification for betting against ETH, especially near the lower boundary of the channel where buyers have repeatedly stepped in. If support holds, the next move would be a gradual return to the upper trendline of the channel, which is just below $3,340. A move into that region would bring price back into direct contact with overhead resistance and set the stage for a breakout if buying pressure continues to increase. Ethereum Price Chart. Source: @Tryrexcrypto on X Ethereum is entering 2026 without clear bullish momentum, a reality that has dampened sentiment across the spot and derivatives markets. Spot ETF inflows into Ethereum and Bitcoin have slowed down, and issuers have been highlighted with consistent days of outflows. Nonetheless, major asset managers are still holding huge amounts of Ethereum and are working on diversifying their activities on Ethereum. BlackRock, for example, filed with the SEC in December to launch a staked Ethereum exchange-traded fund, a move that will bring in more institutional investors into the Ethereum ecosystem. Speaking of staking, BitMine Technologies recently amped up its ETH staking to over $5.71 billion worth of Ethereum. On-chain data from Arkham Intelligence shows that the firm has staked an additional 171,264, worth $503.2 million, pushing its total stake to over 1.94 million ETH.

Title: $7 Trillion Player Is Moving Into Bitcoin, Can This Trigger A Surge To $200,000?
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/7-trillion-player-eye-bitcoin/
Time Published: 2026-01-25T00:30:06Z

Swiss banking giant UBS, with assets under management (AuM) of up to $7 trillion, is set to launch Bitcoin trading for some of its clients. This comes amid predictions that regulatory clarity and broader adoption could send the BTC price to as high as $200,000. Bloomberg reported that UBS is planning to launch crypto trading for some of its wealth clients, starting with its private bank clients in Switzerland. The bank will reportedly begin by offering these clients the opportunity to invest in Bitcoin and Ethereum. At the same time, the crypto offering could further expand to clients in the Pacific-Asia region and the U.S. The banking giant is currently in discussions with potential partners, and there is no clear timeline for when it could launch Bitcoin and Ethereum trading for clients. This move is said to be partly due to increased demand from wealth clients for crypto exposure. UBS also faces increased competition as other Wall Street giants are working to offer crypto trading. Morgan Stanley, in partnership with Zerohash, announced plans to launch crypto trading in the first half of this year, starting with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. The banking giant may soon also be able to offer its crypto products, as it has filed with the SEC to launch spot BTC, ETH, and SOL ETFs. Furthermore, JPMorgan, another of UBS’ competitors, is considering offering crypto trading to institutional clients, although this plan is still in the early stages. The bank already accepts Bitcoin and Ethereum as collateral from its clients. Last year, it also filed to offer BTC structured notes that will track the performance of the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF. Kevin O’Leary predicted that Bitcoin could rally to between $150,000 and $200,000 this year, driven by the passage of the CLARITY Act. His prediction came just as White House Crypto Czar David Sacks said banks would fully enter crypto once the bill passes. As such, there is a possibility that BTC could reach this $200,000 psychological level in anticipation of the amount of new capital that could flow into BTC from these banks once the bill passes. BitMine’s Chairman, Tom Lee, also predicted during a CNBC interview that Bitcoin could reach between $200,000 and $250,000 this year, partly due to growing institutional adoption by Wall Street giants. Meanwhile, Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao said that a BTC rally to $200,000 is the “most obvious thing in the world” to him. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $89,600, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Amazon braces for another major round of layoffs, 14,000 jobs at risk

MYNORTHWEST NEWS Jan 27, 2026, 5:00 AM | Updated: 5:38 am A sign for an Amazon Go retail store is seen at the Amazon.com Inc. headquarters. (Photo: David Ryder, Getty Images) (Photo: David Ryder, Getty Images) BY MYNORTHWEST STAFF MyNorthwest.com Amazon is expected to undergo another round of layoffs this week, according to an exclusive report from Reuters, in an effort to trim its workforce by approximately 30,000 employees. This is considered the next round of layoffs that first occurred in October, two sources who asked not to be identified told Reuters. During the October round of layoffs, 14,000 employees were laid off. The second round, which can begin as early as Tuesday, is expected to affect roughly the same number of employees. Included in the layoffs are jobs within the company’s Amazon Web Services, retail, Prime Video, and People Experience and Technology departments. MyNorthwest has reached out to Amazon for comment. In October, Amazon cut approximately 14,000 corporate jobs, close to 4% of its workforce, as the online retail giant ramps up spending on AI while trimming costs elsewhere. According to a letter to employees from Beth Galetti, the senior vice president of People Experience and Technology at Amazon, those laid off would be given 90 days to look for a new position internally. Amazon has about 350,000 corporate employees and a total workforce of approximately 1.56 million. In June, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, who has aggressively sought to cut costs since becoming CEO in 2021, said he anticipated that generative AI would reduce Amazon’s corporate workforce over the next few years. Amazon is investing $10 billion toward building a campus in North Carolina to expand its cloud computing and artificial intelligence infrastructure. Since 2024 began, Amazon has committed to about $10 billion apiece to data center projects in Mississippi, Indiana, Ohio, and North Carolina as it builds up its infrastructure to try to keep up with other tech giants making leaps in AI. The 14,000 jobs cut in October were the biggest wave of layoffs since 2023, when the company cut 27,000 jobs over a two-month period. Amazon’s workforce doubled during the pandemic as millions stayed home and boosted online spending. In the following years, big tech and retail companies cut thousands of jobs to bring spending back in line. The number of Americans who applied for unemployment benefits inched up last week, but U.S. layoffs remain historically low despite signs of a softening labor market. U.S. filings for jobless aid for the week ending Jan. 17 rose by 1,000 to 200,000, up from 199,000 the previous week, the Labor Department reported Thursday. That’s fewer than the 207,000 new applications that analysts surveyed by the data firm FactSet were expecting. Applications for unemployment benefits are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. Employers added just 50,000 jobs last month, nearly unchanged from a downwardly revised figure of 56,000 in November, the Labor Department said. The unemployment rate slipped to 4.4%, its first decline since June, from 4.5% in November, a figure also revised lower.

Title: XRP Ledger Enters The AI Era As Ripple Merges Two Mega Trends

The XRP Ledger has entered a new phase of innovation as Ripple integrates to bring together two of the most powerful technology trends shaping the global economy. Long known for its speed, low transaction costs, and enterprise-grade reliability, the Ledger is now expanding beyond payments to data-driven and automated financial applications. By merging AI with decentralized settlement, Ripple is positioning the Ledger to support smarter workflows and more efficient liquidity management. An analyst known as SMQKE on X has shared a case study of an AI implementation in the cross-border payment, in which Ripple has successfully combined blockchain technology and artificial intelligence to enhance the efficiency, speed, and cost-effectiveness of global transactions. As a leading provider of real-time cross-border payment solutions, Ripple leverages the XRP Ledger, a decentralized blockchain that enables real-time cross-border settlement. Related Reading: Surge In XRP Transactions: 1.45 Million Daily Users Could Signal Price Rally Ahead, Says Expert What sets this integration apart is the use of AI to optimize transaction flows and routing decisions in real time. Ripple AI-powered systems continuously process large volumes of payment data in real time, allowing financial institutions to make dynamic decisions on the most effective payment paths. BlackRock is now using Ripple’s RLUSD as collateral, which is extremely bullish for XRP. JackTheRippler revealed that the altcoin is being positioned as the future infrastructure, which is being built with the potential to hit over $10,000 per coin. With the REAL token launching on January 26th, trillions in global capital could flood into the XRP Ledger. According to JackTheRippler, some projections suggest up to $800 billion could flow into the REAL token on XRP Ledger, potentially sparking a powerful supply shock. The rise of the phoenix XRP is here. Crypto analyst Xfinancebull highlighted that Caroline Pham isn’t just another name in crypto. Pham played a role in pushing utility regulation into the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), helping shift policy toward real-world use cases. Currently, she is at MoonPlay and posting about the phoenix on X. Related Reading: How Donald Trump’s Latest Crypto Move Will Boost Demand For XRP Years ago, Brad Garlinghouse drew that same phoenix, and it became one of the biggest pieces of XRP lore. While the market chased narratives, Ripple has been building institutional-grade crypto products for years. Meanwhile, the token, RLUSD, and the XRP Ledger are now live operating, and recognized among the most compliant blockchain assets in the crypto world. This is the same asset that survived the SEC’s biggest regulatory battles in crypto history, and is now on the other side with legal clarity, growing integration, and increasing relevance to government infrastructure in its favor. Xfinancebull concluded that Caroline has helped clear the regulatory path, Brad and Ripple built what actually runs on that path, and they have been aligning all along, which is how the real adoption happens.

This weekend's main card also sees two of UFC's best bantamweights – Sean O'Malley and Song Yadong – return to the Octagon after long layoffs to stake their claim to challenge for Petr Yan's recently re-acquired title.

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/24/2026 11:33:35 AM PST by E. Pluribus Unum Mass immigration was always a scam to destabilize the West, it’s why China admits almost zero refugees. Accurate. --Elon Musk✓ @elonmusk Video Transcript You know, we always used to think shrinking population is a cause for negative growth. But in my conversations with the leadership of these large developed countries that have xenophobic immigration policies, they don't allow anybody to come in, shrinking unemployment, excuse me, shrinking demographics, these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology.

Title: Bitcoin price to hit $180,000 if it overcomes this hurdle, analyst says
URL: https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/bitcoin-to-180000-if-one-thing-does-not-happen/
Time Published: 2026-01-24T17:51:24Z
Full Content:
About us Copy link Fears of quantum computing breaking Bitcoin’s encryption continue to plague Bitcoin investors. In fact, Eliezer Ndinga, global head of research at 21Shares, reckons that unless developers address the concern, Bitcoin won’t enjoy a rally anytime soon. But if developers act? It’s clear, blue skies. “If we get past the quantum threat, then Bitcoin can go to $180,000,” Ndinga told DL News. For now, however, “it’s a cloud in the air.” Every day more market watchers are cropping up and labelling quantum computing Bitcoin’s most pressing threat. Adding to Ndinga, Sergio Ermotti, CEO of Swiss investment bank UBS, said that Bitcoin needs to prove itself able to overcome quantum computing. Ray Dalio and BlackRock have made similar comments. They aren’t the only ones, however. Just last week, Christopher Wood, of Jefferies Group, removed Bitcoin from his long-standing portfolio recommendation. Instead, he’s urging investors to double down on gold and gold-mining stocks. “In the world of institutional allocation, virtually everyone I have talked to is quietly concerned about Bitcoin,” Nic Carter, a general partner at Castle Island Ventures, previously told DL News. Of late, Bitcoin developers and the broader community are finding themselves fighting over a vulnerability that hadn’t been taken seriously. Why are investors so fearful now? Because advances in quantum computing are coming at a rapid pace, and if the technology falls into the wrong hands, it could potentially break Bitcoin’s entire encryption model. Researchers at Chaincode Labs discovered that 20% to 50% of all Bitcoin could be stolen by actors using quantum computers. We’re talking about $400 billion to $900 billion that could be lost — including Satoshi Nakamoto’s alleged 1 million Bitcoin stash. In an interview with DL News, the first thing that Ndinga said was that quantum computing is a real threat. “The challenge is that we’re drowning in information but starving for a reason,” Ndinga said. “Crypto has to get past its teenage years and address this seriously.” When asked to rate the quantum threat on a scale of one to ten, Ndinga broke it down into two dimensions: timing and magnitude. “On magnitude, you’re talking about potentially 50% of all Bitcoin at risk,” he said. “On timing, it’s harder to pin down. We could be talking about a couple of years or a couple of decades.” That uncertainty is exactly what’s creating headwinds for institutional investors, according to Ndinga. And unless he acknowledges the vulnerability, he’ll lose credibility among investors. “I won’t be taken seriously if I don’t talk about quantum computing,” he said. While institutional concern mounts, there are Bitcoin developers working on solutions — although progress is slow. One of the proposals is BIP 360, authored by developers Hunter Beast and Ethan Heilman, and podcaster Isabel Foxen Duke. “Nearly everyone has been very grateful that we are taking the problem seriously,” Beast told DL News. “Our whole motto is: prepared, not scared.” Rather than forcing a sudden network-wide upgrade, BIP 360 would introduce a new type of Bitcoin address that allows users to voluntarily move funds into quantum-resistant protections, reducing long-term exposure without breaking existing wallets, the Lightning Network, or Layer-2 systems. BIP 360 is now into its second year of development, and according to Beast, it remains one of the most widely-discussed draft BIPs in Bitcoin’s history. That means little, however, since the notoriously lethargic Bitcoin Investment Proposal process means activation could still be years away. Beast acknowledged the urgency but cautioned against rushing. “We must remain thoughtful and diligent, while not rushing a half-baked solution,” he said. “Fortunately, the general consensus is that we still have time.” Pedro Solimano is a markets correspondent based in Buenos Aires.

Blade’s return following a five-week layoff is one of just three changes made by head coach Stuart Lancaster. Out-half Josh Ioane is named outside Blade, while Dylan Tierney-Martin comes in at hooker in place of the injured Dave Heffernan. Connacht have over 850 caps worth of experience to call upon from the bench with Bundee Aki, Jack Carty and Denis Buckley all named among the replacements. James Crombie / INPHO James Crombie / INPHO / INPHO Meanwhile, Niall Smyth is set to make his Leinster debut as Leo Cullen navigates a tricky period of injuries among his tightheads. Smyth, who won a Leinster Schools Senior Cup with Blackrock in 2024, partners Jack Boyle and Gus McCarthy in the front row. Harry Byrne starts at out-half once again, while captain Caelan Doris is set to win his 100th Leinster cap. 15. Sam Gilbert 14. Shane Jennings 13. Harry West 12. Cathal Forde 11. Finn Treacy 10.

Ruben Moloney Referee: Eoghan Cross (IRFU) Just over five minutes to go until kick-off in Galway. The last time the sides met, only last month, Leinster were runaway winners in the end — but Connacht were excellent in the first half of that game at the Aviva. Imbued with home advantage and the sense of occasion in a new-look Dexcom Stadium, let’s see if this one is more competitive for 80. Nick Elliott / INPHO Nick Elliott / INPHO / INPHO Fantastic performance on the pitch pre-game, with all 26 Connacht clubs represented. Ballina man Caelan Doris leads Leinster onto the pitch to a fairly warm reception. And now here come Connacht to some serious noise! Dexcom Stadium is HOPPING. And it looks absolutely fantastic. Here we go! 1′ – CON 0-0 LEIN: Harry Byrne gets us underway at The Sportsground! Taken by Cathal Forde and Connacht exit through Caolin Blade. A little bit of argy-bargy before the first lineout. Brilliant! 6′ – CON 0-0 LEIN: Billy Bohan wins a scrum pen on Leinster debutant Niall Smyth and Connacht get a lineout on the Leinster 22′, but Josh Murphy spills it forward at the front. Leinster exit through Fintan Gunne, who booms it to touch on halfway. Then a half-break by Gus McCarthy who snatches one from Blade’s hands — and Leinster eventually win a penalty deep in Connacht territory as they impede Leinster at lineout time. 8′ – TRY FOR LEINSTER! Fintan Gunne! The scrum-half crashes over after a sharp Leinster start in attack. Byrne converts for 7-0, and there’s a further double blow for Connacht: Cathal Forde and Sam Illo are gone off, replaced by Bundee Aki Jack Aungier respectively. Not sure if either of those were HIAS — will try to keep you posted. 11′ – TRY FOR CONNACHT! Dylan Tierney-Martin! Connacht respond immediately! Ferocious Leinster defence, phase after phase, but Tierney-Martin burrows over with a brilliant close-range finish. That’s a serious reaction by the hosts, and Sam Gilbert chips over the afters. He’s well over 90% from the tee since arriving at Connacht — I think he’s missed only one kick?! Seven each in Galway! 15′ – CON 7-7 LEIN: First chorus of ‘The Fields’ as Eoghan Cross sets up a scrum after some brilliant Connacht defence forced a Leinster error on midfield. And in the game’s second scrum, Connacht win their second scrum penalty. This time it’s Sam Illo on Jack Boyle. Connacht lineout outside the Leinster 22′. 16′ – CON 7-7 LEIN: Alex Soroka gets hands on Connacht ball in a ruck just outside the Leinster 22′ and referee Cross pings Connacht for side entry. Leinster lineout just inside the Connacht half — but Doris knocks it on on halfway. 20′ – CON 7-7 LEIN:Play stopped with Jack Boyle down, appearing to hold his calf. Andy Farrell will be holding his breath here — but Ireland’s loosehead injury crisis looks set to deepen. Stretcher coming on. Ah, Jeayyysus. Poor Boyle! That’s a massive blow to Ireland ahead of the Six Nations. 23′ – CON 7-7 LEIN: Boyle is replaced by Jerry Cahir. And Billy Bohan immediately wins another penalty on Smyth. Meanwhile, Sam Illo and Cathal Forde are both back on the field having passed their HIAs. Connacht back to their starting side. The hosts then win a further penalty as Lowe infringes in a ruck. Gilbert chips over three points from close range and Connacht lead for the first time! 26′ – CON 10-7 LEIN: Leinster attempting to play with tempo but another attack in the Connacht half breaks down as Gunne tries to feed the intended decoy in Doris but passes it forward. Leinster win a scrum pen, though, as Illo is pinged for not driving straight. Harry Byrne does what Gilbert did seconds earlier and pops over the easy three points. 29′ – CON 10-10 LEIN: A madcap passage of play leads to a Gunne chip through, which dribbles into touch deep inside the Connacht 22′. Connacht lose their second straight lineout — and Leinster are knocking on the door! Penalty advantage to the visitors also. 31′ – CON 10-10 LEIN: Connacht scramble well but concede two penalties in the process. Leinster will take three points once more from close range — surprising considering Connacht are on an official warning now. 32′ – CON 10-13 LEIN: Shane Jennings wins the restart — he’s been excellent in the air once again — and Connacht wind up earning a penalty outside the Leinster 22′ as Will Connors impedes Blade on the floor at the base of a ruck. Connacht will take a shot at goal, this one from left of centre. And Sam Gilbert does what Sam Gilbert does: we’re level once more! 36′ – CON 13-13 LEIN: Cian Prendergast catches Snyman with a seatbelt tackle just inside the Connacht 10′. Advantage comes to nothing and Leinster go to touch — lineout just inside the home 22′. 37′ – CON 13-13 LEIN: Sean Jansen melts Gus McCarthy off the Leinster lineout and forces the knock-on. Dexcom Stadium goes nuts! What a hit. It was borderline high but the TMO has checked it in the background and can’t find any head contact. Connacht scrum inside their own 22′. Terrifically enjoyable half if far from free-flowing! Vicious, pulsating stuff. Ireland will be sweating after Jack Boyle was stretchered off for the visitors. James Crombie / INPHO James Crombie / INPHO / INPHO Connacht on top in the scrum, where they lead 3-1 on penalties. But where it matters, it’s 13-13 following first-half tries by Fintan Gunne and Dylan Tierney-Martin, with the rest of the points coming from the respective boots of Harry Byrne and Sam Gilbert. Nick Elliott / INPHO Nick Elliott / INPHO / INPHO Catch you shortly! 41′ – CON 13-13 LEIN: Back underway at Dexcom! A big 40 minutes ahead on what’s been a superb occasion so far. 45′ – CON 13-13 LEIN: A really open, loose start to the second half! Connacht have a scrum well inside the Leinster half after Ciarán Frawley knocked on during an attempted rip. The hosts almost got around the Leinster blitz there — but still savage defence by the eastern province! Alex Soroka, meanwhile, looks like he’s going off for a HIA. 47′ – CON 13-13 LEIN: Superb carry by Cathal Forde and he makes serious yardage deep into the Leinster 22′! Connacht go very close and Leinster concede the pen. Advantage comes to nothing, so Connacht go again with the tap. Paul Boyle reaches for the line but Leinster hold him up! Unreal defence by debutant Niall Smyth who had a tough first half! 48′ – TRY FOR CONNACHT! Harry West! What a score! Magic, magic, magic Connacht! The outstanding Sean Jansen and Finn Treacy combine and West collects the offload on the inside to score, pretty much under the sticks. Handbags afterwards and officials getting involved but the try will be good! Gilbert converts and Connacht lead! 51′ – CON 20-13 LEIN: Sublime line-break by Fintan Gunne and he finds Snyman in support! The huge lock takes it close but Cian Prendergast wins the jackal penalty on the scramble and The Sportsground erupts again. What a piece of attack and defence by each side. This is cracker. 54′ – CON 20-13 LEIN: Leinster have a penalty advantage inside the Connacht half — and now a penalty as Sam Gilbert and co. stop James Lowe and Ciarán Frawley down Leinster’s left. There’ll be a Leinster lineout deep in Connacht territory shortly, but Rónan Kelleher is just getting a bit of treatment. He looks alright. 56′ – CON 20-13 LEIN: Connacht defend their line! Sean Jansen — man of the match by a wide margin to this point — wallops Scott Penny in contact and forces another knock-on. Connacht will get the scrum on their own 5′. The Fields of Athenry reverberates around Dexcom once again. 57′ – CON 20-13 LEIN: Leinster win the scrum penalty on the Connacht 5′! 57′ – TRY FOR LEINSTER! RG Snyman! The visitors tap and go and after a first effort by Charlie Tector, RG Snyman breaches the whitewash and dots down! Harry Byrne brings us level again. What a final quarter we have in store. 59′ – CON 20-20 LEIN: Leinster’s tempo is starting to give Connacht big problems. 60′ – TRY FOR LEINSTER! Charlie Tector! That’s inexcusable defence by Connacht, to be honest. Off first phase, Tector runs through Tierney-Martin and Aungier and goes right under the sticks from just outside the Connacht 22′. Leinster have turned this game on its head: they lead 27-20! 64′ – CON 20-27 LEIN: Connacht win a scrum pen near halfway. Jack Carty gives them a lineout up towards the Leinster 22′. 66′ – CON 20-27 LEIN: Another Connacht pen just outside the 22′ — Tector not rolling away — and Connacht take the three points. Gilbert brings the gap down to four as the rain begins to descend from the heavens over Galway again. 69′ – CON 23-27 LEIN: Nice grubber down the left by James Lowe and Leinster get a five-metre scrum after an error in judgement by Finn Treacy! The Connacht wing clips the ball with his instep ahead of the try-line and then dots it down. Leinster can kill it here. 70′ – TRY FOR LEINSTER! Ciarán Frawley against his future employers! That should do it! Leinster win a penalty advantage and eventually cross in the left-hand corner through the Connacht-bound Frawley, who just about gathers Harry Byrne’s delayed pass to score. Byrne converts from the left-hand touchline and Leinster lead by 11 with just under 10 minutes to go. That’s also the bonus point secured by Leinster. 72′ – CON 23-34 LEIN: Luke McGrath pins Connacht back with a beautiful box-kick over the top which rolls into touch near the Connacht 5′. Leinster have turned the screw here. That’ll do it: a special occasion for Connacht but they just about ran out of gas and, unfortunately for them, leave with nothing. Leinster take maximum points after another second-half surge against the Westerners, but that was a super game. Thanks for joining us. Keep an eye on The 42 for Murray Kinsella’s report and reaction.

Title: Aave Price Structure Hinges On Crucial $145 Level — Here’s How

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. As the crypto market suffered a widespread decline, Aave (AAVE) prices dipped by nearly 10%, reaching a local bottom around $153. Presently, the altcoin is trading within a range of $155-$160, but an emerging chart pattern indicates an impending price breakout. In an X post on January 23, popular market expert Ali Martinez shares an insightful analysis of the AAVEUSD 4-hour chart, showing the altcoin is approaching a critical market juncture. Notably, a key support zone of $144 sits at the base of a broader descending structure that has defined AAVE’s price action since last year. Martinez’s analysis shows that AAVE is trading within a falling wedge formation, characterized by a series of lower highs capped by a descending trendline and relatively stable support near the $145 region. This price formation often represents a period of consolidation following sustained downside pressure, as sellers gradually lose momentum while buyers defend a key floor. For context, since topping out above the $350 level earlier in the cycle, AAVE has experienced a steady corrective move, with price stepping down through multiple horizontal levels near $240, $200, and $162. The loss of these zones shifted short-term momentum firmly in favor of sellers, making the current support range even more important. At present, AAVE is trading in the mid $150s, leaving limited room before a direct retest of the $144.93 support. However, this level has already acted as a demand zone multiple times during the current downtrend, reinforcing its significance. According to Martinez’s analysis, a clean break below $145 could force an accelerated downside move, with the next major support area set around $125. In that scenario, price acceptance below the wedge structure would likely confirm a continuation of the broader bearish trend. Conversely, holding the $145 support may provide the conditions for a technical rebound. A successful defense of this level, combined with a break above the descending trendline, could allow AAVE to reclaim higher resistance zones around $162 and potentially $200 over time. While such a move would not immediately invalidate the larger corrective structure, it would suggest improving market balance and decreased selling pressure. At press time, Aave trades at $156.99, reflecting a decline of 0.76% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the daily trading volume is up by 6.07% and valued at $362.59 million. With price compressing toward the apex of the falling wedge, traders should expect increased volatility in the coming AAVE trading sessions. For now, the price moves at $144.93 as a pivotal inflection point for determining the next directional move.

Title: Brex and The Pros and Cons of Hubristic Fundraising

by Jason Lemkin | Blog Posts, Fundraising Capital One just announced it’s acquiring Brex for $5.15 billion. An incredible, top 0.1% “exit” in less than 10 years from a category creator that created massive wealth and opportunities. A huge win. But also … less than half of Brex’s $12.3 billion valuation from October 2022. Should anyone care? Many are seeing is a failure vs Ramp, a measured success at best. But … why? I don’t think most people commenting on this actually understand what they’re reacting to. What they’re really feeling—even if they can’t articulate it—is the consequences of hubristic fundraising. And we should probably talk about it. Because hubristic fundraising is back. In a big way. It was back big time in 2025 and is back even bigger time in 2026. Let me define it simply: Hubristic fundraising is when you raise at a valuation so aggressive, with terms so favorable, with a narrative so bold, that you are essentially betting the entire future of your company on hitting an extraordinary outcome. It’s not just “raising a lot of money.” Plenty of companies raise hundreds of millions without hubris. Hubristic fundraising is when you: These deals can work out. It will work out for Databricks, Anthropic, etc. But at least as of when I write this, there are so very few $30B+ IPOs or exits. And that’s what Brex was promising. ElevenLabs, Harvey, Replit/Lovable, Cursor etc. are promising even more. Brex checked all these boxes. In 2021 and 2022, they raised at valuations that implied they would not just win corporate cards and expense management—they would dominate financial services for startups, then enterprises, then… everyone, apparently. Stupidest behavior I've seen on @brexHQ getting acquired by @CapitalOne for $5.15B: – Saying Brex "lost"– Mocking Brex for the outcome– Claiming investors lost money If losing means starting a business that gets sold for over $5B in 9 years, where both founders make hundreds… — JC Bahr-de Stefano (@jbahrdestefano) January 23, 2026 Let’s remember what 2021 looked like. Zero interest rates. SPACs everywhere. Tiger Global doing deals in 48 hours. Multiples that would make a 1999 VC blush. Brex raised $300 million at a $12.3 billion valuation in October 2022—technically 2022, but really the tail end of the 2021 madness before rates spiked and everything crashed. At that valuation, with maybe $200-250M in revenue at the time, Brex was being valued at 50x+ revenue. For a low gross margin corporate card and expense management company. In a market with Ramp, Mercury, Airbase, Navan, and others all competing furiously. Was that valuation justified by fundamentals? No. Was it justified by the fundraising environment and competitive dynamics of the moment? Absolutely. And that’s the trap of hubristic fundraising. In the moment, it feels not just rational but necessary. Hubristic fundraising works. At least for a while. And sometimes forever. When you’re the $12 billion company and your competitor is the $3 billion company, who do the Stanford MBAs and Google PMs want to join? The big number wins. The paper gains look better. The press coverage is better. The LinkedIn flex is better. Brex recruited absolute killers in 2021-2022. Engineers from Stripe. Execs from everywhere. One of the best sales teams ever under Sam Blond. That was partly product and vision—but it was also the massive valuation signaling “this is the winner.” This one is circular but real. Raise at a huge valuation, and suddenly more investors want in. FOMO is the most powerful force in venture capital. The $12.3B valuation wasn’t a barrier to raising more—it was a magnet for investors who wanted to be part of “the next big thing.” Enterprise customers want to work with winners. When Brex was valued at $12B and their competitor was valued at $2B, which one do more conservative customers feel comfortable signing a multi-year deal with? The big number creates legitimacy. It signals staying power. Every funding round becomes news. Every executive hire becomes news. You’re always in the conversation. That awareness compounds. When you’re raising at $12B and your competitor just raised at $1.5B, you are sending a message: we are going to outspend you on everything. Sales. Marketing. R&D. Acquisitions. Some competitors will give up. Others will make mistakes trying to keep up. Ramp didn’t give up. But many others did. Now for the dark side. This is the big one. And it’s what I think people are actually reacting to with Brex without realizing it. When you raise at a hubristic valuation, you attract employees, investors, and partners who are there for the outcome, not the mission. They’re there because they did the math on their equity and saw an IPO at $25B+ and early retirement. That’s fine when everything is going up and to the right. But the moment you hit turbulence—and every company hits turbulence—those mercenaries disappear. They have no patience for struggle. They didn’t sign up for hard mode. They signed up for paper gains. Brex went through brutal layoffs in 2024. Lost 20% of the company. Massive executive turnover. Struggled with burn. Had to do a full “Brex 3.0” turnaround that CEO Pedro Franceschi admirably pulled off. But where were the fans during that turnaround? Where were all the people celebrating Brex’s dominance in 2021? Gone. Because they were never fans. They were mercenaries betting on an outcome, not a company. Brex just sold for $5.15 billion. In cash and stock. To a major bank. Creating liquidity for everyone. Is that a failure? We’re already seeing this play out in real-time in AI. Look at Windsurf. Windsurf (formerly Codeium) was one of the hottest AI coding startups. They had $82 million in ARR with enterprise revenue doubling quarterly. OpenAI offered $3 billion to acquire them. When that deal fell apart, Google paid $2.4 billion in a reverse acqui-hire for the CEO, co-founder, and 40 senior staff. Cognition then scooped up the remaining assets—the product, IP, 210 employees, and the entire $82M ARR business—for a reported $250 million. Total value captured: roughly $2.65 billion. And yet? The narrative in Silicon Valley was that Windsurf “sold too cheap.” SaaStr literally published “Did Windsurf Sell Too Cheap?” The deal was framed as a cautionary tale, a fire sale, a disappointment. Think about that. A company with $82 million ARR that didn’t exist three years ago returned $2.65 billion to stakeholders. In any other era, that’s a legendary outcome. But when Cursor is valued at $29.3 billion? When Lovable hits $6.6 billion with $200 million ARR? Suddenly $2.65 billion for $82 million ARR feels like leaving money on the table. That’s hubristic fundraising distorting reality. The benchmarks have become so warped that even massive wins feel like losses. For Ribbit Capital, who led the Series A, this is a monster return. For employees who joined early, this is life-changing money. For the customers using the product, nothing changes except they get the backing of a major financial institution. But because the peak valuation was $12.3B, the narrative is “Brex failed.” They got acquired at a “steep discount.” They “crashed.” This is insane. A $5B+ exit is an incredible outcome for any company. But hubristic fundraising creates hubristic expectations. And anything short of those expectations feels like failure—even when it objectively isn’t. When you’ve raised at $12B, you can’t think about $5B exits. You can’t consider acqui-hires or smaller strategic deals. Every decision has to be oriented around justifying that massive valuation. This leads to over-expansion, over-hiring, and over-spending. Brex’s $17 million/month burn in Q4 2023 was a direct consequence of trying to grow into a $12B valuation. For Brex to have “succeeded” by the mercenary definition, they probably needed to IPO at $20B+ or get acquired for $15B+. In the fintech market of 2023-2025. With rising rates. With competitors like Ramp breathing down their neck. That’s an almost impossible bar. And when you don’t clear it, everyone who joined for the outcome—and only the outcome—writes you off. Here’s the thing that should concern everyone: we’re doing this again. And in the Age of AI, we’re doing it at a scale that makes 2021 look quaint. Look at Ramp. In 2025 alone, they went from $13B to $16B to $22.5B to $32B. Four funding rounds in one year. Nearly tripling their valuation in twelve months. Is Ramp a great company? Of course. They hit $1B+ in ARR in record time. They’re cash flow positive. They’ve executed brilliantly. But four rounds in one year? A $32B valuation for an expense management company? This is 2021 fundraising playbook all over again. Except now, in AI, it’s 2021 on steroids. Let me share some numbers that should make your head spin. Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab raised $2 billion in a seed round. Not Series A. Not Series B. A seed round. At a $12 billion valuation. Before shipping a product. The former OpenAI CTO walks out the door and six months later has a company valued higher than Brex just sold for. And it gets crazier. Bloomberg reported Thinking Machines is now in discussions to raise additional funding at a $50 billion valuation. Even with their CTO having just quit with several other top team members to go back to OpenAI. That would be a 4x markup in less than a year. For a company that just launched its first product in October. Ilya Sutskever’s Safe Superintelligence raised over $1 billion for his AI safety startup. The former OpenAI Chief Scientist hasn’t shipped anything public yet. But billions? Sure, here you go. Harvey, the legal AI company, went from $3B to $5B to $8B across three funding rounds in 2025 alone. They raised $760 million in a single year. They 2.7x’d their valuation in ten months. For an AI tool that helps lawyers do due diligence faster. ElevenLabs went from $1.1B (January 2024) to $3.3B (January 2025) to $6.6B (September 2025). That’s 6x in less than two years. A voice synthesis company is now worth more than Brex sold for. Lovable, the Swedish “vibe coding” startup, went from $1.8B in July to $6.6B in December. They 3.5x’d in five months. They’re barely a year old. Cursor went from under $10B to $29.3B in a single year. They raised $2.3B in their Series D. That’s not a funding round—that’s an entire unicorn in a single check. We are now regularly seeing what would have been considered absurd even in 2021: billion-dollar seed rounds, valuations that exceed Brex’s exit for companies that haven’t shipped products, and 3-4x markups in less than a year. Is this driven by real innovation? In many cases, yes. AI is genuinely transformative. Is this also hubristic? Also yes. The same dynamics apply, just amplified. These valuations require these companies to not just succeed but to dominate. They require AI to transform every industry exactly as promised, on exactly the timeline investors are betting on. They require no major regulatory setbacks, no compute shortages, no technical plateaus. And they’re attracting the same mercenaries—talent, capital, and partners who are there for the paper gains, not the mission. Some of these companies will hit their numbers and the valuations will prove justified. ElevenLabs has real revenue. Harvey has real customers. Cursor has $1B ARR. The AI revolution is real. But many won’t hit their numbers. And when they don’t—when the inevitable correction comes—we’ll see the same pattern: mercenaries leaving, narratives turning, “failures” that are actually $3-5B exits, founders blamed for outcomes that were structurally locked in the moment they took hubristic valuations. The difference this time? The numbers are bigger. The falls will be harder. And the schadenfreude will be even more intense. When Thinking Machines is worth $50B and comes up short of expectations, no one will remember that Mira Murati built something real. They’ll call it a failure because it wasn’t worth $100B. When Harvey can’t grow into an $8B valuation fast enough, no one will remember they serve half of the top law firms in America. They’ll say legal AI was overhyped. That’s how hubristic fundraising works. The mercenaries don’t remember the mission. They only remember the paper. For many founders, especially in AI, hubristic fundraising isn’t really a choice. It’s a survival imperative at the very top. The war for AI talent is unlike anything we’ve seen before. Meta is offering $1 billion+ packages to poach researchers. OpenAI is clawing back co-founders from startups that raised $2 billion seed rounds. Google paid $2.4 billion just to acqui-hire 40 people from Windsurf. If you’re an AI founder and you don’t raise at an aggressive valuation, what happens? Your competitor raises at $10B. They can now offer engineers equity packages worth $50M on paper. Your $2B valuation offers $10M packages. You lose the talent war before it starts. Your competitor has $500M in the bank to buy GPUs. You have $50M. You can’t train competitive models. You fall behind on capabilities. Your competitor’s valuation signals “winner” to enterprise customers. Your valuation signals “risky bet.” You lose deals to perception, not product. In many cases, it might be almost irresponsible not to take the hubristic path. The founders who stayed disciplined, who raised at “reasonable” valuations, who prioritized sustainable growth—many of them got steamrolled by competitors who didn’t. So I’m not here to tell founders to avoid hubristic fundraising. In the current AI environment, that might be asking them to bring a knife to a gunfight. Hubristic fundraising narrows your exit options. Not always financially—Brex proved you can still do a “down exit” and create real liquidity. But it narrows what success means for your stakeholders, your employees, your company narrative, and frankly, for your own psychology. When you raise at $12B, a $5B exit isn’t a win. It’s a disappointment. When you raise at $29B, anything less than a $50B+ IPO feels like failure. When your employees joined expecting a $100B outcome, a $10B exit means they’re doing mental math on what could have been. The mercenaries don’t just leave when things go badly. They leave when things go less well than the paper said they would. You can raise hubristically and still build a great company. Brex did. But you need to go in with eyes open about who you’re attracting, what expectations you’re setting, and how the narrative will be written if you come up even a little short. Because the siren call is seductive. The capital, the talent, the press, the gravity—it all feels like winning. And sometimes it is winning. But sometimes it’s just setting yourself up for a “failure” that would have been a triumph at any other valuation. Pedro Franceschi and Henrique Dubugras built something real. They went from Stanford dropouts to a $5B+ exit in under 8 years. They served thousands of companies, moved billions of dollars, and built technology that Capital One clearly values. The “failure” narrative says more about our broken expectations than about Brex. But there is a lesson here for founders considering hubristic fundraising—especially the AI founders raising at $10B, $20B, $50B valuations right now: Know who you’re attracting. The capital, talent, and attention that comes with a huge valuation comes with strings attached. Those strings are expectations. And when expectations get too disconnected from reality, you’ll eventually find yourself surrounded by people who were only ever there for the paper. Missionaries stay through the turnaround. Mercenaries don’t. Brex survived their turnaround and found a soft landing. Many companies in the next few years won’t be so fortunate. The question for every founder raising in this frothy AI market—whether you’re building fintech or AI B2B or foundation models—is simple: are you building a company or a casino bet? Are you really, honestly building a $100B generational company? And who exactly is sitting at your table? Because when the cards turn—and they always turn—you’ll find out fast who was really on your team. Just ask Brex. They built a real company, executed a real turnaround, and achieved a real exit. And half the internet is calling it a failure because the number wasn’t big enough. That’s the price of hubristic fundraising. Powerful? Yes. Dangerous? Also yes. Choose your investors, your employees, and your expectations wisely. The mercenaries won’t be there when you need them most.

Title: A Ghost is Haunting Davos! The WEF Summit
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/ghost-haunting-davos/5913196
Time Published: 2026-01-24T12:52:19Z

The 2026 Davos Summit of the World Economic Forum (WEF) will undoubtedly go down in history. Just as the fall of the Berlin Wall symbolized the end of the First Cold War with the victory of the United States, I believe the Davos Summit, which began on Monday, is declaring the end of American hegemony. To read this article in the following languages, click the Translate Website button below the author’s name. Español, Русский, 中文, Portugues, Français, عربي, Hebrew, Deutsch, Farsi, Italiano, 日本語, 한국어, Türkçe, Српски. And 40 more languages. The World Economic Forum shouldn’t be taken lightly. Founded in 1971 by Klaus Schwab, a student of Kissinger who was a former lawyer for Rockefeller, this foundation has been renowned for shaping the course of the capitalist world for 50 years. Note: The WEF’s founding date coincides with the year the US dollar was removed from the gold standard. Image: Brende in 2023 (Public Domain) At this year’s summit, Borge Brende, a low-profile Norwegian right-wing politician who has taken over the seat of the now-retired Klaus Schwab, is attempting to keep the foundation afloat; Even if he says, “The World Economic Forum isn’t about responding to current events. It’s about orchestrating the right conditions to move forward,” it’s all in vain. There’s great chaos at the top level. The culprit is Emperor Trump, who, like a bull in a china shop, is destroying everything in the Western establishment. Trump is actually feigning madness, but he knows perfectly well that his country is in a terrible situation. Its total debt has reached $40 trillion, and for the first time in history, its annual interest payments exceed its military spending by one trillion dollars. To address this, Trump has increased the Pentagon budget to $1.5 trillion by 2026. What Trump is doing, continuing with “Iran, Venezuela, Mexico, Greenland, Canada,” is like a powerful opponent overturning the table after losing the game. In my opinion, Trump is playing the role of a madman to prevent the inevitable collapse of the US. He probably doesn’t need to act that much, given his nature. As the spoiled and useless child of a wealthy contractor whose father was a Jewish lobbyist, nonsense and perversion are in his blood. But the bitter truth is emerging at the annual meeting of finance capital in Davos. The Western world is accepting defeat. For example, what did Larry Fink, the famous CEO of BlackRock, the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, say? “Global elites have lost the public’s trust and are currently facing ‘deep institutional distrust.’ If the WEF wants to be useful in the future, it must regain that trust.” Fink is referring to the Plandemic and the Great Reset scenarios. And of course, he’s describing the horrific income inequality in the world and the savagery of neoliberalism, or finance capital, that ran rampant after 1980. He’s practically confessing the sins of capitalism’s as a grey cardinal! “Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, the greatest wealth in history has been created, but this money has gone into the pockets of a tiny minority, enough to disrupt social peace. No society can sustain such an unjust distribution for long; eventually, the system will crack.” The End of White-Collar Workers: “Just as globalization hit the factory worker, Artificial Intelligence will now do the same to office workers, lawyers, and analysts. I’m not talking about the future, I’m talking about today!” You’d think he was about to sing the international anthem! But Fink, burning with rage as gold, silver, and copper soared while stock markets and the dollar crashed, wasn’t alone. The announcement of the collapse of the West’s “rules-based order” was made by the US’s immediate neighbor. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney delivered a speech that was at least as important, perhaps even more so, than Fink’s: “We knew the narrative of a rules-based international order was a lie. We knew that the most powerful actors would exempt themselves when it suited them. But this construct was convenient.” Carney also admitted that he had accepted American hegemony because it suited the purposes of his government. But now the system had broken down. The former central banker-turned-prime minister alluded to Vaclav Havel’s famous story of the greengrocer. In the story, a greengrocer in the Soviet Union hangs a sign in his shop that reads “Workers of the world unite,” even though he doesn’t believe it. But one day he decides not to conform and takes it down; this spreads, and communism collapses! “This fiction was useful. That’s why we put the sign up in the window. We are not in a transition period, but in the midst of a rupture. We are aware of what is happening and we are determined to act accordingly. We know that a rupture requires more than just conformity. It requires honestly accepting the world as it is. We are taking the sign down.” This was a response to Trump’s “initiation of illegality” and the very announcement of the specter haunting Davos: the collective acceptance by the West of the end of US hegemony. Like Fink and Carney, Belgian Prime Minister (right wing-conservative) Bart De Wever stated: “On Wednesday, together with King Philippe of Belgium, we will meet with Trump. But this will have a different character than we planned. The message we will probably have to give is: You are crossing red lines here. Either we stand together or we are divided; if we are divided, it will be the end of 80 years of Atlanticism, a real era will close. And you know, as Gramsci said: “While the old is dying, the new is not yet born, now is the time of monsters. It is up to him (Trump) to decide whether he will be a monster or not, yes or no?” The Italian communist philosopher Antonio Gramsci, like the famous Czech anti-communist Vaclav Havel, was declaring the end of the Second Cold War and the defeat of the US long after his death (through the mouths of the most ardent capitalists). While all this was happening, the EU announced it was canceling its trade agreement with the US. The US was offering Denmark $700 billion to buy Greenland (including a one-time payment of one million dollars to each Greenland citizen to accept US citizenship), and Iran was preparing for what was likely an imminent US-Israeli attack. At Davos, the club of the wealthy where the future of the world and capitalism was discussed, the familiar rhetoric of global warming was also shelved. In fact, it would become clear at this summit that the chemicals sprayed into the air under the pretext of global warming were not a conspiracy theory. Journalist James O’Keefe secretly filmed at the World Economic Forum, recording elites confessing to things long dismissed as “conspiracy theories.” World Economic Forum in casual conversations with O’Keefe, the elite openly admitted that chemicals were being sprayed into the atmosphere and even agricultural areas to cool the planet. One company executive acknowledged that many of these operations were being carried out quietly and behind closed doors by the US military; “A large part of the work is actually done by the (US) military. They do it constantly, and it’s actually quite cheap.” Those lines we saw in the sky were indeed chemicals dropped from planes! In short, the end of Pax Americana was announced in Davos, and the ghost of reality began to howl in the Swiss Alps. The panic among the bosses shows that the world has now reached a turning point. Whether good or bad… Note: Meanwhile, China and Russia seem to be enjoying the taste of winning without doing much. What the Chinese delegation said in Davos suggests that Western leaders (like Mark Carney) will soon be heading to China. Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng said in Davos: “The world cannot return to the law of the jungle where the strong prey on the weak.” “China is ready to be not only the world’s factory, but also the world’s market,” he said. However, when Trump arrived in Davos, Switzerland, there was no one to greet him. There was no official welcome. No delegation was present. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article. Follow us on Instagram and X and subscribe to our Telegram Channel.

Every time Reed publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Citi has largely put the dog days of its multiyear transformation behind it, and CEO Jane Fraser signaled a shift from remediation to competition. The next step is cultural. In a memo to employees last week, Fraser told Citi's more than 200,000 workers that "the bar is raised" and that it was time to ditch bad habits. When Fraser took over as Citi's chief executive in 2021, the bank was under intense scrutiny — bogged down by regulatory pressure, dated and weak technology, and investor doubts about whether it could still compete with Wall Street's most established names. Five years in, the stock is up about 40% over the past year and more than 80% over the past five — signs that investors are increasingly confident the firm has moved past its worst problems. Central to the bank's efforts are three executives she hired to run businesses that are key to Citi's growth: investment banking, wealth management, and technology. Brian Mulberry, a senior client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, offered a sports analogy. "If Jane Fraser is the quarterback, you need really strong skill positions — the receivers and running backs — to carry the ball over the goal line. These are the five-star recruits you'd want on that team," he told Business Insider. "They're now on offense." Corporate dealmaker Viswas Raghavan has earned an industry reputation for pushing his people. Andy Sieg is the politically savvy denizen of the white-glove world of money management. And Tim Ryan is the steady hand from consulting, tasked with reinventing the bank's technology backbone. Their rise has fueled some quiet succession chatter, though Fraser has given no indication she is considering stepping aside anytime soon. As her no-nonsense year takes shape, here is how those three executives have fared in reshaping their units and how they're helping enforce her mandate. Title: Executive Vice Chairman and Head of Banking Since Viswas "Vis" Raghavan took over Citi's investment banking business in June 2024, the unit is showing clear signs of momentum. Investment banking fees rose 35% year over year in 2025, with M&A revenues jumping 84%, according to Citi's fourth-quarter results. Fraser highlighted some of the bank's most prominent client wins during the earnings call, including mandate work for Boeing, Pfizer, Nippon Steel, Johnson & Johnson, and private-equity firms Blackstone and TPG. Last year, Citi advised on Nippon Steel's roughly $14.9 billion acquisition of US Steel, and on Charter Communications' announced nearly $35 billion combination with Cox Communications. As head of banking, he oversees investment banking, corporate banking, and commercial banking — a sprawling remit that puts him at the vanguard of many of Citi's most financially important relationships. Raghavan is known in the industry for his high expectations. A 25-year JPMorgan veteran, Raghavan ran the firm's league table-topping investment banking franchise and oversaw its business in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Landing Raghavan's star power was a boon for Citi, Mulberry said. "It absolutely matters who is backing the deal. Having that specific hire, with the confidence he brings" in the eyes of the kinds of clients Citi wants, is a triumph for the bank, he added. His credibility has helped him rebuild Citi's senior dealmaking ranks from rivals — especially JPMorgan. He's lured JPMorgan bankers Drago Rajkovic and Guillermo Baygual to serve as global co-heads of M&A at Citi. Former Goldman Sachs partner David Friedland joined Citi last summer as co-head of North America investment banking. And the Wall Street Journal reported this week that former JPMorgan banker Alex Berkett, an ex-Paramount executive, would join to build Citi's media business. Title: Head of Wealth In a note sent to employees of his division following earnings results last week, Andy Sieg said key focuses for the division would include leading the way in wealth advisory, deepening the integration of wealth offerings through the US retail bank, and incorporating AI into regular, daily workflows. He shared a chart showing Citi Wealth revenue up 22% in two years. And he doubled down on Fraser's empathic message. "For 2026, the bar has been raised," he wrote in the memo, which was viewed by Business Insider and confirmed by a Citi spokesperson. "Jane speaks of scale for the bank; it will be our watchword as well. Strong, sustained organic growth will be ours if we double down on a set of strategic priorities," including fomenting "a culture of ownership, accountability, and innovation," he added. Sieg joined Citi in late 2023 to fix its wealth business. Sieg previously oversaw roughly 25,000 employees at Bank of America, where he had risen to the role of president of Merrill Wealth Management. The bank said wealth revenue grew 14% in 2025, according to fourth-quarter earnings. Mulberry said Citi could rebuild wealth gradually over time, but argued that Sieg's background speeds things up. "I think on the wealth management side, there's a fair argument you could do that organically," he said, "but it helps to have a weighty name that's been successful in gathering assets at a place like Merrill Lynch." Sieg has moved away from the single global private-bank head structure and made targeted hires, including former BlackRock portfolio manager Kate Moore to run the chief investment office and ex-Morgan Stanley executive Dawn Nordberg to deepen ties between wealth and banking. Citi has also added senior private bankers like Clinton Warren, a former JPMorgan private banker, to lead teams in the central US. He has also had notable exits, including longtime private bank chief Ida Liu, who left in early 2025; and Valentín Valderrábano, chief operating officer for global wealth, whose exit was announced this month. He is following Liu to her new employer, HSBC. It's also been reported that Sieg was the subject of an internal investigation into his conduct. A Financial Times report from October raised some questions about how the probe was conducted, but Citi told the FT that it approaches "all internal complaints appropriately by conducting unbiased, thorough, and complete investigations", and noted a "commitment to a workplace where everyone is treated fairly and has equal opportunity to succeed." Title: Head of Technology and Business Enablement Citi is pushing deep into artificial intelligence as it moves out of its long-running cleanup phase. More than 80% of Citi's transformation programs are now at or close to their target state, Fraser said on the latest earnings call. That progress has enabled the bank to shift its focus toward growth and innovation. That next phase is being largely driven by Tim Ryan, who joined Citigroup in 2024 after spending nearly two decades at PwC, most recently as the consulting firm's US chair. Fraser tapped him to run technology and business enablement as Citi worked to move past years repairing outdated systems and addressing regulatory shortcomings. Early on, he was tasked with turning around Citi's substandard data management systems. Last summer, he was named one of the senior executives overseeing Citi's AI strategy. Citi has begun embedding artificial intelligence into core processes across the firm — from know-your-customer reviews to loan underwriting — starting with more than 50 of its largest and most complex workflows. Employees in 84 countries have already used the bank's proprietary AI tools tens of millions of times with adoption exceeding 70% across the workflow. According to the bank's third-quarter earnings report last year, Citi used generative AI to conduct one million automated code reviews, saving approximately 100,000 hours per week across its developer population. In the fall, Ryan wrote on LinkedIn that Citi had rolled out prompt training to help workers get more out of the tech, and cheered the bank's plans to rev the engine on agentic AI. But competition is rife. The broader finance industry is being rapidly reshaped by AI, with powerhouse firms like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan spending billions to supercharge their workforces. The fight to secure top AI talent has intensified. Citi has spent years defined by baggage from its past that it's been under pressure to fix. Now, it has the rare chance to define what it wants to be. Fraser wants her staff to know there's no time to lose. She concluded her memo with a clear directive: "Let's get it done." Jump to

January 24, 2026 6:55am by Barry Ritholtz The weekend is here! Pour yourself a mug of Danish Blend coffee, grab a seat outside, and get ready for our longer-form weekend reads: • Netflix’s $82.7 billion rags-to-riches story: How the DVD-by-mail company swallowed Hollywood. It’s a story so good it could have been a screenplay. In 2000, Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph sat down across from John Antioco, then CEO of video rental giant Blockbuster, and pitched him on acquiring their still unprofitable DVD-by-mail startup, Netflix, which at the time had around 300,000 subscribers. But when they told him their price—$50 million and the chance to develop and run Blockbuster’s online rental business—Antioco balked. By 2010, Blockbuster had filed for bankruptcy, and Netflix had stormed Hollywood with its entertainment streaming service.

Using a true multidisciplinary understanding of things, Peter identifies two often overlooked, parabolic “Big Ideas”: 1) Mirrored Reciprocation (go positive and go first) and 2) Compound Interest (being constant). A great “Life Hack” is to simply combine these two into one basic approach to living your life: “Go positive and go first, and be constant in doing it.” (Farnam Street) • The Crisis Whisperer: how Adam Tooze makes sense of our bewildering age: Whether it’s the financial crash, the climate emergency or the breakdown of the international order, historian Adam Tooze has become the go-to guide to the radical new world we’ve entered.

(Vox) • Mike Macdonald is a genius, but that’s not the only reason his Seahawks are Super Bowl favorites: The Seahawks are arguably the best team in football because they have elite talent. But everyone in the NFL has talent, especially in the postseason. Marrying that talent with the vision and bringing it to life, Macdonald believes, starts with intent and attitude.

Title: Take a look at the fanciest private jets and government aircraft that took the rich and powerful to Davos

Every time Pete publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Some of the world's wealthiest and most powerful people traveled to Switzerland this week, to attend the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos. That meant some of the world's fanciest aircraft descended on nearby airports, too. Business Insider has been tracking the private jets and government aircraft that arrived there this week. On Monday alone, there were around 160 private jet arrivals from over 40 countries spread across five continents. The majority appeared to land at Zurich Airport, which is 75 miles from Davos. In a press release, the airport said it expected more than 1,000 extra takeoffs and landings due to the WEF. Others landed at Friedrichshafen, over the border with Germany, or St Gallen, also near Lake Constance. From Elon Musk's Gulfstream G650 to Air Force One, here's some of the most impressive aircraft. On Monday, 31 of the 157 private jet arrivals were Gulfstream G650s. Throughout the week in Switzerland, data from JetSpy showed such planes belonging to: Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Blackstone, BlackRock, and JPMorgan Chase. Gulfstream jets are known for their large, circular windows, which give high-flyers great views. Business jets can be configured in different ways depending on what the customer wants. Sometimes, they have double beds and an on-board shower. It's more likely that a billionaire flying solo would choose that, whereas a company would probably prefer more seats. These are pretty rare to see since they're so spacious compared to other business jets. A Boeing Business Jet version of the 737 Max costs about $100 million. Flight-tracking data showed a private 737 that flew from Dubai to Zurich on Sunday. Another one from Dubai went to Friedrichshafen, a lakeside German city just over the Swiss border, on Tuesday. Some governments also use the 737 to transport political leaders. In Switzerland this week, flight-tracking data showed such planes belonging to the United Arab Emirates and the Netherlands. Due to its size, the Boeing 737 business jet is even more customizable than Gulfstream or Bombardier aircraft. Sometimes they are laid out like a typical airliner, with six seats abreast. But there is room for all sorts of amenities, too. Business Insider toured one in 2024, which had an on-board bar, two double bedrooms, and two showers. The first Gulfstream G800 was only delivered last August, so they're still relatively rare to see. It costs about $70 million to buy one. A handful of them flew into Swiss airports this week. JetSpy data shows they included ones owned by Visa, Qualcomm, and Pfizer. It's big enough to have room for four living areas on board. Passengers also shouldn't feel as fatigued as flying commercial, because the G800's cabin pressure makes it feel like the altitude is 2,480 feet. On the newest airliners, like the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, the cabin altitude is more like 6,000 feet. According to data from JetSpy, the above jet is owned by Robert F. Smith, the billionaire founder of Vista Equity Partners. The private equity firm's logo is on the tail. Flight-tracking data shows this Global 7500 flew from Atlanta to Zurich, about 75 miles from Davos, last Saturday. JetSpy data showed that other Bombardier plans that landed in Switzerland this week include ones owned by: Avram Glazer, the Manchester United co-owner; Steve Witkoff, the special envoy to the Middle East; and the quantitative hedge fund Two Sigma. This is the interior of a Global 7500 owned by VistaJet, a private charter firm that operates the most such jets. Several of its planes touched down in Switzerland during the week of the World Economic Forum's annual meeting. Emmanuel Macron appeared to arrive in Davos on Tuesday. That morning, two French government jets — a Dassault Falcon 7X and a smaller Falcon 900 — flew to Zurich from an air base near Paris. However, it appears he left before Trump's speech. Even the president couldn't help compliment Macron's eyewear, which spawned plenty of memes and jokes online. "Those beautiful sunglasses," Trump said. "What the hell happened?" Macron has worn them in public in recent days due to an eye problem. A Dassault Falcon 8X arrived in Zurich from Scottsdale, Arizona, on Tuesday, flight-tracking data showed. It costs about $60 million to buy a new one, or $14,000 an hour to charter. More popular than the Falcon 8X in Switzerland this week was the smaller Falcon 2000 jet. Trump was supposed to fly to Zurich aboard the usual presidential jet, a Boeing VC-25A. It's a militarized version of the Boeing 747 airliner. However, 30 minutes into his journey, the plane U-turned and went back to Joint Base Andrews. He instead flew on a Boeing C-32A. It's not quite as fancy and is usually used as the Vice President's Air Force Two. Any plane carrying the president is designated as Air Force One while he is on it. This week served as a reminder of Trump's impatience with Boeing over delays in building the new Air Force One. His press secretary took the opportunity to mention the 747 that he was gifted by Qatar. That plane is currently undergoing modifications and refitting by the Air Force. The Sikorsky VH-60N White Hawk flew in a convoy of at least five helicopters. They took about 40 minutes to fly from Zurich Airport to Davos on Wednesday. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has had a busy start to the year. He flew on a military version of the Airbus A330. It first arrived in Beijing on January 14, flew to Doha a few days later, and then to Zurich on Monday. Carney won plenty of attention for his speech in Davos about the change in world politics since Trump's election. "We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition," he said. The above Azerbaijani private jet landed in Zurich on Tuesday. The Argentine government's Boeing 757 jet, registered as "ARG-01," arrived in Zurich on Tuesday. Flight-tracking data showed it departed Buenos Aires on Monday evening, then stopped in the Canary Islands, before heading to Switzerland. The journey took about 15 hours. Jump to

Title: I was laid off from CrowdStrike and used AI to send 800 applications in a month to land my ideal role

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Dray Jankowski, former employee at CrowdStrike and current senior director of product operations and program management at Wunderkind. Business Insider verified his identity. This essay has been edited for length and clarity. I still remember the morning I found out I was getting laid off from CrowdStrike. I went to bed thinking everything was fine, and when I woke up, there was a mysterious meeting on my calendar for later that afternoon. That's when I saw the email that said the company was doing a reduction in force as it adjusted to changes driven by AI. It wasn't about financial trouble. It was sudden, impersonal, and final. At 30, it was my first layoff. I was shaken. I worked hard to get where I was. At CrowdStrike, I was a program manager working closely with the team that makes motion sensors. I also worked at Amazon and Raytheon and consulted with companies such as Microsoft and Johnson & Johnson. I had what people would consider a "great résumé."

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Little did I know how brutal the job market would become and how hard it would be to find the right fit. In the first three months after my layoff, I applied to 52 jobs on my own, and I hated every second of it. At first, I wasn't even looking. I had savings, and it was summer. I traveled to Yellowstone, spent time with my mom and my two dogs, and casually applied to roles I actually liked. Instead of being quiet about my layoff, I also decided to be vocal. I started making YouTube videos and launched a podcast called "The Reboot Era," where I talked openly about layoffs and invited others to share their experiences. Even with my background, the job-search process was frustrating. I'd turn to ChatGPT with basic questions like, "Should I update my résumé for this role?" and I started noticing how many people were stuck for months because they didn't know how to optimize it for applicant tracking systems. When I looked for help online, most of it was locked behind paywalls. LinkedIn "Easy Apply" felt like a black hole. Company websites made me create a new Workday account every time. The process was tedious, slow, and draining. So when an AI-powered application platform reached out to me after seeing my posts about layoffs, I invited them onto my podcast with a catch: I wouldn't promote anything unless I tested it myself and believed it worked. At first, the results didn't seem promising. The very first call I got was from a car wash near my house. A week later, something changed. I started getting legitimate interview requests for corporate roles that matched my experience and salary range. One message on LinkedIn asked if I wanted to interview with a company I'd never even heard of. That's when I knew the AI had applied for me. Over the course of about a month, the platform sent out 812 applications on my behalf. It also shows you which keywords to hit in your cover letters, and you can set your own parameters. With AI handling the repetitive work, I could focus on preparing for interviews, refining my résumé, networking, and continuing my podcast. In total, I received five serious interview requests that were aligned with what I wanted. I moved forward with two. One didn't pan out, but the other moved fast. Within two weeks, I had an offer. That's how I landed my current role as senior director of product operations and program management at Wunderkind, a marketing technology company that helps brands re-engage customers who leave their websites without making a purchase. AI didn't get me the job. It got me the interview. From there, it was on me to show up, connect, and prove I was the right person. I think the job market is going in the wrong direction. First, companies decide they can automate many standard workflows and lay off workers. Those employees are then pushed back into the open job market, forced to apply for new roles. Now, they face AI screening systems that evaluate them against opaque criteria they can't see or understand. If the applicant is using AI as well, they get rejected by the screener AI if they sound too robotic. Then, even when you do get the interview, many offers ask you to meet with a digital recruiter who's not a real person and will ask automated questions. None of that seems fair, and it often feels like AI is working against job seekers in this brutal market. It took me more than 800 applications to get one great offer, so it is reasonable if you need help. When used correctly, AI can be the tool that gives you your time and momentum back. Jump to

While the $14 trillion asset manager BlackRock notes that tokenization might benefit the network, JPMorgan notes that Ethereum is still not out of the woods yet. The diverging opinions come amid a surge in network activity, despite the ETH price stalling amid a bearish trend across the broader market. Earlier this week, BlackRock stated that Ethereum is set to dominate the tokenization industry. The asset manager noted that the network could emerge as the gateway for traditional companies looking to dip their toes into blockchain. According to the head of equity ETFs at the asset management firm, Jay Jacobs, if the number of firms using the Ethereum network to tokenize real-world assets increases, ETH could be on a bullish trajectory. BlackRock also notes that as demand for tokenization increases, trading activity on the network will increase, and so will the issuance of various assets, such as stablecoins. The report comes nearly two years after the asset manager launched its first tokenized fund on Ethereum, known as the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). The fund currently has a stablecoin market cap of more than $221 billion. Despite BlackRock’s bullish take, the firm’s iShares Ethereum Trust has been bleeding for the last three consecutive days. During this time, the ETF has seen more than $387 million in outflows, a trend that has coincided with a nearly 12% drop in ETH prices over the last week. JPMorgan has taken a cautious outlook on Ethereum, saying that the recent uptick in network activity might not be sustained. According to the banking giant, the factors that previously hampered network usage might still be at play, which could trigger a bearish correction in the future. Analysts at the bank added that the recent surge in activity might be due to the Fusaka upgrade that went live towards the end of 2025. However, historical data shows that these upgrades only improve network activity for a short time before stalling. JPMorgan also notes that user migration from the mainnet to layer two networks could stall activity, making it challenging for the ETH price to sustain an upward trajectory.

The top five teams in Division 1A of the Energia All-Ireland League have opened up a 10-point gap to the bottom four, adding significant to the clash between Young Munster (28 points) in sixth and third-placed Terenure (32) at Tom Clifford Park, where the visitors last won in 2017. What’s more, Munsters are seeking a second consecutive double over Terenure after a 29-19 win at Lakelands Park in early December. Despite winning just one of their first six matches, it was clear the Cookies’ results were misleading, picking up seven bonus points in those first four defeats. But that win over Terenure sparked a maximum haul of 15 points from their last three games, and this weekend make just two changes to the side that won at Nenagh last time out. Munster and former Connacht and Ireland Sevens winger Andrew Smith returns while Leo Langbridge starts in the backrow. Terenure make one change to the team that ended a three-game losing streak at home to Old Belvedere a fortnight ago, Leinster hooker John McKee returning to the fold as Max Russell reverts to openside after playing for Leinster A in Toulouse last weekend while Ben Blaney is on duty with the Ireland Under-20s. The rest of the top five teams will be favourites to win, although the same was true in early December when UCD produced their best performance of the season to beat Lansdowne 43-38. The students’ make two changes for the return meeting in Belfield, Leinster academy and Ireland Under-20 Grand Slam winner James Culhane coming in at number eight and Thomas Quinn at scrumhalf. Lansdowne make four changes; Harry O’Riordan at inside centre, Jack Matthews and Stephen Madigan in the halfback line, and Harry van Eeden at eight. Leinster scrumhalf Cormac Foley is also among the replacements after a length injury lay-off. Leaders Clontarf (42 points), seeking a 10th successive win, are unchanged at home to Nenagh, who have lost all 10 games this season, while second-placed St Marys (37) make just one change for the visit of seventh-place Ballynahinch (21). Cork Con (fourth, 32) take their four-game winning run to Old Belvedere for a first meeting at Ollie Campbell Park since 2016. The 1B leaders Old Wesley go to Queens, while the 2A and 2B unbeaten duo of MU Barnhall and Galwegians continue their push for promotion at home to Greystones and Navan respectively. Division 1A: Clontarf v Nenagh Ormond, Castle Avenue; Old Belvedere v Cork Constitution, Ollie Campbell Park; UCD v Lansdowne, Belfield; Young Munster v Terenure College, Tom Clifford Park; St Mary’s College v Ballynahinch, Lakelands Park (3pm). Division 1B: Blackrock College v Instonians, Blackrock College School Pitch; City Of Armagh v UCC, Palace Grounds; Highfield v Dublin University, Woodleigh Park; Naas v Garryowen, Rathoe Road; Queen’s University v Old Wesley, Dub Lane. Division 2A: Banbridge v Ballymena, Rifle Park; Cashel v Galway Corinthians, Spafield; Dungannon v Old Crescent, Stevenson Park; MU Barnhall v Greystones, Parsonstown; Shannon v Wanderers, Thomond Park Back Pitch. Division 2B: Clogher Valley v Skerries, The Cran; Galwegians v Navan, Crowley Park; Rainey v Buccaneers, Hatrick Park; Sligo v Enniscorthy, Hamilton Park; UL Bohemian v Malone, UL 4G.

Title: Gonna be golden: join the flight to gold and other precious metals

Amid persistent geopolitical tensions rise in various parts of the world, precious metals such as gold and silver continue to see strong price growth. “The price of silver and gold has risen greatly in the past 60 days, mainly due to what’s going on in the world, from Greenland to the Middle East to Ukraine,” says John Weldon of Weldon Auctioneers in Cows Lane, Temple Bar, Dublin. Earlier this week, pure silver ingot was on the market for about €2.60 per gramme, compared with €1.39 per gramme in mid-November 2025. “People and banks move cash funds into the safety of silver and gold, not only to guard as an inflation hedge, but also to have a tangible asset,” Weldon says. John Weldon Auctioneers will be selling a commemorative set of silver ingots celebrating 1,000 years of the British monarchy from AD 973 to 1973, at their next auction on Tuesday, January 27th, at 2pm. Weldon says potential purchasers of this walnut-cased set of 50 silver ingots (each of which has a portrait and scene of a British monarch), will be more interested in the gramme weight of the silver rather than the historic significance of the item. The combined weight of the collection is about 3,300g. Although one would imagine that such a collection would sell better in the UK than in Ireland, Weldon says Irish owners have found that post-Brexit import duties have made it much less attractive for Irish owners to sell items of significant historic British interest there. The 1973 limited edition set made by John Pinches in London has an estimate of €5,000-€8,000, with the upper figure representing a little under the market price for silver (which stood at €2.57 per gramme earlier this week). Weldon says gold sovereign coins are another way of storing value. The auction includes three gold sovereign coins with guides of €700-€800 each, and a Canadian silver coin dated 2018 with a guide price of €400-€700. If predictions about people spending less time on their smartphones comes to pass, older-style time pieces such as alarm clocks and watches may well come back into vogue. Watches feature prominently in both Adams Blackrock online auction on January 28th at 7pm, and the aforementioned John Weldon in-person and live online auction on January 27th at 2pm. Elena McCrory of Adams Blackrock says Omega, Rolex, Patek Philippe, Longines and Raymond Weil watches are always in demand. A Rolex GMT-Master II Oyster-Perpetual Date man’s stainless steel wristwatch (€8,000-€9,000), and a Rolex Oyster 18-carat yellow gold diamond woman’s wristwatch (€6,000-€7,000) are included in the auction. Meanwhile, an 18-carat gold Rolex Oyster Date wristwatch with a white face and roman numeral dial (€9,500-€11,500) and an 18-carat Cartier Tank Française Chronograph wristwatch (€5,000-€6,000) are among the watches for sale at Weldon’s auction. The latter includes three sub-dials that track seconds, minutes and hours for anyone in need of such exact measurements for sporting or other pursuits. The Weldon auction also has a stainless steel Rolex Oyster Date wristwatch with a guide price of €3,000-€4,000. Most guide prices for watches at auction are substantially below the retail price of an equivalent watch. Moving on to matters much more mechanical, Wilsons Auctions in Belfast is holding a timed online auction of vintage tractors from Wednesday, January 28th, at 2pm, to Friday, January 30th. Collected over 60 years by Ronnie Deering of Newtownards, Co Down, the John Deere, Case, Chamberlin and Hanomag tractors date from 1918 to 1969 and were sourced in the UK, across Europe and in Australia. David Deering, son of Ronnie and Margaret Deering (who also ran Ballycastle House B&B for a number of years), has fond memories of participating in road runs, agricultural shows and vintage tractor shows over the years. Mount Stewart and Rosemount Estate in Greyabbey, Co Down, and Shane’s Castle, Co Antrim, were among the most popular local venues for such events. At least two of the Deering tractors for sale – a 1922 Case 12/20 Crossmotor tractor and a 1949 Chamberlin tractor – that were used in the Cooley Vintage Festival in 2007. At that event, more than 4,500 tractors helped set the Guinness World Record for the most veteran tractors ploughing simultaneously. Ronnie Deering, who worked for the Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland, bought some of his collection in Western Australia when visiting family there. Now in his 80s, he is ready to sell 12 of them, while the family retains eight or nine others, alongside vintage cars for future generations of the Deering family. “Myself and my father have restored many of these tractors over the years and we built an insulated shed to store them,” says David Deering, who expects strong interest in the vintage tractors from collectors here as well as abroad. Viewing takes place at the Deering residence (BT222AL) on Monday, January 26th, 10am-5pm. jwa.ie, adamsblackrock.ie, wilsonsauctions.com Estimate €500-€800 Hammer price €3,000 Auction house Adam’s Estimate €800-€1,200 Hammer price €1,300 Auction house Adam’s Estimate €400-€600 Hammer price €1,300 Auction house Adam’s Estimate €600-€1,000 Hammer price €1,800 Auction house Adam’s Keep up to date with fashion news and trends for you and your home.

Only select stores though OP might need that in title. 1 out of 6 stores around me has it and that doesn't allow pick up so no deal for me Rooster Rolls are absolutely top tier fast food. Real chicken, not tenders. Two of them would hit the spot All I buy there, ..Just wish they didn't microwave the f out of em. I'm a 8 beers and 0.25 vodka atm and the rooster roll is one of gods greatest creations Haha, had just ordered 4 rooster rolls, 2 for dinner, and 2 for lunch at work tomorrow. Truly the best. After i placed the first order, i was unable to get the same deal again? How were you able to place 2 orders for the same deal? I really like the pineapple fritters and colesaw also This comes and goes often, but gosh it’s terrible food. Soggy rolls with some blender chicken. The two posts above literally could not be any different if they tried. My personal opinion red rooster has better quality than the beef burger fast food joints trying their hands on chicken as well as better quality than kfc 100%. KFC at it's best is superb, but I don't find them consistent. Red Rooster is just such a great consistent option in my humble opinion $9 delivery is a killer Free with uber one because it's technically over the $20 threshold. But they still get you for like a 1.20 service fee Most of the Red Rooster outlets I see are empty, or hardly anyone is inside. Wonder how they make a profit or how they survive. My local dosen't even have tables for eat in- just counter seating. Most of their business is from drive through. Instead of disparaging the great rooter, instead support them Anyone found a store that allows pickup? Yeah there should be many wasnt able to use the offer for pick up orders though There’s no rooster roll in the menu, wtf? A red rooster store delisted the rolls AFTER I took advantage of this LOL. Every time I click the banner the rolls are missing from the menu. I've now switched to another red rooster store and the rolls now show up… So funny when Uber does deals for stores and the stores refuse to play ball. Ordered Rooster Rolls from my local store today for lunch. Unfortunately, I found that the amount of chicken provided was roughly a quarter of what is standard or advertised. It was essentially a bread roll with very little filling, which made for a very poor experience and poor value for money. Very disappointed. Don't know if anyone else had the same experience. definitely tell them. a rooster roll should be filled up properly All trademarks are owned by their respective owners.OzBargain is an independent community website which has no association with nor endorsement by the respective trademark owners.

Title: After A Snake-Like 2025, Is The Bitcoin Price Ready to Break Out In 2026?

The bitcoin price twisted and turned through a tough 2025 — but historical cycles, investor sentiment, and market signals suggest a stronger 2026 may be ahead. We had high hopes for the bitcoin price in 2025. It was supposed to be the crescendo of the four-year cycle, the most bullish setup in recent memory. It was the year after the halving, the ETFs had just been approved, a new president was elected, with the promise of the money printer roaring back to life. Everything looked primed for a Q4 blow-off top, and instead of a new life in Monaco, all you got was this lousy article. What follows is my interpretation of the events of 2025 and my outlook for 2026. I’m not a trader, not an analyst, and like you, I’ve been outperforming professional funds for years, by simply stacking Sats, of course. I’m more of a “fix the money, fix the world” kinda guy, but like everyone else, it’s hard to ignore Bitcoin’s price movements, which I think of as the game of “Snakes and Ladders”. In the game of Snakes and Ladders, momentum drives us forward, but it can also provide a false sense of confidence. You can be one roll away from victory, only to land on a snake that sends you sliding back ten places. As much as hopium dictates that we pray for the price to go ‘up and to the right’, markets rarely oblige. Switching from the board to the chart, price action is played on a board of global liquidity and market sentiment. When sentiment is low or liquidity dries up, no amount of good news can sustain momentum. We simply crab sideways or find a snake that slides us down into further despair. On the other hand, when liquidity floods the system, we often find the ladders that shoot us through resistance levels. For most of 2025, we were stuck playing the former, while dreaming of the “ladder”. So let’s take this time to review 2025 from the perspective of hindsight, as foresight proved to be of little benefit. If there is a phrase that defines the Bitcoin market of 2025, it is exactly that: a Year of Snakes and precious few ladders. Interestingly, and unbeknownst to me, 2025 was indeed the year of the snake according to the 12-year Chinese zodiac cycle, starting January 29, 2025, and ending February 16, 2026. We began the year with the kind of euphoria that usually marks a cycle top. The halving was behind us, and the political stars had aligned perfectly. Google trends showed search queries were soaring. In fact, the year kicked off with a quiet but massive victory before the political fireworks even started: FASB fair value accounting rules took effect on January 1st, finally allowing companies to report bitcoin profits rather than just losses. Then came the main event. We witnessed the inauguration of a “Bitcoin President.” Gary Gensler departed, leaving behind a legacy that, in hindsight, was perhaps less villainous than we assumed, and Ross Ulbricht walked free within 48 hours. With the new administration came a few allies: Paul Atkins took over the SEC and Mike Selig the CFTC, securing a pro-crypto cabinet. The financial plumbing was finally completed. The ETFs were fully operational, options trading on IBIT were unleashed, and it quickly became clear that Michael Saylor was not about to let Larry Fink steal his thunder. MicroStrategy went on a $25 billion buying spree, 100x what they bought in 2020, and the corporate treasury list exploded from 60 companies to nearly 200. By October, the engines were well and truly revving. We hit the All-Time High on October 6th, ready to punch the accelerator for the glorious Q4 end-of-cycle run. Instead, we shifted the gear into reverse and slid all the way down to $80,000. First, we got our knickers in a twist over the “Knots vs. Core” drama. Then came the Binance incident, where the snake manifested itself as a “technical issue” at precisely the wrong time, and right as Gold broke out. We essentially got rug-pulled by a glitch. The issue of October 10th likely created added sell pressure through forced liquidations, whilst also triggering the 4-year cycle sellers who have been trained to sell Q4 of the 4th year. Few understood the gravity of it at the time, though I tip my hat to Jesse Olson for calling it early. Then the FUD machine was turned on. First, it targeted MicroStrategy with threats of MSCI exclusion; it didn’t help sentiment that its mNAV has been dropping all year. Then it pivoted back to Bitcoin with the return of the “quantum attack” narrative. While the headlines swirled, the bitcoin price became stuck in purgatory, range-bound between $84,000 and $95,000 and trapped by options traders, even though the handcuffs had theoretically been taken off IBIT options earlier in the year. Bitcoin was having an Austin Powers moment, while Peter Schiff enjoyed his first day out in the sun since high school. Bless him. While some fear 2026 will bring the hangover of a post-cycle bear market, I, like countless other optimists believe otherwise. If 2025 was the year of snakes, 2026 is the year we finally climb a few ladders. The setup is favourable. We have a Bitcoin-ish president, who’s hungry to fire up the printing press, we’ve a developing multipolar world, where the process of game theory should be heating up, there’s a $7 trillion debt wall to be paid, the old guard are positioned, the regulation stranglehold has been loosened, the cowboys (FTX, Terra-Luna, etc.) are gone, gold and silver have both had their runs, and Bitcoin’s supposed to follow next, or so we hope. Not to mention, the tax year is done, and new budgets have been allocated to fund managers and businesses alike. FASB fair value accounting is now live, smoothing the runway for corporate balance sheets. Michael Saylor is still buying with the relentless intensity of a man who understands math better than Archimedes. Even the “MSCI FUD” was defeated early, so credit to George and the Bitcoin for Corporations team for that victory. At the point in time as the price is beginning to climb higher, the bears are finally showing signs of exhaustion, that’s according to James Check and countless others. By far the most significant headwind Bitcoin faced in 2025 was the relentless onslaught of coins sold by long-term holders. That pressure looks to finally be ending. On November 1st, approximately 67% of the Realised Cap was invested above $95k. The last two months have seen a massive supply redistribution occur, with that metric declining to 47%. Over the last 30 days, around 80% of the coins which have transacted came from higher prices. This is the definition of capitulation. The weak hands who bought the top have flushed out, and new buyers have stepped in with a lower and stronger cost basis. Incidentally, the Year of the Snake officially ends on February 16, 2026, to be followed by a horse, which as we all know has the ability to outrun any bull. This coincides almost perfectly with the monthly CME Futures expiry on February 27th. The shedding of a snake’s skin happens right before the growth returns. Really, who can truly say they know? What we do know is that the four-year cycle is no longer connected to the halvings or the presidential cycles in the way we once thought, and the halvings are less likely to have an effect going forward, as the new coins distributed are a lower percentage of supply, and the miners are supported by huge funds which can help them weather any potential death spiral.We have not seen a Pi Cycle top signal, the 200 week moving average has not crossed the prior cycle top, the MVRV score is just 1.3, the Puell multiple is just .99, we’ve not had a considerable drawdown, and we’re still at the bottom of the range of almost every metric imaginable. For those of you who are old enough to remember the KitKat ad from the 90’s, “the 4 year cycle is not dead, it was just takin’ a break.” As the 4-year cycle is a purely Liquidity Based Cycle, it can be measured by proxy using the ISM Manufacturing PMI, a qualitative index sourced from purchasing managers in the manufacturing industry. I give credit to Raoul Pal for highlighting this metric; he was the first I observed to point out that bitcoin is a “Liquidity” asset rather than a “Halving” asset. Bitcoin, as the highest-beta risk asset in existence, responds to shifts in global risk appetite with greater force and speed than any other asset class. The PMI tracks the business cycle, and it has been in contraction for nearly two years. The current PMI at 47.9 signals ongoing contraction, but ISM projections indicate a 4.4% revenue growth for manufacturing in 2026, crossing 50 in Q2 as Trump’s policies kick in. The bitcoin price should follow. When the ISM PMI is below 50, we’re generally in a bear market, and we’ve been that way for over two years now. The bull markets have historically topped out between 55 and 65. The question remains, when is the business cycle going to see an upturn? TechDev is of the view that it’s happening very soon, as the bullish divergence reversal momentum is decidedly building. The $9 Trillion Debt Question The US government has to address the $9 trillion debt wall that’s due to mature this year. But the nuance is in how they do it. President Trump has made it clear he intends to build a “Dream Military” for 2027 and is pushing for a budget increase to $1.5 trillion. When you combine that with the $4.1 trillion of debt maturing in 2026 and the standard annual deficit, the US Treasury faces a $9 trillion liquidity gap, and a further $7.4 trillion before 2028. Does the US have to print all $9 trillion? No. And through this lens, the recent geopolitical moves make sense. Trump didn’t only capture Maduro for a photo-op; he has likely taken control over 303B barrels of reserves and is enforcing USD oil sales, creating artificial dollar demand and easing the liquidity gap by $2-3T annually. Can he cover the gap via a mix of tariffs (that Americans actually pay for!), Petro-Dollar demand, and the inevitable monetization of the rest by the Federal Reserve? I guess he’ll have to. With Jerome Powell expected to leave his chair in May, the path will be cleared to give the printer engines a whir. There’s another $5 – $10 tr due globally in 2026, and the same again in 2027. So the fed chair won’t be without company. The four-year cycle OGs may be stepping aside, but the Liquidity Cycle is just gearing up, and Bitcoin, as Raoul Pal has long argued, remains the ultimate liquidity barometer. Samuel Benner’s famous 19th-century forecasting chart (first published in 1875), maps long-term cycles of panics (“A” years), booms/high prices (“B” years), and depressions/low prices (“C” years). Interestingly, 2026 falls squarely in one of Benner’s “B” years, which is a period of “Good Times, High Prices and the time to sell Stocks and values of all kinds.” The chart places 2026 right alongside previous boom years like 2016, 2007, 1999, and 1989, suggesting we are entering a structurally favorable window for risk assets. How Long Will The Next Money Printing Last? Prediction: 18–24 months Why: History shows that once the dam gates open, it takes roughly two years to stabilize and reflate. If the official aggressive printing phase begins in late 2025 (as the liquidity uptick and Benner timeline imply, and as M2 shows), it will likely run strong through mid-2027. Prediction: ~$9–$10 trillion in the U.S. Treasury debt is maturing in 2026 alone (about one-third of outstanding marketable debt) and a further $5 – $10 tr globally. Why: As discussed above, the maturity walls for 2026 are nearly double what we faced during the COVID crisis. Yellen extended the pain by leaning on short-term issuance back then, but come hell or high water, that debt has to be paid or refinanced—the money will arrive from somewhere. Because of this, we can expect a new wave of inflation, the 70’s and 80’s have a story to tell about that! Prediction: $250,000 Why: During that $5 trillion COVID expansion, BTC rallied roughly 20x from the $3k–$4k lows to $69k. With the potential for double that liquidity entering the system this cycle, the upside is significant even if diminishing returns apply. From our $16k effective low, a conservative 10x to 12x multiple lands us in the $160k to $200k range as a base case. However, models suggest we could push higher. PlanC’s quantile model points toward $300k+ by the end of 2026, and Giovanni Santostasi’s Power Law projects a peak potentially around $210k early on, with room to stretch as high as $600k in outlier scenarios. But hey, I was expecting +$200k last cycle too. Oh, if the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act moves out of the committee, and if the U.S. Treasury officially starts side-stacking alongside MicroStrategy, all bets are off the table. Prediction: Late 2026 to mid-2027 The Logic: Bitcoin historically tops out 12–18 months after the liquidity expansion enters its “mania” phase. If the ISM Manufacturing PMI crosses back above 50 in early 2026, the perfect storm should unfold throughout 2026, setting up a blow-off top, potentially in the first half of 2027. Bitcoin is unlikely to go straight up, nothing ever does. We’ll almost certainly encounter a few snakes along the way: sharp corrections, regulatory noise, profit-taking, or some form of shenanigans. But the ladders are built, ready and waiting. The Year of the Snake is coming to an end, just ahead of the February 27 CME futures expiry, our potential ignition point, right before the anticipated PMI uptick in Q2. 2025 was a year of snakes and sideways pain, with long-term holders finally capitulated and weak hands flushed out. Now, with a wall of liquidity heading our way, 2026 looks like the ladder we’ve been waiting for. The horse year is coming, so stack and secure accordingly. Good luck.

Larry Fink, president and CEO of investment firm BlackRock, interviewed Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX at the World Economic forum in Davos, Switzerland this week. They spoke about everything from AI to robotics to Mars, and Musk offered a vision of the future that’s coming more quickly than you might think. Here’s an excerpt of their conversation: Larry Fink: So you’re presently building on AI, on robotics, on space, on energy, all at the same time. When you look across those efforts, what do they have in common from an engineering standpoint? Elon Musk: Well, they’re all very difficult technology challenges, but the overall goal of my companies is to maximize the future of civilization, like basically maximize the probability that civilization has a great future, and to expand consciousness beyond Earth. So if you take SpaceX, for example, that SpaceX is about advancing rocket technology to the point where we can extend. Life and consciousness beyond Earth, to the Moon, to Mars, eventually to other star systems. And I think we should always view consciousness, life as we know it, as precarious and delicate. Because to the best of our knowledge, we don’t know of life anywhere else. You know, I’m often asked, are there aliens among us? And I’ll say that I am one, but . . . We have 9,000 satellites up there. And not once have we had to maneuver around an alien spaceship. So I’m like, I don’t know. Bottom line is, I think we need to assume. Life and consciousness is extremely rare, and it might only be us. And if that’s the case, then we need to do everything possible to ensure that the light of consciousness is not extinguished, because the way I view it is, the image in my mind of a tiny candle in a vast darkness, tiny candle of consciousness, that could easily go out. And that’s why it’s important to make life multi-planetary, such that if there is a natural disaster or a man-made disaster on Earth, that consciousness continues. That’s the purpose of SpaceX. Tesla is obviously about sustainable technology and . . . And also, at this point, we’ve sort of added to our mission sustainable abundance. So with robotics and AI. This is really the path to abundance for all. People often talk about solving global poverty, or essentially, how do we give everyone a very high standard of living? I think the only way to do this is AI and robotics, which doesn’t mean that it is without its issues. I mean, we need to be very careful with AI. We need to be very careful with robotics. We don’t want to find ourselves in a James Cameron movie. You know, “Terminator.” But if you have ubiquitous AI that is essentially free or close to it, and ubiquitous robotics, then you will have an explosion in the global economy, an expansion of the global economy that is truly beyond all precedent. Fink: How can that be created? How can it broaden the global economy? Musk: In the benign scenario of the future . . . there will be such an abundance of goods and services because my prediction is that there’ll be more robots than people. Fink: But how do you then have human purpose? Musk: Yeah, I mean, you know, nothing’s perfect, but I mean it is a necessary, like you can’t have both. You can’t have work that has to be done and amazing abundance for all. . . . But if you have billions of humanoid robots, and I think there will be, I think everyone on Earth is going to have one and going to want one. Because who wouldn’t want a robot to, assuming it’s very safe, watch over your kids, take care of your pets? If you have elderly parents, a lot of friends might have elderly parent, so it’s very difficult to take care them. Yeah, it’s expensive and they just aren’t enough young people to take care of the old people. So if you had a robot that could take care of and protect an elderly parent, I think that would be great. That would be an amazing thing to have. And I think we will have those things. So overall, I’m very optimistic about the future. I think we’re headed for a future of amazing abundance, which is very cool, and definitely we are in the most interesting time in history. Fink: So in the future that you talk about, the AI models, autonomous machines, rockets, depends on massive increases of compute, massive increases in energy, expensive energy, manufacturing scale. What are the bottlenecks to get there? Musk: I think the limiting factor for AI deployment is fundamentally electrical power. It’s just, right, it’s energy. I mean, we’re seeing the rate of AI chip production increase exponentially, but the rate of electricity being brought online is negligible, 10%, 4% a year, max. It’s clear that we’re very soon, maybe even later this year, we’ll be producing more chips than we can turn on. Except for China, China’s growth in electricity is tremendous. They’re building 100 gigawatts of nuclear as we speak. Actually, solar is the biggest thing in China. . . . China, just in solar, can do half of US electricity output per year. Solar is by far the biggest source of energy. And that’s why one of the things we’ll be doing with SpaceX within a few years is launching solar-powered AI satellites because the space is really the source of immense power, and then you don’t need to take up any room on Earth. There’s so much room in space, and you can scale to hundreds of terawatts a year. Fink: You and I have had these conversations before, but why don’t you tell the audience what would it take for the United States and what type of geography would it take to have that solar field to electrify the United States? And why aren’t we doing it? Musk: Yeah, so, I mean, I guess a rough way to think about it is 100 miles by 100 miles, I’ll call it 160 kilometers by 160 kilometers of solar is enough to power the entire United States. Yeah, 100 mile by 100 mile areas is, I mean, you could take basically a small corner of Utah. Nevada. Nevada, New Mexico. Obviously, you wouldn’t want it all in one place. But it is a very small percentage of the area of the US to generate all of the electricity that the US uses. And the same is true, actually, for Europe. You could take a small part. You can take. Relatively unpopulated areas of say Spain and Sicily and generate all of the electricity power that Europe needs. Fink: So why don’t you think that there’s a movement toward that here and in the United States? Musk: Unfortunately, in the US, the tariff barriers for solar are extremely high. And that makes the economics of deploying solar artificially high because China makes almost all the solar . . . We obviously don’t control the US tariff policy. But for other countries, China makes solar cells that are incredibly low cost. Fink: I know you’re going to be having a couple of big announcements on robotics and what it can do. I mean, when I went to the factory, you showed me those robots. You talked about billions of robots, but how quickly can they be deployed in a manufacturing setting? How quickly can it be utilized and be functional and create that abundance that you talked about? Musk: Well, humanoid robotics will advance very quickly. I think we do have some of the Tesla Optimus robots doing simple tasks in the factory. Probably later this year, by the end of this year I think they’ll be doing more complex tasks. But still deployed in an industrial environment. And probably sometime next year, I’d say that by the end of next year I think we’d be selling humanoid robots to the public. That’s when we are confident that it’s very high reliability, very high safety, and the range of functionality is also very high. You can basically ask it to do anything you’d like. Fink: You’re already seeing that in Tesla cars, the software changes that you’re doing. And what is it, every quarter now a software change that upgrades the ability of the robot within the car? Musk: Yes, the Tesla full self-driving software, we update it sometimes once a week and recently some of the insurance companies have said that it is actually so safe, Tesla full-self driving is so safe that they’re offering customers half-price insurance if they use has the force of driving in the car. Fink: And that can be monitored by the insurance company? Is that part of the agreement? Musk: Yeah. But I think self-driving cars is essentially a solved problem at this point. And Tesla’s rolled out a sort of robot taxi service in a few cities and will be very, very widespread by the end of this year within the US. And then we hope to get supervised full self-driving approval in Europe hopefully next month. Fink: Really, that quickly. Musk: And then. Maybe a similar timing for China, hopefully. Fink: I want to move to space, because historically, space is very capital-intensive. It’s historically been done by governments. Obviously, SpaceX changed the whole model. But we’ve seen it slow to scale, and now I’m starting to see it ramping up in what you’re doing and other things.

Please provide a valid email. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Never miss a story. Musk: Well, the key breakthrough, the major breakthrough that SpaceX is hoping to achieve this year is full reusability. So no one has ever achieved full reusability of a rocket, which is very important for the cost of access to space. We’ve achieved partial reusability with Falcon 9 by landing the booster stage. We’ve now landed the booster over 500 times. But we have to throw away the upper stage. The upper stage sort of burns up on reentry for Falcon 9. So, and the cost of that is equivalent to a small to medium sized jet. But with Starship, which is a giant rocket, it’s the largest flying machine ever made. Fink: That’s a rocket that you’re using for the idea of going to Mars, right? Musk: Yeah, Mars and the moon, as well as for high volume satellite stuff. So Starship, hopefully this year we should prove full reusability for Starship which will be a profound invention because the cost of access to space will drop by a factor of 100 when you achieve full reusability. It’s the same sort of economic difference that you would expect between, say, a reusable aircraft and a non-reusable aircraft. Like if you have to throw your aircraft away after every flight, that would be a very expensive flight. But if you only have to refuel, then it’s the cost of the fuel. And so that’s really the fundamental breakthrough that gets the cost-of-access to space. Below the cost of freight on aircraft. Under $100 a pound type of thing easily. So it makes putting large satellites into space very cheap. And then when you have solar in space, you get five times more effectiveness, maybe even more than that, than solar on the ground. Because it’s always sunny. You don’t have a day-night cycle or seasonality or weather. And you get about 30% more power in space because you don’t have atmospheric attenuation of the power. Any given solar panel will do five times more energy and space than on the ground. Fink: Is there any capacity in doing that and then taking that power and bringing it back to Earth? Is there a way of doing that or are you just taking that power and utilizing it for the needs, like building AI data centers in space? Musk: It’s a no-brainer for building AI, solar-powered AI data centers in space . . . It is also very cold in space, if you’re in the shadow. So you just have, you have solar panels facing the sun and then a radiator that’s pointed away from the sun. So it has no sun incidence and then it just cooling, it’s just a very efficient cooling system. Net effect is that the lowest cost place to put AI will be space, and that will be true within two years, maybe three, three at the latest. Fink: So looking 10 or 20 years out, how would you describe success with AI or space technology, and where do you see it? Are you more certain what’s going to happen the next three years, or five or 10? Musk: I don’t know what’s going to happen in 10 years, but the rate at which AI is progressing, I think we’ve . . . We might have AI that is smarter than any human by the end of this year. And I would say no later than next year. And then probably by 2030 or 2031, call it five years from now, AI will be smarter than all of humanity collectively. Fink: Do you see yourself ever going to Mars in your lifetime? Musk: I’ve asked it a few times, like do I want to, you know, die on Mars? And I’m like, yes, but just not on impact. Fink: Elon, thank you. Any last words? Musk: Well, I think generally, I mean my last words would be, I would encourage everyone to be optimistic and excited about the future. Good. And generally, for quality of life, it is actually better to err on the side of being an optimist and wrong rather than a pessimist and right. Advertisement

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Amazon employees are doing what Big Tech workers often do when they're anxious about layoffs: making memes. The company is expected to cut thousands more corporate roles as soon as next week, Business Insider reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter. This coming round would mark another wave of mass layoffs at Amazon in just a few months, following the roughly 14,000 jobs eliminated in October. In the absence of official companywide communication, workers have been trying to ease tension in an internal Slack channel with more than 26,000 employees who joined by posting memes and jokes, which Business Insider viewed. The focus of their snark? Amazon founder and former CEO Jeff Bezos' famous "two-pizza rule," originally designed to keep meetings lean and productive. The rule was simple: never have a meeting so large that two pizzas couldn't feed the entire group. As the company continues to thin its ranks, employees are using the same logic to point out just how much leaner their teams are about to become. Amazon did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. One meme showed a single, thin sliver of pizza with the caption "how we feed two pizza teams." Another image featured two Amazon Web Services-branded pizza boxes, with the caption "did someone say 2 pizza team?" The meme is a nod to the company's cloud division, where many of the cuts are expected to land. "I don't think I've ever been on a team that could be completely fed with just two reasonably sized pizzas until you were still hungry very frugal," one employee wrote in the Slack channel. "Increasing 'span-of-control' for managers seems to be the new rage." Others wondered if two Costco pizzas would be considered "reasonably sized." "I was thinking more like Domino's Large pizzas," another employee wrote. The pizza jokes weren't the only coping mechanism. Employees also shared non-pizza memes. One riffed on the rumored timing, splashing "JANUARY 27TH" over the scene from "The Shining" showing Jack Nicholson's character smashing through a door with an ax and "AWS" over his face. Another meme used the "panik/kalm" template to mock corporate buzzwords. It shows an error message about email not working, presumably because the employee was laid off, with the words "Mail not working (have I become Nimble?!)", referring to CEO Andy Jassy's 2025 remarks about cutting jobs to stay nimble. Other posts leaned into the dread of the unknown: one meme laid out a checklist for employees for January 27: "able to login," "mail and Slack works," and "no random HR meeting in calendar." Another simply captured the vibe in all caps: "I don't know what will happen on 27 Jan and at this point I'm too afraid to ask." Amazon isn't the first tech giant to see a nervous workforce poke fun at its internal culture. In 2023, Google employees flooded the company's internal message boards with memes mocking its lavish developer conference, which came months after it laid off 12,000 employees. Have a tip?

Title: Honeywell CEO Vimal Kapur: Powering Data Centers with Renewables is “Against Physics”

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Essay by Eric Worrall “Even after 3 or 5 years more innovation?” “It’s against physics”. NOW – Honeywell CEO says solar power cannot produce cement or steel, "They are very energy-intensive… It's physics… Renewables remain in the mix, but it cannot bring the amount of joules we need to produce this infrastructure which is required in the world." pic.twitter.com/n4zz8KIfjp Anti-renewable blasphemy in the Davos World Economic Forum, the citadel of globalism. The moment when someone tells the emperor he has no clothes. The video is well worth watching, once they get over their momentary shock the quiet part is being spoken aloud, all the panelists nodded and agreed. Larry Fink, CEO of Blackrock, also trashed renewables in Davos 2024 (first published JoNova); The words are out now, and cannot be unspoken. For the last decade I’ve spent writing for WUWT myself and I think many of us have viewed BlackRock as an adversary, and big tech as hypocrites, all cynical exploiters promoting renewables and backing green politicians at the expense of ordinary people. But the money train has left the renewable station. Banks and big tech follow the money, and with subsidies and political goodwill for renewables on the wane, renewables are increasingly uninvestable. Now that Fortune 500 CEOs like Vimal Kapur “I’m an engineer by trade” are speaking out, now big bankers like Larry Fink are happy to throw renewables under a bus, now that President Trump is trashing renewables and cancelling climate treaties, it might seem the battle is won. Not everyone is onboard with the end of renewables. Some big European organisations are heavily invested in renewables, and stand to loose big time if the renewable subsidy hose dries up. Top business leaders issue an expletive-laced message on the green backlash PUBLISHED THU, JAN 22 20262:29 AM ESTUPDATED THU, JAN 22 20268:05 AM EST Sam Meredith@IN/SAMUELMEREDITH@SMEREDITH19 KEY POINTS Top business leaders this week delivered an expletive-laden plea in defense of climate action, describing the backlash to Europe’s green transition as an “aberration.” In an interview with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Allianz CEO Oliver Bäte said he disagreed with the suggestion that it may just be a matter of time before net zero is dismissed in Europe, saying short-term thinking on this issue is “bulls—.” Asked about political leaders backtracking on their much-vaunted European Green New Deal and Norway’s oil fund reportedly defending a push from companies to water down their climate goals, Bäte said anyone who has children “will have to worry” about the planet’s future. “It’s an aberration that short-term people are saying that,” Bäte told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe” on Tuesday. “I think it’s about doing it intelligently. And by the way, the role model here is China, they are going to be the leader both in terms of renewable and cost of energy.” … There is one important big player, mentioned in the article above, which wants to see the Western world remain committed to self destructive renewables. ‘Subservient to China’: Net zero warning at Davos as Trump slams the policy, Chinese vice-premier defends renewables America’s shock verdict at Davos has put Australia’s energy future in doubt. And China is at the centre of it all. Harrison ChristianJanuary 23, 2026 – 9:20AM Globalisation wasn’t the only policy to cop extraordinary criticism at Davos — another was net zero. … Donald Trump went even further than Lutnick in his remarks to the forum on Wednesday local time. … “One thing I’ve noticed is that the more windmills a country has the more money that country loses and the worse that country is doing. “China makes almost all of the windmills, and yet I haven’t been able to find any windfarms in China. China’s very smart — they make them, they sell them for a fortune, they sell them to the stupid people that buy them.” In the end, it was Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng who advocated strongly for renewables at the forum. “China has put in place the world’s largest renewable energy system and the most complete new-energy industrial chain,” he said in his address. “We invite enterprises from all over the world to embrace the opportunities from the green and low-carbon transition, and work closely with China in such areas as green infrastructure, green energy, green minerals and green finance, and jointly create a green and prosperous future.” China makes the vast majority of renewable technology. It also installs more renewable energy capacity than the rest of the world combined, though it remains by far the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases. … China, which uses vast and growing amounts of coal to manufacture renewables while maintaining a sham of going green, stands to lose 10s, possibly hundreds of billions of dollars if the world cancels Net Zero. They are using every influence lever they can pull to try to ensure global Net Zero remains on track. China doesn’t seem to care if Net Zero wrecks the global economy, so long as China ends up on top. Perhaps they hope a broken world would be easy pickings for China’s greedy elites. With President Trump strides the world stage, trampling green sacred cows, and some CEOs championing energy sanity, it is easy to think the battle is over. But China is patient, their culture champions the long game. China are doing everything in their power to replace the USA as the global superpower. The measure of their vast influence is the number of Western politicians and leading business figures who still champion green energy and the Chinese way, both within and outside the United States. If President Trump’s successor is not equal to the challenge of continuing the Trump energy abundance agenda, and companies like BlackRock start manoeuvring for trillions of dollars of re-instated green subsidies, 2029 will feel like 2021 all over again. “China makes almost all of the windmills, and yet I haven’t been able to find any windfarms in China. China’s very smart — they make them, they sell them for a fortune, they sell them to the stupid people that buy them.” This is a “they are eating the dogs” level lie. Reality just doesn’t matter in trumpland. You seem smart. How can you believe China is going green, when they are still expanding coal capacity? At what point will the penny drop that China is fooling you with a Potemkin village style green sham, while their industrial economy breaks new coal consumption records every other year? How much did their electricity production from coal grew last year? How much of their overall demand growth was covered by renewables? They can expand their capacity all they want when their capacity factor goes down. Let’s wait and see how it looks next year. China’s coal electricity production went up last year of record (2024, Coal fired supply increase 6.1% on year, to cover hydropower shortage). Since renewable generation has increased every year for at least the past decade, you would think even with the hydro down, coal usage would have been stable. Fwiw, demand growth in 2024 was approx.6.5%. Fwiw^2, nuclear had a growth rate of about 7% that same year in China. All the extra added nameplate wind/solar capacity appears to have done…. Last year was 2025 Clearly stated, “last year of record”. But comprehension was never your strong point, was it? CREA/GEM ‘China Coal Power’ August 2025 “Coal remains deeply embedded in the power system with little public discussion of its phase down or eventual exit.” “Coal power continues to expand in absolute capacity terms and remains structurally protected. Current institutions continue to lock in coal’s position” “Coal construction and commissioned projects remain high with no clear signs of slowing. 21GW commissioned in the first half of 2025, the highest first half total since 2016. Full year additions expected to exceed 80GW. Construction starts and restarts reached 46GW, equal to the entire coal capacity of S Korea” “Renewables equal 60% of installed capacity compared to 34% for coal but there is a widening disconnect between capacity growth and actual power production” “Faced with constraints in grid flexibility and market mechanisms Local Authorities have largely defaulted to coal power as the fastest and most controllable way to secure dispatchable capacity” “Only 1GW retired in the first half of 2025……Current efforts are focused on life extensions and retrofitting. Coal exits are politically marginal and institutionally unsupported. BEIJING – China’s coal output rose to a record in 2025, statistics bureau data showed on Monday, as lower domestic prices prompted buyers to cut imports and rebuild stockpiles with cheaper local supply, although the rise was limited by regulator efforts to curb production growth. Production in 2025 reached 4.83-billion metric tons, up 1.2% from 2024, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. More ample domestic supply – a reversal from the coal and power shortages China experienced a few years ago – also encouraged power plants to source better quality coal, said Peng Chengyao, head of APAC power and renewables research at S&P Global Energy. In H1 2025, 21 gigawatts (GW) of coal power were commissioned, the highest amount in the first half of the year since 2016, with projections for the full year exceeding 80 GW. This increase in commissions follows on the tail of the 2022-2023 coal power permitting surge that saw two new coal projects permitted per week, on average, totalling more than 100 GW of coal power approved per year. This trend will likely continue into 2026 and 2027 I asked about the power generated from coal (Twh), not their domestic production or their added capacity… And you were answered, lie spewing moron. Why are you asking? Just provide the details and make your point. “How much did their electricity production from coal grew last year? How much of their overall demand growth was covered by renewables?” NB : I am translating “Renewables” to equal “Wind + Solar (only)” here. I had no idea how China’s electricity generation was split for calender year 2025 when first reading your post … but being a curious fellow with (way) too much spare time on my hands I went looking for some actual data on the Wibbly Wobbly Web … I eventually ended up at the following site, which has monthly “data” up to November 2025 : https://lowcarbonpower.org/region/People's_Republic_of_China/sources Extracting the 21 lines starting with “CN,”People’s Republic of China”,…” — plus the header line with the date information — from their (just over 3 MB) CSV file allowed me to generate a “quick and dirty” spreadsheet plot, which is attached to the end of this post. . Notes – It looks like “Coal” generation levelled off on a “12-month rolling sum” basis during 2025, it neither increased nor decreased. – How much the “Coal” and “Renewable” (nominal / nameplate / baseplate) capacity numbers changed during 2025 is a completely separate issue. – “Renewables” — AKA “Wind + Solar” — has indeed steadily increasing both in absolute and percentage terms since (at least) 2019, but it is nowhere near overtaking “Coal”, let alone (completely) replacing it in China’s electricity mix. – Just because “demand growth” may have been “covered by renewables” in 2025 doesn’t mean all of the CO2 emissions from “Coal” electricity generation are going to drop to “Net Zero” anytime soon (“carbon neutrality before 2060“, according to China’s latest NDC). If wind and solar are so cheap, why would China build new coal plants? Because wind and solar can’t build themselves? 😎 you have obviously never been in China. I have been to every large city there. In winter it can be anything from -15 in Bejing to -30 in the north. It was snowing in Afshan when we were there, and Harbin was just a HUGE SMOG of burning coal. Coal is used for heating and electricity generation in China and with the EVs and heat-pumps+no wind or solar (cos of the smog and windless nightsm etc) they just need more and more electricity from all forms of reliable fossil fuels. And of course the Chinese Communist Party is above bribing parts of The Green Blob to favor Chinese interests. And if you believe that, I have a surefire investment in voodoo acupuncture for you. China energy.. Wind and solar are basically a very small afterthought.. You haven’t spent much time in China, have you? Drown it in soy sauce, and everything tastes the same. Just like snake tastes like chicken, crocodile tastes like chicken, lizards taste like chicken, etc etc. And now the chicken doesn’t taste like chicken. 😉 I was in China a decade, or so, ago, visiting auto plants. At one, we were given lunch in the same cafeteria as the workers. The only item on the menu was some kind of stew. It had a meat of some sort it. It tasted like nothing I had ever eaten before, and certainly not like chicken. I quietly covered my plate with a napkin and ate nothing there at all. I never found out what it was and didn’t ask. I thought it likely was dog. It takes about 3 weeks to get used to Soylent Green. It may well have been cat. It could have been cats or bats (from Wuhan). Actually none of those taste like chicken, and yes, I do know. The Chinese term for dog meat translates to “sweet meat.” I was talking about that: Trump repeats baseless claim about Haitian immigrants eating pets Those re not baseless claims, it was happening and still is, also eating cats and wild geese caught in parks and on ponds/creeks. But hey! Just lie some more, liar, its all you got. All of this has been debunked. Your lies endanger people that are a hard working part of their communities. Hope you are proud of yourself. Haitians are fine people- like everyone else- all most of us want is that if they come to America, it’s done legally. Actually, no. The Haitians Biden Admin fast tracked into America are the ones who f*cked up what government Haiti had and stole every penny the Clinton Foundation didn’t steal. Same with Somalians Biden and Obama Admins prioritized into America. Democrat Party stands with their fellow America hating criminals worldwide. I am, because you keep proving yourself to nothing more than a liar. Good job, buddy. The thoroughly discredited MyUsernameReloaded and all of his baseless claims, all offered without evidence, have been authoritatively debunked throughout media and academia, so much so that no person with a degree from an accredited institution accepts any of his lies. PS Just thought I’d “argue” on his level. -MSK Yes, you are a massive liar. We already know that. They are eating dogs – in China and Haiti. Your holy cows are someone elses food. That’s something you western white fagots can’t even imagine let alone fathom. Kim Iverson ( Vietnamese origin) had some funny jokes about Vietnamese people eating dogs in the USA. The fact that you are such a corrupt hypocrite does not change reality. It is an exaggeration. Trump’s public speech usually loose and hyperbolic. Most people understand that. When will you learn? Very nice Eric. It is a lie that CO2 can cause catastrophic runaway global warming. It is a lie that we must stop using fossil fuels. It is a lie that wind and solar can replace fossil fuels. People give China far too much credit, the only reason they are behaving the way they are is because they are considered a developing country rather than a developed country. They have nothing to lose by net zero and everything to gain. Every nation needs to adopt policies that are best for them without demanding welfare from the developed countries. It is that simple. The renewable backlash will only gain steam going forward. Now that it’s OK to question CC people will start listening to its’ facts and follies. The media will have no choice but to get on board with the ‘new’ narrative or risk losing their already dwindling audience. Ho hum another day another Great Leap Forward with triple somersault and full pike- Shared solar: Labor’s “free power” plan to have daily cap to stop abuse by EV and home battery owners Minister Bowen was naturally uber excited to ejaculate the wonder of free power from the sun whereas the pesky trogs hanging it all together were busy reminding him to do no macro harm as usual with gushing ministerial pronouncements. Particularly as middleclassville had concentrated all the subsidised Teslas solar panels and the latest in massive home batteries in their leafy burbs leaving a paucity of same in struggletown and the mortgagee nappy valleys. That’s hilarious 🙂 Male privilege- The rational capability to suffer life’s universal vicissitudes without blaming other various genders and sundry identifiers. Male privilege = build 99% of everything you can see in a picture of any town. Pay for it with way higher job related injury and mortality rates, while all the lazy unproductive people with liberal arts spit at you from their moral high ground and while the Ladies get the well paid administrative jobs. I still have to see my 1st female roofer,street or bridge constructer or at least a vintage photo of a female building a skyscraper. Solar panels on home rooftops is said to cost 3-4x more than having panels in a grid scale solar farm But in order to get grid scale solar 24/7 you need 3x more panels than equivalent base load fossil fuel (i) supply when sun is shining (ii) supply the batteries needed for the supply when its dark (iii) supply the system when its low sun or cloudy (iv) cost of the battery storage Theres goes the cheap energy when this the infrastructure required . Its much worse when the power needed isnt a sunny part of the country. Solar is like fast food- its only cheap when you need while out and about, not when its for 3 meals a day So, what you are saying is solar is a failure. Should have just opened with that. But he provided the analysis – full marks. Vastly better than the oh so sensitive arm waving. “Top business leaders issue an expletive-laced message” Practical interpretation: technical team could not provide slides with good numbers. Yes. It’s just like you can’t make a cake with dog turds. It’s cooking. It’s fine to leave them “in the mix” though. You will hardly even notice them after a while. If President Trump’s successor is not equal to the challenge of continuing the Trump energy abundance agenda, and companies like BlackRock start manoeuvring for trillions of dollars of re-instated green subsidies a Democrat, 2029 will feel like 2021 all over again. Will at least the autopen be solar powered to make some sort of difference? sarc I loved it when Trump told the Stupid People at Davos that only Stupid People buy windmills! All the Stupid People who buy windmills were sitting in the audience. I love his blunt language. It’s long over due. The ultimate reality check. 😎 He learned a lot about politics his first term but he’s still NOT a politician. That’s a good thing! “… and yet I haven’t been able to find any windfarms in China.” Well? Did find a collapsing bridge, and a bunch of collapsing buildings. They make buildings with “tofu dregs”. And a collapsing dam? Well, at this point it is just sorta mobile-ish. But you can find solar “farms” that cover entire mountain sides- up and over the top- for which I see no environmentalists complaining about loss of habitat, loss of biodiversity, loss of “green space”, loss of soil protection, etc. But it’s all for “The Cause” so it’s OK. Mr Kapur? You are SOOOO canceled. Now more invitations to hobnob with the glitterati. And I hope you don’t have teenage daughters, they are going to be SOOOO cross with you for embarrassing them by actually telling the truth. 😉 When the CEO said “I’m an engineer” it was clear that he knew it was worth mentioning. That’s why he said it. He knew that technical knowledge distinguished himself from (most) business leaders attending from Europe. Our business leaders rise through finance, law or (worst of all) sales. They just don’t understand the physical limitations that their industries are constrained by. It’s one of the reasons why Europe’s economy has fallen behind the USA and Asia since China joined the WTO. The lure of AI is like a vaccine to stop all the crazy aspects of Climate Change. It may not eliminate the disease entirely but it has the potential to render it harmless…… “…the world’s most viewed climate website” – Fred Pearce The Climate Files: The Battle for the Truth about Global Warming “…invaluable” – Steven F.

Title: Friday, January 23. Russia’s War On Ukraine: News And Information From Ukraine

Full Content:
ByKatya Soldak, Forbes Staff. Dispatches from Ukraine. Day 1,430 Zelenskyy Rebukes Europe At Davos January 23, the final day of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, brought Ukraine neither breakthroughs nor fresh commitments from allies, only bold statements. The most important moment for Kyiv was a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Both leaders described the hour-long meeting as “constructive.” Afterwards, Trump emphasized that the war must stop; meanwhile, Zelenskyy, whose arrival in Davos remained in doubt until the last moment due to the acute energy crisis in Kyiv — caused by Russia’s bombing the energy and heating infructrtucture on the coldest week of the winter — used the meeting to underline Ukraine’s need for air-defense missiles to shield its battered energy system. The talks generated no agreements on postwar economic recovery or security arrangements that had been under discussion in recent weeks, as they were clouded by Trump’s aggressive rhetoric about Greenland. Meanwhile, media outlets had expected Ukraine and the U.S. to sign a plan worth possibly billions of dollars, but the agreement was put on hold. Zelenskyy later delivered a pointed speech in Davos, aimed at Europe. In blunt language, he warned that Europe’s internal divisions were a strategic weakness, accusing European allies of failing to “take the lead in defending freedom.” He called Europe a “fragmented kaleidoscope of small and middle powers” that seemed “lost” as it tried to induce Trump to force Russia to end the war. “Instead of taking the lead in defending freedom worldwide, especially when America’s focus shifts elsewhere, Europe looks lost,” Zelenskyy said. After his speech, Zelenskyy presented estimates of Russian military losses. According to cited figures, Russian monthly casualties have doubled over the past year, to about 36,000. Zelenskyy attributed the increase in casualties to the effectiveness of Ukrainian drones, a priority of Ukraine's new defense minister, Mykhailo Fedorov. Russia’s cumulative losses, he claimed, now surpass 1.2 million personnel, roughly a fifth of which have occurred since last June. The Kremlin, however, effectively absorbs these losses through monthly conscription of 40,000-43,000 troops. Zelenskyy also announced a trilateral meeting involving Ukraine, the U.S., and Russia, the first such meeting in years, to be held in the United Arab Emirates on January 23. Meanwhile, U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff has arrived in Moscow to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin. Ukraine In Davos The annual Ukrainian Breakfast in Davos, hosted by the Victor Pinchuk Foundation, centered this year on Ukraine’s EU integration and reconstruction. The January 22 discussion brought together European leaders, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. A special guest at the Ukrainian Breakfast was Steve Witkoff, US Special Envoy to the Middle East, and the US negotiator on the Ukraine peace process. He shared updates on the progress in peace negotiations: “I think that we have made a lot of progress,” he said, “We spent the whole dinner last night talking about the upward trajectory for the Ukrainian economy and financial system... The President (Trump) talked about a tariff-free zone for Ukraine, that I think will be game-changing, and you’ll see the industry moving into that area,” he added that he’s headed to Moscow later that day to continue the negotiations with Putin and his government. A recurring theme was how to push Russia toward a peace settlement on terms acceptable to Kyiv. Finnish President Alexander Stubb said Europe and the U.S. might soon converge on a peace plan for Ukraine. In his opinion, however, it was questionable whether Moscow would accept such a plan, and the war would end only if accompanied by further military support for Ukraine. The debate over using frozen Russian assets to finance Ukraine's postwar reconstruction, estimated to cost roughly $524 billion, exposed divisions among European countries. Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever, a skeptic of direct confiscation and fearful of legal action from the Kremlin, reiterated that any such disposition must comply with international law. Still, he acknowledged that Russian assets should play a role in rebuilding Ukraine once a peace settlement is reached. Regarding Ukraine’s European track, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Taras Kachka expressed the opinion that Kyiv would be fully integrated into the EU energy market by 2027, even without formal membership. EU Commissioner Marta Kos supported that assessment, noting that Ukraine has completed most of the reforms required for accession. Nonetheless, Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said Ukraine’s path to the EU would take several years. Speakers also highlighted Ukraine’s role in defense innovation, particularly in drone warfare. Even with generous reconstruction funds, however, Ukraine’s success is not guaranteed. Referring to what he described as well-designed reforms, Larry Fink said that “Ukraine’s future will depend on whether it can establish strong governance … and integrate itself more deeply into the European and global capital markets.” A January 21 panel, “The Role of the United States in the World,” examined Europe’s security amid shifting U.S. priorities. Former U.S. special envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg shared optimism for future negotiations but warned against trading Ukrainian territory for a ceasefire. He argued time favors Ukraine if it can withstand winter, and that Europe, with U.S. support, could deter Moscow. Russian Attacks Russia launched a sweeping attack overnight on January 20. Although Ukraine's Air Force reported intercepting 27 missiles and 315 drones out of 342 projectiles, the mega-strike, which targeted Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, left half of Kyiv without electricity amid bitter cold. Zelenskyy said the attack employed “updated tactics” and included missiles produced this year. The strikes came just days after Ukraine received a new batch of air-defense missiles, which, Zelenskyy said, limited the damage. In addition, Ukrainian officials reported at least 14 civilians killed and nearly 80 more wounded in Russian strikes in the previous three days in the Kherson, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Sumy, Donetsk, and Dnipropetrovsk regions.

Title: 'We're going to let VR be what it is and what it does great,' says Meta execs regarding Quest changes

Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth went on a series of interviews this week, detailing what's next for Meta Quest headsets, VR gaming, and the company's quest for the Metaverse. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. In a move that will have lots of Meta Quest gamers screaming "HALLELUJAH," Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth announced that the company would be paring back its investments into the VR version of Horizon Worlds, a Roblox-like metaverse, and focusing its efforts on smartphone gamers, instead. Meta is even removing Horizon Feed from headsets starting with the next Meta Quest software update, v85. Bosworth went on several interviews this week at Davos, a World Economic Forum summit, detailing Meta's next steps for its Reality Labs division. Last week, Meta laid off 1,500 Reality Labs staff and announced the closure of most of its first-party development studios without any official announcement, causing speculation that the company was done with VR. Bosworth told Axios, "we had this integrated concept of where Horizon and VR were the same thing....That is a real challenging piece of work to land. There's lots of people who put this headset on for different reasons. You want to support all those different use cases. The lack of focus comes at the expense of user experience and a great expense at development cost." Nearly two years ago, Meta made moves to more deeply integrate Meta Quest headsets with the company's Horizon Worlds metaverse. The Meta Quest store became the Meta Horizon store, and free-to-play Horizon Worlds content was prominently placed in front of users instead of more traditional gaming content. The result was a substantial decline in game sales on the Quest, backed up by tons of developer data to prove it. Many on social media are saying the changes are too little, too late. Several development studios have announced closures lately, some citing broader challenges across the video game market, while others have attributed them specifically to the VR market. Even developers of games that regularly stay in the top-20 best-sellers have announced layoffs. Allegedly, more are also on the way. "We're going to let VR be what it is and what it does great," Bosworth continued. "We're going to focus a lot more on the third-party content library and ecosystem that has developed there." But according to several interviews I conducted after Meta's studio closures on January 13, 2026, Meta let go of several staff who worked with third-party developers and reduced funding to programs like Oculus Publishing. Bosworth wasn't asked about this topic in either of the Davos interviews, but has so far failed to comment publicly when asked on social media. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Heath's interview with Bosworth revealed that Meta is "still continuing to invest heavily in this space, but obviously, VR is growing less quickly than we (Meta) hoped." We saw this trend begin in mid-2025, although the Christmas holiday period saw the Meta Quest outsell even the Nintendo Switch 2 on Amazon. Even with that success and the success of several new games, Meta looks to be shifting priorities away from first-party development. As Palmer Luckey, founder of Oculus, said on social media, "Oculus had a strong internal mandate to NOT be Nintendo and instead build things that build the ecosystem. Returning to that is good." "This is not a disaster," Palmer followed up with. Meta "still employs the largest team working on VR by about an order of magnitude. Nobody else is even close."

Title: Ethereum Emerges As Likely Candidate In BlackRock Tokenization Vision – Here’s Why

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Recent remarks from BlackRock CEO Larry Fink have pointed toward the need for a single, unified blockchain for tokenized markets, and have intensified the focus on platforms capable of handling institutional-scale liquidity, compliance, and settlement. With its long track record in smart contracts, extensive developer ecosystem, and growing role in regulated financial products, Ethereum is now emerging as the most likely candidate to serve as the settlement layer for tokenized capital markets. In an X post, the Ethereum Daily shared a video in which BlackRock CEO Larry Fink made it clear that tokenization is necessary. Speaking at the World Economic Forum, Fink said the financial system must move rapidly toward digitization, adding that a single, common blockchain could reduce corruption and improve transparency across the global markets. While Fink did not name a specific network, the most plausible candidate could be ETH, based on BlackRock’s own initiatives and public statements that emphasized the role of ETH in asset tokenization. The firm has consistently highlighted ETH as a core platform for its on-chain strategy. Meanwhile, BlackRock launched its BUIDL tokenized money market fund directly on ETH, a product that has already grown to over $2 billion in total value locked. “There’s no second best,” Ethereum Daily noted. In the staking space, Bitmine has turned Ethereum staking into a multi-billion-dollar business. An analyst known as Milk Road has revealed that the company now has 1.83 million ETH staked, worth roughly $6 million at current prices, and plans to scale that figure toward 4.2 million ETH over time. Over the past months, Bitmine Immersion Technologies Inc. (BMNR) has accounted for nearly 50% of all new ETH entering the staking queue. Staking at this scale is important because it removes ETH from the liquid supply and locks it into long-term infrastructure rather than keeping it for short-term trading. When one player is willing to commit billions of dollars worth of ETH to staking, it reflects confidence in ETH’s future economic prospects. A lower liquid supply, combined with sustained network demand, will create structural pressure over time. Analyst Milk Road has also highlighted that Ethereum is holding near a critical support zone around $3,000, hovering just above the lower boundary of its long-term rising structure, an area that has acted as a stress test for ETH throughout the cycle. Historically, when ETH drifts into this area, the market will need to decide whether the weakness is temporary or structural. The $2,750 level remains the key line because it has repeatedly stopped downside pressure after macro-driven or narrative-driven pullbacks, making it a reliable floor for the broader trend. As long as ETH holds above that level, the broader multi-year uptrend will remain intact. My name is Godspower Owie, and I was born and brought up in Edo State, Nigeria.

My name is Godspower Owie, and I was born and brought up in Edo State, Nigeria. I grew up with my three siblings who have always been my idols and mentors, helping me to grow and understand the way of life. My parents are literally the backbone of my story. They’ve always supported me in good and bad times and never for once left my side whenever I feel lost in this world. Honestly, having such amazing parents makes you feel safe and secure, and I won’t trade them for anything else in this world. I was exposed to the cryptocurrency world 3 years ago and got so interested in knowing so much about it. It all started when a friend of mine invested in a crypto asset, which he yielded massive gains from his investments. When I confronted him about cryptocurrency he explained his journey so far in the field. It was impressive getting to know about his consistency and dedication in the space despite the risks involved, and these are the major reasons why I got so interested in cryptocurrency. Trust me, I’ve had my share of experience with the ups and downs in the market but I never for once lost the passion to grow in the field. This is because I believe growth leads to excellence and that’s my goal in the field. And today, I am an employee of Bitcoinnist and NewsBTC news outlets. My Bosses and co-workers are the best kinds of people I have ever worked with, in and outside the crypto landscape.

I am also very good at singing, dancing, acting, fashion and others. I cherish my time, work, family, and loved ones. I mean, those are probably the most important things in anyone's life. I don't chase illusions, I chase dreams. I know there is still a lot about myself that I need to figure out as I strive to become successful in life. I’m certain I will get there because I know I am not a quitter, and I will give my all till the very end to see myself at the top. I aspire to be a boss someday, having people work under me just as I’ve worked under great people. This is one of my biggest dreams professionally, and one I do not take lightly. Everyone knows the road ahead is not as easy as it looks, but with God Almighty, my family, and shared passion friends, there is no stopping me.

Title: The System Is Starting To Crack – Home Prices Plummet As Silver Hits $100 And Gold Closes In On $5,000

The Economic Collapse Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression? There are all sorts of signs that the relentless pressure that has been causing an enormous amount of stress on our financial system is starting to break things. Do you remember how bad things got in 2008 and 2009 when home prices fell dramatically? Well, as you will see below, it is beginning to happen again. Meanwhile, the price of silver and the price of gold both just keep setting brand new record high after brand new record high. That is music to the ears of many of my readers, but for large financial institutions that are holding enormous short positions that has the potential to be absolutely catastrophic. I think that we will be shocked by how violently things start to break loose in the financial system in the months ahead. For decades, those that pull the financial strings in the western world were able to keep the price of silver and the price of gold within ranges that they considered to be acceptable. But now everything has changed. A year ago, nobody was predicting that the price of silver would hit $100 and the price of gold would nearly reach $5,000 in just 12 months. But that is precisely what has occurred… Silver prices rose above $100 an ounce ​for the first time ever on Friday, while gold hit another record en route ‌to $5,000/oz as investors pile into safe-haven assets amid geopolitical turmoil and on expectations for U.S. interest rate cuts. The price of silver is up more than 200 percent over the past year. When there are swings of this magnitude, there are really big winners and really big losers. I think that the identities of the really big losers will start to be revealed soon, and this will shock the financial world to the core. In previous articles, I have gone over many of the reasons why the price of silver has been skyrocketing. But there is one more theory that I wanted to throw out there today. Zero Hedge is reporting that demand in China is “off the charts”, and not too long ago the Chinese implemented severe restrictions on silver exports. Could it be possible that China is purposely attempting to destabilize the western financial system? The Chinese know that there are very large institutions that have massive short positions, and if they can force those institutions to fail that would cause enormous chaos in the U.S. and Europe. If that really is their motive, that would explain a lot. It is very interesting that silver has hit $100 at the exact same moment when gold is almost reaching the $5,000 milestone. Both of those marks are key psychological thresholds, and nobody is quite sure what is going to happen next… Gold approaching $5,000 and silver approaching $100 represent more than incremental price advances. These levels function as psychological thresholds where attention concentrates, behavior changes, and market structure briefly dominates narrative. In market terms, these prices act as an event horizon. The concept is borrowed deliberately. In physics, the event horizon marks the point beyond which outcomes are no longer observable in advance. In trading, it marks the price level that forces participation. Opinions polarize, positioning compresses, and conviction gives way to reaction. These numbers draw in new participants on both sides of the market. Buyers include momentum participants who believe higher prices are inevitable, as well as short positions forced to cover under pressure. Sellers include long holders who have never experienced these prices and view the opportunity to monetize as both rational and psychologically satisfying. Selling silver at $100 or gold at $5,000 carries narrative weight regardless of future direction. Some are convinced that these key psychological thresholds will propel gold and silver to new heights. Others are convinced that these thresholds will act as “ceilings” and gold and silver will start bouncing in the other direction. We shall see what happens. As I write this, the price of silver has just hit $102. I am looking at that number and I can see that it is real, but I am still having a hard time believing it. It is truly difficult to comprehend the pace at which things are now changing. As precious metals soar, home prices all over the United States are starting to fall precipitously… Florida, Texas and California are now firmly at the center of America’s housing crash – accounting for 12 of the 14 major metro areas where home prices are falling. The sharpest drop was recorded in Dallas, TX, where median sale prices slid 7.6 percent from a year earlier. Florida’s once-red-hot housing market is also cracking, with prices falling in Miami, Jacksonville, Orlando and Fort Lauderdale. California has four declining metros as well, including Oakland, with the second-biggest drop of 5.6 percent, San Jose, Sacramento and Los Angeles. On the one hand, this is good news because home prices had become wildly unaffordable. But on the other hand, if home prices fall too rapidly that will be a very bad thing. Let’s not forget what happened during 2008 and 2009. When housing prices crashed, millions of mortgages were suddenly underwater and foreclosures went through the roof. In previous articles, I have talked about the fact that the number of foreclosures was way up last year. If we are on the leading edge of another giant tsunami of foreclosures, that will be absolutely disastrous for our banking system. Meanwhile, pending home sales just dropped “to the lowest level for any December on record”… Pending home sales, which track the number of contracts signed in December, plunged by 9.3% seasonally adjusted from November, to the lowest level for any December on record in the data by the National Association of Realtors, which goes back to 2010. Compared to December 2010, during the Housing Bust, pending sales were down by 21.5%. The market is now well into its fourth year of the collapse in transactions, and there has simply been no improvement. That is a really bad sign. Unfortunately, demand is likely to continue to be weak for quite some time because we continue to see mass layoffs all over the nation. For example, Amazon is gearing up for another round of layoffs which could end up being the largest in the entire history of the company… Amazon is planning to cut thousands of jobs as part of a broader push to eliminate nearly 10% of its corporate workforce, according to Reuters. After initially cutting roughly 14,000 white-collar jobs in October, Amazon is expected to launch a second round of layoffs impacting a similar number of employees, with an overall target of about 30,000 jobs, although the scope may change, according to two sources cited by Reuters. If fully realized, the cuts would amount to the largest layoffs in Amazon’s history, surpassing the roughly 27,000 jobs the company cut in 2022. So many good paying jobs are being lost. And this is the worst time since the Great Recession to find a new good paying job. In so many ways, it is starting to feel like 2008 all over again. Earlier today, I heard from a reader that explained that my articles really resonate with him because of what he has been going through. That meant a lot to me. I know that so many of you are really struggling right now. I want you to know that it isn’t your fault. Decades of incredibly bad decisions by our leaders have brought us to this point, and now the entire system is starting to fail. We should have fundamentally transformed the system after the Great Recession, but we didn’t. Instead, our leaders chose to inflate all of the old bubbles even larger than before, and now we have a colossal mess on our hands.

Title: Business Leaders Suddenly Fearful as Anger Surges Over AI Replacing Human Jobs

Time Published: 2026-01-23T20:02:45Z

By Joe Wilkins Published Jan 23, 2026 3:02 PM EST It’s an agonizing time for the labor market in the US, where unemployment is on the rise and wages are stagnant. Though there’s raging debate over what degree of blame AI holds for the sorry state of the job market, one thing’s for sure:workers are growing increasingly furious with the tech, which they perceive as undercutting what little job security they had. Business leaders, as a result, are becoming anxious about the blowback — even as they rhapsodize about the coming AI revolution. At the World Monetary Fund summit at Davos, for instance, International Monetary Fund managing director Kristalina Georgieva launched into a talk on AI by calling it a “major factor for economic growth.” “We see potential to up of 0.8 percent boost to growth over the next years, but it is hitting the labor market like a tsunami, and most countries and most businesses are not prepared for it,” she fretted. Her anxious comments come after a year of dramatic layoffs and hiring slowdowns, in which major firms have often pointed at AI. Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff, for example, said in September that he’d cut 4,000 customer support jobs because he “needs less heads” thanks to automation. In October, Amazon initiated its largest round of layoffs ever, slashing 14,000 office jobs while citing AI as a major factor. It should come as no surprise to those same business leaders that John Q. Public is growing increasingly angry over the narrative that AI is taking its jobs. In its Global Talent Trends 2026 report flagged by CNBC, the analytics firm Mercer found that shop-floor concerns about AI-fueled job loss have surged from 28 percent in 2024 to 40 percent in 2026. The firm’s research also found that 62 percent of employees feel their leaders underestimate the psychological and emotional impact of AI. And why shouldn’t they? Executives have spent the last year bragging about the supposed AI revolution, rhetoric they’ve used to game enough investment dollars to fundamentally alter the US economy. Workers, in turn, shouldn’t be blamed for taking their lead — though in today’s economy, it seems they’re the only ones expected to pay the price.

Title: These Two Charts Sum Up the AI Stock Rally in 2026

Artificial intelligence is once again fueling a scorching tech stock rally, but the rising tide is notably not lifting all boats. Shares of companies making memory and data storage devices soared in the first weeks of 2026, fueled by a shortage of the hardware essential to training and running AI models. Sandisk (SNDK) stock has doubled in value in less than a month, while Western Digital (WDC) and Micron (MU) have each gained more than 30%. They’ve been joined by semi caps, the firms whose products enable the design and fabrication of the chips powering the AI revolution. Lam Research Corp. (LRCX) stock was up more than 25% as of Thursday's close, followed closely behind by Applied Materials (AMAT) and KLA Corp. (KLAC), each up nearly 20%. The AI rally has been the driving force behind the stock market for more than three years. But the AI trade has repeatedly shape-shifted, with investors bidding up certain sub-sectors and industries as new bottlenecks in the AI infrastructure buildout emerge. Then there’s Intel (INTC), one of the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 this year. Wall Street is betting that investments by the federal government and AI king-maker Nvidia (NVDA) will help the storied chipmaker turn things around after years of trouble. The stock plummeted on Friday after the company issued a disappointing outlook for the current quarter, reminding investors that the turnaround they seek will be “a multiyear journey,” in the words of CEO Lip-Bu Tan. On the flip side are software stocks, beaten down by concerns that artificial intelligence is more threat than opportunity at the moment. Software giants like Intuit (INTU), ServiceNow (NOW), Adobe (ADBE) and Salesforce (CRM) are among the worst-performing stocks in the S&P 500 this year. Investors are worried AI-native start-ups are poised to take share from enterprise software incumbents whose deployment of AI agents has moved slower than expected. AI is also seen as a threat to the seat-based pricing model that helps make software-as-a-service companies stable and profitable. Investors are also down on software stocks because most of the industry isn't profiting from AI nearly as much as "pick-and-shovel-makers" like Nvidia—at least not yet. Software executives can attribute small profit margin gains to AI-driven efficiency, but investors are more excited to hear Micron say its high-bandwidth memory chips are sold out through this year because of AI demand. Digital marketing software company Applovin (APP) is one of the few exceptions. The stock soared more than 700% in 2024 and doubled in value last year, because of strong revenue and earnings growth that executives attribute to its AI-powered platforms. (Several short-sellers attribute the meteoric growth to shady practices.) Applovin stock's previous gains are a big reason it's the S&P 500’s worst performer this year. Investors have taken some very profitable chips off the table amid a slump driven by software pessimism and, earlier this week, more allegations Applovin's platforms facilitate illegal activity. The stock was down 22% heading into Friday’s session.

Amazon is reportedly preparing to announce thousands of corporate job cuts next week, Reuters is reporting today. The company already laid off 14,000 corporate employees in late October, and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy hinted at the time that more job cuts would be coming due to “efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” Reuters previously reported in October that Amazon was planning to get rid of 30,000 corporate workers in total, and this new round of layoffs is expected to affect AWS, retail, and HR units. Amazon had already laid off 27,000 employees at the beginning of 2023 to adjust to the post-pandemic era. “Jobs in the company’s Amazon Web Services, retail, Prime Video and human resources, known as People Experience and Technology, units are slated to be affected, the people said, though the full scope was unclear. The people cautioned that the details of Amazon’s plans could change,” the Reuters report reads. Amazon currently employs over 1.55 million employees worldwide, with approximately 350,000 corporate jobs before the first round of layoffs was announced in October. As Jassy previously said, Amazon is all-in on generative AI and agents, and the exec encouraged employees to “use and experiment with AI whenever you can” and learn “how to get more done with scrappier teams.” Laurent is a Senior News Editor at Thurrott.com.

Title: The AI Energy Supercycle: Striving to Secure 24/7 Power Infrastructure

January 23, 2026 13:35 ET | Source: Equity Insider Equity Insider VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Jan. 23, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Equity-Insider.com News Commentary – The global push for Artificial Intelligence is colliding with a considerable physical bottleneck: the power grid is struggling to keep up with data centers' explosive demand[1]. As facilities transform from passive consumers into active energy partners, the market appears to be shifting focus toward assets that can deliver reliable, around-the-clock baseload power. With the U.S. government committing billions to revive domestic uranium enrichment to fuel both current reactors and next-generation modular systems[2], the industry is seeing an unusual wave of activity as institutional capital is beginning to flow toward the companies anchoring this new energy foundation, including Spring Valley Acquisition Corp. II (OTC: SVIIF), Oklo Inc. (NYSE: OKLO), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: META), NANO Nuclear Energy (NASDAQ: NNE), and Ucore Rare Metals (TSXV: UCU) (OTCQX: UURAF). While renewable energy capacity continues to expand globally, the intermittent nature of wind and solar means they currently have trouble powering the high-performance AI superclusters that require constant, firm energy. This reality has turned energy security into a strategic mandate, with new policy frameworks appearing to treat the nuclear fuel supply chain as vital national infrastructure rather than just another commodity. Consequently, the industry seems to be entering a systemic re-rating phase as the Western world races to secure the physical assets required to help power a digital-first economy. Spring Valley Acquisition Corp. II (OTC: SVIIF), a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) recently announced a pending merger with uranium miner Eagle Energy Metals, a next-generation nuclear energy company with the largest mineable, measured and indicted U.S. uranium deposit. Following the announcement, Eagle Energy Metals announced that it has engaged BBA USA Inc., a consulting firm with over 45 years of energy sector experience, to design a targeted drilling campaign at its Aurora Uranium Project in support of an eventual Pre-Feasibility Study. The timing matters because following the SPAC merger, the company is heading toward a NASDAQ listing, subject to customary closing conditions, under the ticker symbol NUCL. Notably, the team orchestrating this transaction is the same SPAC team that brought NuScale Power Corporation (NYSE: SMR) public in 2022. Eagle Energy Metals holds rights to what it describes as the largest open pit-constrained, measured and indicated uranium deposit in the United States. The Aurora deposit sits on the Oregon-Nevada border with 32.75 million pounds of indicated uranium and 4.98 million pounds inferred, based on over 500 drill holes. Adjacent to Aurora is the Cordex deposit, which has seen over 100 holes drilled and offers potential resource expansion as the company digitizes existing data. "We're seeing sustained demand for nuclear power translate into real demand for uranium, particularly for projects located in the U.S.," said Mark Mukhija, CEO of Eagle Energy Metals. "Advancing Aurora with BBA is about making sure this asset is ready to meet that demand as the market continues to tighten." The domestic supply situation provides context for the company's positioning. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, in 2023, U.S. utilities purchased more than 50 million pounds of uranium, with less than 5% obtained from limited domestic production and over 95% sourced from abroad, including significant amounts from Russia and Kazakhstan. President Trump recently signed four executive orders aimed at removing regulatory barriers and seeking to quadruple U.S. nuclear power over the next 25 years, while invoking the Defense Production Act to secure domestic uranium supply. Meanwhile, electricity demand is accelerating as AI, quantum computing, and cryptocurrency operations strain global grids. Meta recently announced plans to build a $10 billion AI data center in Louisiana powered by nuclear energy from Constellation Energy, while Microsoft, Amazon, Oracle, and Nvidia have struck major deals to power their operations with nuclear. Beyond uranium, Eagle Energy Metals also holds rights to exclusive Small Modular Reactor (SMR) technology. With BBA's technical continuity (they authored Aurora's SK-1300 Technical Report Summary in August 2025), existing infrastructure, and access to low-cost hydropower in a mining-friendly jurisdiction, the company is advancing its asset as domestic uranium supply becomes increasingly prioritized. Oklo Inc. (NYSE: OKLO) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: META) have announced an agreement supporting development of a 1.2 GW nuclear power campus in Pike County, Ohio, to supply clean energy for Meta's regional data centers including its AI supercluster in New Albany. The agreement provides a mechanism for Meta to prepay for power and fund project advancement for Oklo's Aurora powerhouse deployment on 206 acres of land formerly owned by the U.S. Department of Energy. "Two years ago, Oklo shared its vision to build a new generation of advanced reactors in Ohio. Today, that vision is becoming a reality," said Jacob DeWitte, CEO of Oklo. "Meta's funding commitment in support of early procurement and development activity is a major step in moving advanced nuclear forward." According to the company, pre-construction and site characterization are slated to begin in 2026, with the first phase targeted to come online as early as 2030. "Our agreement with Oklo enables the development of 1.2 gigawatts of nuclear energy in Southern Ohio, supporting Meta's operations in the region—including our AI supercluster in New Albany," said Urvi Parekh, head of global energy at Meta Platforms. "By investing in baseload nuclear energy, we're helping build a resilient and sustainable future for our communities." The scalable powerhouse facility plans to expand incrementally to deliver the full 1.2 GW target by 2034, creating thousands of construction and long-term operations jobs. NANO Nuclear Energy (NASDAQ: NNE) announced that it has signed a memorandum of understanding with Ameresco to explore deploying its advanced modular microreactor technologies on federal and commercial sites across the United States. The collaboration will evaluate potential pathways for siting, development, construction, licensing, operation, and eventual decommissioning of NANO Nuclear's nuclear modular microreactors including KRONOS MMR, ZEUS and LOKI MMR systems. "This MOU marks another milestone for NANO Nuclear as we continue to build customer demand for our approach to delivering reliable, modular nuclear microreactor energy systems in support of the United States' energy transition," said Jay Yu, Founder and Chairman of NANO Nuclear. "Working alongside Ameresco, a leading U.S. publicly traded energy infrastructure company, gives us the opportunity to test our advanced, patented microreactor technologies against real-world requirements at scale, across both federal and commercial levels." Following comprehensive assessment of regulatory and financial considerations, stakeholder engagement, site suitability and utility interconnections, Ameresco and NANO Nuclear expect to enter specific agreements under which Ameresco would lead engineering, procurement and construction activities for sites using NANO Nuclear's systems. The companies plan to coordinate on government funding and available incentives as the initial assessment advances. Ucore Rare Metals (TSXV: UCU) (OTCQX: UURAF) announced updates on advancements for its RapidSX™ rare earth element separation technology commercialization and its USD$22.4 million U.S. Department of War Other Transaction Agreement through the U.S. Army Contracting Command-Orlando. Ucore reported that, since December 2023, it has completed approximately 5,700 hours of REE processing with tonnes of heavy mixed rare earth oxides in an automated 24-hour per day commercial production environment at its Kingston, Ontario Commercialization and Demonstration Facility, dedicated to transitioning the RapidSX™ technology to its under-construction Louisiana Strategic Metals Complex in Alexandria. "The nearly two years of CDF demonstration work undertaken by Ucore has been done with deliberate coordination with the Louisiana SMC production roll-out pathway," said Mike Schrider, P.E., VP and COO of Ucore. "The result is a technically proven and de-risked commercialization pathway to commence heavy rare earth processing in Louisiana in 2026." The company has produced multiple rare earth element groups and products including TbDy, Tb, and Dy, demonstrating 2 to 4 times faster throughput over conventional solvent extraction methods. Full commercial-scale Louisiana SMC work is underway for the installation of RapidSX™ Machine #1 in mid-2026.

Image: Amazon Amazon is reportedly set to launch a second round of job cuts next week as it works toward a goal of trimming 30,000 corporate employees. According to a report from Reuters, this new wave could begin as early as Tuesday and is expected to be similar in scale to the 14,000 white-collar roles eliminated this past October. Sources familiar with the matter say the reductions will likely impact units including Amazon Web Services, retail, Prime Video, and human resources. The total reduction represents nearly 10 per cent of the company’s corporate workforce. While Amazon employs over 1.5 million people, the majority work in fulfillment centres and were not targeted in this specific round of cuts. While internal documents previously tied the October cuts to the power of artificial intelligence, CEO Andy Jassy later suggested the move was about fixing company culture. Jassy told analysts that the firm had developed too many layers of bureaucracy and management. Despite this, Jassy has noted that AI efficiencies will likely continue to shrink the corporate headcount over time as routine tasks become automated. This downsizing marks the largest layoff period in the company’s three-decade history, exceeding the 27,000 jobs cut in 2022. For those let go in the previous wave, a 90-day grace period on the payroll is scheduled to expire this Monday.

Title: Gates Foundation plans to give away $9 billion in 2026 to prepare for the 2045 closure while slashing hundreds of jobs

Conventional wisdom tells us all good things must come to an end. And that’s what the Gates Foundation is preparing for. Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates told Fortune first about their plans to shutter their $86 billion charitable foundation in 2045. (French Gates is no longer part of the foundation, having stepped down in 2024 from her role following the couple’s divorce. She now runs her own foundation, Pivotal Philanthropies, focused on gender equality and global health.) This year, the Gates Foundation will spend a record $9 billion and cut as many as 500 staff jobs during the next five years as the world’s largest private foundation plans to shutter. The foundation’s motivation for its move is to accelerate giving to global health, poverty, and education, helping beneficiaries take ambitious bets now rather than maintaining operations indefinitely. These moves underscore how one of the defining philanthropic institutions of this century is reconfiguring for its sunsetting era. The Gates Foundation’s move to spend down raises questions about who will fill its proverbial shoes. Perhaps it will be a figure like MacKenzie Scott, the philanthropist and ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who has donated $26 billion to thousands of organizations in just the past five years. The Gates Foundation’s board approved the largest budget in its 25-year history at $9 billion, a decision coming less than a year after Gates said the institution would close its doors by Dec. 31, 2045, and spend down roughly $200 billion over two decades. As part of the Giving Pledge, Gates has promised to give away about 99% of his fortune, calling the accelerated timeline a response to “pressing” global problems that can’t wait for traditional giving procedures. The foundation has already distributed more than $100 billion since its inception, becoming a dominant funder in global health, vaccines, and antipoverty work, and an outsize player in U.S. K-12 education. The board also approved the foundation’s recommendation to increase the budgets of several programs for this year, ranging from women’s health to AI in U.S. education. To hit its 2045 deadline while increasing its grantmaking, the Gates Foundation will cut up to 500 of its roughly 2,375 staff positions by 2030—about 20% of its headcount—through attrition and layoffs, according to a Jan. 14 press release. The board also approved a cap on operating costs, limiting overhead such as salaries, infrastructure, facilities, and travel to no more than $1.25 billion, or roughly 14% of the total budget. “While progress is possible, it remains fragile, and delivering on our mandate requires a commitment to move forward with transparency for our employees and partners and disciplined stewardship of the foundation’s finite resources,” Mark Suzman, CEO of the Gates Foundation, said in a statement. He added that the reductions will be gradual and reviewed annually, rather than a one-time wave, as the organization shifts more dollars from operations into grants. Gates’ decision to sunset the foundation firmly places it in the “time-limited” camp, which is starting to gain traction among other modern mega-donors who argue that hoarding capital in perpetuity doesn’t work in today’s society. One other example is Scott, who has already donated $26 billion since 2020 to thousands of charities and has repeatedly helped organizations facing federal funding cuts. In 2025, Scott issued three lifelines to organizations in the aftermath of federal funding cuts, including a $45 million gift to the Trevor Project, an LGBTQ+ youth crisis organization. “This historic donation from MacKenzie Scott comes at a time when the Trevor Project has never needed it more,” Jaymes Black, CEO of the Trevor Project, said in a statement shared with Fortune. “LGBTQ+ youth in the U.S. are facing a growing mental health crisis, and the resources they have for support continue to be politicized and jeopardized.” In 2025, Scott also made a $60 million donation to the Center for Disaster Philanthropy just as the Trump administration moved to slash the budget of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), an organization Americans rely on for help during and after hurricanes, wildfires, tornadoes, and floods. Scott also donated $80 million to historically Black college Howard University—a gift that came at an “opportune time,” helping the HBCU weather a federal government shutdown that delayed annual appropriations supporting student success, research, and hospital donations. Scott is also a prime example of someone in the billionaire class who is actively attempting to share as much of her wealth as possible instead of holding on to it forever. For nonprofits focused on global health and development, the Gates announcement is a double-edged sword. It means more money will be disbursed in the near term, but it also sets a firm expiration date on one of the organizations they rely on the most. Many of the foundation’s biggest bets—from vaccines and disease eradication to agricultural innovation—often require long lead times and coordination with governments and other organizations. This raises the question of what happens after 2045. As the Gates Foundation continues its 20-year shutdown process, pressure will grow on peers, like tech billionaires and next-gen heirs, to either step in to help or face questions of why they’re not doing enough. French Gates recently said there’s more the ultrawealthy can do. While more than 250 of the world’s wealthiest have signed the pledge, many have so far failed to live up to it. “Have they given enough? No,” French Gates said in an interview with Wired published in December. “We’re trying to demonstrate for them: Go big. You can go big, you can go bold.”

Title: 2026 layoffs news: Which companies are planning job cuts as Amazon is set to trim workforce? Check details

With just over 20 days into 2026, several companies are already planning job cuts. Major companies, including Amazon, aim to cut thousands of corporate jobs across various divisions, potentially marking its largest layoffs yet. Ericsson plans to eliminate 1,600 jobs in Sweden to stay competitive, while FedEx will cut 500 jobs in France but also create new positions. Citigroup and BlackRock have announced significant layoffs. Here's a list of companies planning layoffs recently — E-commerce giant Amazon is set to cut thousands of corporate jobs next week as part of its workforce reduction strategy, Reuters reported on 22 January, citing two people familiar with the matter. These layoffs, possibly the company's largest, are expected to affect white-collar roles across divisions such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), the People Experience and Technology unit (human resources), Prime Video, and retail. However, the report indicated that the plans might change. Telecom equipment manufacturer Ericsson, earlier this month, announced plans to cut up to 1,600 jobs in its home country of Sweden, a move aimed at maintaining the company's competitive position, the firm said in a press release. The company expects to continue laying off employees as part of its cost-cutting and restructuring efforts, CEO Borje Ekholm said on Friday. “You have seen that we have reduced the headcount, for example, by 5,000 over the past year, and we expect to continue reducing headcount going forward,” Reuters quoted Ekholm during a post-earnings call. On Friday, US parcel delivery company FedEx announced a strategic overhaul of its French domestic operations, including a plan to cut up to 500 jobs and invest about 78 million euros ($91.58 million). FedEx plans to streamline its internal structure by cutting its station count from 103 to 86. This move aims to simplify the distribution network and eliminate unnecessary infrastructure across the country. Although job cuts are part of the plan, the reorganisation is also expected to create over 770 new full-time and part-time roles. FedEx stated that employees affected by layoffs would be given priority consideration for these new positions. Banking giant Citigroup is expected to lay off approximately 1,000 employees this month as CEO Jane Fraser aims to reduce costs and boost returns. The current round of job cuts at Citigroup is part of the company's plan, which was announced two years ago, to eliminate 20,000 jobs by the end of 2026, according to a Bloomberg report citing people aware of the development. The Metropolitan Opera of New York announced a round of layoffs on Tuesday as it struggles financially, despite having implemented other significant cost-cutting measures over the past five years, according to a report by The New York Times. Met announced additional cost-cutting measures, including salary reductions for its highest-paid employees and delaying a new production scheduled for the upcoming season. According to the report, the opera house will reduce its administrative staff by 22, decreasing the total from 284 to approximately 262, which is about 10% of the division's workforce. BlackRock earlier this month said it will fire hundreds of employees across the company, Bloomberg reported. According to a report citing people familiar with the development, BlackRock will lay off about 1% of its workforce, or about 250 employees across divisions.

The Shareholders Are Hungry: They must feast on livelihoods! And bones! And they demand more! More! More! Amazon is planning to cut thousands more corporate jobs next week, according to a report by Reuters. Back in October, Amazon trimmed 14,000 jobs. The plan, supposedly, has been to cut around 30,000 jobs. Why? Not because of artificial intelligence, or earnings, but "culture," as per CEO Andy Jassy. Too many people? Too much bureaucracy. Sorry, tech brethren. Save the Date: Sound Transit is going to announce when it's going to open its Crosslake Connection and knit together the spine of the 1 line with the east side 2 line. They'll make that announcement at 10 a.m.—which is in the future at the time of this writing. I will update this if I remember. Two Hikers Dead on Mount Rainier: Two backcountry hikers on Mount Rainier were reported missing earlier this week. Rangers found them, both dead, on Wednesday. Timber: A falling tree on Lena Lake Trail in the Olympics hit and killed two women in their 70s. ICE Out Act: Down in Olympia, Rep. Tarra Simmons, D-Bremerton has introduced a bill that would bar anybody who became an Immigrations and Customs Enforcement officer during Donald Trump's second term from ever becoming a law enforcement officer in Washington. "I don’t want people that are trained in that culture to come and infiltrate our culture," Simmons said. Rep. Shaun Scott, D-Seattle, is the only other sponsor of the bill. The Weather: Another crisp, sunny day. Meanwhile, seemingly everyone else in the country is going to get rocked by a dramatic winter storm. Texas and Oklahoma are preparing for snow! The storm will stretch from the southern Rockies up through New England. You know who is not included in that? Us. It's so lonely in this mild winter. Though, maybe I should be grateful. Dozens of states have issued states of emergency in advance of the oncoming storm. White House Uses AI-altered Photo as Propaganda: The Justice Department arrested demonstrator Nekima Levy Armstrong for the crime of interrupting a church service in St. Paul, Minnesota because of the pastor's alleged ties to ICE. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted a photo of Armstrong's arrest to X. In it, Armstrong looked calm, composed, stoic. Later, the White House posted its own photo showing Armstrong open-mouthed sobbing, tears streaming down her face. The picture was manipulated with generative AI tools. In a response to questions about the doctored photo, Kaelan Dorr, the deputy communications director for the White House, said, “Enforcement of the law will continue. The memes will continue.” This is the first example I’ve seen of an American government using AI to meaningfully misrepresent actual events with the intent to deceive the public. We are at Stalinesque levels of propaganda. donmoynihan.substack.com/p/past-the-b...[image or embed] There's a Big Game This Weekend: The Seahawks will play in the NFC Championship game in Seattle on Sunday. As the old adage goes: Fuck the Rams. Minnesota on Strike: The Day of Truth & Freedom general strike is on in Minnesota this Friday. To protest the ICE killing of Renee Good, Minnesotans are participating in a "no work, no school, no shopping" blackout. It's been endorsed by the Minneapolis City Council. Businesses around the state are shutting down in solidarity. The demands of the action are simple: ICE needs to GTFO, Jonathan Ross—the agent who killed Good—needs to be held accountable, Congress needs to stop federal funding for ICE, and there needs to be an investigation into the agency's actions. JD Vance Pins Blames on Minnesota Officials: Vice President, expectant father, and couch lover JD Vance told the press that the one thing that would "lower the temperature" in Minnesota is if local officials cooperated with federal law enforcement by "helping ICE identify and arrest violent criminals so that the operation could be more targeted," as The Guardian reports. In fact, the federal government suspects Minnesota officials are conspiring to impede federal efforts in the state. The US Justice Department subpoenaed local officials like Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz this week to investigate these conspiring claims. Walz called it "political theater." Good's Autopsy: Renee Good's autopsy—which was commissioned by her family—showed she was shot four times. Once in the forearm, once in the right breast, and once in her head near the left temple. That bullet exited through the right side of her head. She also sustained a graze wound. Why the fuck did that man shoot her at close range four times? Everyone Has a Role in Resistance: A Minnesota man offered up his screen printing talents and studio to help stand up to ICE. You don’t know your role yet maybe, but we are all finding out just what we have to offer. In Minneapolis, one man knew immediately what he could offer and said “Bring me your clothing”.[image or embed] Deuces: Trump has officially pulled the US out of the World Health Organization since the organization is, as he says, "straying from its core mission." That's surely a sign of our country's good health, right? Good News for Brainrot: TikTok finalized a deal to create an American entity, a move that circumvents the national security concerns that threatened a ban of the app. US investors in the new joint venture include Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX. President Donald Trump praised the deal, thanked China's President Xi, and said he hopes, "that long into the future I will be remembered by those who use and love TikTok." Hell Is Also Elsewhere: Wildfires are raging in Chile. They've gobbled up record 45,700 hectares of forest which is the equivalent of a 176 square miles. The fires have killed 21 people so far. While firefighters are trying to stop the blazes, people are trying to hurt them. There have been two attacks on firefighting brigades—one of which included gunfire (it's unclear why they were attacked). Plus, arsonists are having a field day. At least 70 people have been arrested for setting or attempting to set new fires this fire season. A Food Review: Have you seen the ads for the new Applebee's cheeseburger sitting open-faced in a pile of cheese? This man has. "The O-M-Cheeseburger, the purest distillate of Americana yet produced." Queer Bait: The straight ex-hockey player brothers behind the hockey podcast "Empty Netters" are in hot water after publicly praising the steamy gay hockey show Heated Rivalry but bashing it in private. Their episodes praising Heated Rivalry have hundreds of thousands of more streams than their regular content. The hosts, realizing the grift at their disposal, started hawking Heated Rivalry t-shirts. Too bad they actually hate the show. A Song for your Friday: Marty Supreme gave me a new appreciation for this song. Sad that the soundtrack was snubbed from the Oscar nominations, but ya can't win 'em all, right? Which is probably one of Marty Supreme's themes. Nathalie Graham has reported on everything from Seattle City Hall to underwater hockey for The Stranger.

Title: Apple turning to Intel for future iPhone chips, analyst reaffirms

Multiple reports have indicated that Apple is turning to Intel for future iPhone chips. Now, analyst Jeff Pu is out today with a new research note once again affirming an upcoming partnership between the two companies. In December, Pu reported that Intel will start producing chips for Apple’s non-Pro iPhone models starting in 2028. In a research note seen by 9to5Mac today, Pu says that Intel has a “solid external customers pipeline” for 14A, which is the company’s 1.4nm-class process technology. Among the companies in that pipeline are Apple, AMD, and Nvidia. “We reiterate our expectation of potential order-wins such as Apple’s SP SoC and NVDA/AMD’s x86 server chips,” Pu says. Ming-Chi Kuo has also reported that Intel will “begin shipping Apple’s lowest-end M processor as early as 2027.” This would presumably be the base model M7 chip, which could be used in select iPad and Mac models. Under this arrangement, Apple will still develop and design its own iPhone and Mac processors in-house. The difference is that, instead of exclusively using TSMC to manufacture those chips, Intel would come aboard as an additional partner. This is not a return to Intel chips powering the Mac (or the iPhone). What do you think about Apple and Intel reuniting for iPhone and Mac chips? Let us know down in the comments.

by Heide Lazaro Freepik/Reddit Company success should be shared with the entire organization. The following story involves a man working at a small company. The company proudly announced it reached tens of millions in revenue. Because of this, all employees will be getting some sort of “reward.” Read the full story below and find out more. This should be short and sweet. The company I work for proudly announced that it made tens of millions of pounds in revenue this year. We exceeded our revenue goals by millions. We’re a small company with less than 100 employees. This man learned that he and his colleagues will be getting an Amazon gift card. Yesterday, our office manager proudly announced that we’d all be getting a £25 Amazon gift card. I’ve heard of these things happening. I even joked during the revenue announcement that the layoffs would be next. I still didn’t think the ironic skinflint move would happen to me. Wow! What a tempting reward! lol Let’s see how others reacted. We live in a sad, greedy world, says this one. Short and simple. Finally, this one got a blanket and a chocolate. Nothing says “we smashed our goals” quite like a gift card that barely covers lunch. If you liked that story, check out this post about an oblivious CEO who tells a web developer to “act his wage”… and it results in 30% of the workforce being laid off.

When Amazon cut 14,000 corporate jobs in October, it warned that more layoffs were coming in 2026. According to Reuters, that round is set to begin next week and, once again, will sweep away thousands of jobs. The exact number of job cuts in the latest round is unclear, but sources tell Reuters it could be on par with the last round as part of Amazon’s broader plan to eliminate 30,000 corporate jobs. Departments expected to take a hit include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Prime Video, human resources, and retail. Although 30,000 represents a small portion of Amazon’s 1.58 million global workforce, it accounts for 10% of its corporate staff, the report adds. Most other employees work in warehouses and fulfillment centers. In October, CEO Andy Jassy argued that the layoffs weren’t driven by financial struggles or AI development. “It’s culture,” he noted. However, Beth Galetti, head of HR at Amazon, said in a memo to employees that "This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the internet, and...we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business." In a June memo to workers, meanwhile, Jassy warned that generative AI and AI agents would change the way people work at Amazon. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company,” he added.

More important than its effect on my fragile feelings, though, selling a stock short always comes with significant risk. The potential losses when you short a stock are literally infinite.

Then there is something that I have mentioned here before: if a price looks “wrong” to you, it is far more likely that you have missed something than it is that the entire market has got it wrong and you are right. Still, with all that said, I believe there is one very popular energy stock that should be shorted at current levels…Bloom Energy (BE). If you are a regular reader and have a long memory, you might remember that seven months ago, in June of last year, I recommended buying Bloom. I said then that their on-site fuel cell type generators stood out from the competition for a few reasons, and that they would appeal to companies building server and data centers as an alternative to depending on America’s somewhat creaky electric grid. That opinion has obviously become more mainstream, based on what has happened to BE since I wrote that piece… Back then, BE was trading at around $20, a far cry from the $150 that it touched this week. I said in June that buying and holding the stock for a few years might be smart, but I really didn’t see it jumping this far, this fast. That has come as the company has consistently beaten estimates for everything: EPS, revenue, and growth. On that basis, and given the potential that is still there, the move up makes sense. However, looking at the numbers, it seems to have gone too far, too fast. Growth stocks often have high P/Es, but BE’s trailing multiple of just under 1,900 is way beyond high. I get it, they are growing, but not that quickly! For context, Amazon (AMZN), probably the ultimate growth stock that went on to dominate multiple industries and sectors, has a historical high P/E of 563 in December of 2015. The forward P/E looks a little more reasonable, at around 175, at least until you realize that that is after just about every analyst that covers the stock has scrambled to raise their estimates significantly. My overall view of BE’s prospects hasn’t changed that much since June, but do you really think that they will turn out to be three or four times more dominant or more profitable than Amazon on a comparative basis? I guess they could, but it is unlikely, to say the least. Even if they eventually do, that is a long way off, and current pricing suggests that it is imminent. This is a case of one stock becoming the poster child for a compelling investment theme…powering the AI transition and getting massively overbought as a result. So, having bought at just above $20 back in June, I am now selling, and not just squaring up my position. The move is so overdone that I am actively shorting BE as well, even though it goes against both my nature and my learned risk aversion. To access this exclusive content...

Title: BitGo kicks off what could be a huge year for IPOs
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/23/bitgo-kicks-off-huge-year-ipos/
Time Published: 2026-01-23T14:20:26Z
Full Content:
UPDATED 09:20 EST / JANUARY 23 2026 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof In the first big initial public offering of 2026, the crypto platform BitGo shot out of the gate fast as initial trading jumped 25% over the offering price. Investors took a deep breath later, but the stock still rose almost 3% on the day — which means it raised about as much as it could. John Furrier covered it like a glove from the NYSE floor, including many interviews with BitGo and its partners. More IPOs could be coming too, not just from crypto companies such as Kraken and Ledger, but from artificial intelligence bellwethers such as Anthropic and OpenAI, Elon Musk’s Starlink and (maybe!) data giant Databricks. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang thinks that not only is there no bubble in artificial intelligence, but we actually need even more investment. 👀 Well, at least for now, most people agree, in particular investors who continue to plough plenty of dough into both AI chipmakers such as Furiosa AI, Upscale AI and AheadComputing, and all the AI companies that will need them, such as Anthropic, Humans&, China’s Moonshot AI, inference startup Baseten, Databricks and more. No slowdown in 2026, that’s for sure. If you want to know what’s coming in data and AI this year, don’t miss the latest Breaking Analysis from Dave Vellante and his panel of data experts. There’s a whole lot here, but one takeaway is that the agentic AI era will make data all the more important — in particular contextual data, meaning intelligence — and the cost of not doing it right will be steep. Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin is looking to take on Elon Musk’s Starlink with an enterprise-focused ultra-fast satellite internet play called TeraWave. Competition is good. After watching its stock keep rising for much of the past year thanks to AI infrastructure demand and government help, Intel stumbled a bit with its latest earnings — in particular its guidance, which came in light. Next week brings some big earnings reports: Microsoft, IBM, Apple, Meta, Samsung, SAP, ServiceNow, ASML, Tesla and more. Here’s all the enterprise and emerging tech news this week from SiliconANGLE, theCUBE Research and beyond: 2026 data predictions: Scaling AI agents via contextual intelligence Nvidia CEO says AI needs more investment in defiance of bubble fears (per WSJ) OK, Jensen… but it’s pretty apparent this is some kind of a bubble, which means winners and losers. Anthropic boss Dario Amodei slams Trump over ‘crazy’ decision to sell advanced AI chips to China CEOs say AI is making work more efficient. Employees tell a different story (per Wall Street Journal) Palantir CEO says AI will eliminate the need for mass immigration Some of these tech titans are just kind of weird, or maybe just opportunistic.

Title: Amazon layoffs: Which departments will get affected as e-commerce giant cuts jobs?

US-based tech and e-commerce giant Amazon is planning a second round of job cuts next week, as part of its broader goal of trimming its workforce by 30,000, according to news agency Reuters. In October last year, the company slashed around 14,000 white-collar jobs, which accounted for roughly half of Amazon's 30,000 target. This time though, the total layoffs are expected to be roughly the same as last year and could begin as soon as Tuesday, the agency report said. The reduction in roles will impact multiple departments across the Jeff Bezos-owned company. This marks one of the major layoffs happening at the start of the new year, indicating that last year's job-cut spree has continued into 2026. The mass layoffs are expected to impact employees who are serving in the company's Amazon Web Services, retail, Prime Video and human resources divisions, known as People Experience and Technology, said people aware of the development, although the full scope remains unclear. The sources further cautioned that the plan is not yet final, and the details could change, the agency reported. The full 30,000 jobs would represent a small portion of Amazon’s 1.58 million employees, but nearly 10% of the company's corporate workforce. The majority of Amazon’s workers are employed in fulfillment centers and warehouses. This move would also mark the largest layoff in Amazon’s three-decade history. The last time it trimmed such a massive number of jobs was in 2022, where around 27,000 employees were affected. During the job cuts in October, the online retailer cited the rise of artificial intelligence software as a key reason for the decision. However, CEO Andy Jassy later told analysts during the company’s third-quarter earnings call that the reduction was “not really financially driven and it’s not even really AI-driven.” Jassy also noted that “it’s culture,” meaning the company has too much bureaucracy, referring to the layoffs. “You end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers,” he added. He had said earlier in 2025 that he expected Amazon’s corporate workforce to undergo a reduction over time as a result of efficiencies gained from the integration of AI in its workforce. Corporations are rapidly integrating AI into their software development lifecycles, moving beyond simple code autocompletion to adopting autonomous AI agents that can plan, execute, and debug code. This shift is driven by the need for increased productivity, cost reduction, and faster outputs, according to multiple reports.

January 23, 2026 08:27 ET | Source: AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. Chicago, Jan. 23, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- According to recent data from Astute Analytica, the global food safety testing market was valued at US$ 21.24 billion in 2024 and is projected to hit the market valuation of US$ 44.74 billion by 2033 at a CAGR of 8.63% during the forecast period 2025–2033. The food safety testing market is being propelled forward by a pressing and sobering reality: the high incidence of foodborne illnesses worldwide. In the United States alone, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that one in every six Americans falls victim to foodborne illnesses each year. This translates to roughly 48 million cases annually, with devastating consequences that include approximately 3,000 deaths. Request Sample Pages: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/request-sample/food-safety-testing-market The widespread prevalence of foodborne illnesses has galvanized regulatory agencies and industry leaders alike to intensify their focus on food safety. Regulatory bodies have responded by enforcing stricter standards and mandating comprehensive testing protocols designed to detect contaminants at every stage of the food supply chain—from production and processing to distribution and retail. Cutting-Edge Technologies Reshaping Food Safety Testing Technological advancements in food safety testing methodologies are revolutionizing how contaminants are detected, dramatically improving both accuracy and efficiency. Among the most impactful innovations are DNA-based techniques and rapid testing methods, which have transformed traditional testing paradigms. These state-of-the-art approaches enable food safety professionals to identify pathogens and chemical hazards with unprecedented precision, often delivering results within hours rather than days. DNA-based testing methodologies, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next-generation sequencing (NGS), have become indispensable tools in the fight against foodborne illnesses. By targeting the genetic material of pathogens, these techniques offer highly specific and sensitive detection, capable of identifying even low levels of contamination that might elude conventional methods. Rapid testing technologies complement DNA-based methods by providing quick and dependable results directly at points of production or distribution. Techniques such as immunoassays, biosensors, and portable diagnostic devices empower food producers and regulators to conduct on-site testing with minimal delay. This immediacy allows for real-time decision-making and swift corrective actions, reducing the likelihood of contaminated products reaching consumers. Contract Research Organizations: Pillars of the Food Safety Testing Ecosystem Contract Research Organizations (CROs) have become indispensable players in the global food safety testing market, serving as specialized partners that address the complex and evolving needs of the food industry. By 2024, over 1,000 CROs worldwide will be providing a wide spectrum of food safety testing services, highlighting the industry’s growing dependence on these expert third-party providers. CROs cater to a broad range of testing requirements, adapting to the multifaceted challenges of modern food production and distribution. As food supply chains become increasingly global and intricate, the demand for precise and timely testing has surged. These organizations bring specialized expertise and advanced technologies to the table, enabling food companies to comply with stringent safety regulations and respond rapidly to potential contamination risks. A striking example of the CRO sector’s growth and sophistication is Boston University’s high-throughput clinical testing laboratory, which processed an impressive 45,000 food and clinical tests weekly in 2024. This achievement underscores the widespread adoption of automation and high-capacity testing systems within the industry. Such innovations enable CROs to deliver faster, more accurate results, meeting the urgent need for speed and precision in food safety testing. Microbial Testing: The Cornerstone of Food Safety Microbial testing holds a commanding 36% share of the global food safety testing market, reflecting its critical role in detecting and preventing foodborne illnesses. As pathogens continue to spark high-profile food recalls, the importance of microbial analysis has only deepened. In 2024, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that contaminated foods were responsible for 600 million illnesses and 420,000 deaths worldwide, underscoring the urgent need for rigorous microbial surveillance and intervention. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) exemplifies this heightened vigilance, processing a record 1.2 million microbial assays in 2024—an increase of 140,000 samples compared to 2023. This surge highlights the expanding scope of microbial testing as a frontline defense against harmful pathogens. Across Asia, similar momentum is evident: Japan’s Ministry of Health conducted thorough examinations of 880,000 consignments following a Listeria outbreak in frozen vegetables, demonstrating rapid response capabilities. Technological advancements have profoundly transformed microbial testing, with rapid molecular tools like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays becoming fundamental to routine inspections. Thermo Fisher Scientific’s shipment of 5.4 billion PCR reactions worldwide in 2024 is a telling indicator of this trend—enough to screen every kilogram of exported meat twice over. These molecular techniques enable faster, more precise detection of pathogens compared to traditional methods, allowing for quicker interventions and reducing the risk of contaminated products reaching consumers. Data-Driven Revolution: Transforming Food Safety Risk Assessment The integration of data-driven methodologies is reshaping the landscape of food safety risk assessment, marking a pivotal shift in how professionals identify, evaluate, and mitigate potential hazards. Traditional approaches are giving way to sophisticated technologies that leverage advanced data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence (AI). These tools process massive datasets drawn from diverse sources—ranging from historical testing records and supply chain logistics to environmental monitoring and even social media trends—providing a holistic view of food safety risks. The power of machine learning and AI lies in their ability to uncover complex patterns and correlations within seemingly unrelated data points, turning raw information into actionable insights. These technologies facilitate continuous learning and adaptation, improving risk assessments over time as new data flows in. Consequently, food safety professionals can make more informed decisions, prioritize resources effectively, and minimize the likelihood of foodborne illnesses. North America: A Vanguard in Food Safety Testing and Recall Management North America continues to lead the global food safety testing market, driven by a stringent regulatory framework and a proactive stance on managing food recalls. The United States, under the combined oversight of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), managed an estimated 296 to 300 food recalls in 2024. These recalls were predominantly triggered by undeclared allergens and contamination from pathogens such as Listeria, Salmonella, and E. coli—hazards that pose significant risks to public health. Parallel to the U.S., Canada’s Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) issued 89 food safety advisories within the same timeframe, reflecting a similarly vigilant approach to protecting public health. These advisories demonstrate the region’s commitment to early detection and swift response to potential food safety threats, reinforcing North America’s reputation for rigorous oversight and consumer protection in the food supply chain. The regulatory environment in North America is characterized not only by aggressive recall management but also by the widespread adoption of advanced food testing technologies. While annual assay volumes remain confidential, the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) alone performed more than 1.2 million laboratory tests on meat, poultry, and egg products in 2024.

Title: Ericsson layoffs: CEO Borje Ekholm says telecom giant to continue job cuts amid 5G market woes

Swedish telecoms equipment maker Ericsson expects to continue laying off employees as part of its ongoing cost-cutting and restructuring efforts, CEO Borje Ekholm said on Friday. “You have seen that we have reduced the headcount, for example, by 5,000 over the past year, and we expect to continue reducing headcount going forward,” Ekholm was quoted as saying in a post-earnings call by Reuters. Earlier this year, Ericsson announced plans to cut up to 1,600 jobs in its home country of Sweden, a move aimed at ensuring the company's competitive position, the firm said in a press release. These cost-saving measures have helped the company maintain profitability and deliver strong earnings, even as telecom operators continue to witness sluggish demand in the global 5G equipment market. In mid-January, Ericsson submitted a notice to the Swedish Public Employment Service, stating that approximately 1,600 positions could be impacted in the country. It also initiated negotiations with relevant trade unions. The telecom equipment maker has been working to cut costs and improve margins in recent years. The company struggled with weak demand, as anticipated carrier spending on 5G technology did not meet expectations, Mint reported earlier. Ericsson has been steadily reducing headcount over the last three years to maintain profitability as it grappled with 5G spending slowdown and the widespread impact of sweeping US tariffs. In 2023, the company announced a global plan to cut 8,500 jobs, equivalent to 8% of its workforce. The reductions have continued since then, with the company axing hundreds of staff in Spain and Canada last year. Ericsson is not the first company to reduce its headcount, as at least five other major companies have also announced layoffs in January this year, reflecting a broader trend of cost-cutting across the corporate sector. The job-loss trend that companies struggled with the previous year seems to have continued into the new year as well. Earlier, BlackRock said it planned to cut hundreds of jobs this month, after Meta announced it would cut 10% of its workforce in the Digital Labs division. Meanwhile, a Bloomberg report also said Meta's job cuts are expected later this week, citing people familiar with the matter. Banking major Citigroup is also about to lay off around 1,000 employees this week as CEO Jane Fraser seeks to control costs and improve returns at the company, Mint reported. In a more recent instance, Amazon also announced that it plans to slash around 30,000 white-collar jobs by next week. It said the layoffs may impact AWS, HR, Prime Video and retail segments of the company. However, the plans may still change, said a Mint report.

It wasn’t long ago that Witkoff and Kushner were in negotitions with the Russians when suddenly out of the blue they brought up the subject of a few thousand acres owned by Blackrock which they were very concerned about. This is at best a peripheral topic and yet they wanted this sorted out on behalf of Blackrock and forget negotiating ending the war. Amateurs. “No diplomatic breakthrough”? I’m shocked! Shocked! / ;) I second that comment. They send the bird of a business feather K. Dimitriv to talk with them.

It’s 2026 and… If the WHO now concedes, as the letter urges, that airborne transmission is central and that respirators are materially superior, then every state that continues to permit surgical masks as default clinical protection exposes itself to claims that it is breaching its duty of care to healthcare workers and patients alike. The implications under European human rights law are immediate. I think I can hear Lambert Strether clearing his throat. Storm tips: also fill the bathtub for washing and flushing toilet. Fill largest pots/teakettles etc with water for drinking. Good tips. Also, if you kitchen or bathroom sinks are against an outside wall of your house keep a tiny thin stream of water running and open the under sink cabinet doors to let house heat warm the pipes. This keeps the those water pipes from freezing up and possibly bursting. Don’t forget to stock up on supplies for any cats and dogs that you have. And if push comes to shove, they make great hot water bottles for your bed. If you have a camp stove, but couldn’t get the standard green bottles of camp stove propane before it sold out, propane “torch” canisters work exactly the same and were, at least yesterday, still in stock in the Richmond, VA metro region at both big box hardware stores and small scale hardware stores. She Criticized the Mayor’s Support for Israel on Facebook. Then the Cops Showed Up at Her Door. The Intercept ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Its so bad out there, the other day I was at a farmers market in Visalia and remarked to a seller in one of the booths that I didn’t really like Jerusalem Artichokes, and almost immediately out of nowhere was put in a choke hold by some goon using a yarmulke as an impromptu face mask and admonished that talk like that would not be tolerated anywhere in the land of the free and home of the brave. You aren’t that far off of reality despite the jest, which is the astounding thing. Everywhere one cares to look across the “West” it’s censorship and suppression of speech, all in the service of the genocidal state. The latest news re:TikTok “””sale””” is case in point, where supposedly it was sold but the valuation makes it essentially stealing from the Chinese: TikTok’s long-running US saga ends with a deal that averts a ban Vice President JD Vance, whose former firm, Revolution, participated in the deal, has said the new US venture is valued at about $14 billion. That figure marks the highest public estimate tied directly to government disclosures, although analysts previously placed TikTok’s broader US business – advertising, e-commerce, and live streaming – at between $35 billion and $50 billion. That’s some ‘deal’ right there…more like a NexPeria type heist, American-Israeli style. You will find the Western lamestream media stenographers keep dutifully claiming the sale was necessary for American national security, while the cabal behind the heist openly talk about why it was necessary for Israeli interests: (Dec 21 2025) Anti-Palestinian Billionaires Can Now Control What TikTok Users See The TikTok deal announced on Thursday poses a fundamental threat to free and honest discourse about Israel’s ongoing genocide of Palestinians in Gaza. Under the reported deal, the Chinese company that owns the short-video social media app, ByteDance, will transfer control of TikTok’s algorithm and other U.S. operations to a new consortium of investors led by the U.S. technology company Oracle. The long-gestating deal will give Oracle’s billionaire pro-Trump board members Larry Ellison and Safra Catz the power to impose their anti-Palestinian agenda over the content that TikTok users see. ….. Ellison and Catz have a documented record of supporting Israel and its military …. Catz, who stepped down as Oracle’s CEO in September, has also been quite blunt about the company’s ideological agenda. The Israeli American billionaire said while unveiling a new Oracle data center in Jerusalem in 2021, “I love my employees, and if they don’t agree with our mission to support the State of Israel then maybe we aren’t the right company for them. Larry and I are publicly committed to Israel and devote personal time to the country, and no one should be surprised by that.” The Ellison family has also brought his pro-Israel agenda to CBS News, where Larry’s son, David Ellison, recently installed anti-Palestinian ideologue Bari Weiss as editor-in-chief. …. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has made it clear that he understands the consequences of access to unfiltered social media. He recently described the sale of TikTok as “the most important purchase happening. … I hope it goes through because it can be consequential.” Netanyahu, who faces an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity in Gaza, sees control of TikTok as a part of Israel’s military strategy. “You have to fight with the weapons that apply to the battlefield, and one of the most important ones is social media,” he continued. The Netanyahu video in question, as noted by r/China watchers on reddit: Wow, Netanyahu blatantly discusses buying Tiktok for propaganda And an article on his comments to online ‘influencers’: TikTok sale could be ‘consequential’ for Israel, Jews, Netanyahu tells influencers Its so weird at present, that I expect gentiles will soon be required to wear a Star of David on their clothes, in order to not be singled out as an anti-Semite. Have things really changed? I remember visiting my sister in NYC almost 15 years ago when I said to her that Israel is an apartheid state. We were having lunch at the time in a restaurant and my sister reacted with almost panic. She looked around hurriedly, leaned over and said in an urgent whisper that I couldn’t say such things in NYC. She is not at all political but having lived there for a few years was already well versed in right speak. > We ran high-level US civil war simulations. Minnesota is exactly how they start The Guardian >> Minnesota may be the first test of whether constitutional limits on domestic military force still hold – or whether the United States is about to cross a line from which it cannot easily return. From The emergence of categorical norms: > Why do incursions on a territory of little strategic or economic significance (e.g., the Falkland Islands, or the disputed islands in the South China Sea) invite full-scale retaliation and risk war? Why do nations not retaliate only when the incursion is sufficiently meaningful? If retaliation is modeled as punishment in a repeated game, then punishment is incentivized by the need to deter similar transgressions, which involves coordination, namely on what counts as similar and what type of transgression will incur retaliation. Under these assumptions, it is not possible for retaliation to be triggered by the significance of the incursion–a continuous variable–but only by the presence of an incursion–a categorical variable. ICE has added a new harassment for violence observers: https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/ice-making-list-of-anyone-who-films just curious if any of y’all wonder the same thing – is this fascist push in Minnesota to actually incur an armed response to ICE in order to use the insurrection act and throw a wet blanket over 2026 elections??? re: The Monstrous Confessions Of Mark Carney – Nate Bear Thanks for that link. Very good. I’m left thinking of this old nursery rhyme: There was a crooked man, and he walked a crooked mile. He found a crooked sixpence upon a crooked stile. He bought a crooked cat, which caught a crooked mouse, And they all lived together in a little crooked house. agree with Nate and thankful for the succinct observation – i make it a point to keep my blood pressure down for medical reasons and do not listen to “leaders” speeches – a very close Chicago friend who is from Belgium and who disagrees often with me mentioned i should listen or at least read a text of his speech – i read a text and found it beyond disturbing at the admission of the criminal hegemony participated in and profited from – and that this mea culpa meant forgiveness? – there was no suggestion of solutions, just different partnerships as the good ship hegemony continues on its course – may Carney rot in a hell – although that’s a pipe dream, which reminds me i should pour some cognac and light a pipefull, sometimes it feels like the only way to stop shaking my head in disgust and disbelief – when my Belgian friend ask what i thought I asked her how the weather was in Chicago – Carney just another judas goat for the masses – https://www.agweb.com/news/livestock/beef/judas-goats-agricultures-bizarre-drug-addicted-masters-deceit-once-ruled-killing-floor The blood pressure thing is real; I find myself having to take a break from the news sometimes because it, and our so-called “elite” leaders, are simply rage-inducing, quite literally for me. The sheer criminality, and the increasingly dysfunctional natures of western society as it degrades and they don’t even bother to hide things anymore…it’s quite something. Take care out there. YESSSSSS – had an aortic valve replacement and take lisinopril to keep pressure under control I’ve never heard the word “historic” used to mean “what used to happen all the time” before. “This is all-time historic vintage cold” Meh. I remember January 1977 ,,, I was just a kid, but Buffalo went the entire month without getting above freezing, and the cold air pushed so far south that it snowed on Miami Beach. All-time would technically include pre-history, when humans weren’t around to record events, so yeah, that’s some bad headlining that needed an editor. Oh I’ve seen it all over the place, journalists being the parrots that they are. I honestly don’t get the mentality since they are surely aware and many presumably remember that such storms happened a lot more often 10 or 20 years ago. I remember in VA an icicle as thick as my head blocking the entire front door from opening. When I first moved to NYC a decade ago I remember multi foot snow, nothing remotely like that happens any more. I guess they just reflexively use such language to sell clicks but its irritating. I remember this. There was going to be an orange juice shortage. Fifteen year old me was horrified at the thought of losing a major component of my food pyramid. Stay warm, don’t leave your car under the canopy! I remember January 1977, had airdrifts piled up all the way into the mesosphere in LA. oh the humanity! I don’t think it was more than 10 years ago when we had a spell of winter weather where the temperature didn’t get out of the low single digits for a month, and below zero every night. I remember telling a friend about skiing in a 16 degree “heat wave” that practically felt like summer. I was a high schooler in rochester then and we were blanketed good but not as bad as buffalo I think. Cross country skiing to school was fun, once in a while some skeeching but watch out for those manhole covers. I had a 6 kid toboggan and we’d go to cobbs hill and it was the greatest. The funny thing I learned about that “blizzard” was that the actual snow fall total wasn’t that much… a few inches. The thing was Lake Erie was totally frozen over and the high winds picked up all that lite snow sitting on the ice and dropped it on western NY to accumulate there in feet! Lol, I’m sure to be mulling this over while I’m trying to thaw the kitchen pipes with my blow-dryer. @Amfortas, thinking you’re under this storm’s gun, don’t forget the rv antifreeze for the toilet. There is money to be made in middle class anxiety. Its why I don’t watch local news anymore. Probably one of the best movies about TV news (outside of Network) is Nightcrawler, starring Jake Gyllenhaal. Chilling to the bone… It’s what the world of Network has wrought. If you guys are wondering where all the heat has gone, we have it parked over here- https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2026/jan/23/intense-heat-across-south-east-australia-could-shatter-temperature-records-in-coming-days For people who either weren’t around then or have really short memories, Winter of 1977-78 enters the chat. In Kentucky, we were slammed by relentless amounts of heavy wet snow from basically the end of December into early February. I was in high school at the time and we missed from Christmas Break to around Valentine’s Day before roads were clear enough to go back to school. The station whose signal we could pick up the best had a weather person who was showing real signs of mental distress at having to give daily reports of more heavy snow and bitter cold. My parents’ house was out in the county and trying to keep our fairly long driveway shoveled enough for my dad to get in and out to get to work felt like something Sisyphus would appreciate. The road crew guys trying to keep the roads plowed no doubt felt the same. I remember other winters not quite this epic, but also very cold with lots of heavy snow through the 1980’s up to 2003 where we got insane amounts of ice instead of snow. I think we had something like 20 snow days in Buffalo that year. We were doing make-up days into late June. As a kid it was fun having entire weeks off from school. No darn virtual schooling, thank God! We also did make up days into mid to late June. Since I didn’t live in town, the remoteness was starting to wear thin by the time we got into February. They are totally out of control with the hype, at least for some areas. I’m in Rochester, NY and they are saying it’s going to be “Dangerously Cold” today. The high is 14 degrees. That’s not an uncommon temperature for January here. We’re forecast to be well above zero for the next week. It’s bad when it’s below zero for days and that’s not in the forecast. It’s basically click bate weather these days. I’ll give your weatherman a pass on this one because Rochester, NY has a world class university. There are probably many students, some of them freshmen, who are from milder or even tropical climates. They need the warning. I remember seeing a car load of students apparently from a southern locale in my uni town whose car got stuck in the snow on a bitterly cold, sub-zero, January day. 3 of them got out of the car to push it, and not one was wearing anything warmer than what I’d call a light windbreaker. Not a winter coat or caps and gloves in sight. I grew up in Michigan and moved to a warmer climate. It was years before I could leave the house without a jacket even on a nice day. It was in my bones that the weather could turn vicious with little notice. Yep. I’m sure you’ve seen this old cartoon. https://www.sikhu.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Weather-in-Michigan-Cartoon.jpg The Weather Channel naming snowstorms as if they were hurricanes was a major step backward for me. Locally, the models and actors posing as meteorologists on a local TV news outlet are collectively billed as “Stormwatch Team.” I thought, why not “Weather Watch Team”? Because we’re not supposed to be compelled by forecasts of nonviolent weather. This is weather porn. For Central Virginia, we are looking at something that could indeed be catastrophic. Temps in the 60’s are not uncommon in Richmond in January. Once or twice a year, we get a day that doesn’t get above freezing. What we have coming our way this weekend is on another level. It’s not the snow but the half inch to one inch of ice. That will put the power out for many, including my family, as a near certainty and make travel completely impossible between iced roads and fallen trees. But what is following the ice is what is so extraordinary. My local 7-10 day forecasts are not predicting a single day getting above freezing between now and next weekend. So a half inch of ice and power outages means thousands and thousands of homes with frozen pipes. For potentially a week. I know northerners scoff at highs in the upper 20s, but my home is not insulated for a week with highs in the twenties and lows in the single digits for a week steady. We have a heat pump; not gas or a furnace. I am much better set up for those days when it’s 102* in the sun. Now those oak trees that shade my home in July are major threats to my house on Sunday. So, please do spare a thought for some of us. My family is looking at some very very hard days ahead of us, despite all the preparations I have tried to make. A few things. If you expect the power out for several days charge up your phones. Buy some candles. But batterys for flashlights. Keep a weak stream of water running in all the faucets, if you’re a camper and have a portable tent (yes, this sounds silly but it works), set up the tent or improvise one out of blankets and clothes pins for sleeping quarters. Shared body heat is a real thing. Cook some food ahead of time that can be stored in the fridge and eaten cold. There’s one big Do Not. Do not use a kerosene or gas or bottled gas space heater. Carbon monoxide poisoning is a serious danger. Best of luck. To be clear: set up the tent inside your house, not outside. Use the living room for camping in the great indoors. / ;) Yes, ice storms are a different matter. Good luck with it. Prepare well. “Armada”, hmm, history often rhymes. In the headlines on the consumer electronics front (and a bit of a Japan economy watch) is that Sony is looking to offload the majority of its TV and home entertainment business to Chinese TCL: Sony is selling its home entertainment business to TCL – but what does this mean for future Bravia TVs? Sony and TCL have announced that they are moving forward with discussions to establish a joint venture between the companies, which will see TCL assume control of Sony’s home entertainment business. The partnership is in early stages, with both companies signing a “memorandum of understanding to confirm their intentions to establish a joint venture that will assume Sony’s home entertainment business”. … In a statement shared by Sony, it confirmed that the joint operation will “operate globally”, and will ensure that TCL oversees “the full process from product development and design to manufacturing, sales, logistics, and customer service for products including televisions and home audio equipment”. Sony’s press site says they want to have the joint venture up and running in 2027. As this is an MOU nothing is set in stone yet, but if it goes through it will be historic for the Japanese consumer electronics industry that even the mighty Sony wants to throw in the towel on television manufacturing, a sector that was once considered something of a crown jewel in consumer electronics. This would be like the equivalent of Apple selling off its desktop and laptop division. I thought Sony would have kept it going somehow purely out of pride; they aren’t bleeding money on the TV division like in years past, when Samsung and LG came on the scene and LCD flatscreens price wars blew up the market, but they probably aren’t making all that much selling TVs anymore because prices on television sets have fallen astonishingly over the past 25 years: TV prices have fallen more than 90% since 2000, thanks to mass scale Television prices have fallen faster than almost any other consumer product over the past 25 years, a quiet but striking shift in the economics of home electronics. A closer look at the trend reveals a mix of manufacturing breakthroughs, scale effects, and intensifying competition, as once-budget brands steadily close the gap with long-dominant players. Sony still makes some of the best tv’s you can buy (along with Panasonic, see Vincent’s 2025 shootout ) but it is an utterly cutthroat business with thin margins, as are most consumer electronics nowadays with hungry Chinese juggernauts coming up fast. Sony was #5 worldwide as of 2024 with a 5.4% market share, which actually is pretty decent given that they mostly sell premium TVs. Aside from Sony, there is still Panasonic and Sharp (and somewhat Toshiba?) left of the Japanese brands still making TVs, and even these are mostly outsourced to other companies now given the thin margins. Sharp (the entire company) was bought by Foxxcon a few years back because of heavy losses, and Toshiba has sold off it’s TV division as well as most of its appliance division to Chinese companies. They all have minuscule global marketshares in televisions, a far cry from their heydays when Japan dominated the industry. Bit of a shame really, as I’ve always had something of a soft spot for anything Panasonic (AKA Matsushita). Japan also had Mitsubishi, Hitachi, Pioneer, JVC, Sanyo, Fujitsu, and probably even more companies I’ve never heard of making TVs at one point or another, just to give an idea how dominant their industry once was. Crazy how rapidly the tech world changes! Samsung is the largest maker of TVs globally today and has been for the past twenty years, but TCL will probably surpass them this year or next. Both Samsung and LG sold their last LCD panel factories to TCL (both the Korean makers kept their OLED panel factories), and Sharp wound down their last LCD panel factory in Sakai, Japan in 2024, meaning almost all large LCD TV panels (regardless of TV brand) today are made in China. Most companies source the actual display panels from third parties and build the rest of the TV themselves, even companies that made their own panels like Samsung and Sharp often source panels from others to target different sizes and tech display options. It is rather remarkable how quickly some of these Chinese companies grow and come to dominate their industry, even against other tough competition in Asia. Although in the display panel business there is always lots of talk about state subsidies giving the Chinese majors a big boost. Sony KDL-40EX720 here. Bought new in 2012, still using it, still looks great. sound quality? You don’t buy Sony tvs for sound quality, but the early 2010 models (I don’t know other years) could process all kinds of modern digital sound processes (DTS, etc.) so you could run the sound from a digital optical output in to an older receiver (i.e. one with digital optical BUT no HDMI) and it would sound incredible. I bought a similar model (EX line) in 2010 and it is still be used by my mother in her home as her daily watcher. We just run the sound through a Polk soundbar with subwoofer and it is decent. The upper tier Panasonic and Sony tv’s have actually put quite a bit of thought behind their sound systems to cater to folks who don’t want to hook their tvs up to external sound systems. Panasonic has woofers and upward+side-firing speakers on the Z95B and the W95A models, something like 50W speaker power total if I remember correctly? Even has Dolby Atmos somehow with that setup. The upper tier Sony TV’s have woofers as well as an interesting technology Sony calls “Acoustic Surface Audio”, which uses the entire panel surface area itself as a speaker. Not as good sounding as external units like yours will give you but pretty close! For us, it is Toshiba (is this brand still around — it isn’t on your list?). Our largish flat-screen set is 20+years old and is still working great — perfectly in fact. When it finally dies, we are assuming that whatever we replace it with (even if Toshiba is still available?) will be a downgrade. They made great laptops! I still have an old Toshiba Satellite somewhere here, that still worked last time I powered it up a few years ago. Toshiba itself was doing OK but was sunk by it’s ownership/investments into the nuclear arm of US Westinghouse, which Toshiba bought in 2005, and which ended up bleeding them dry throught the mid-2010s through delays, cost overruns and penalties. Things got so bad that Westinghouse itself had to declare bankruptcy in 2017 in what is known as the Nukegate scandal. That lead Toshiba to selling off most of its consumer electronics and appliance divisions to raise money to cover some of the losses. There’s a list of Toshiba’s business groups that were spun off on their website : Businesses transferred from Toshiba Group (Including Toshiba Brand licensed products ) Home Appliances (Toshiba Lifestyle Co., Ltd.) TV, Blu-ray and other visual products (TVS REGZA Corporation) Memory and SSDs (Kioxia Corporation) PC and Tablets (Dynabook Inc.) HVAC (Carrier Japan Corporation) You can see some of the carnage in all the corporate spinoffs (although Toshiba today is still huge, they make mostly commercial products now). The TV unit was bought by Hisense and they still seem to operate it as a separate unit to Hisense (“Toshiba Visual Solutions”), although Toshiba TVs today are built by Hisense in their own factories. And is it know which segments have kept old quality levels? p.s. I bought a new hand mixer and learned that only KRUPS – which has become part of a French consortium in the 2000s – has an older model still produced where the inside and the mountings for the egg whips are made of metal instead of plastic. It´s quite heavy to hold in your hand. But when the lady told me and immediately recommended only this particular one among a dozen other companies I bought it without looking further. KRUPS has a newer model but that has switched to all plastic too. So for now they got two different models. She pensively articulated hope that KRUPS would keep producing the older version. Well, buying the old (really old) models, if they are still in production, is often one of the easiest ways as you have found :) Being heavy is another one. Something built on an old production line can be not worth ‘updating’ so the bean counters that run everything don’t bother changing processes. You have to remember that modern companies are run under a relentless cost-cutting regime, they will move heaven and earth to save a few pennies per unit. If you ever watch engineering tear-downs by folks like Munro and associates (a fun video from them: German Engineering At Its Best: Tearing Down the New Volkswagen APP550 Electric Motor ), they will critique every single screw or fastener a company uses because it represents extra costs of production. Every extra bend, every extra casting piece, anything part that is three pieces but might have been able to do in one piece? Etc. Every dollar adds up when you’re building 200 000 units a year. Trying to guess the quality levels is difficult, and that’s why brands have ‘value’ to them in the first place, as that takes the guesswork out for potential buyers if that company has consistently well made products or if they produce garbage. A lot depends on company culture, if they are run by engineers versus finance people – I find American companies are the worst in this respect, epitomized by the Wall Street style bankster private equity types that will burn a company to the ground to raise profits. If you have people running things who care about the company’s or product’s reputation (like a lot of family owned German Mittelstand?), then the chances are better that the engineers will get more freedom to build it without taking a chainsaw to production costs. I think that is often times why Apple’s products were so good under Steve Jobs, because he was such a fussy leader and the bean counters, finance and investment people probably feared for their lives around him, haha. The best way to know is find someone that knows his stuff and does a tear down to analyze it. Youtubers like JerryRigEverything are good for this (for phones in his case). There are other channels that test things to failure (Project Farm) or test specs on things like tools (Torque Test Channel), so if you’re lucky the thing you want to buy might be on one of their channels being reviewed. Thanks! I have a TCL TV and it looks fine to me. It may be ten years old and didn’t cost much. My serious video watching is always via computer output where I have far more control. Sony reigned back during a pre digital age when the finer points of analog tube TVs mattered. Of course those DVD and earlier era TVs would seem quite primitive next to a 4k panel of today. Sony also pioneered with something called the Walkman. I doubt many younger people have even heard of it. That’s the interesting bit, Sony itself was amazingly innovative, even until fairly recently, and pioneered a lot of the technology we take for granted now (like first with lithium ion batteries – a division they later sold off in 2017). They were slow with LCD technology but were pioneers with OLED panels, releasing the worlds first OLED tv in 2007(!), but never seemed to be able to capitalize on their inventions like other companies managed to (LG and Samsung pushed OLED displays into the mainstream). Similarly with the cellphone, they bought Ericson’s cellphone division and just let it seemingly wither away (although I see that they are still making Xperia phones to this day, but they are hardly sold anywhere?). Sony was the model that Steve Jobs admired and wanted Apple to emulate at one point. A lot of similar shady business practices from the both of them, too! lol I never understood the LG logic. I found their surfaces and interfaces very complicated and overstuffed. I grew up on SONY. But at some point started to assume that that was a huge load of PR compensating for lack of real quality by the early 2000s. Don´t know if that was a correct assessment. But I started to look either in lower price segments or pricier ones depending on what I needed. And yes they were serious mafiosi as business practices are concerned. Ever since I understood that part of business success I started to doubt almost all of them. Their older stuff was definitely better put together. I think that is true for most Japanese electronics, the golden age was the mid 1970s until the bubble bursting in 1991, and China really taking over manufacturing in the latter 1990s. I have my dad’s old JVC stereo system from 1979 that still works perfectly, and a few other Panasonic, Toshiba, and Yamaha gizmos around the house that still work. Lots of it older than me, just incredible longevity. My university housemate had a Sony Trinitron TV his dad bought in the 1980s for the basement, and it was so well made it actually survived a flood! They found the thing so submerged it was practically floating in water; they took it upstairs and dried it out over two or three weeks, and much to their surprise it fired right up. Was disgustingly heavy too, bloody thing must have weighed at least 200 pounds haha. Not fun moving it 6 storeys up! Sony Trinitron TV I believe that was bought two or three times in our family. At one point I had to explain Dad that they are not being sold any more. But it was used so extensively that it broke after a decade every time. Am not sure if there weren´t theories that those very models had less longevity. Anyway that image quality has never been achieved since. At least judging from the screens I rarely happen to see nowadays. And the flatter and younger the models the worse. The first gen JVC flat-screen was still the best one we had. “Sony also pioneered with something called the Walkman. I doubt many younger people have even heard of it.” The following video gives an idea how fast mainstream, familiar consumer technologies fade away and disappear from the universe of recognizable objets. It is in French (Canada), but it should nevertheless be quite understandable. Notice that the video is already quite old (at least 15 years old). I reckon one of the objects presented was utterly foreign to me (I had never seen one before). Haha, great video ty :) In a similar vein to that, one of the more entertaining things on youtube is kids trying to figure out how to use old film cameras: KIDS REACT TO OLD CAMERAS A Tech Bro Think Tank Is Trying to Roll Back Evidence-Based Homelessness Policy Truthout ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Drove by a proposed new Careless Consumers Camp (CCC) the other day on Highway 395 just before Independence along the flanks of the eastern Sierra. Most of the prior buildings dating from 1942 are gone, so it’d be easy to construct new 2×4 framed and tar papered living quarters for the careless. re: Iran DROP SITE NEWS J. Scahill interview with Iranian photographer Notes from the Ground: Reflections on a Month That Shook Iran Kaveh Rostamkhani, a photographer and essayist, speaks to Drop Site about what he saw and felt over the past several weeks inside Iran 52 min. https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/interview-tehran-iran-protests-internet-blackout-israel-trump-pahlavi-riots Drop Site News seems to be trying to restore some balance in their coverage here, after Ryan Grim provided a platform for a very one-sided anti-regime narrative several days ago. Grim seemed genuinely taken aback by all the criticism these earlier appearances received, which threatened to tarnish the reputation Drop Site was building for its work on Gaza and Epstein. On that subject, I found the New Left review article ‘Scylla and Charybdis’ posted in today’s Links as similarly dismaying. Written by a left-leaning Oxford educated Westerner, Eskandar Sadeghi-Boroujerdi, it emphasized the brutality, unpopularity, corruption, incompetence, and even the neoliberalism of the government – which of course fits right in with the Western narrative. Again, it’s not that there isn’t truth behind these charges, but the larger context, including the effects of tremendous economic pressures and external destabilization efforts, were greatly downplayed in this piece in favor of regime criticism. This author has written about the latter effectively before; for example: https://newleftreview.org/sidecar/posts/culmination But this current piece exhibits many of the characteristics of left-leaning Western academics who let their own ideological preferences cloud their analysis. For example, given the reforms he (and many Iranians) favor, he could have mentioned how every time reformist politicians and policies have gained traction in Iran they have been sabotaged by the West. He is correct about the symbiotic relationship between Iranian hard-liners and Western regime-change neocons. Yet much of this discussion provides cover for the latter. I was wondering what had happened – :-P ok, was about to read NLR… Apparently the Anarchist line of thinking in the left unfortunately makes many usually decent thinkers and commentators blind to harsh realities and they simply are unwilling to at least acknowledge that and learn to expand their horizon and include this new experience. As it now turns out this is one of the main obstacles for organizing within the left. Until 2022 I did not expect such a demise to take place. And since this is systemic within the intellectual tradition which they seemingly follow like a law of nature no hope for any change soon. So the rightwing march will go on without serious resistance at least from those quarters as usual in recent decades. Not in all areas and not in the same way and not everywhere. But it sure is an ontologic crisis in Western Europe. B on Moon of Alabama has picked up on NC and the NLR piece. A ‘Left’ Cover-Up Of Regime Change Failure Today’s daily Links page at Yves’ Naked Capitalism pointed to a piece about Iran published by Sidecar, the blog-site of the New Left Review. Neither NLR nor Sidecar are on my daily reading list though I have linked to several Sidecar piece in my Week-In-Review collection. According to its About page: The criteria for publication on Sidecar will be saying something – about persons, processes, events, structures – that is not being said elsewhere, but deserves to be. The Sidecar piece linked via Naked Capitalism, Scylla and Charybdis by Eskandar Sadeghi-Boroujerdi, certainly does NOT match that criteria. https://www.moonofalabama.org/2026/01/a-left-cover-up-of-regime-change-failure.html q.e.d. How is this incompetence of “left” on geopolitics possible? I remember well when I started shaking my head about NLR´s coverage of the War in early 2022. Susan Watkins or Volodymyr Ishchenko and others. Not that everything was wrong but it was a striking lack of overall grasp due to ideology. Almost a helpless search for orientation. Dunno if they have altered some views or recovered from the initial shock. The way to a certain extent I dare speculate Craig Murray, for instance, has. Thanks. I think the MoA take-down is spot on. Especially effective is the contrast between this view from the “left” and that of the decidedly non-leftist John Mearsheimer: “[w]hat happened in Iran is an attempt by the Israeli & American tag team to overthrow the government in Tehran and break apart Iran, much the way the US, Turkey, and Israel fractured Syria…” It’s not as if this routine is a new one. Charlie Brown, Lucy, and the football. Over and over. Thank you AG. I have been reading NLR for decades, and have saved some valuable old issues, for example the issue-long essay on global economic turbulence Robert Brenner published in 1998. But these days with every new issue, I am finding fewer and fewer of the insights I am looking for in a “left” journal. I have been looking for an excuse to cancel my sub. I think I might have found it. I think Iran will turn out to be a test-case for the Left (or what’s left of it) in that intellectual honesty is clearly in conflict, once again, with political ideology. But this isn’t Stalin’s purges in the 1930s, or the Khmer Rouge, this is 2026 and the media, especially the regional media, is all over the place recording what’s going on. The standard argument that it isn’t happening because Iran is a state disliked by the United States and Israel and can therefore do no wrong, cannot function under such circumstances. The argument that it’s all due to sanctions is refuted by experts on the Iranian economy (including real Iranians) who point out that the role of sanctions has been greatly exaggerated: mismanagement of water supplies, for example, cannot be attributed to sanctions. And yes, bellicose statements by hard-line westerners provide the regime with a rationale for cracking down, as they do for all governments everywhere. But as always, the narcissistic self-licking ice-cream cone of the western comment industry cannot accept that the outside world has relatively little impact on the average disgruntled market trader in Tehran. For the Left, as for the Right, the level of likely ego-damage is too serious. As long as writers from the Notional Left begin by asking themselves “Am I being anti-American enough?” they will not be able to write anything useful. Ironically, the basic dynamics of the conflict (secular, democratic and leftist opposition linked to popular sentiment, against reactionary, repressive religious-dominated regime) should make it obvious which side the Left should be on. But as long as it adopts the approach that any enemy of the United States must be supported, it’s locked into a pattern of denial which will, in the end, do it a lot of damage, comparable perhaps to what happened to the Leftist groups that supported the repression of the Hungarian uprising in 1956. It’ll be their fault. Ahem. Countries have a right to sovereignity. I don’t see how you attack the left for not being on board with regime changes operations. You want me to believe that 40,000 Starlinks walked in on little cat feet in all on their own? Or that a bunch of Iranians nicely asked Elon Musk? Do you think we are children? It’s been reported that the US raided the currency and arm-twisted Iran’s allies not to intervene to try to support it. That produced the plunge that set off the protests by businessmen (and the government said those protestors had valid complaints) which then ramped up by foreign-paid agitators who, just like the Maidan coup, instigated violence. Video is coming out that supports that version of events. Oh, and the right-wingers I know say the right wing social media supports the “son of Maidan” reading and many/most are not on board with the US wasting money and energy on regime change, so your take on political views, at least as far as the US is concerned, is blinkered. “(A) secular, democratic and leftist opposition linked to popular sentiment, against reactionary, repressive religious-dominated regime) should make it obvious which side the Left should be on.” Ah, were it so simple, but the opposition both within Iran, and most certainly in the diaspora, is much more complex than this, incorporating a very large, if not dominant, constituency of right-wing Neoliberal proponents of, not only regime change, but of crushing the historic socialist legacy of Iran’s revolution(s). Superficially, it is tempting to grant you your point, but consider that the Shaw-in-exile and his (and his dear dad’s) supporters await in the wings, and that the “Left” in Iran is perhaps also weighing its prospects against the Theocratic pot vs. the Neoliberal fire. I am far from convinced that the Iranian Left is behind these “protests”. Without even bringing in forces external to Iran, one should keep in mind that the “average disgruntled market trader in Tehran”, in other words a merchant or operator of the Tehran bazaar, is, and always was, about as “democratic and leftist” as a member of a traditional chamber of commerce in the Western world. OK? Is really there (around the World) a notional left asking themselves how much anti-American one has to be to be “true left” or something? If it exists their numbers must be very small. I tend to believe that any notional left might be allergic to interventionism which is a product of geostrategic interests and has no interest at all in the populaces at large. The protests in this occasion were aligned, almost certainly fed by and coincidental in time with foreign interests on regime change as a desired outcome. It is impossible to ignore how Trump was rising to the occasion to say he was going to bombard Iran in defence of the protestors. Obviously not because Trump’s humanitarian worries. Not possible to ignore the delivery of Starlink terminals to proceed and coordinate with the protests and aggressions. This is not to say there isn’t genuine and abundant discontent in Iran. Almost certainly. Abundant discontent is possibly the default in most if not all countries. At the end of the day we have more than 3000 thousand victims which no leftists should be happy about, but with serious doubts that things might have gotten that far without foreign intervention. If there is this secular struggle that you mention at the root and cause of protests, quite possibly it was the attempt by Israel and US to use it to their advantage what provided Iran government with a rationale to be more aggressive and expedite with the protests. OK, this is not to say that a social struggle cannot turn a bloodbath without external meddling. It can indeed. But here i suspect the gasoline and the spark were originated abroad. Thank you, Ignacio, for this pertinent and pungent riposte. If there were a global temperature scale for disgust and fury, I feel sure that it would be hitting record highs. Sigh …. for those not around long ago or even on NC the term left is a libertarian/Corp funded slur word. Socialists/Commies stealing stuff from hard working Capitalists aka vestiges of colonialism and the failed attempt in financial slavery by globalism. In the original classical meaning it denotes share of productivity and via that family formation e.g. the kids are the future. The best part is the left has never been in control in the West, FDR was not a commie lol. Not being a leftist I have no opinions on who the Left (to whatever extent it exists and is worth discussing) should or shouldn’t support there. I agree that Iran’s government seems like an unlikely target for them to side with, but then so do the supporters of Pahlevi. I suspect that leftists weighing in on Iran are going to come off badly whichever side they take. Either they support “reactionary theocrats massacring their own people” or they support “American imperialists and their puppets”. Or else they are fence-sitting and “hiding behind false nuance”. Iran is, somewhat more fundamentally, a problem for them because it challenges what appears to me to be common leftist assumptions: the supreme evil of non-leftist-controlled states, the inherent goodness (and leftwards tendency) of popular resistance, secularism over theocracy, etc. There are, in fact, good reasons to doubt the universal applicability of all of those premises in general and in this specific case (not to excuse Iran’s government, but if somehow it was overthrown by its enemies now I don’t think it’s unreasonable to expect the result to be an even worse humanitarian catastrophe). But those reasons align poorly with the traditional leftist framework, which may be why this case causes such evident division and confusion among them – and why some non-leftists find it easier to navigate. Didn’t many leftists think kinda the same thing when the Shah was overthrown back un 1979 (or wrt Egypt during Arab Spring. Maybe they’d have thought the same about Ataturk if they were around in 1920.) The idea that a right wing authoritarian government shoukd be replaced not by “liberal leftist” regime but by another flavor of right wing authoritarian regime really does offend their dichotomous view about how the world works. Of course, people point out many original neocons started out as Tritskyite leftists who believed in inevitable triumph of the “left” in the struggle against (presumably monolithic) “authoritarian right” even when they were themselves yet another flavor of the authoritarian right themselves… Well said. I consider myself a “leftist”, but I’m an *authentic* one (ha ha, yes that is sarcasm). Unlike the straw man described by Aurelien, I don’t support the current Iranian government because I’m “anti-American” or because they are our enemies. Like any “real” leftist (again, irony quotes here), I dislike theocratic rule of any kind. Indeed, the reforms supported by the NLR author would be desirable in my view. But I hate US policy with a passion because it is NOT in any way about “democracy” or “rule of law” or “freedom” or any of those nice words. Rather, it is about economic exploitation and geopolitical advantage for US interests (or in this case those of Israel as well, which are identical in the neocon view). Its policies kill people and destroy nations whose governments resist our efforts. Anyone or anything that enhances those efforts should be condemned, even if they are the words of a well-meaning “leftist” academic. I could write a long essay off the top of my head for Aurelien on how we have done this in the past, and on the many ways in which the US has interfered significantly to destabilize such nations, prey on their weaknesses, and leverage their internal divisions until they crack. But I fear it would be wasted breath; I’d just be considered an egotistical American who insists on ignoring the “agency” of these target countries. I actually knew many Iranians during and after the revolution. All but one were Westernized “leftists” who hated Pahlavi but were certainly no fan of Khomeini. They had cautious hopes at first; these hopes were crushed as the Islamic Republic consolidated its control. No, I’m not a particular fan of the current government. But the balkanized chaos that will likely result from the US/Israeli will be worse. And though it is true that not *all* of Iran’s current problems are due to external pressures, certainly many of them are, or are exacerbated by them to a great degree. I’ll bet I could even find some “real Iranians” who would agree. A recent interview by the only left paper in Germany left (how many lefts can one include into an English sentence?) with a leftist from Iran sums up the problem in the headline already: “We want to confront the dictatorship and US imperialism.” Causes, composition, and perspectives of the protest movement in Iran. A conversation with Navid Shomali” https://archive.is/VE6GH I was sitting over a response to your post from last week (re: UKR/RU) but found nothing I drafted adequate. And yet here we are again. Same problem. The nation-state in the age of superpower imperial conflict appears to become a Catch-22 for the left. However the idea of international, i.e. cross-border solidarity – is not off the table – relevant just as it was in the late 1800s. British filmmaker Ken Loach in his (1995) “LAND AND FREEDOM” about the Spanish Civil War offered some wise scrutiny of this problem from the POV of the Anarchists who found themselves boxed in by the Fascists and the Stalinists. Same issue now. (Kurds is more complex but it is tangent to these normative contradictions.) re: “1956” (etc.) as mentioned by Aurelien above: Co-founder of German NACHDENKSEITEN alternative news site and former bureau chief of Willy Brandt, Albrecht Müller, spoke about the day USSR invaded Czechoslovakia: The then head of his office, an old-style German SPD man said “Ok, that´s tragic but we will carry on with “Ostpolitik” and not boycott the Russians.” That was a much more left SPD than anything that would follow. p.s. I don´t know much about Prague/1968. However Budapest/1956 has become more complicated for me with growing age because more and more hints are showing up that there was some inteference by the CIA too – not just the British. The real repression having been established in the Hungarian CP purges of 1948. And as far as I know the West did not really use 1948 as any means to upset the consolidation of CP power in Hungary. So there is logic to the anecdote that Churchill congratulated Stalin for suppressing the Socialists in Greece in 1948. “We want to confront the dictatorship and US imperialism.” A sympathetic idea in theory, but an additional problem is: what would that amount to in practice? Weakening the Iranian government naturally serves US interests. Confronting US imperialism from within Iran is ridiculous – all one can really do there is fight the rest of the opposition… which of course serves the interests of “the dictatorship”. It’s like how Makhno’s followers boasted of beating Whites until they’re red and Reds until they’re white. Sounds very brave and independent of them. In reality, despite occasionally skirmishing with the Reds, they mostly just repeatedly volunteered to be cannon fodder for the Reds and were then duly disposed of. If they hadn’t agreed to that, though, their actions still would’ve helped one side or the other more. They had no path to victory short of everyone else just collapsing or deciding to leave them alone. What makes this problem worse, from the movement cohesion standpoint, is that this dilemma – of really having to choose a side if you want to influence the outcome – is very obvious. And that collides with modern opposition movements’ typical moral and political absolutism (not just characateristic of the left, by the by). There can be no compromises with the absolute evil of the dictatorship or that of American imperialism. So if you’re clearly working to assist one and not the other, you are yourself compromised. In such conditions it also becomes tempting to pretend that it’s not evil after all. A lot of what’s left of Russian leftists and other activists are in this position too. Frankly, I think the whole concept of a lesser evil gets a bad rap in some politically earnest circles. There shouldn’t be any shame in admitting that sometimes you do have to choose a bad option and try to make the best of it – mitigate damage, keep looking for better possibilities, lay groundwork for later improvements. But this is denounced as a form of moral cowardice – by people who don’t actually have any better ideas, other than being virtuously ineffectual or else choosing a side but lying desperately about it to themselves and others. If I am hard on the left, part of the reason is that it seems inherently particularly inclined to this kind of self-defeating maximalism – anyone who tries to break away from that faces an uphill fight. (As for Prague, I’ll just add that the real work was done there around 1948 too. It’s also rather vexing that so many leftists broke with the USSR over that largely bloodless intervention against some liberal communists in a “civilised European country”. Bloodier events in less-civilised Hungary and far worse things still that happened in “semi-Asiatic” Russia did not bother them, apparently – but here they drew the line… I’d respect them more if they had not.) On that note: Maybe we should stop complaining in the West – or as anti-colonialist activist Nathalie Yamb said, as she has been sanctioned by the EU and the US for criticizing France in Africe – for Africans nothing of what is happening now is new. It is the Europeans and the rich and eduacted in the US who are shocked. But on a global scale both spatially and temporal their experience horizon is tiny compared to what other “civilisations” had to endure – from the hands of those who are now bathing in “victimhood”. And the Left in awe may well be in that category of “don´t take yourself too seriously”. They have to learn to fight again – not on Berkeley campus but in the “jungle”. re: Australia vs. free speech/Gaza CONSORTIUMNEWS has 4 pieces about Australia´s new legislation on censoring speech: Going Down, Down Under The Australian Parliament has passed a new hate crimes law that could potentially throw critics of Israel in prison for years by Joe Lauria https://consortiumnews.com/2026/01/22/going-down-down-under/ Oppose Israel’s Abuses While You Can The Israel lobby can cry about Jewish Australians feeling threatened by every pro-Palestine group and then ASIO will ban the group and cage anyone associating with it for up to 15 years. by Caitlin Johnstone https://consortiumnews.com/2026/01/22/caity-johnstone-oppose-israels-abuses-while-you-can/ Hate Crime Laws Can Chill Free Speech What is the impact that the Albanese government’s Combatting Antisemitism, Hate and Extremism Act 2026 will have on the ability of ordinary Australians to protest?

But where and how will we sideline Stephen Miller, Alex Karp, and that lot? RE: South of the border- ” Project-Cuba next” The homeland-less meandering corrupted lost souls of the no-nation not-Cubans of south Florida are clueless to the honor and dignity of the Cuban people’s history… Putting a ‘Blond Frame’ (see Spanish translation) on the vile, venomous, and vindictive intentions that look to erase their dignified history, highlights the ignorance of the anti-imperial history of a people from which he pretends to descend. Cuba has been on the receiving end of psychopathic imperial abuse of power for more than six decades, yet have remained steadfast in their conviction that without autonomous sovereignty, i.e., independent freedom within a clear context, there is no dignity, and without dignity, life is a meaningless empty existence…offering an example of refusal to being atomized and resistance to the colonizing psittacist programming… There are higher purposes than being lulled into the atomized, corrupting and soul crushing comfort of consumer cages…Ponder the vile, venomous, vindictive, and psychopathic mentality that would ‘Frame’ their medical missions as “human rights” violations. Medical missions that have sent Doctors to the poorest regions of the hemisphere and beyond and have given Medical School scholarships to students from these regions with the condition that they return to their home and care for their people after graduating. All this despite their extreme resource limitations and conditions, effects of the more than six decades of the morally despicable and abhorrent “sanctions” and blockade. AND let’s not ignore the recent, even more morally despicable, and abhorrent “on the verge” gloating… France intercepts sanctioned Russian oil tanker flying false flag in Mediterranean Indian Express “It was carried out in strict compliance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea,” Macron said. BS by Macron. There is nothing in the UN Convention on the Law of Sea on supposed “international sanctions” that can be applied to any ships and then enforced on the high seas with supposed “false flags” because someone wants to suppose this. First, the sanctions which the EU unilaterally applies are not internationally recognized, except by EU members, and do not affect maritime traffic in the high seas but commerce and exchanges with the EU. Beyond that France or the EU have no competence or regulation of traffic in the high seas. This is violation of UNCLOS by France with apparent cooperation from the UK. Interception could have been lawful only and exclusively in territorial waters of France. Increasingly idiotic escalations. Wanting pretexts for war with Russia? One day they are going to find it and not to like it. Why the WHO respirator revolt could reshape global health governance Business Upturn If the WHO now concedes, as the letter urges, that airborne transmission is central and that respirators are materially superior, then every state that continues to permit surgical masks as default clinical protection exposes itself to claims that it is breaching its duty of care to healthcare workers and patients alike. I have always found this “debate” to be one of the more depressing aspects of both the covid pandemic and human society in the 21st century in general. There is a deadly virus loose among the population, and despite that, sober regulatory and administrative bodies insist on sticking with ineffective measures when effective ones are well known and readily available. Consequently, lots of people are ill and dying for no reason at all. BTW another aspect of this I haven’t seen discussed is that by requiring N95 masks to be used routinely, we will keep manufacturing lines for these masks open, and encourage continuous research on better masks. Consequently, we will be much less likely to be caught flat-footed when the next pandemic comes along as we were in 2020, when N95 masks were very hard to come by for a year or two. I keep hoping human beings are going to get with it. I’m still hoping. “sober regulatory and administrative bodies insist on sticking with ineffective measures when effective ones are well known and readily available. Consequently, lots of people are ill and dying for no reason at all.” I keep hoping, too. But nothing on this scale happens for no reason. Trump Says He Bruised His Hand on a Table (NY Times) I’m more worried about his brain. Pictures of the bruise spread on social media and elsewhere on Friday morning, in keeping with previous intense interest in the president’s health. Mr. Trump said that the bruise was also a side effect of taking aspirin. “I would say take aspirin if you like your heart. But don’t take aspirin if you don’t want to have a little bruising. I take the big aspirin. And when you take the big aspirin, they tell you you’ll bruise,” he said. Also, because the FDA won’t save you, you can try to save yourself “A Godsend”: ProPublica’s Rx Inspector Tool Is Helping People Find Critical Safety Information on Generic Drugs (Pro Publica) When was the last time T had his blood platelet count checked? Sorry if this comes across as off but if a Canadian PM or a US Commerce Secr. announce the end of anything that to me means definitely it is not the end. It´s if anything a repackaging of a brand. Trump is not looking or sounding good, the letter to Norway and his speech at Davos lead me to believe that SOTU may provide us with Trump’s “Biden Moment” when it becomes inarguable that there is something seriously wrong with him cognitively. The impact of that happening both domestically and overseas would be immense and immensely destabilizing. It might not be a bad idea to lay in some smelling salts, along with the popcorn. Trump, in ripping off the fig leaf, has been the best thing to happen to the inmates of the Empire in a very long time — may he not be lost to us before his time. Witkoff and Kushner Spend Almost Four Hours with Putin, but No Diplomatic Breakthrough Larry Johnson Johnson recalls this interesting bit of Cuban missile crisis history: The most prominent and well-documented example occurred during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, a 13-day standoff between the Soviet Union and the United States that brought the world to the brink of nuclear war. … On October 26, 1962, Feklisov initiated contact with John Scali, an ABC News correspondent with ties to US officials. Acting on instructions from Moscow, Feklisov proposed a deal: The Soviet Union would remove its missiles from Cuba if the US pledged not to invade the island and removed its Jupiter missiles from Turkey. My recollection is that the RFK administration, composed of “the best and the brightest” the US had to offer, adamantly refused this proposal from the Soviets, presumably for the sin of advocating parity between the US and the Soviet Union, ie, dismantling forward-based missiles targeting the opposite country. Evidently, according to Kennedy, it was fine for the US to install such destabilizing missile batteries, but completely outrageous for the Soviets to do the same. Fun times. My recollection is that they accepted the deal. I concur, the Turkish missiles were removed, but the USA did not mention for many years for appearance sake. https://www.jfklibrary.org/learn/about-jfk/jfk-in-history/cuban-missile-crisis “No one was sure how Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev would respond to the naval blockade and US demands. But the leaders of both superpowers recognized the devastating possibility of a nuclear war and publicly agreed to a deal in which the Soviets would dismantle the weapon sites in exchange for a pledge from the United States not to invade Cuba. In a separate deal, which remained secret for more than twenty-five years, the United States also agreed to remove its nuclear missiles from Turkey. Although the Soviets removed their missiles from Cuba, they escalated the building of their military arsenal; the missile crisis was over, the arms race was not.” I would add a theory of mine if I may: The US by that time had already established the new standard for future nuclear deterrence, POLARIS class SSBNs which would rewrite the rule of nuclear deterrence. So my critical 2 cents would be – knowing what would come anyway – trumping any RU old-fashioned ground-based missile threats with US seaborne missiles – the US Administration 1) did not give up any advantage with those Jupiters because SSBNs would replace those 2) the JUPITERS were out of date anyway and if I am correct they were scheduled to be replaced one way or another. This corresponds with the huge military build-up under JFK. Something conveniently omitted from history today while it is acknowledged with the legacy of such “warmongers” as Truman and Reagan the other two with huge defense budget increases. Argent Provocateurs have got the grey mare over the hump, can’t believe spot is $101 an ounce… Nearly 3.5x the spot price when doofus came back for a second round~ Nothing on the Hunt Brothers bubble though, they got it up to 6x the spot price in 9 months, whew! Yes indeed. Plus the Hunt Brothers were dealing on “margin,” ie. leveraged positions. Today, the “rules” are a bit more stringent as to margins. There are a lot of reasons why today is not a replay of 1980. For instance, see the Shanghai Exchange trading that poor nag at over $110 per this morning. There they tend to be “cash and carry” on their commodities bourse. There will be a shake-out if history is any guide, but the underlying fundamentals have changed from 1980. It’s a Brave New World out there. Stay safe, keep leverage to a minimum. Historically, China was all about silver and not much in gold. The push on silver is quite something, but still around 50-1 ratio, and the last time the silver/gold biblical ratio of 16-1 happened was at the height of the Hunt Brothers bubble in 1980. We Asked 300 People About Health Care Costs. The Numbers Are Shocking. (NY Times oped) Not to NC readers. When Congress allowed the expanded Affordable Care Act subsidies to expire at the end of December, my monthly health insurance bill went up by about $200 a month. That’s a good chunk of the $25,000 I expect to earn, after business expenses, in 2026. I am not alone in paying more for health care. More than 300 Times Opinion readers responded to a January invitation to share their experience of rising health care costs. They included a cancer patient who shifted care mid-recovery to a new insurance plan that doesn’t cover all her doctors. A mother who began skipping birthday parties to avoid the cost of a gift. A small-business owner who closed his doors. Many readers shared accounts of relying on retirement funds to pay for insurance. More than one Republican voter said they now regretted voting for that party. I am sharing a selection of these stories below, which have been edited for length and clarity. Recently, 17 Republicans joined with House Democrats to vote to reinstate the subsidies. The issue now rests with the Senate, though President Trump says he might veto any legislation to extend them. Senators should keep in mind these stories, which show just how untenable health care costs have become, fueling distrust, fear and anger across incomes and political persuasions. Lawmakers should restore the subsidies, which will provide much-needed relief to some 20 million Americans. It is the least they can do. “It is the least they can do.” The “least they can do” for whom? One either serves the People or Mammon. From what I have seen, Mammon is a fiercely jealous and hungry Ba’al. With the People at least, you have a chance. I don”t really know as I’m not a genius or anything but aren’t the subsidies to the insurance companies not people? When the subs went away the subsidy gets laid on the “consumer” so an honest description would be subsidies to corporations went away so average joe/sephine will have to cover it, o and ,gov has included a reasonable 10% increase per year because capitalism or some bs. Eat good, don’t get run over… Taibbi’s latest, public excerpt: Forget Trump and Greenland. Howard Lutnick Gave the Davos Speech that Mattered The death of globalization is the real headline from the international self-indulgence festival at Davos https://www.racket.news/p/forget-trump-and-greenland-howard 2 para’s from the longer article: “Globalization has been terrible for the United States. In addition to lost jobs and hollowed manufacturing towns, integration with countries like China has massively weakened worker bargaining power and put heavy downward pressure on civil liberties and democracy. Core Trump accusations that American voters have been asked to swallow shitty trade deals for decades and foot Europe’s security bills for even longer (while getting little in return) aren’t wrong. That globalization caused once-powerful countries to lose self-sufficiency — a security issue as well as an economic one — and prioritize global economic growth over the needs of their own citizens is no longer even denied, not that anyone wants to hear it. Watch what happened when Lutnick articulated the traitorous idea that countries should take care of their own citizens first, saying this is the “job” of government. “I would suggest that policy is something for other countries to deeply consider,” he said, “to take care of their own, and then we will work out wonderful relationships between us.” There was a hush and then the moderator asked, “Can I bring you back to Greenland?” an aside: my fear is that Lutnick’s idea of countries ‘taking care of their own citizens’ has more to do with digital-IDs, CBDCs, and panopticon surveillance than with improvement in Main Street economics. Hear, hear.. Lutnick may say globalization has failed the West and United States of America. I’m not too sure about that, but American elite greed and stupidity has sure won the day. And cracking down on your own citizens will only put America that much farther behind. But I fear greed and stupidity will win out here too. Thanks for the link. Nice rhetoric from Lutnick, though I think Taibbi is being a touch naive here: I remember Bubba Clinton saying much the same, thirty years ago. We’ll see how it goes. AI hasn’t delivered the profits it was hyped for, says Deloitte The Register Seriously? “We’re working with this big large manufacturing company,” Sarrafi explained. “They have about 7,000 suppliers. And every single time they needed to restock something, they had to coordinate with so many suppliers. It’s actually the most boring job ever for everyone. But then they deploy this agent worker or a team of agent workers that basically monitors the stock levels. As soon as it goes below the forecast requirements level, it sends a preliminary email to the supplier saying, ‘Can you tell us if you can supply this and what price?'” The result is a summary report sent to Microsoft Teams that a company planner has to review and approve. Honestly, doesn’t this sound like a short python script that a summer intern could crank out in a week or two (or an hour or two) and would not cost $20 billion dollars or suck down every watt in the Texas power grid? If this is the kind of brain-dead value proposition this AI dude is relying on for sales, he will be one of the first to go. I had a VBA macro that did this in coordination with outside vendors, 15 years ago. RE: Trillion Dollar Question What does this guy not understand about information, supply/demand, and classical economic theory? First there is no such thing as perfect information so buying a long term asset (house) is a crap shoot. Insurance rates are going up because of catastrophic losses from floods and fires (mostly). But there are other elements that are needed for a home to be ‘valuable’, and that is utilities (water and sewer specifically). If your local sewage treatment plant gets swallowed by the sea your 5bed 3bath home becomes practically unlivable. If home values decline so does tax revenue to repair or relocate these utilities. In my town expensive, vulnerable to disaster homes retain value because the scenic and cultural qualities of the populace are attractive to very wealthy newcomers who can readily rebuild after a catastrophic fire or other loss (including going standalone PV, and high-tech water/sewer treatment). There appears to be endless money chasing these homes. But, in the end, it is the quality of the community (and jobs) that encourages folks to ignore the climate change risks. Re: Learn to Love Engineers Once again we get an article which tries to draw a comparison between Chinese and American society: Wang’s response unfolds through what may be the most illuminating comparative framework for understanding contemporary China and the United States: the “engineering state” versus the “lawyerly society.” I have to say as an American I really don’t get “lawyerly society”. As an older American that can compare what America was like fifty years ago to today I would make the argument that we were maybe more a lawyerly society in the past, but much less of that today. I would have to say that the overriding vibe I get from our ruling elites today is we are a corrupt society. We have laws, but those with vast amounts of money or power routinely ignore them. Maybe that’s where the lawyers come in to the picture. Just saying… Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment * Name * Email * SUBSCRIPTIONS

Time Published: 2026-01-23T11:08:00Z

January 23, 2026 06:08 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Jan. 23, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Discount Brokerage Market - Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, and Forecast, 2021-2031" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The Global Discount Brokerage Market is projected to expand from USD 26.14 billion in 2025 to USD 37.16 billion by 2031, registering a CAGR of 6.04%. These financial intermediaries specialize in executing security orders at reduced commission rates, catering primarily to investors who function independently of personalized advisory services. The market's expansion is fundamentally propelled by the democratization of financial access, where technological breakthroughs and the widespread availability of mobile devices have drastically reduced entry barriers for retail participants. Additionally, this upward trend is bolstered by increasing levels of financial literacy and a growing preference for cost-efficient, self-directed investment platforms. According to the World Federation of Exchanges, the global trading volume of listed securities rose by 9.6% in the first half of 2024, indicating strong and continued investor participation in equity markets. Despite this positive growth trajectory, the market faces substantial hurdles related to strict regulatory compliance and the need for operational resilience. Global regulatory authorities are implementing more rigorous standards concerning digital engagement strategies and risk management to safeguard inexperienced investors against market volatility. This intensifying regulatory environment requires significant capital allocation toward compliance infrastructure and restricts the use of certain aggressive customer acquisition tactics. Consequently, these pressures can compress profit margins and hinder the pace at which firms can establish operations in new jurisdictions. Market Drivers A significant increase in retail investor participation and adoption among millennials serves as a primary driver for the discount brokerage industry, causing a fundamental shift in client demographics. This momentum is defined by a new generation entering the market, empowered by accessible educational materials and a cultural trend favoring early financial independence. The arrival of younger demographics has compelled brokerages to adjust their service models to support smaller account balances and higher trading frequencies, departing from traditional wealth management frameworks. The scale of this retail capital accumulation is evident in recent financial reports; according to Robinhood Markets, Inc., assets under custody rose by 76% year-over-year to reach $152.2 billion in the third quarter of 2024, underscoring the massive influx of capital from this growing segment. The development of mobile-first and user-centric trading platforms acts as the essential technological foundation facilitating this demographic transition. Brokerage firms are focusing on intuitive interface designs and seamless mobile app functionality to satisfy clients who require immediate market access and execution capabilities. By prioritizing digital experience and minimizing friction in the trading process, these platforms encourage higher engagement and trade volumes among self-directed investors. The magnitude of this activity is reflected in key operational metrics; for instance, Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. reported a 46% increase in Daily Average Revenue Trades (DARTs) to 2.823 million in October 2024 compared to the previous year. Furthermore, the extensive reach of these digital access points is illustrated by The Charles Schwab Corporation, which reported record total client assets of $9.92 trillion during the third quarter of 2024, highlighting the vast scale of the modern self-directed investment landscape. Market Challenges Stringent requirements for regulatory compliance and operational resilience imposed by global authorities currently serve as a major constraint on the Global Discount Brokerage Market. As regulators enforce strict standards regarding digital engagement and risk management, brokerage firms are forced to direct significant capital toward establishing advanced compliance infrastructures rather than investing in product innovation or geographical growth. This reallocation of resources results in higher operational costs, which directly undermine the low-commission business model essential to discount brokerages. Additionally, prohibitions on aggressive acquisition strategies, such as gamified user interfaces, restrict the ability of firms to rapidly attract the next generation of retail investors, effectively slowing the market's organic growth rate. The severity of this regulatory landscape is highlighted by the increasing frequency of punitive actions taken against non-compliant entities. According to the North American Securities Administrators Association, state securities regulators executed 1,183 enforcement actions and secured over $69 million in fines in 2024 to address regulatory infractions. These enforcement measures emphasize the intensified scrutiny directed at the sector, establishing substantial barriers to entry for new competitors and compelling existing players to prioritize regulatory compliance over market share expansion, thereby impeding the overall development of the brokerage landscape. Market Trends The incorporation of AI-driven predictive analytics and hybrid robo-advisory services is transforming discount brokerages into comprehensive wealth management centers. Firms are increasingly integrating automated planning tools and predictive insights directly into trading interfaces to provide retail investors with access to sophisticated portfolio strategies. This shift toward a technology-driven advisory model meets the growing demand for personalized guidance that extends beyond simple execution, thereby fostering deeper user engagement. The extent of this adoption is substantial; according to Fidelity Investments' Q3 2024 update, the firm logged 7.1 million Customer Planning Interactions year-to-date, representing an 11% year-over-year increase, which validates the sector's effective pivot toward digitally enabled advisory solutions. Concurrently, the inclusion of direct cryptocurrency and digital asset access is redefining the asset composition within the market. To compete with specialized exchanges and appeal to younger demographics, traditional brokers are rapidly embedding spot crypto trading into their primary ecosystems. This convergence enables investors to manage both equity and digital asset portfolios within a single, unified environment, which enhances platform retention and diversifies revenue streams. The financial impact of this expansion is evident; according to Robinhood Markets, Inc., cryptocurrency revenue jumped 165% year-over-year to $61 million in the third quarter of 2024, underscoring the vital role digital assets play in driving growth for modern brokerages.

Title: I landed a job at Snap after guessing the recruiter's email address. Here's my advice for other recent graduates looking for tech roles.

Every time Jacob publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sreeja Apparaju, a 24-year-old machine learning engineer at Snap living in New York. Business Insider has verified Apparaju's employment history with documentation. The following has been edited for length and clarity. When I decided to pivot from finance to tech in the fall of 2022, a couple of things were working against me. I was less than a year from graduating from the University of California, Berkeley, with a double major in computer science and economics, and some large tech companies had announced major layoffs before the end of the year. That made me nervous about the demand for new hires. I also didn't have any tech internships to fall back on. The prior summer, I'd interned as an analyst at Deutsche Bank in New York, but I realized that finance didn't feel like the right path; I was more excited about the kind of work happening in tech. It felt like unfortunate timing to be searching for tech roles — but at least I didn't have to job hunt alone. Given these challenges, I was fortunate to have the support of a close circle of four friends who were applying to many of the same software engineering roles. When one of us heard from a recruiter or HR professional, we'd share their contact information with the group. That's how I connected with a Palantir recruiter. Within a week of applying, I received an online assessment and was scheduled for an interview. I didn't end up getting the job, but I'm confident that getting on the recruiter's radar helped boost my chances. In job searching, there can be a culture of keeping to yourself because you want to be ahead of others. In my experience, though, sharing what we knew and helping each other out made the process easier — and faster — for all five of us. Every win for my friends felt like a personal win, and it was the motivation I needed to keep pushing for a job offer. One landed a role at Amazon, and another joined Salesforce. However, by the end of 2022, I was still looking. Business Insider is speaking with workers who've found themselves at a corporate crossroads — whether due to a layoff, resignation, job search, or shifting workplace expectations. Share your story by filling out this form, contacting this reporter via email at jzinkula@businessinsider.com, or via Signal at jzinkula.29. In early January 2023, I came across an opening at Snap Inc. — the company behind Snapchat — for a software engineering role. Snap had already been on my radar as a company I thought could be a good fit. The cousin of one of my friends in my job search circle worked there, and I immediately reached out to them, obtained their referral, and submitted my application within a couple of days of the role being posted. However, February came around, and I still hadn't heard back from Snap. I decided to take action; I got on LinkedIn and searched for a recruiter at the company who specialized in hiring new graduates. My goal was to reach out via email rather than a LinkedIn message. Since I didn't have a LinkedIn Premium account, I was limited in the number of characters I could use — and I worried that sending a short message would come across as superficial. I eventually found someone who appeared to be the recruiter, but their email wasn't listed anywhere. However, I did have the email of my referral contact, so I decided to guess the recruiter's email address based on the same email format — a strategy that had worked for me in the past. If I guessed incorrectly, I'd get an error message, and then I'd try a different version. I could have asked my referral for the recruiter's email, but I was already deeply grateful for their time and referral, and I felt uncomfortable asking for more. Fortunately, it didn't take long for me to send an email that appeared to go through. It included my résumé and an expression of interest in the role. Within a few days, I received a response from the recruiter and was given an online assessment to complete. Shortly after, I did my first interview — a one-hour technical and behavioral interview with an engineer. That was followed by a final interview round, which included four one-hour technical interviews, a 30-minute Q&A session, and a 30-minute break between the third and fourth rounds — about five hours total in a single day. By March, I had received and accepted an offer for the software engineering role. I started at Snap in August 2023 and am now a machine learning engineer. One thing I like about Snap is that it's smaller than companies like Meta or Google, which means I'm given a lot of agency and independence on the projects I work on. My top pieces of advice for other job seekers are: I'm really glad I listened to my gut and decided to pivot to tech when I started to sense during my finance internship that it wasn't the right path for me, rather than continuing down the same road. Additionally, I'd recommend leaning on others, whether that's friends or your broader network. Given the tough job market, I've found that many people are willing to help if you reach out to them.

Δ These cuts will be part of the second round of a broader plan to eliminate 30,000 corporate jobs, and they will follow the first round that involved 14,000 layoffs in October, Reuters reported Thursday (Jan. 22), citing unnamed sources. The latest round is likely to impact four Amazon business units: Amazon Web Services, retail, Prime Video, and People Experience and Technology, which is the firm’s human resources division, according to the report. The full scope of the layoffs is not known, and the plans could change, per the report. Amazon did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comment. According to the Reuters report, the 30,000 jobs that Amazon plans to cut under this plan would amount to only a small portion of the company’s 1.58 million employees but 10% of its corporate workforce. It would also follow Amazon’s elimination of 27,000 jobs in 2022. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue It was reported in October, just before the first round of the latest wave of layoffs, that Amazon planned to cut as many as 30,000 corporate jobs as part of an effort to reduce the amount of bureaucracy and the number of managers at the company. About a year earlier, in September 2024, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that the company planned to reduce the number of managers in each of its organizations and to “operate like the world’s largest startup.” “If we do this well, it will increase our teammates’ ability to move fast, clarify and invigorate their sense of ownership, drive decision-making closer to the front lines where it most impacts customers (and the business), decrease bureaucracy, and strengthen our organizations’ ability to make customers’ lives better and easier every day,” Jassy wrote at the time in a message shared with the company’s employees and posted online. When the company began its earlier series of layoffs in November 2022, Jassy said Amazon had hired rapidly over the previous several years and was looking at workforce levels.

Title: Amazon layoffs: Thousands of corporate jobs on chopping block as giant seeks to trim workforce by 30,000 — All we know

American tech and e-commerce giant Amazon plans to cut thousands of corporate jobs next week, as part of its plan to trim its workforce by 30,000, Reuters reported on 22 January, citing two sources familiar with the matter. These layoffs — among the company's largest — are likely to impact white-collar roles across divisions, including Amazon Web Services (AWS), the People Experience and Technology unit (human resources), Prime Video and retail, it added. Sources added that the plans could change. In October last year, Amazon culled 14,000 white-collar jobs (around half of its target of 30,000), and is expected to do the same this year, as per the sources. A spokesperson for Amazon declined to comment, the report added. According to a Bloomberg report, as of September 2025, Amazon had around 1.57 million employees — a majority of whom worked in its warehouses. Its corporate workforce comprised around 3,50,000 people, it added. The Reuters report added that 30,000 cuts would be 10% of the company's corporate workforce. Notably, this would be Amazon's largest layoff in 30 years, after it cut 27,000 roles in 2022. Those laid off in October were given 90 days on payroll to either seek jobs externally or find other roles internally. This period expires on 26 January 2026 (Monday), it added. The Reuters report added that the Seattle-based online retailer's job cuts in October were tied to increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) software. It cited an internal memo which stated: “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before.” However, later during the company's Q3 earnings call, CEO Andy Jassy told analysts that the cuts were not AI-driven or financially driven, but rather due to “culture”. He added, “You end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers”. In 2025, Jassy said he expected the company's corporate workforce to reduce as AI efficiencies increase. The Reuters report added that to save costs, corporations are increasingly using AI to write code for their software and adopting AI agents that automate routine tasks. Amazon's AWS itself touted its latest AI models during its annual cloud computing conference in December.

The company in October cut some 14,000 white-collar jobs, about half of the 30,000 target first reported by Reuters. The total this time is expected to be roughly the same as last year and could begin as soon as Tuesday, the people said, who asked not to be identified because they were ​not authorized to discuss Amazon’s plans. An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment. Jobs ⁠in the company’s Amazon Web Services, retail, Prime Video and human resources, known as People Experience and Technology, units are slated to be affected, the people said, though the full scope was ​unclear. The people cautioned that ⁠the details of Amazon’s plans could change. The Seattle online retailer tied the October round of job cuts to the rise of artificial intelligence software, saying in an internal letter that “this generation of AI ‌is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s ‌enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before.” However, CEO Andy Jassy later told analysts during the company’s third-quarter earnings call ‍that the reduction was “not really financially driven and it’s not even really AI-driven.” Rather, he said, “it’s culture,” meaning the company has too much bureaucracy. “You end up with ‍a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers,” he said. Jassy had said earlier in 2025 that he expected Amazon’s corporate workforce to shrink over time as a result of efficiencies gained from the use of AI. Corporations are increasingly using AI to write code for their software and adopting AI agents that automate routine tasks, as they look to save costs and cut reliance on people. Amazon touted its ⁠latest AI models during its annual AWS cloud computing conference in December. The full 30,000 jobs would represent a small portion ​of Amazon’s 1.58 million employees, but nearly 10% of the firm’s corporate workforce. The majority ⁠of Amazon’s workers are in fulfillment centers and warehouses. It would be the largest layoff in Amazon’s three-decade history. The company trimmed about 27,000 jobs in 2022. Affected workers in October were told they would remain on the payroll for 90 days, during which time they could apply ⁠for jobs internally or seek other employment. That period expires on Monday.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Amazon is planning to eliminate thousands of corporate employees, with cuts expected to begin as soon as next week, according to people familiar with the matter. The reductions would mark the company's second wave of mass layoffs since October, when Amazon cut about 14,000 jobs. Two of the people said the company is expected to eliminate a similar number of roles in the coming round, bringing total job cuts to almost 30,000. The latest cuts underscore Amazon's continued efforts to streamline operations and reset its culture. Amazon first attributed the October job cuts to changes brought on by AI. But CEO Andy Jassy later said the layoffs were instead tied to cultural fit, not cost savings or AI. Amazon employs more than 1.5 million people globally, though its corporate workforce makes up a relatively small share, at about 350,000. An Amazon spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. Reuters earlier reported this latest round of cuts could come as early as next week. Have a tip?

Title: Bitcoin options show pro traders expect more downside, but also plan to accumulate
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-options-show-pro-traders-expect-more-downside-but-also-plan-to-accumulate

Bitcoin derivatives markets show traders holding steady, but the path back to $95,000 relies on institutional inflows returning, especially after this week’s $1.58 billion outflow. Cointelegraph in your social feed Key takeaways: Bitcoin funding rates sit at 7%, showing bullish traders are still hesitant to increase leveraged positions. The spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $1.58 billion in outflows while gold hit record highs, signaling a shift toward safe assets. Bitcoin (BTC) has been pinned below $91,000 since Tuesday, even as equity markets rallied on strong US economic growth and employment data. As BTC struggles to find bullish momentum, muted demand for leveraged long BTC positions has led traders to question whether the $88,000 support level can hold much longer. The annualized funding rate for Bitcoin perpetual futures stood at 7% on Thursday, with the typical neutral range being 6% to 12%. While this marks a recovery from Monday, when the indicator nearly hit zero, significant demand for bullish leverage is still missing from the market. The lack of optimism among Bitcoin traders stems partly from the robust 4.4% third-quarter US GDP growth. A strong economy generally fuels earnings momentum, providing a tailwind for the stock market. Continuing jobless claims fell by 26,000 to 1.85 million for the week ending Jan. 10. Despite this tepid conviction, there has been no notable surge in demand for downside protection via BTC options. According to data from Laevitas, the two most active BTC options strategies on Wednesday and Thursday were the long straddle and the long Iron Condor. Both strategies prioritize volatility over directional bets. This suggests that whales and market makers are anticipating a period of price accumulation rather than a deeper correction from the current $89,500 level. To determine if professional traders are holding firm following an 11% weekly correction from the Jan. 14 peak of $97,900, one must analyze exchange long-to-short ratios. This metric offers a broader view than a single contract by aggregating positions across futures, perpetuals, and margin markets. Top traders at Binance increased bullish exposure on Thursday, with the long-to-short ratio rising to 2.18 from 2.08. Similarly, the top 20% of users by margin on OKX boosted long positions on Thursday despite Bitcoin's failure to reclaim $90,000. This onchain data reinforces the view that traders remain neutral-to-bullish despite the current lack of appetite for high-leverage plays. Market attention is now shifting toward corporate earnings. Several major companies report next week, including Microsoft (MSFT US) and Tesla (TSLA US) on Wednesday, followed by Apple (AAPL US) and Visa (V US) on Thursday. Consumer demand will also be scrutinized as General Motors (GM US) and Starbucks (SBUX US) release their reports on Tuesday and Wednesday. Gold prices hit an all-time high on Thursday as 10-year US Treasury yields approached 20-week highs. This divergence typically signals waning confidence in US fiscal health, and investors are clearly worried that further economic stimulus may trigger inflation, given the expanding US deficit. Related: Bitcoin's 16.7K inflow to exchanges raises alarm: Will BTC’s sell-off deepen? Rising Treasury yields indicate lower buyer demand and higher borrowing costs for the government. The 10-year yield reached 4.25% on Thursday, up from 4.14% the previous week. Ultimately, Bitcoin derivatives are showing resilience after the $88,000 retest, with few signs of bearish sentiment. However, a move back toward $95,000 depends heavily on institutional inflows. This trend has yet to materialize following $1.58 billion in net outflows from Bitcoin spot ETFs over the past two days.

PHOTO: AFP PublishedÂ Jan 23, 2026, 07:15 AM UpdatedÂ Jan 23, 2026, 12:44 PM SAN FRANCISCO - Amazon is planning a second round of job cuts next week as part of its broader goal of trimming some 30,000 corporate workers, according to two people familiar with the matter. The company in October cut some 14,000 white-collar jobs, about half of the 30,000 target first reported by Reuters. The total this time is expected to be roughly the same as 2025 and could begin as soon as Jan 27, the people said. company in October cut some 14,000 white-collar jobs, about half of the 30,000 target An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment. Jobs in the companyâs Amazon Web Services (AWS), retail, Prime Video and human resources, known as People Experience and Technology, units are slated to be affected, the people said, though the full scope was unclear. The people cautioned that the details of Amazonâs plans could change. The e-commerce giant tied the October round of job cuts to the rise of artificial intelligence software, saying in an internal letter that âthis generation of AI is the most transformative technology weâve seen since the internet, and itâs enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever beforeâ. However, chief executive Andy Jassy later told analysts during the companyâs third-quarter earnings call that the reduction was ânot really financially driven and itâs not even really AI-drivenâ. Rather, he said, âitâs cultureâ, meaning the company has too much bureaucracy. âYou end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers,â he said. Mr Jassy had said earlier in 2025 that he expected Amazonâs corporate workforce to shrink over time as a result of efficiencies gained from the use of AI. Corporations are increasingly using AI to write code for their software and adopting AI agents that automate routine tasks, as they look to save costs and cut reliance on people. Amazon touted its latest AI models during its annual AWS cloud computing conference in December. The full 30,000 jobs would represent a small portion of Amazonâs 1.58 million employees, but nearly 10 per cent of the firmâs corporate workforce. The majority of Amazonâs workers are in fulfillment centres and warehouses. It would be the largest layoff in Amazonâs three-decade history. The company trimmed about 27,000 jobs in 2022. Affected workers in October were told they would remain on the payroll for 90 days, during which time they could apply for jobs internally or seek other employment. That period expires on Jan 26.

Damien, this has been a journey, man. Like, this is the 18th year of producing The Changelog. As you know, when Wynn Netherland and I started this show back in 2009, I corrected myself recently. I thought it was November 19th. It was actually November 9th was the very first, the birthday of The Changelog. November 9th, 2009. And back then you ran Pusher, Pusher.app. And that’s kind of when sponsoring a podcast was kind of like almost charity. Like, you didn’t get a ton of value because there wasn’t a huge audience, but you wanted to support the makers of the podcast. And, you know, we were learning, and obviously open source is moving fast and we were trying to keep up, and GitHub was one year old. I mean, like, this is a different world. But I want to start off by saying, you were our first sponsor of this podcast. I appreciate that, man. Welcome to the show. Damien Tanner So kind of you. I, you know, reflecting on Pusher, we kind of just ended up creating a lot of great community, especially around London and also around the world with Pusher. And I really love everything we did. And we started an event series. And in fact, another kind of like coming back around, Alex MacCaw, who works at Mastra, he’s coming to speak at the AI Engineer London meetup branch that I run. And he started and ran the Pusher Sessions, which became a really well known talk series in London. Adam Stacoviak Okay. Were you at the most recent AI conference? I was in SF. Damien Tanner Yeah. Adam Stacoviak What was that like? I can always kind of jump in the shark a little bit because I kind of want to talk. I want to juxtapose like Pusher then timeframe developer to like now, which is drastically different. So don’t, let’s not go too far there, but how was AI in SF recently? Damien Tanner It was a good experience, always a good injection of energy going to SF. I live just outside London. But, you know what, the venue was quite big and it didn’t have that like, together feel as much as some competitors. But it was the first time though I sat and, you know, huge conference hall. And I think it was like Windsurf or something’s chatting and I was like, this is, this is really like, we’re all miners at a conference about mining automation. And we’re like, we’re engineers. So we’re super excited about it, but, right, it’s kind of weird. Like, it’s going to change all of our jobs. All right. It’s like, I’m working right now to change everything I’m doing tomorrow, right? I mean, that’s kind of how I viewed it. Adam Stacoviak I was watching a lot of the playback. I wasn’t there personally, this time around, but I would want to make it the next time around. But, you know, just the Swyx, the content coming out of there, everybody’s speaking, I know a lot of great people are there. Obviously pushing the boundaries of what’s next for us, the frontier, so to speak. But a lot of the content, I mean, almost all the content was like, top, top notch. And I feel like I was just watching the tip of humanity, right? Like just experiencing what’s to come because in tech, you know this as being a veteran in tech, we shape, we’re shaping the future of humanity. In a lot of cases, technology drives that. Technology is a major driver of everything. And here we are at the precipice of the next, the next, next thing. And it’s just wild to see what people are doing with it, how it’s changing everything we know. Everything. I feel like it’s like a flip. It’s a complete, not even a one eighty, like a 720, you know what I mean? Like it’s three spins or four spins, it’s not just one spin around to change things. I feel like it’s a dramatic forever. Don’t even know how it’s going to change things, changing things thing. Damien Tanner [04:05] I mean, you know, bringing it back to the Pusher days, it’s the vibe we had then. You know, there was this period around just before Pusher and the first half of Pusher, I felt like where we were going through this. Maybe it’s called like the Web 2.0, but there was a lot of great software being built. And a lot of, you know, the community. And I think the craft that went into, especially like the Rails community. And we were just able to build incredible web-based software. And then, you know, we’ve gone through like the commercialization, industrialization of SaaS. And what gets me really excited is now when we’re, you know, we run this AI Engineer London branch. And incredible communities come together. And it’s got that energy again. And I guess the energy is very exciting. There’s new stuff. Everyone can play a part in it. And we’re also just all completely working it out. And it’s like, you’ve got the, you know, folks on the main stage of the conference. And then you’ve got, we’ll chat about it later, maybe like, Geoffrey Huntley, posting his meme, blog post. It’s like that the crazy ideas and innovation is kind of coming from anywhere, which is brilliant. Adam Stacoviak Yeah, there’s some satire happened too. I think there was a talk that was quite comedic. I can’t remember who the talk was from, but I was really just enjoying just the fun nature of what’s happening and having fun with it, not just being completely serious all the time with it. For those who are uninitiated, and I kind of am to some degree, because this has been a long time, remind me and our listeners what exactly was Pusher. And I suppose the tail end of that, how are things different today than they were then? Damien Tanner Pusher was basically a WebSockets push API. So you could push anything to your web app in real time. So just things like notifications into your application. We ended up having a bunch of customers, maybe in finance or crypto or any kind of area where you need to live updating pricing. In the early days at one point, Uber was using Pusher to update the cars in real time before they built their own infrastructure. And it was funny. I remember the standout because we ran a consultancy where we were chatting about the WebSockets in browsers and we’re like, oh, this is cool. How can we use this? And the problem is, you know, we were all building Rails apps. So like, okay, we need like a separate thing, which manages all the WebSocket connections to the client. And then we can just post an API request and say, push this message to all the clients. It was a simple idea and we took it seriously and built it into pretty formidable dev tool used by millions of developers. And still used a lot today. And we eventually exited the company to MessageBird who are kind of European Twilio competitor. Actually, at one point, we nearly sold the company to Twilio. That would have been a very different timeline. Adam Stacoviak According to my notes, you raised $9.2 million, which is a lot of money back then. I mean, it’s a lot of money now, but like, that was tremendous. That was probably 2010, right? 2011? Damien Tanner The bulk of that we raised later on from Balderton. Okay. The first round was maybe half a million. Very, very small. And it started out the agency. So we built the first version in the agency. Just for fun, I suppose. Adam Stacoviak And maybe some tears on your part. Juxtapose the timeline, right? You got an acquisition ultimately, but you mentioned Twilio as an opportunity. How would have that been different, if you can like branch the timeline? Damien Tanner [08:09] It would have been a great experience to work with the team. There’s incredible people who watched Twilio and move through Twilio. I don’t know. I haven’t calculated it, but we didn’t sell, because the offer wasn’t good enough in our minds. It was a bit of a local, and it was stock. In hindsight, the stock hasn’t gone very well. Turns out it was a good financial decision, but would have loved that experience. I think Twilio became the kind of OG of DevRel, right? And dev community. And we’ve run, you know, how we got to know them is we did a lot of combined events with them and hackathons with them. That was a fun time. Adam Stacoviak Yeah, they were like the origination. Jeff Lawson was, you know, very much quintessential in that process of a whole new way to market to developers. And I think that might have been the beginning of what we call DevRel today. Would you agree with that? I mean, it’s like, if there was a seed, that was one of many, probably, but I think one of the earliest seeds to plant of what DevRel is today. Damien Tanner Crazy times, man. Adam Stacoviak So how do you think about those times of Pusher and the web and building APIs and building SaaS services, et cetera, and, you know, pushing messages to Rails apps. How are today’s days different for you? Damien Tanner It’s exciting, because the web and software is just completely changing again. Like, I feel like we had that with Web 2.0, right? That was the birth of software on the internet, hosted software on the internet. And it’s such an embedded thing in our culture, in our business, as developers, a lot of us work on that kind of software. But most businesses run on SaaS software now. And I have to remind myself, like, there was a time before SaaS. And therefore, there can be a time after SaaS, and there can be a thing that comes after SaaS. And it’s not a given that SaaS sticks around. I mean, like any technology, we tend to kind of go in layers, right? We still have a bunch of copper phone lines around the place, and we use them for other things, and we’re slowly replacing them. Like, these changes, you know, in the aggregate take a lot of time. But I guess, you know, the thing that can shift more quickly is the direction things are going. And really in the last few months, I think I’ve been more and more convinced by my own experiences and things I’ve seen playing with stuff, that it’s entirely possible, and probably pretty likely that there is a post SaaS. And I think I don’t know if everyone realizes, but like the, or everyone is with that intention, but like all of us playing with agents and LLMs, whether it’s to build the software or to do things, we are doing that. You know, when we’re probably doing that instead of building a SaaS, we’re using it to build a SaaS, right? It’s already playing out amongst the developers. Adam Stacoviak Yeah, it’s an interesting thought experiment to think about the time before SaaS and the potential, as you may say, the potential time after SaaS. I’m curious because I hold that opinion to some degree. I think there’s, you know, what SaaS stays and what SaaS goes if it dies. And you said in the pre-call, burst the bubble a little bit here, you did say, and I quote, all SaaS is dead. Can you explain your homework? All SaaS is dead. Damien Tanner I think I should probably go through my journey to here, to kind of illustrate it, because… Adam Stacoviak Give us the TLDR first, though. Give us the, the clip, and then go into the journey. Damien Tanner Okay, okay. The TLDR is SaaS. So there’s a few layers as like the building of software or parts to software. There’s a building of software. And then there’s the operating of software to get something done. And I think most developers are very familiar with like the building of software as changing now. But the operating software, the operating of work, the doing of work in all industries and all knowledge work, can change like we’ve changed software. And SaaS is made for humans, slow humans to use. The SaaS UI is made for a puny human to go in, you know, understand, you know, work at this complex thing and it has to be in a nice UI. If it’s not a human actually doing the work that they do in the SaaS, if it’s an AI doing that work, why is there a, why is there a SaaS tool? The AI doesn’t need a SaaS tool to get the work done. It might need a little UI for you to tell you what it’s done. But the whole idea of humans using software, I think, is going to change. It can. Adam Stacoviak Yeah. Well, you’ve been steeped in, and I still want to hear your journey, but I’m going to step in one second. You’ve been steeped in APIs and SaaS for a while. So I hold that opinion that you have that I agree that the, if the SaaS exists for a UI for humans, that’s definitely changing. So I agree with that. Where I’m not sure of, and I’m still questioning myself is like, what is the true solution here? There are SaaS services that can simply be an API. You know this, you built them. I don’t really need the web UI. Actually, I kind of just prefer the CLI, I kind of prefer just JSON from my agents. I kind of prefer Markdown for me because I’m the human. I want those good prose. I want all of it local. So my agents can, you know, mine it and create sentiment analysis and, you know, all this fun stuff you could do with DuckDB and Parquet and just super, super fast stuff across embeddings and, you know, vector, you know, PG vector, all those fun things you could do in your own data. But that’s where I stop is I do agree that the web UI will go where some version of it. Maybe it’s just there’s like a dashboard for those who don’t want to play in the dev world with CLIs and APIs and MCP and whatnot. But I feel like SaaS shifts. Like my take is CLI is the new app. That’s my take is that SaaS will shift. But I think it will shift into CLI for a human to instruct an agent and an agent to do. And it’s largely based on API, JSON, you know, clear defined endpoints, great specifications, things that get more and more mature as a result of that. Damien Tanner Yeah, I guess we should probably kind of tease apart SaaS the business and SaaS the software. Okay. Because yeah, I agree that the interface is changing. The interface that we use, whether it’s visually CLI or a chat conversation or something. But the way we communicate with the software is changing, right? It’s a much more natural language thing. We don’t have to dig in the UI to find the thing to click. But also so much of the software we use that we call SaaS that we access remotely. If you can just magic that SaaS locally or within your company, right? There’s no need to access that SaaS anymore, right? You just have that functionality. You just ask for that functionality and it’s being built. But yeah, SaaS, the business, I guess this is the challenge for companies today is they’re going to have to, if they want to stay in business, they’re going to have to shift somehow. Because yeah, I mean, there’s still got to be some harness, harness is the wrong word because you use that in coding agents, but like some infrastructure, some cloud, some coordination, authentication, data storage, there’s still a lot to do. And I think there’s going to be some great opportunities for companies to do that. And maybe a CRM, a Salesforce or something, manages to say, hey, we are, people like Salesforce trying to do that. We are the place to run your sales agents, right? You’re magically instantiated CRM code that you want just for your business. Maybe there’ll be some winners there. But the idea that I think the thing that’s going to change SaaS’s business, SaaS Software is the idea that like everyone has to go and buy the same version, you know, of some software which they remotely accessing can’t really change. Adam Stacoviak Okay, I’m feeling that for sure. Take us back into the journey then because I feel like I cut you off and I don’t want to disappoint you, but not let you go and give the context, the key word for most people these days, the context for that blanket statement that SaaS is dead or dying. Damien Tanner Yeah, okay, I’ll give you a bit of the story. So my company Layercode, I’ll just give you a little short on that. We provide a voice agents platform. So anyone can add voice to their agent. It’s developer tool, developer API platform for that. And we’re now ramping up our sales and marketing. And we kind of started doing it the normal ways. We kind of got a CRM. We got some marketing tools. And I was just finding, we went through a CRM too. And I was just finding them like, these are like the new CRMs that are supposed to be good. They were just really, really slow. And then I just couldn’t work out how to do stuff. It was like, I had to go and set up a workflow. And it was like, I needed training to use this CRM tool. And I’d been having a lot of fun with Claude Code and Codex, kind of both flipping between them, kind of getting a feel for them. And so I just said, build me a, I just voice dictated, you know, a brain dump for like 10, 15 minutes. Here’s the CRM I need. And also it wasn’t just like a boring CRM, it was like, I need a CRM, I need you to make a CRM that kind of engages me as a developer who doesn’t wake up and go, let’s do sales, you know, gamify it for me. And then here are the ways I want you to do that. And it just did it. That was my kind of like coding agents moment. And I think you have that moment when you do a new project. You use an LLM and a completely greenfield project. And there’s no kind of existing code it’s going to kind of mess up or get wrong and the project’s not too big. It just built the whole freaking CRM. And it was really good. It was a good CRM and it worked really well. And so that was like my kind of like level one awakening, which was like this idea that you can just have the SaaS you want instantly. It suddenly felt true. It felt, because I had done it. And I have canceled the old CRM system now. And there’s a bunch of other tools I plan to cancel. You know, because they’re all crap, but because it’s harder to use them than it is to just say what I want. Because I kind of have to learn how to use those tools. Whereas I can just say, make me the thing, make me the website I want instead of using a website builder tool or make me the CRM that I want to use. And then there’s this like different cycle that you have, the loop that you have of improvement, where it’s not a once, it’s not build and then use the software. It’s like as you’re using the software, you can improve the software at any time. And we’ve still got to work out how this works. Like who has the power to change the software? And how do you share that amongst a team, right? And do I have a branch of the software that I, or do I have different, like my own views or something in the CRM that I can mess around with? But just as a within our team of three doing this stuff in the company, it was like, oh, you’re annoyed with this part of the software. Just change it. Just change it. Adam Stacoviak Yeah. When it annoys you, it’s the exact point of time and then continue with the work. Right. And I assume you’re probably still doing like a GitHub or some sort of like primary GitHub, not literally like GitHub, but git repository as a hub for your work, right? And you probably have pull requests or merge requests. So even if your teammate is frustrated, improves the software, pushes it back, you’re still using the same software and you’re still using the same traditional developer tooling, which is pull requests, code review, merging. Damien Tanner Yeah. That’s going to have to change as well. Adam Stacoviak Okay. Take me there. I woke up this morning with that feeling. Damien Tanner Okay. That’s changing too. Adam Stacoviak How’s it changing? Damien Tanner With the CRM and with something we’ve been building this week, there were new pieces of software. There weren’t existing code bases. I didn’t have any prior ideas and taste and requirements about what the code should look like. I think this is the thing that slows people down with coding agents. You use it on existing repo and LLMs have bad taste. They just give you kind of the most common denominator, kind of bad taste version of anything, whether it’s like writing a blog post or coding, right? And so when you use it on an existing project and then you review the code, you just find all these things wrong with it, right? It’s like, you know, right now they love doing all this like really defensive try-catch in JavaScript or really verbose stuff or right now a utility function that exists in a library already. But when you start on a new project and you just use YOLO mode and you’re just, you know, you’re building something for yourself as well, right? And it works. Like, where’s the code? Why review the code? I think we’re only in this temporary, weird thing where we’re like trying to jam, like we have these existing software processes that ensure we deliver high quality software, secure software, good software. I think it’s hard, we can’t throw it, we’ve got SOC 2, we can’t throw those out the window for everything that exists today. But for everything new that you’re building, you’ve got an opportunity to kind of pull apart, question and collapse down all of these kind of processes we built for ourselves, processes that were built to ensure humans don’t make mistakes, right? And help humans collaborate and help humans manage change in the repository and everything. It’s like if the humans aren’t writing the code anymore, we need to question these things. Adam Stacoviak Are you moving into the land of agent first then? It sounds like that’s what you’re going. Damien Tanner I feel like I’m being pulled into it by, yeah, I’m slight, I’m kind of like, there is a tide. I can’t resist. I’m falling in the hole. And we’re kind of like, we’re dipping our toes in, right? Trying to try out Cursor and Tab. And then we’re kind of in there and we’re swimming, trying to swim the way we normally swim the way we want to go. And suddenly I’ve just gone, just like relax and just let the tide, let the river take you. Just let it go, man. Just let it go. Adam Stacoviak It’s scary. Damien Tanner It feels kind of terrifying and there are going to, and I don’t have the answers to how we do code review. But you know, if you look at like a lot of, you know, teams talking about using AI coding agents and the resisting project, everyone’s big problem now is code reviews, right? Because everyone using coding agents is producing so many PRs, it’s like it’s piling up in this review process that has to be done. The new teams that don’t have that process in place, they are going multiple times faster right now. Adam Stacoviak Okay. What is replacing code review if there’s no code review? Is it just nothing? Damien Tanner To these teams that you’re explaining about, like us as developers, we need to think more like, we need to put ourselves in the shoes of PMs, designers, managers. Because they don’t, they don’t look at the code, right? They say we need this functionality. We build it. We do our code reviews. We ensure it works. And the PM, whoever, goes, oh yeah, great. I’ve used it and it’s a requirement. It’s great, right? They’re comfortable not looking at the code. They’re a long way from the code. They’re closing the deal. They’re with the customer. They’re integrating. They’re like, I am confident that the intelligent being that created this code did a good job. Now, I think the only reason we’re kind of stuck in this old process is because many of them are set in stone. But also because LLMs aren’t quite smart enough yet. They still make stupid mistakes. Right. You still need a human in the loop and on the loop. Adam Stacoviak Yeah, I mean, they’re still a bit dumb and they get done with silly things and they do. Oh, look, they’re going the wrong direction for a while. And I’m like, no, hang on a second. That’s a great thought here. But let’s get back on track. This is the problem we’re solving. And you’ve sidequested us. It’s a fun sidequest, that was the point, but that’s not the point. Damien Tanner But this is going to change. Right. And this is one of the hard things is trying to put ourselves in the mindset of what it’s going to be like in a year. And I think I’ve only been, you know, after us being able to play with LLMs for several years, it feels like I can feel the velocity of it now. Right. Because I’ve felt GPT-3, 4, 5, Claude, Codex. And now I can go, oh, okay, that’s what it feels like for it to get better. And it’s going to keep getting better for a few more years. So it’s kind of like self-driving cars, right? They’re like not very useful while they’re worse than humans. But suddenly when they’re safer than a human, like, why would you have a human? Adam Stacoviak Yeah. Damien Tanner And I think it’s the same with coding. Like all this process is to stop humans making mistakes. We make mistakes. Like our mistakes are not special, better mistakes. They’re still like, we stuff up code. We cause security incidents. And so I think as soon as the LLMs are twice as good, five times as good, 10 times better at outputting good code that doesn’t cause these issues. We’re going to start to let go of this concern, like these things, right? We’re going to start to trust them more. Adam Stacoviak Something I leaned on recently, and it was really with Opus 4.5. I feel like that’s when things sort of changed because I’m with you on the trend from GPT-3 on to now and feeling the incremental change. I feel like Opus 4.5 really changed things. And I think I heard it in an AI talk or at least in the intention of it, if it wasn’t verbatim, was trust the model. Just trust the model. As a matter of fact, I think it was one of the guys, man, they were building an agent. And in the process was maybe as an agent layer, layer agent, something like that. Maybe borrowed something from your name, Layercode. I have to look it up. I’ll get the talk. I’ll put in the show notes. But I think it was that talk. And I was like, okay, the next time I play, I’m going to trust the model. And I will sometimes like stop it from doing something because I think I’m trying to direct it in a certain direction. And now I’ve been like, wait a second. And like, this code’s free basically. It’s just going to generate anyways. Let’s see what it does. Worst case, I’m like, you know, roll back or worst case is like just generate better. I mean, like ultra think. Right. You know, what’s the worst that could happen because it’s going faster than I can. Anyways, let’s see. Even if it’s a mistake, let’s see the mistake. Let’s learn from the mistake because that’s how we learn even as humans. I’m sure LLMs the same. And so I’ve come back to this philosophy or this thought, almost to the way you describe it, like falling into this hole, slipping in via gravity. Not excited at first, but then kind of like excited because like, well, it’s good in there. Let’s just go. Just trust the model, man. Just Damien Tanner [30:03] Trust the model. And it can surprise you. And I think that still gives me that dopamine hit that I would have coding, right? When I was coding manually, you’d get a function right and you’d be like, “Ah, it works.” And now it’s like, you’ve got the whole application and you’re like, “Ah, I just did a problem for the whole thing works.” That’s right. Yeah, it’s really exciting. And yeah, it’s fun right now. I mean, it’s going to keep changing. This is just a bit of a temporary phase here and now. But I think for many of us building software, we love the craft of it, which you can still do. But also the making a thing is also one of the exciting bits of it. And the world is full of software still. Like, you think about so many interactions you have with like government service or whatever. Not saying that they’re going to adopt coding agents, particularly, but there is a lot of bad software in the web. And software has been expensive to build. And that’s because it’s been in high demand. And so I don’t think we’re going to run out of stuff to build. I think even if we get 10 times faster, 100 times faster, there’s so much useful software and products and things and jobs to be done. Adam Stacoviak Close this loop for me then. You said SaaS is dead or dying. I’m paraphrasing because you didn’t say “or dying.” I’m just going to say we’re dying. I’ll parenthesis. That’s my parenthesis. I’ll add it to your thing. How is it going to change then? So if we’re making software, there’s still tons of software to write, but SaaS is dead. What exactly are we making then? If it’s not SaaS. I know that not all software is SaaS, but you do build something, a platform, and people buy the platform. Is that SaaS? What changes? You mentioned interfaces like, where do you say that? Damien Tanner I think we’re moving. And so this is the next level. The next kind of revelation I had was I started using the CRM. I was like, this is cool. This is super fast. This is better than the other CRM. And I can change it. Cool. I’m doing some important sales work. I’m enriching leads. And then I kind of woke up a few days later. I was like, why am I doing the work? What’s going on here? I create an interface for me to use, right? Why can’t Claude Code just do the work that I need to do for me? I know it’s not going to be with the same taste that I have. And I know it’s going to make mistakes. But I can have 10 of them do it at the same time. And it’s not a particularly fun idea, fully automated sales. And what that means for the world in general, but it’s the particular vertical where I had this kind of revelation, right? Well, the enriching certainly makes sense for the LLM to do, right? The enriching is like, come on, that’s under the API, I’m copying things. And a lot of it is so manual still. And so the revelation was just waking up and then going, okay, Claude Code’s going to do the work for me today. Like it does for software. It builds the software for me. I’m going to give it a Chrome browser connection. That’s still a non-solved problem. There’s a lot of pain in LLM chatting to the browser. But there’s a few good ones. And I’m going to let it use my LinkedIn. I’m going to let it use my X. And I’m going to connect it to the APIs that I need that aren’t pieces of software, but like data sources, right? I can get enriched and search things. And then I just started getting it to just do it. And it was really quite, it was slow. But it was really quite good. And that was a kind of, that was like that moment where we typed in, build this feature in Claude Code, build this. But it was suddenly like this thing can just do anything a human can do on a computer. The only thing holding it back right now is the access to tools and good integrations with the interfaces, like the old software it still needs to use to do what a human does. And a bigger context window and it’d be great if it was faster. But I can run them in parallel so that the speed’s not a massive problem. And in the space of a week, I built the CRM. And then I got Claude Code to just do the work, but I didn’t tell it to use the CRM. I just told it to use the database. And I just ended up throwing away the CRM. And now we have this little Claude Code harness that overrides the Claude Code system prompt, sets up all the tools and gives it a Postgres database. And I’ve just got like, I need to vibe code a new CRM UI. But I’ve just got like a database viewer that the non-technical team used to kind of look at the leads and stuff like that. It’s just a kind of Beekeeper kind of database viewer. And now Claude Code is just doing the work. We’ve only applied it there, but this is just like Claude Code is like this kind of little innovation in an agent that can do work for a long time. And we already know people use ChatGPT for all sorts of different things beyond coding, right? And so suddenly I think these coding agents are a glimpse of all knowledge work can be sped up or replaced. Administration can be replaced with these things now. Adam Stacoviak Yeah, these non-technical folks, why not just invite them to the terminal and give them CLI outputs that they can easily run and just up arrow to repeat or just teach them certain things that maybe they weren’t really comfortable with doing before. And now they’re also one step from being a developer or a builder because they’re already in the terminal. And that’s where Claude’s at. Damien Tanner Yeah, I mean, that’s what we’ve done now. I’ve seen some unexpected kind of teething issues with that. I think there’s just a terminal feels a bit scary to non-technical people. Even if you explain how to use it, like when they quit Claude Code or something, they’re just kind of like lost. They’re like, “Oh my gosh, where did Claude Code go?” Adam Stacoviak Yeah. And I was onboarding whatever team, it was like open the terminal. And then I’m like, okay, we’ve got a CD. What if the terminal was just Claude Code? What if you built your own terminal that was just— Damien Tanner I think when I actually think about specific UI, whether it’s terminal or web UI, it’s kind of not the handle there, but there is the magic is a thing that can access everything on your computer, right. And they’re doing that with, I think it’s called Co-Work. Have you seen Co-Work yet? Adam Stacoviak So it’s like, I haven’t played with it enough to know what it can and can’t do. I think I unleashed it on a directory with some PDFs that I had collected that was around business structure. And it was like an idea I had like four months ago with just a different business structure that would just make more sense primarily around tax purposes, you know. And I was like, hey, revisit this idea I haven’t touched it in forever. And it was a directory. And I think it went and it just did a bunch of stuff. But then it was like, come on with ideas. I’m like, nah, there’s not good ideas. I don’t know like if it’s like less smart than Claude Code is in intent or whatever, but it’s kind of, I think that’s what you’re trying to do with Co-Work. But you know, you could just drop them into essentially a directory, which is what Claude Code lives. And it lives in a directory of maybe files that is an application or knows how to talk to the database as you said your CRM does. And they can just be in the Claude Code instance, just asking questions. Show me the latest leads. Damien Tanner Yeah. That could use a skill if you want to go that route or it can just be smart enough to be like, well, I have a Neon database here. The Neon CTL CLI is installed. I’m just going to query it directly. You have to be able to write some Python to make it faster. Maybe I’ll store some of this stuff locally and it’ll do it all behind the scenes. But then it gives this non-technical person a list of leads. All I had to do was be like, give me the leads, man. You know. And then you mentioned enabling them as builders. I think it then is a window into that because then when they want something, oh, they get curious, right? They’ll be like us. They’re just going to be like, hey, build me a report for this. Build me a web app for this. Help me make this easier. Adam Stacoviak Yeah. You’d be surprised how easy that is, like, help me make it easier is one of those weird ones. And Claude Code will also auto complete and just let you tab and enter. And I’ve noticed that those things got more terse. Like, maybe I think if the last one I did was like, that’s interesting. It was like super short. It was like, “I like it, implement it.” What was the completion for them? Damien Tanner “I like it, implement it.” I was like, okay, is that how easy it’s gotten now to like just spit out a feature that we were just riffing on that you know the problem. You understand the bug we just got over. And now your response to me to tell you what to say because you need me the human to get you back in the loop. At least in today’s REPL is “I like it, implement it.” You know what I mean? Adam Stacoviak I found myself just responding with the letter Y. I know a lot of the time it just knows what to do, right? Even if it kind of like is a bit ambiguous, you’re kind of like you’ll work it out. Damien Tanner So I think it’s very exciting that Anthropic released this Co-Work thing because they’ve obviously seen that inside Anthropic. All sorts of people using Claude Code. And you know, when we think about, okay, someone starts there for non-coding purposes, but stuff is done with code and CLI tools and some MCPs or whatever, APIs. And then the user says, well, make me a UI to make this easier. So for instance, I had to review a bunch of draft messages that I wrote. I was like, okay, this is kind of janky in the terminal. Make me a UI to do the review. It just did it. And I think this is where software is changing because when the LLM is 10 times faster, I mean, if you use the Groq with a Qwen 10 points, right, they’re insanely fast. It’s going to be fast. Then if you can have any interface you want within a second, why have static interfaces, right? Adam Stacoviak Yeah, I’m camping out there with you. What if everything was just in time? I think that interface. What if I didn’t need to share it with you? Because you’re my teammate, but what if you could do the same thing for you and it solves your problem? And you’re in your own branch and what you do in your branch, it’s like Vegas and it stays there. It doesn’t have to be saved anywhere else, right? Like just leave it in Vegas, right? What if in your own branch, in your own little world, as a sales development representative, for example, an SDR who’s trying to help the team, help the organization grow and all they need is an interface. What if it was just in time for them only? And it didn’t matter if it was maintainable. It didn’t matter how good the code was. All it mattered was that it solved their problem, get the opportunity and enable them to do what they got to do either to do the job. And you just take that and multiply or copy and paste it on all the roles that make sense for that just in time. What? It completely changes the idea of what software. It also completely changes how we interact with the computer and what a computer does and what it is for. I just love this notion that every user can change the computer, can change the software as they’re using it as they like it. Damien Tanner I think that’s very essentially everyone’s a developer. Yeah, I mean, it’s the ultimate way to use a computer like all the gates are down, right? There’s no geeky prerequisite anymore. If I want software the way I want software so long as I have authentication and authorization, I got the keys to my kingdom I want to make. And I think also the agents can preempt, right? I haven’t tried this yet, but I was thinking of giving it the little sales thing. We have a little prompt where it says, like, either if a web UI is going to be better for the user to do this, review this, then just do it. So then instead of you asking it, you ask it to do some work and then it comes back and be like, oh, I’ve made you this UI where I’ve like displayed it all for you. Have a look at it. Let me know if you’re happy with it. I mean, this is getting kind of wild this idea, but you, it’s kind of how we can think about how we communicate with each other as humans, as employees, right? We have back and forth conversations. We have email, which is a bit more asynchronous. You know, we put up a preview URL or something. Like I think all those communication channels can be enabled in the agent you’re chatting to and like I haven’t like this kind of like product companies have sell, you know, the initial messaging where people solve like digital employees, right? But something like that’s going to happen. And I don’t think it’s the exciting bit for me is the human computer interaction, right. It’s like and this is how it’s kind of exciting in the context of Layercode and why we love voice is like voice is this OG communication method. Whereas humans we’ve been speaking, we started speaking before we were writing. And it’s kind of quite a rich communication medium. And it’s a terrific way, like if your agents can be really multi-medium, whether it’s you’re doing voice with them, text with them, they create a web UI for you, you interact with the UI with them. Like there doesn’t have to be these strict modes or delineations between those things. Adam Stacoviak Well, let’s go there. I didn’t take us there yet, but I do want to talk to you about what you’re doing with Layercode. I obviously produce a podcast. So I’m kind of interested in speech to text to some degree because transcripts, right. And then you have the obvious version, which is like you start out with speech, you get something or even a voice prompt. What exactly is Layercode? And I suppose we’ve been 51 minutes deep on nerding out on AI essentially. And not at all on your startup and what you’re doing, which was sort of the impetus of even getting back in touch. That’s all you had something new you were doing. And I’m like, well, I haven’t talked to Damien since he’s sponsored the show almost 17 years ago. It’s probably a good time to talk, right? So there you go. That’s how it works out. Has your excitement and your dopamine hits on the daily or even by minute by minute changed how you feel about your ability with Layercode. And what exactly are you trying to do with it? Damien Tanner [46:29] Well, there’s, and we’ve talked a lot about the building of a company and the building of software now. And I think founders today have that, it is as important as the thing that they’re building, right? Because if you just head into your company and operate it like you did a few years ago, using no AI, using all your kind of slow development practices, using our slow sales and marketing practices, you’re going to really get left behind. And so there is a lot to be done in working out and exploring what the company of the future looks like. What the software company of the future looks like. I’m very excited about the idea that we can build large companies with small teams. I think a lot of developers, well, I mean, there is a lot of HR and politics and culture change that happens when teams get truly large and companies get truly large. And this is one of the kind of founding principles when we started our startup was let’s see how big we can make this. Yeah. We’re the small team. And that’s very exciting because I think you can move fast and you can keep culture and keep a great culture. And so that’s why we invest a lot of our energy into the building of the company. And what we build and what we provide right now is, and our first product is a voice infrastructure, voice API for real-time building real-time voice AI agents. And this is currently a pretty hard problem. We focus a lot on the real-time conversational aspect. And there’s a lot of kind of weird problems in that, right? Conversations are dynamic things. And there’s a lot of state changes and interruptions and back channeling and everything that happens. And if you’re a developer building an agent, it could be your sales agent, it could be a developer of a coding agent. And you want to add voice AI, there’s a bunch of stuff you’re going to bump into when you start building that. And it’s a pretty, it’s interesting, we kind of see our customers, we can kind of predict where they are in that journey, right, because there’s a bunch of problems that you don’t kind of preempt and then you just quickly slam into them. And so we’ve solved a lot of those problems. And so with Layercode you can then just take our API, plug it into your existing agent backend, so you can use any backend you want. And you can use any agent LLM library you want and any LLM you want. So the basic example is a Next.js application that uses the Vercel AI SDK. We’ve got Python examples as well. And you connect up to the Layercode voice layer and put in our browser SDK and then you get a little voice agent microphone button and everything in the web app. We also connect to phone over to layer. And then for every turn of the conversation, whenever the user’s finished speaking, we ship your backend that transcript. You call the LLM of your choice, you do your tool calls, everything you need to do to generate a response like you normally do for a text agent. Then you start streaming the response tokens back to us. And then as soon as we get that first word, we start converting that text to speech and start streaming back to the user. And so there’s a bunch of stuff you have to do to make that really low latency, make that a real time conversation where you’re not waiting more than a second or two for the agent to respond. So we put a lot of work into refining that. And there’s also a lot of exciting innovation happening in the model space for voice models, whether it’s transcription or the text to speech. And so we give you the freedom to switch between those models, right, so you can try out some of the different voice models, some that are really really cheap and really you know got really casual voices and some like ElevenLabs, they’re a much more expensive but they’re very professional clean voices and you can find the right fit for your kind of experience that you want, trade off. There’s a lot of trade-offs, right, in voice between latency, price, quality, so we let users explore that and find the right fit for their voice agent. Adam Stacoviak That is interesting. So Next.js SDK, streaming, latency, is it, you’re meant to be the middleware between implementation and feedback to user. Damien Tanner Yeah, we handle everything related to the voice basically and we let you just handle text like a text chatbot basically. Adam Stacoviak No heavy MP3 or wave file coming down, just— Damien Tanner Yeah, and everything’s streaming. And so it’s a very interesting problem to solve because the whole system has to be in real time. So the whole thing, we call it a pipeline. I don’t know if that’s a great name for it because it’s not like an ETL loading pipeline, but the real time agent system, our backend, when you start a new session, it runs on Cloudflare Workers. So it’s running right near the user who clicked to chat with your agent with voice. And then from that point on everything is streaming. So the microphone input from the user’s browser streaming in, that is then getting streamed to the transcription model in real time. The transcription model is spitting out partial transcripts. We send that partial transcript back to you so you can show what you’re saying if you want to show them that. And then the hardest bit in this whole thing is working out when the user is finished speaking. It’s so difficult because we pause, we make sounds, we pause and then we start again and conversation is such a dynamic kind of, it’s like a game almost, right? Adam Stacoviak Yeah. Damien Tanner So we have to do some clever things, use some other AI models to help you detect when the user ends speaking. And when we have enough confidence, like there’s no certainty here, but we have enough confidence, I think the user finished their thought, then we finalize that transcript, you know, finish transcribing that last word and ship you that whole user utterance, like whether it’s a word, a sentence, paragraph the user has spoken. The reason we have to kind of like, we can’t stream at that point, right, we have to like bundle up this user utterance and choose an end, is because LLMs don’t take a streaming input. I mean, you can stream the input but like you need the complete thing, the complete question to send to the LLM to then make a request to the LLM to then generate any response, right? There is no duplex LLM that like takes input and generates output at the same time. Adam Stacoviak Technically, what if you constantly wrote to a file locally or wherever the system is and then at some point it just ends and you send a call that sends the end versus packaging it up and sending the whole thing once it’s done. Like you incrementally, yeah just line by line, it’s like maybe even like, I don’t know, I’m not sure how to describe but that’s how I think about like what if you constantly wrote to something and you just said okay it’s done and what was there was the done thing. Damien Tanner Yeah, so we can do that in terms of like, because we have to, partial transcripts, yeah, so we can, you can stream the partial transcripts and then say okay now it’s done, now make the LLM call, then you make the LLM call. But interesting, text, sending text is actually super fast in the context of, very fast. And actually the default example, this is crazy, I didn’t think this was, this would work until we tried it but it just uses a webhook. When the user finishes speaking, the basic example sends your Next.js API route a webhook with the user text. And turns out the webhook sending, sending webhook with a few sentences in it, that’s like, that’s fine, that’s fast. It’s all the other stuff, like then waiting for the LLM to respond. Adam Stacoviak Yeah, that’s actually not the hard part. I mean, you have to be a millisecond or somewhat a few milliseconds but it’s not going to be a dramatic shift the way I described it versus how you do it. Damien Tanner Yeah, and we’ve got a WebSocket endpoint now so we can kind of shave off that HTTP connection and everything but yeah, then the big heavy latency items come in. So generating an LLM response, most LLMs we use right now, they’re optimized, the ones we use in coding agents, they’re optimized for intelligence, not really speed. Then when people optimize for speed, the LLM labs, they tend to optimize for just token throughput. Very few people optimize for time to first token. And that’s all that matters in voice is I give you the user utterance, how long is the user going to have to wait before I can start playing back an agent response to them? And time to first token is that, right, how long before I get the first kind of word or two that I can turn into voice and they can start hearing. The only major LLM lab that actually optimizes for this or maintains a low latency of TTFT is Google and Gemini Flash. OpenAI, most voice agents now doing it this way, we’re using GPT-4o or Gemini Flash. GPT-4o has got some annoying, the OpenAI endpoints have some annoying inconsistencies in latency. And that’s kind of the killer in voice, right, it’s a bad user experience if it works you know the first few turns of the conversation are fast and then suddenly the next turn the agent takes three seconds to respond to you. Like is the agent wrong? Is the agent broken? But then once you get that first token back then you’re good because then you can, you send that text to us, you start streaming the text to us and then we can start turning into full sentences. And then again we get to this batching problem. The voice models that do text to voice, again they don’t stream in the input. They require a full sentence of input before they can start generating any output because again how you speak, how things are pronounced depends on what comes later. And so you have to then buffer the LLM output into sentences, ship the buffered sentence by sentence to the voice model, and then as soon as we get that first chunk of 20 millisecond audio, we chunk it up into, we stream that straight back down WebSockets from the Cloudflare worker straight into the user’s browser, we can start playing the agent response. Adam Stacoviak You chose TypeScript to do all this? Understand we’re pretty set on Cloudflare Workers from day one, okay. Damien Tanner And it just solves so many infrastructure problems that you’re going to run into later on. I don’t think we’ll need a DevOps person ever. Yeah, it’s such a, it’s interesting, it’s such a wonderful platform. There are constraints you have to build to, right, you’re using V8 JavaScript, browser JavaScript in a Cloudflare worker. Tons of Node APIs don’t work. There is a bit of a compatibility layer. You do have to do things a bit differently. But what do you get in return? Your application runs everywhere at 330 locations around the world. There is essentially zero cold start. Cloudflare workers start up in the time while the SSL negotiations are happening, the worker has already started. And you have very few limitations to your scaling, extremely high concurrency. Every instance is very kind of isolated, that’s really important voice as well. There’s often quite big spikes, like 9 a.m. everyone’s calling up somewhere that’s got a voice agent and asking to kind of book an appointment or something. You get these big spikes. You want to be able to scale and you need to scale very quickly because you don’t want people waiting around. And if you throw, well if you throw tons of users on the same system and you start kind of overloading it then suddenly people get this problem where the agent starts responding in three seconds instead of one second. And it sounds weird but yeah, Cloudflare gives you an incredible amount of that for no effort. And I think compared to kind of Lambda and stuff it’s also pretty, like the interface, it’s just a HTTP interface to your worker. There’s nothing in front and you can do WebSockets very nicely. And there’s this crazy thing called Durable Objects which I think is a bad name— Damien Tanner [60:08] And it’s also kind of a weird piece of technology, but it’s a little JavaScript runtime that is persistent basically and has a little SQLite database attached to it. And it is — I don’t know what the right word is, it’s kind of like, it’s not the right word for JavaScript, but it’s basically think of it like thread safe. So you can have it take a bunch of WebSocket connections and do a bunch of SQL writes to its SQLite database it has attached, and you don’t have to do any kind of special stuff dealing with concurrency and atomic operations. So you know, the simple example is just implement a rate limiter or a counter or something like that. You can do very simply in Durable Objects. You can have as many Durable Objects as you want. Each one of them has a SQLite database attached to it. You can have 10 gigabytes per one. And you can then kind of do whatever, you can kind of shard however you want, right? You could have a Durable Object per customer that tracks something that you need to be done real time. You could have a Durable Object per chat room. As long as you don’t kind of — like it does have a set amount of compute, a Durable Object, but you can use it for all sorts of magical things. And I think it’s a real underknown thing that Cloudflare has. Coming from Pusher, it’s like the kind of real-time primitive now. And a lot of the stuff we’d reach for something like Pusher, Durable Objects — especially when you’re building a fully real-time system — is really grateful. Adam Stacoviak Yeah. You chose TypeScript based on Cloudflare Workers, it sounds like, because that gave you three hundred locations across the world, Durable Objects, great ecosystem, no DevOps. For those who choose Go — or I don’t think you choose Rust for this because it’s just not the kind of place you put Rust — but Go would compete for the same kind of mind share for you. How would the system have been different if you chose Go, or can you even think about that? Damien Tanner [62:10] I haven’t actually written any Go, so I don’t know if I can give a good comparison. But from the perspective of what we do have out there — there are similar real-time voice agent platforms in Python. And I think because a lot of the people building the models, the voice models, then built coordination systems like Layercode for coordinating the real-time conversations, Python was the language they chose. And I think what’s more important is the patterns rather than the specific languages. And so we actually wrote the first implementation with RxJS, and that has an implementation in most popular languages. I hadn’t used it before, but we chose it because it was for stream processing. It’s not really for real-time systems, but it gives you subjects, channels — these kinds of, it has its own names for these things — but basically it’s like a pub-subby kind of thing. And then it’s got these kind of functional chaining things where you can then kind of pipe things and filter things and filter messages and split messages and things like that. And that did allow us to build the first version of this kind of quite dynamic system. We didn’t touch on it, but interruptions is this other really difficult dynamic part where whilst the agent is speaking its response to you, if the user starts speaking again, you then need to decide in real time whether the user is interrupting the agent or are they just going “yeah” and like agreeing with the agent, or are they trying to say “oh stop.” How much of the hard problems — we have to still be transcribing audio even when the user is hearing it, and we’ve got to deal with background noise and everything. And then when we’re confident the user is trying to interrupt the agent, we’ve then got to do this whole kind of state change where we tear down all of this in-flight LLM request, in-flight voice generation request, and then as quickly as possible start focusing on the user’s new question. And especially if their interruption is really short, like “stop” — suddenly you’ve got to tear down all the old stuff, transcribe the word “stop,” then ship that as a new LLM request to the backend, generate the response, and then get the agent speaking back as quickly as possible. And it’s all happening down one pipe, as it were, at the end of the day, right? It’s like audio from the browser microphone and then audio replaying back. And we would have bugs like you’d interrupt the agent, but then when it started replying there’d still be a few chunks of 20 millisecond audio from the old response snuck in there, or the old audio would be interleaved with the new audio from the agent back. And you’re kind of in Audacity or something, some audio editor, trying to work out like what’s going — why does it sound like this? And you’re rearranging bits of audio going, “Okay, the responses are taking turns every 20 milliseconds, it’s interleaving the two responses,” trying to work out what’s going on. Real pain in the bottom, yeah. Adam Stacoviak When you solve that problem with the interruption, do you focus on the false examples, the true examples? So do you like have these — if it is an interruption you can tell it’s an interruption by these 17 known cases? Like how do you direct that, the interrupt? Damien Tanner It really depends on the use case. How you configure the voice agent really depends on how the voice agent is being used, right? Like a therapy voice agent needs to behave very differently than a vet appointment booking answering phone agent. Adam Stacoviak [66:21] Yeah. What about dogs barking in the background? Damien Tanner Yeah, there’s that. And when we call that audio environments, that’s often an early issue users have. It’s interesting, they’re like, “Well, my users call from cafes and it kind of really misunderstands them.” And big problem with audio transcription — it just transcribes any audio it hears, right? So if someone’s talking behind you, the model doesn’t quite know that’s irrelevant conversation. It’s just transcribing it all. But if you imagine the therapy voice agent, it needs to actually not respond too quickly to the user and allow the user to have long pondering thoughts, long sentences, big pauses. Maybe tears, they’re crying, or just some sort of human — you know, interrupt, but it’s not a true interrupt. It’s something that you should maybe even capture and process. And so you can choose a few different levels of interruption, right? You can just interrupt when you hear any word. By default, we interrupt when we hear any word that’s not a filler word, so you filter out things like that. And then if you need some more intelligence, you can actually just ship off the partial transcripts to an LLM in real time. So let’s say the user’s speaking while and starts interrupting the agent — every kind of word you get, or a few words, you fire up a request to Gemini Flash and you say, “Here’s the previous thing that the user said, here’s what the agent said, here’s what the user just said. Respond yes or no, do you think they’re interrupting the agent?” And you get that back in about 250-300 milliseconds. And you just — as you get new transcripts you can cancel the old ones — you just constantly try and make that request until the user stops speaking. Then you get the response from that and then you can kind of make quite an intelligent decision. But these things feel very hacky, but they actually work very well. Adam Stacoviak [68:26] Well, the first thing I think about there is that Gemini Flash is not local. So you do have to deal with an outage or latency or downtime. Or in Cloudflare’s case, most recently, a lot of downtime because of usage — like really heavy usage. Unless it is — I’ve had more trepidation with Cloudflare than ever, and I’m like, “Okay cool, I get it.” You know, I’m not upset with you because I empathize with how in the world do you scale those services. Damien Tanner Yeah, it’s the Ralph effect. Adam Stacoviak It’s the Ralph effect. And I’m like — so why does your system not allow for a local LLM to be just as smart as Gemini Flash might be to answer that very simple question? Like an interrupt, it’s a pretty easy thing to determine. Damien Tanner Yeah, yeah. I think smaller LLMs can do that. Gemini is just incredibly fast, and I think because of their TPU infrastructure they’ve got an incredibly low TTFT — time to first token — which is the most important thing. But I agree that there are smaller LLMs, and actually I think probably maybe one of the Groq with a qLLaMA is actually might even be a bit faster. We should try that. But you make a point about reliability. People really notice it in voice agents when it doesn’t work, for sure. And especially for businesses relying on it to collect a bunch of calls for them. And so that is one of the other helpful things that platforms like us provide as well. Adam Stacoviak Or even just cost. I imagine over time, cost — I mean, right now you’re probably fine with it as you’re innovating and maybe you’re finding out customer fit, ability, reliability, all those things. And you’re sort of just-in-time building a lot of the stuff and you’re maybe okay with the inherent cost of innovation. But at some point you may flatten a little bit and you’re like, “You know what, if we had been running that locally for the last little bit, we just saved 50 grand,” you know? I don’t know what the number is, but the local model becomes a version of free when you own the hardware and you own the compute and you own the pipe to it, and you can own the SLA latency to it as well. The reliability comes from that. Damien Tanner And there’s some cool — there’s a new transcription model from Nvidia and they’ve got some voice models as well. And so there was a great demo of fully open source, like all voice agent platform, that was done with Pipecat — which is the Python coordination agent, open source project that I was mentioning. And they’ve got a really great pattern. They have a plugin pattern for the voice agent, and I think that’s the right pattern. And we’ve adopted a similar — and other frameworks have done that — we’ve adopted a similar pattern for us. When we rebuilt it recently, the important thing is the plugins are independent things that you can test in isolation. That was the biggest problem we had with RxJS — the whole thing was kind of, you know, those mixing kind of audio mixing things with cables going everywhere. It was kind of like that, right, with RxJS subjects going absolutely everywhere. It was kind of hard — it was hard for us as humans to understand. It was the kind of code where you come back to a week later and go, “What was happening here?” And things like, you know, oftentimes we’d end up writing code where the code at the top of the file was actually the thing that happened last in the execution of it. You know, basic stuff like that, just because that’s how the RxJS was kind of telling us to do it or kind of guiding us and how we had to initialize things. But that was one of the key things — we moved to a plugin architecture. We went to a very basic — we’ve got no kind of RxJS-style stream processing plugin. It’s just all very simple JavaScript with async iterables, and we just pass a waterfall of messages down through plugins. And it’s so much better. And we can take out a plugin if we need to, and we can unit test a plugin, and we can write integration tests and mock out plugins up and down. And we’re about to launch that, and that’s just such a game changer. And then interestingly, tying back to LLMs, we ended up here because with the first implementation we found it hard as developers to understand the code. We’d run the LLMs — they were hopeless. They just could not hold the state of this dynamic, crazy, multi-subject stream system in their head. Adam Stacoviak Context was everywhere, right? Like it was all — it was here, it was there. Damien Tanner Yeah. Even if you — I would do things like take the whole file. I was like, copying and pasting files into ChatGPT Pro being like, “You have — you definitely have all the context here. Fix this problem.” And they couldn’t solve the problem. Adam Stacoviak Fix it. Damien Tanner And part of the problem was that complexity. I mean, not having the ability to test things in isolation then meant we couldn’t have a kind of TDD loop, whether it was with the human or with an agent. And so — and because we couldn’t use agents to add features to this platform, to the core of the platform, it was slowing us down. And so that’s when we really started to use coding agents — Claude Code, Codex — like really properly and hard. We were like — I spent like two weeks just in Claude Code and Codex, and the mission was: if I can get the coding agent to write the new version of this — it was kind of not even a refactor, it had to be rewritten, start from scratch, first principles — then it will, by virtue of it writing it, understand it. And then I’ll be able to use coding agents to add features. And I started with literally the API docs for our public API, because I didn’t want to change that, and the API docs of all of the providers and models we implement with — like the speech-to-text and text-to-speech model provider endpoints — and just some ideas about, “I think we should just use a simple waterfall pipe, like pass messages through the plugins.” And that experience was really interesting because it felt like molding clay. Because I did care about — I really cared about how the code looked, because I wanted humans as well as — the agents aren’t quite good enough to build this whole thing from a prompt, but I think they will be in a year or two, right? But it did an okay job, and it needed a lot of reprompting — “refactor this, re-architect this” — but it felt like clay in one sense because, and you mentioned this earlier, you can just write some code and even if it’s wrong, you’ve kind of learned some experience. Adam Stacoviak Yeah. Damien Tanner I was able to just say, “Write this whole plugin architecture and do it,” and it would do it, and I’d be like, “Oh, that seems a bit wrong, that’s hard to understand.” I was like, “Write it again like this. Write it again like this.” And I suddenly got that experience of throwing away code because it hadn’t taken me weeks and weeks to write this code. Adam Stacoviak It had taken you 10 minutes. Damien Tanner And I was there, just threw it away. And you still have your chat session too, so even if you had to scroll back up a little bit, or maybe even copy that out to a file for long-term memory if you needed to, you still have that there as a reference point. Adam Stacoviak Yeah. I find myself doing similar things, which is like just trust the model, throw it away and do it again if you need to. Learn the mistake, go down the wrong road for the learning, and make the prompt better. Damien Tanner And it did a terrific job. And then the bit that really got it over the finish line was then I said — I gave it this script that we used to have to do manually to test our voice agent. You know, it’s like: connect to the voice agent, say this to the voice agent, tell it to tell you a long story, now interrupt the story, you shouldn’t hear any leftover audio from the long story — like all these things, there’s like 20 different tests you had to do. I gave it that script and I was like, “Write the test suite for all of these tests.” And then it did. And I gave it all these bugs we had in our backlog. I was like, “Write tests for this.” And I just started doing TDD on our backlog, and it was great. Then I was like, “Write a bunch —” I did like a chaos monkey thing. I was like, “Write a bunch of tests for like crazy stuff the users could do with the API.” Adam Stacoviak Yes. Damien Tanner Found a bunch of bugs and issues, security issues. And then it kind of — it got it working, got a bunch of unit tests. And I was still having to kind of do a bit of manual testing. And then one day I was like, you know what, I really want — no one’s made an integration test thing for voice agents. There are a few observation platforms, observability platforms and eval platforms. So I was like, I just wanted to simulate conversations. And it’s so — that’s part of the magic, is trying something that you’re like, “This is a pain in the ass to build,” or like, “How is this even going to work?” Well, I just got it to build it. And I recorded some WAV files of me saying things, and I gave it to them. I was like, “Make an integration test suite for this and feed the WAV files like you’re having a conversation, and check the transcripts you get back.” Wow. And it did a great job. And then it was actually able to fully simulate those conversations and do all the tests. And then that — I mean, we’ve got these practices like TDD which are going to hold value, right? It was so valuable for the model, for the agent, to be running the test, fixing the test, running the test, fixing the test. And that feels a bit like magic when you get that working. Adam Stacoviak So much to cover in this journey. I’m so glad we had this conversation. I kind of feel like a good place to begin the end — not actually end — is back to this idea that is on your about page. And I just got a reMarkable, because I love to write and I really hate paper, because this thing has Linux on it. And I wrote an API that I now API to my reMarkable Pro tablet. So amazing. I’m loving this. Damien Tanner Behind me? Adam Stacoviak So you can be able to Claude Code or Codex to your tablet? Damien Tanner That’s next. Adam Stacoviak I just got it. I just got it. So like, that’s the next thing. I’m going to have this — it’s a little playground for me, basically. But it’s real time. So if you see me looking over here writing — audience, or even you Damien — I’m not not paying attention. I’m writing things down. And the one thing I wrote down earlier from your about page was “the era of the small giant,” which you alluded to, but you didn’t say those exact words. And the reason why I think it might be a good place to begin to end is I want to — I think you might be able to encourage the single developer that maybe in the last couple of months they’ve just begun to touch and not resist falling into this gravity hole, or however we describe this resistance we’ve had as developers, loving to read our own code and code review and all the things as humans, and now to not resist as much, or if at all, and just trust the model. To give them this word of encouragement towards, “Hey, you’re a single developer,” and in your case, Damien, you don’t need a DevOps. It’s not that they’re not valuable or useful, but you chose a model, a way to develop your application, solve your problem, that didn’t require a DevOps team. Give them that encouragement. What does it mean to be in this era of the small giant? Damien Tanner [80:41] I think the hardest thing is our own mindset, right? I just found this with coding agents. You start off putting in things where you kind of have an idea, you know what to expect out of it. And then you start just putting in stuff that just seems a bit ridiculous and ambitious. And oftentimes it fails, but more and more it’s working. That’s a very magical feeling, and it’s a very revealing kind of experience. And so I think we can all be more ambitious now. I think we all — and especially as engineers, we know how the whole thing works, right? There is a lot of power everyone’s been given with vibe coding. Being able to vibe code — there are a lot of security issues I think will be solved over time — but as engineers, we have the knowledge to be able to take things fully through, deploy things, scale them, fix the issues that the LLMs can still get stuck on. But we can do so much more now. We can be so much more ambitious now. And I think the thing that everyone should — every engineer should be doing now is not only trying out Claude Code and Codex and doing something new and fun. I mean, the great thing is it’s so low risk. It’s so easy to do that you can build something ridiculous and fun that you’ve always wanted to do. Adam Stacoviak Yeah. Damien Tanner You can just — and you can build something for a friend, for your wife. And that’s really exciting. And I think this Ralph Wiggum thing — very kind of basic idea — is give a spec.md, todo.md, just an ambitious task or a long list of tasks in a markdown file, and you run a shell script. And all it does is it just says to Claude Code, “Do the next bit of work. When there’s no more work to do, return complete.” And the shell script just greps for “complete,” and if it hasn’t seen that word in some XML tags, “complete,” it just calls Claude Code again. And like many of these things, it seems like a terrible idea, it seems ridiculous, but it is also incredible what it can do. And so I think that’s probably — to feel what the future is going to be like, I feel like you write down something very ambitious in a markdown file, or transcribe an idea you have that you’ve been thinking about for a while, and you set a Ralph Wiggum script off on it, and you just go for a long walk or go and have lunch. And when you come back — I mean, it’s a very exciting feeling. And as a developer, it’s very fun because then you get to go through all this code and be like, “Why did it do it?” And you’re like, “Oh, that was pretty smart. But I didn’t like that. Okay, that was quite a good idea. It messed up this bit.” But that’s — I just feel like that’s a very, very exciting experience. Adam Stacoviak Very cool. I definitely agree with that. I’m looking forward to writing that todo.md or spec.md and just going for that walk. Because I haven’t done it yet. I’ve only peaked at some of the videos and some of the demos, but I haven’t tried the Ralph Wiggum loop yet. Damien Tanner I’m gonna post on X a one-liner as well, because I think you can just then copy and paste the thing. Adam Stacoviak There’s their blog post to read, yeah. Well, I feel like with everything, I want to make it more ceremonious. Because I want to — it’s not because it needs to be, because I want to know — I want to give myself space to think of something that I think will be challenging for me, even, you know? And then give it to the thing and go away, like you said, and come back happy. I want to save space to do that when I can give it full mind share, versus the incremental 20 minutes or 10 minutes or whatever it might be that I have available to give it. I kind of want to give it a bit more ceremony, not because it deserves it, because I want to actually do it for myself. So I’m just in this constant learning scenario. It’s a pretty wild era to be a developer and to be an enabled developer. These non-technical folks that may get introduced to a terminal-like thing that’s basically just Claude in a directory, really, and ask questions and get a just-in-time interface managed to them only — that’s a really, really, really cool world to be in. And it doesn’t mean that software goes away. It just means there’s gonna be a heck of a lot more of it out there. And I do concur that maybe code doesn’t matter anymore. Maybe it won’t in a year. Maybe it won’t in six weeks. I don’t know how many weeks it’ll take. Let’s truly aim with this. What’s over the horizon for you? What’s over the horizon for Layercode? What is coming? Damien Tanner So the show release — next Wednesday you’ve got a week, given that horizon. And no one’s listening. It’s a week from now. Adam Stacoviak What’s on the horizon for you that you can give us a peek at? Is there anything? Damien Tanner We are working really hard to bring down the cost of voice agents. There is a magic number of one dollar an hour for running a voice agent, where suddenly a huge, huge number of use cases open up — whether it’s consumer applications, gaming. There are so many places where voice AI will be super valuable, super fun, and isn’t implemented yet. And with the choices we made being on Cloudflare, with the system we’ve built, we’re going to be able to bring out the lowest cost platform. I’m very excited for that. And most of all, very excited just to see voice AI everywhere. Voice AI — voice is just such a wonderful interface, right? I find myself dictating all the time to Claude Code, and you can kind of get out your thoughts so much better. And I’m excited to see how many applications we can enable adding voice AI into their application. And then we get an insight into the future of voice AI as well, with the companies that are building — a lot of them startups — and they’re building some crazy, crazy new things with voice AI on our platform. So there’s going to be some amazing stuff with voice coming out this year. Adam Stacoviak What’s the sweet spot for Layercode right now that you can invite folks to come and try? Damien Tanner Well, the great thing is we’ve got a CLI — single command you can run — and you’ll get a Next.js demo app all connected to the live voice agent. And you can get a voice agent up and running within a minute. So it’s super fun, worth trying. And then from that point, you can use Claude Code, Codex, and just start building from that. Adam Stacoviak Well friends, right here at the last minute of the very last question, Damien’s internet dropped off or something happened. I’m not sure. But it was a fun conversation with Damien. Kind of wild to be talking to somebody 17 years later after being one of the first — if not the first, I’m pretty sure the first — sponsor of this podcast. What a wild world it is to be this deep in years and experience and history in software and to just still be enamored by the possibilities. I hope you enjoyed today’s conversation with Damien, and we’ll see you next time. Changelog Our transcripts are open source on GitHub. Improvements are welcome. 💚 Bandwidth Hosting Search

Title: Despite promises that AI will create more jobs, 1.2 million jobs were actually slashed last year
URL: https://fortune.com/2026/01/22/despite-promises-ai-create-more-jobs-1-2-million-jobs-actually-slashed-last-year/

Tech leaders like Google DeepMind’s Demis Hassabis and Tesla CEO Elon Musk have described AI as a win-win for society; they make ambitious promises that the advanced tech will allow us to turbocharge the labor force, cure cancers, and create new “super well-paid, super interesting jobs” that didn’t exist before. But instead of feeling empowered, many workers fear their jobs are at risk of being automated—and the flood of layoffs in 2025 confirmed their suspicions. A staggering 1.2 million job cuts were announced last year, up 58% from the roughly 760,000 layoffs in 2024, according to a recent report from employment consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas. In fact, 2025 had the highest level of workforce reductions since 2020, and was neck-and-neck with the 2008 financial crisis, when 1.22 million roles were slashed. The biggest victims of last year’s headcount reduction bloodbath were federal workers. Extreme cost-cutting efforts from Elon Musk’s DOGE crippled entire agencies, including USAID, the Department of Education, and the Department of Health and Human Services. In total, about 308,000 government jobs were cut last year. However, the tech industry took the heaviest blow in the private sector. Last year, tech announced that about 154,000 roles would be slashed, a 15% increase from nearly 134,000 job cuts in 2024. The culprit? Rapid AI implementation—and the industry self-correcting from pandemic-era overhiring. In 2025, AI was responsible for 54,836 layoff plans overall; since 2023, the tech has been connected to 71,825 job cut announcements. “Technology has been pivoting to both developing and implementing artificial intelligence much more quickly than any other industry,” the report noted. “This coupled with over-hiring over the last decade created a wave of job loss in the industry.” In a time where the tech industry is growing fast and companies are vying to win the AI race, it might sound counterintuitive for trillion-dollar innovators to be offloading their talent. But CEOs have been open about how AI tools are taking over human skills, and they’re gearing up for more workforce changes. Microsoft let go of 6,000 employees last May, dishing out another round of 9,000 cuts in July. Meanwhile, its CEO Satya Nadella announced AI now writes 20% to 30% of the company’s code; technology that has proven to be so powerful, that the business is funding a $80 billion AI infrastructure drive. At the start of this past year, Meta also announced a 5% workforce reduction—impacting around 3,600 staffers—in an attempt to “move out low-performers faster,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg said. This came as the tech billionaire admitted AI was on the precipice of “effectively be a sort of mid-level engineer.” Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy also admitted in a memo sent out to staffers last year that the business “will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today.” Just a few months later, Reuters reported that Amazon plans to cut as many as 30,000 roles. While tech layoffs are nothing new, entry-level staffers—who are already facing challenges getting their careers off the ground—will likely feel the sting of AI-related workforce changes more than others. The percentage of employees between the ages of 21 and 25 has been cut in half at technology companies over the past two years, according to 2025 data from compensation management software business Pave. These Gen Z workers accounted for 15% of the workforce at large public tech firms in January 2023; but by August 2025, they only represented 6.8%. The situation isn’t pretty at big private tech companies, either—during that same time period, the proportion of early-career Gen Z employees dwindled from 9.3% to 6.8%. “If you’re 35 or 40 years old, you’re pretty established in your career, you have skills that you know cannot yet be disrupted by AI,” Matt Schulman, founder and CEO of Pave, told Fortune last year. “There’s still a lot of human judgment when you’re operating at the more senior level…If you’re a 22-year-old that used to be an Excel junkie or something, then that can be disrupted. So it’s almost a tale of two cities.”

Title: AST SpaceMobile Bets on Blue Origin to Send Up Its Next Giant Satellite

In the race to deliver satellite-to-phone connectivity, AST SpaceMobile has announced it’ll use Blue Origin’s massive rocket, New Glenn, to send up its latest satellite next month. The plan is to launch AST’s massive BlueBird 7 satellite, also known as FM2, sometime in “late February," the company said on Thursday. The news is notable because AST SpaceMobile is betting it can use New Glenn to carry up to eight BlueBird satellites in future flights. The increased capacity promises to help the Texas startup launch between 45 to 60 satellites by the end of 2026; enough for the company to supply continuous cell coverage from space to users through partners such as AT&T and Verizon. Thus far, New Glenn has only completed two successful flights, and only one landed the reusable booster. Blue Origin says the AST launch will happen "no earlier than late February"; rocket launches are routinely pushed back due to weather or testing-related setbacks. Tapping Blue Origin is a high-stakes gamble, but if successful, it would help AST compete with SpaceX, which is already delivering satellite-to-phone connectivity through its cellular Starlink system. SpaceX’s offering, available through T-Mobile as T-Satellite, can already power video calls, messaging, and select apps in cellular dead zones. But the bandwidth remains constrained. Meanwhile, AST is promising superior service with “peak speeds of 120Mbps per coverage cell,” thanks to each BlueBird satellite's massive antennas. (That said, SpaceX is planning its own upgrades, slated to debut in 2027.) The company’s second-generation BlueBird spans 2,400 square feet when the antenna is fully deployed. The first second-gen BlueBird flew up last month on a rocket from India’s space agency after multiple delays. AST investors are now hoping the company can successfully launch more BlueBirds through New Glenn on schedule. The company also told the Federal Communications Commission earlier this month: "AST SpaceMobile expects four more orbital launches by the end of Q1 2026, with additional launches occurring every one to two months on average to reach 45-60 satellites launched by the end of 2026." In a bit of irony, AST also uses SpaceX for satellite launches. A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carried the first BlueBird satellites into orbit in September 2024, but New Glenn is expected to carry twice as much capacity as a Falcon 9 rocket. is obsessed with culture and tech, offering smart, spirited coverage of the products and innovations that shape our connected lives and the digital trends that keep us talking.

Title: US applications for jobless benefits inch up last week to a still-low 200,000

The number of Americans who applied for unemployment benefits inched up last week but U.S. layoffs remain historically low despite signs of a softening labor market WASHINGTON -- The number of Americans who applied for unemployment benefits inched up last week but U.S. layoffs remain historically low despite signs of a softening labor market. U.S. filings for jobless aid for the week ending Jan. 17 rose by 1,000 to 200,000, up from 199,000 the previous week, the Labor Department reported Thursday. That’s fewer than the 207,000 new applications that analysts surveyed by the data firm FactSet were expecting. Applications for unemployment benefits are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. Earlier this month, the government reported that hiring remained sluggish in December, capping a year of weak employment gains that have frustrated job seekers even though layoffs and unemployment remained low. Employers added just 50,000 jobs last month, nearly unchanged from a downwardly revised figure of 56,000 in November, the Labor Department said. The unemployment rate slipped to 4.4%, its first decline since June, from 4.5% in November, a figure also revised lower. The Labor Department also recently reported that businesses posted far fewer jobs in November than the previous month, a sign that employers aren’t yet ramping up hiring even as growth has picked up. Businesses and government agencies posted 7.1 million open jobs at the end of November, down from 7.4 million in October. Layoffs also dropped as companies seem to be retaining workers even as they are reluctant to add staff, a trend economists refer to as “low hire, low fire.” Recent government data has revealed a labor market in which hiring has clearly lost momentum, hobbled by uncertainty raised by President Donald Trump’s tariffs and the lingering effects of the high interest rates the Fed engineered in 2022 and 2023 to rein in a spike of pandemic-induced inflation. In an attempt to stabilize a softening labor market, the Federal Reserve last month trimmed its benchmark lending rate by a quarter-point, its third straight cut. Fed officials meet again next week, with most analysts and traders expecting central bank officials to keep the benchmark lending rate where it is. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said members of the committee are increasingly concerned that the job market is even weaker than it appears. Powell suggested that recent job figures could be revised lower by as much as 60,000, which would mean employers have actually been shedding an average of about 25,000 jobs a month since the spring, when the Trump administration rolled out its sweeping import taxes. Companies that have recently announced job cuts include UPS, General Motors, Amazon and Verizon. Thursday’s report from the Labor Department also showed that the four-week average of jobless claims, which softens some of the week-to-week volatility, fell by 3,750 to 201,500. The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the previous week ending Jan. 10 declined by 26,000 to 1.85 million, the government said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: What Is A Treasury Bond? Are They Going Tits-Up? Did Trump Chicken Out?

That President Donald J. Trump! In case you missed it, all weekend and as he was taking off for the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday, he grunted and growled and pounded on his dumb web site about how he HAAAD TO HAVE GREENLAND, Denmark can’t protect it, how and why is it even theirs, he was going to tariff EU countries 10 percent and then 25 percent until they made Denmark give him Greenland, and tariff French wines 200 percent because President Macron refused to pay a billion-dollar bribe to be in Trump’s made-up peace club with Vlad Putin, Viktor Orban, and a pet psychic from Argentina. Whine, whine, whine!! Then while Trump was in the air, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was already in Switzerland, the US stock markets started going tits up, which is to say down, and then the Danish pension fund AkademikerPension confirmed that it would sell $100 million of US Treasury bonds out of concern over instability in the US. “It is not directly related to the ongoing rift between the [US] and Europe, but of course that didn’t make it more difficult to take the decision,” said Anders Schelde, the head investor, meaning that Trump’s hostile groanings and nonstop nonsensical threats made it pretty fucking easy, not to mention how the value of the dollar has been steadily plummeting since Trump took office. Poor Scott, what if the bond selloff snowballed like an Aspen orgy! Subscribe! Was Bessent’s spray-painted rubber muppet head ever in a tight spot then. He had to use his greasiest weasel words to explain to dumb reporters that once again Trump was full of shit about taking over Greenland and the threat of tariffs was just him trying to make some kind of meta-point, or something, and so everybody should just chill out, man. What BOND SELLOFF? “Denmark is irrelevant.” That smug little troll had to say some pointlessly dickish thing so all angry daddy would hear is how he really stuck it to that MEAN Denmark and all those UNFAIR JERKS at the lying Financial Times who LIED about the large asset managers they quoted who were considering dumping investments in the US from their portfolios. “I just think everyone needs to take a deep breath, do not listen to the media, who are hysterical, just like they were, just like you all were on April 2, and what happened, we had the best stock market recovery in history.” Ooh, he is so mad at those mean economists! Funds sell their bond holdings all the time, it’s no big deal. And he advised reporters on the sidelines, “It’s been 48 hours. As I said, sit back, relax.” Relax! Trump is, of course, the only person in the room who flies into a blind, seething rage whenever he gets told “no” about anything, and constantly says things that he does not mean, because he either knows they are lies at the time or is so batshit crazy he himself can’t tell the difference any more, and we all know there are never any consequences ever. So just chill out, guys! So much for Trump doing the tariffs because they’ll be so great for the American economy that every Cletus with a GED will be able to use AI to supervise robots building robots in the robot factory. Talk about the bond market got Bessent spooked because bond yields are the price of the debt on America’s giant credit card. US Treasury bonds and shorter-term products, T-bills and Notes, have always been considered the standard of stable kinds of investments. A bond is a bet that in 10, 20, or 30 years, the US Treasury will still exist and be able to repay with a modest but stable interest. Bonds are a perfect investment for big savings and retirement funds, and domestic funds and banks hold about 70 percent of them. Then around 30 percent of US bonds are held by foreign governments, mostly Japan, the UK, and China. Which just fell to third place; they’d already been slowly selling off their holdings. So if the US Treasury yields go up, and bond prices go down, it means fewer investors betting on the US, and more of a risk of those bonds not paying off is priced in. With the Supreme Court possibly on the verge of letting Trump fire Lisa Cook and Jerome Powell on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors (but probably not; the Federal Reserve is a “special case” because the Supreme Court Six likes its money) and effectively giving himself the power to set interest rates, or convert the Treasury’s holdings into Melania NFTs if he wants, you can see where long-term investors might be coming from with that worry. Sure, the Danish pension fund’s $100 million is a rounding error compared with America’s $30 trillion of debt. But investors, especially institutional ones, by definition hate uncertainty and are easily influenced by others, and a trickle and then stampede of investors selling their T-Bonds for Chinese bonds or mutual funds in Deutschemarks or Loonies could trigger a disaster. No wonder Bessent was all a-twitter to dismiss STUPID DENMARK THAT NOBODY CARES ABOUT. And so what do you know, Trump immediately backed down from the tariffs and sending US troops to mount a coup in Nuuk and start a war with NATO, saying that he would settle for “frameworks of a future deal” of some kind. And the US stock markets recovered. For now, anyway. They’ve been riding higher on demand for AI technology, infrastructure and chips and such, but according to a study from MIT, 95 percent of businesses have seen zero return on any of their investments in AI technology yet. It seems the only jobs AI robots have actually taken so far are “student who was supposed to write their own term paper,” “lawyer who was supposed to write their own briefs,” and “Adobe Photoshop child-undresser.” Up and up and up the markets now go! When will they crash, nobody really knows. [Wall Street Journal gift link / CNBC / Financial Times archive link] Share! Share Here is where you donate to keep Wonkette going forever!

Title: US applications for jobless benefits inch up last week to a still-low 200,000

By MATT OTT, Associated Press Business Writer WASHINGTON (AP) — The number of Americans who applied for unemployment benefits inched up last week but U.S. layoffs remain historically low despite signs of a softening labor market. U.S. filings for jobless aid for the week ending Jan. 17 rose by 1,000 to 200,000, up from 199,000 the previous week, the Labor Department reported Thursday. That’s fewer than the 207,000 new applications that analysts surveyed by the data firm FactSet were expecting. Applications for unemployment benefits are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. Earlier this month, the government reported that hiring remained sluggish in December, capping a year of weak employment gains that have frustrated job seekers even though layoffs and unemployment remained low. Employers added just 50,000 jobs last month, nearly unchanged from a downwardly revised figure of 56,000 in November, the Labor Department said. The unemployment rate slipped to 4.4%, its first decline since June, from 4.5% in November, a figure also revised lower. The Labor Department also recently reported that businesses posted far fewer jobs in November than the previous month, a sign that employers aren’t yet ramping up hiring even as growth has picked up. Businesses and government agencies posted 7.1 million open jobs at the end of November, down from 7.4 million in October. Layoffs also dropped as companies seem to be retaining workers even as they are reluctant to add staff, a trend economists refer to as “low hire, low fire.” Recent government data has revealed a labor market in which hiring has clearly lost momentum, hobbled by uncertainty raised by President Donald Trump’s tariffs and the lingering effects of the high interest rates the Fed engineered in 2022 and 2023 to rein in a spike of pandemic-induced inflation. In an attempt to stabilize a softening labor market, the Federal Reserve last month trimmed its benchmark lending rate by a quarter-point, its third straight cut. Fed officials meet again next week, with most analysts and traders expecting central bank officials to keep the benchmark lending rate where it is. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said members of the committee are increasingly concerned that the job market is even weaker than it appears. Powell suggested that recent job figures could be revised lower by as much as 60,000, which would mean employers have actually been shedding an average of about 25,000 jobs a month since the spring, when the Trump administration rolled out its sweeping import taxes. Companies that have recently announced job cuts include UPS, General Motors, Amazon and Verizon. Thursday’s report from the Labor Department also showed that the four-week average of jobless claims, which softens some of the week-to-week volatility, fell by 3,750 to 201,500. The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the previous week ending Jan. 10 declined by 26,000 to 1.85 million, the government said.

January 22, 2026 07:33 ET | Source: Rocket Lab Corporation Rocket Lab Corporation Long Beach, CA Long Beach, CA MAHIA, New Zealand, Jan. 22, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, successfully completed its 1st launch of 2026 and its 80th Electron launch overall. The mission ‘The Cosmos Will See You Now’ lifted off today from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in Mahia, New Zealand, at 11:52 pm NZDT (10:52 UTC). The mission successfully deployed two satellites into a 1,050 km circular Earth orbit for Open Cosmos, a first-time dedicated launch customer. This higher-altitude deployment showcased Electron’s wide payload trajectory range, maintaining its reputation as a versatile and dependable small spacecraft launch vehicle that meets diverse mission requirements. Open Cosmos, a pan-European space technology company, offers complete end-to-end satellite services, encompassing everything from design and manufacturing to in-orbit operations and solutions. Just one week after securing high-priority Ka-band spectrum, it has launched the first satellites in its new proprietary low Earth orbit (LEO) telecom constellation. This new constellation compliments the already in orbit satellites that deliver high-resolution imagery and global monitoring capabilities, supporting a wide range of applications and providing valuable metadata for diverse uses. As Open Cosmos continues to increase satellite production each year to meet growing global demand, Rocket Lab’s Electron launch vehicle is well-equipped to support its needs. Rocket Lab Founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, said: "What a great way to start off the year, by welcoming a new customer and launching a mission tailored just for them. Today’s launch is a great showcase of the benefits of flying dedicated on Electron: accurate constellation deployment, streamlined access to space, and the reliability of consistently delivering mission success for our customers.” The upcoming year for Rocket Lab includes a busy manifest of Electron launches for new and repeat customers across its launch sites in Virginia and New Zealand, with Rocket Lab’s next Electron launch scheduled to take place shortly from Launch Complex 1.

Good morning. Bumping into a leading European chief executive as he left the Congress Centre in Davos last night, I asked for a take on President Donald Trump’s speech. “I think we are just tuning out of all that noise a little. Did he say anything we didn’t expect? Was there anything new?” He continued: “We are focusing on our investments, on the AI transition, on security, on our three-to-five-year plans.” He had been at a dinner the night before and that was also “the mood of the table,” American and European. There is only so long you can maintain your risk antenna at 11 on the dial—even as a chief executive. I sense the mood here at Davos was respectful of Trump but resolute in its sense that there are other pressing issues to consider. Fortune hosted a series of panels at USA House, America’s “home base” for the duration of the World Economic Forum. We heard from Novartis CEO Vas Narasimhan; Robin Vince, chief executive of BNY; Kellyanne Conway, former counsellor to the president; Mark Penn, CEO of Stagwell; and Ray Dalio, founder of the world’s largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates. Dalio, leaning on his decades of investment experience, urged business leaders to step back from the day-to-day and focus on the trends—conflict, indebted western governments, and major technology shifts. Trump may be playing in some of those lanes, but not in all of them. “But when you have the president of France saying that we are flirting with a world without rules, surely that will strike fear into leadership teams?” I asked him. Businesses need to sharpen up, he responded, and realize that change is with us for good. On the global stage, Europe can often appear to speak with one voice. But it is more nuanced than that. At our event at USA House, Nigel Farage, leader of the Reform party in the U.K., spoke about the reaction against globalization—a reaction he supports—and said that Trump was a success. Farage’s party is ahead in the polls. Yes, Farage did urge the president to remember the sacrifices of NATO members such as Denmark in U.S.-led conflicts in, for example, Afghanistan. And that self-determination for Greenland was the same as the American desire for freedom from Britain 250 years ago. Davos is about the nuances. It can be easy to ridicule. But for that CEO I bumped into, off to yet another dinner to discuss the transformational nature of AI, the hunt for the signal over the noise continues.—Kamal AhmedContact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com President Trump, the dealmaker President Trump has taken a strong business approach to his second term, making unprecedented deals with private-sector leaders like Nvidia and institutions like Columbia University. One year into his presidency, Fortune digs deep into Trump’s record as “CEO-in-Chief.” Inside Eric Trump’s American Bitcoin Last spring, Eric Trump launched American Bitcoin, a mining venture he says is designed to help the U.S. become “the crypto capital of the world.” Fortune went inside the massive data center behind the operation to learn more about the newest arm of the Trump crypto empire.

Despite the candidate having no experience in merchandising or leading a retail store, his background in e-commerce and supply chain operations reveals where the retail giant sees its future. S&P 500 futures are up 0.61% this morning. The last session closed up 1.16%. STOXX Europe 600 was up 1.34% in early trading. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 was up 0.79% in early trading.

January 21, 2026 19:00 ET | Source: Rocket Lab Corporation Rocket Lab Corporation Long Beach, CA Long Beach, CA LONG BEACH, Calif., Jan. 21, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced an update relating to the development of its Neutron rocket. As the Company pushes Neutron to the limits and beyond to qualify its systems and structures for launch, qualification testing of the Stage 1 tank overnight resulted in a rupture during a hydrostatic pressure trial. Testing failures are not uncommon during qualification testing. We intentionally test structures to their limits to validate structural integrity and safety margins to ensure the robust requirements for a successful launch can be comfortably met. There was no significant damage to the test structure or facilities, the next Stage 1 tank is already in production, and Neutron’s development campaign continues while the team assesses today’s test outcome.The team is reviewing the Stage 1 test data, which will determine the extent of the impact to Neutron’s launch schedule. The Company intends to provide an update on the Neutron schedule during its 2025 Q4 earnings call in February.
