The world’s richest man Elon Musk, who doubles as President Donald Trump’s chief of cost-cutting, took a sizable hit to his net worth as the stock market shudders at Trump’s tariffs, causing shares of Musk’s multinational car company Tesla to flounder. Elon Musk at the Oval Office last month. Musk’s net worth fell by $8.8 billion Thursday to $342.8 billion, according to Forbes’ real-time estimates. Musk’s fortune is now down $121.2 billion from its end-of-day record of $464 billion set Dec. 17, when Tesla stock closed at an all-time high $480 per share. Down 6% on the day, Tesla stock closed at just above $263, some 45% below its end-of-day record set late last year. Tesla ended Thursday trading at its lowest share price since Election Day. The Tesla slump came as the S&P 500 fell 1.8% to a 2025 low as Trump’s tariffs on Canada, China and Mexico ate into investor sentiment. Musk remains by far the richest person on Earth, leading No. 2 Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Meta, by more than $120 billion. To put the $121 billion Musk lost in perspective, the 10th-wealthiest person on the planet, former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, has an estimated net worth of $118.9 billion in total. Asia’s wealthiest person, India’s Mukesh Ambani, has an $89.8 billion fortune. 4.8%. That’s how much Tesla shares were up from Election Day to Thursday, a fraction of the 91% rally they enjoyed through Dec. 17. Tesla’s initial post-election surge came as Wall Street bet Musk’s near $300 million donation toward Trump and GOP election efforts would translate into a big win for Tesla, which would especially benefit from lighter regulation for its self-driving initiatives. Musk is still $78 billion wealthier than he was on Election Day, benefiting in part from higher valuations for his private companies SpaceX and xAI. Tesla is particularly sensitive to tariffs as China is the second-largest market for its electric vehicles and the company, like other American automakers, relies on imports from Canada to produce its cars. Tariffs “will have an impact on our business and profitability” considering Tesla is “still very reliant on parts from across the world for all our businesses,” Tesla’s chief financial officer Vaibhav Taneja warned in January. Musk is arguably the most important member of Trump’s administration as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). “Musk's involvement with DOGE and the Trump administration broadly may affect some buyers in the US and Europe, which complicates the setup from a demand perspective,” Baird analyst Ben Kallo wrote in a Thursday note to clients.

Title: Dealmakers Head to New Orleans to Look Beyond ‘Havoc’ in M&A

(Bloomberg) -- Dealmakers gathered at an annual conference in New Orleans this week to catch their breath and try to look for reasons to be optimistic about a mergers and acquisitions market that has disappointed so far in 2025. “People want to do deals,” Audra Cohen, co-managing partner at law firm Sullivan & Cromwell’s general practice group, said during a presentation Thursday at Tulane University’s Corporate Law Institute event. She was speaking against a backdrop of falling deal values, with activity in part impacted by US President’s Donald Trump’s policies on the economy and foreign affairs. “Things like the tariffs give people a little bit of pause because they’re having to look at their business, at the supply chain and trying to figure out what that means,” Cohen said. “Until a little bit of this settles, it’s going to be challenging to get deals done particularly at valuations that people would expect.” Every year around this time, Wall Street’s clubby network of M&A lawyers, bankers and public relations professionals heads to Louisiana to talk shop at Tulane. Many dealmakers began 2025 expecting a banner year under Trump. But they’ve instead crashed into the harsh reality of trade wars and geopolitical clashes. “There’s a lack of predictability right now,” said Scott Barshay, chair of the corporate department at Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison. “Our clients are kind of waiting and seeing right now to see how things sort out. There’s a lot of interest in doing things.” Barshay said that the head of a company that was seeking to pursue a big transaction recently told him that the company plans to “wait a little while,” as it didn’t want to strike a deal only to see the market crater the next day. Barshay said he still expected the year to end on a positive note. “There’s just a little bit of a pause but I don’t think it’s a lot of pause,” he said. “I think we’re going to see over the next few weeks announcements of some bigger deals coming out.” ‘Wreaks Havoc’ Global deal values are down about 16% in 2025 to roughly $485 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Jennifer Muller, co-head of Houlihan Lokey Inc.’s special committee advisory and fairness and solvency opinions practices, said it will be hard for values to hit the $3.5 trillion that many had expected this year. This week’s movement in the VIX Index, a closely watched measure of stock market volatility, is a worry, she said. “In order for M&A and IPOs to flourish, typically market volatility needs to stay below or around 20 on a consistent basis,” Muller said. “Most have predicted that Trump’s actions would create some enhanced volatility and indeed the VIX has been dancing around 20 and yesterday ended around 20. This wreaks havoc with M&A transactions.” Muller said she saw potential for a pickup in activity in deals around artificial intelligence, pharmaceuticals, financial services and oil and gas. Another wrinkle in the M&A market under Trump 2.0 is that the US government could want more of a say in negotiations around deals that it sees as having the potential to impact America’s competitiveness. This week, BlackRock Inc. led one of the biggest acquisitions of the year in a deal that marked both the firm’s expanded reach in infrastructure and a win for Trump, who had raised concerns over control of key ports near the Panama Canal. “Political leaders are getting into the deal process and [asking] for political concessions around the deal,” said Leo Strine Jr., of counsel in the corporate department at Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz. “That’s a new dynamic. If the US is going to involve itself in who does a deal, if the US government has a perspective on a cross-border deal, is the other government going to be involved?” More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Bitwise's investment through Maple Finance highlights the accelerating trend of institutions seeking attractive yields in DeFi markets. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitwise has taken a significant step into DeFi with its first institutional allocation through Maple Finance. This initiative will allow Bitwise to access on-chain credit while maintaining compliance with institutional regulatory standards on Maple’s platform. The firm, which manages over $12 billion in client assets, announced the move in a statement shared with CryptoSlate on March 6. Following the news, Maple Finance’s native SYRUP token increased by almost 10% to $0.145 as of press time. According to the statement, the development highlights the increasing demand for yield-generating opportunities in digital assets, particularly among institutional investors. The firm noted that its move signals a broader trend of institutions expanding beyond traditional fixed-income markets and exploring on-chain lending as a more efficient and scalable alternative. Jeff Park, Head of Alpha Strategies at Bitwise, emphasized the growing role of tokenization in institutional adoption. He noted that while many misuse terms like “tokenized securities” and “securitized tokens,” the latter is poised to drive real institutional adoption due to its practical benefits in the crypto ecosystem. Park added: “Private credit on crypto rails remains one of the most immediate opportunities for institutions who are looking to achieve high risk-adjusted yield with the additional benefits of liquidity, transparency, and efficiency that only DeFi can provide. With regulatory clarity that is being unleashed in D.C., it is now only a matter of time.” Meanwhile, the partnership between Bitwise and Maple Finance could pave the way for wider adoption of regulated on-chain lending platforms. Institutional investors are increasingly looking to credit markets as a source of alpha, and Maple’s growing track record positions it as a key player in this space. Nikolai Milutin, an ambassador for Maple, said the move shows that institutional adoption of on-chain credit is now underway. He added: “Bitwise has taken the first step by leveraging DeFi through Maple. This move signals a turning point—other institutions will follow, and it won’t be long before giants like Coinbase, Binance, and BLACKROCK take notice.” Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Shipping Giant MSC Set to Become World’s Largest Terminal Operator in $22.8B Hutchison Ports Deal

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. MSC ships at the Port of Long Beach. Photo courtesy Port of Long Beach In a landmark deal announced on Tuesday, Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison will sell its 80% stake in Hutchison Ports Holding to a Blackrock-TiL consortium, positioning Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC)—already the world’s largest ocean carrier by far—to become the global leader in container terminal operations, according to Drewry’s analysis of the deal. The $22.8 billion transaction, the largest ever in the global container terminal sector, comes amid heightened political scrutiny over Chinese influence in critical maritime infrastructure. Notably, the deal also includes the sale of Hutchison Port Holdings’ 90% interest in Panama Ports Company, which operates the Balboa and Cristobal ports on opposite ends of the Panama Canal. Since December, President Trump has repeatedly criticized alleged Chinese influence over Panama Canal operations and discriminatory practices against the U.S.—claims that the Panamanian government has firmly rejected. “My administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we’ve already started doing it,” Trump said in his address to a joint session of Congress this week. “Just today, a large American company (BlackRock) announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals.” Drewry’s global terminal operator (GTO) rankings show Hutchison Ports currently operates 43 maritime container terminals outside China and Hong Kong, spanning from Australia to the UAE, with a combined capacity exceeding 73 million TEU and throughput of nearly 47 million TEU as of 2023. MSC’s existing portfolio, which includes a 70% stake in Terminal Investment Limited (TiL), full ownership of Africa Global Logistics, and various Italian terminals through Marinvest, handled over 70 million TEU in 2023, according to Drewry. “The proposed deal will see MSC leapfrog other leading GTOs to secure the top spot in the global terminal operator rankings which Drewry produces each year, securing the Swiss-headquartered container carrier a truly global network of container terminals,” points out Eleanor Hadland, Drewry’s Lead Analyst for Ports and Terminals. However, regulatory hurdles may complicate the acquisition. Drewry’s analysis reveals key areas of concern include Panama, where TiL already holds significant interests opposite Hutchison’s operations; Rotterdam, where the deal could affect competition across Northwest Europe; and Spain, where both companies maintain substantial terminal presence. Drewry notes that the partnership leverages a longstanding relationship between MSC and Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), now owned by Blackrock. GIP’s initial 35% stake in TiL, acquired in 2013 and currently at 20%, has proven crucial for TiL’s expansion. “This deal appears to be a major win for MSC, which secures additional capacity in several key markets,” concludes Hadland. “We do however expect the regulatory processes to extend for at least a year, and foresee competition authorities taking a particular interest in the Northwest Europe, Spain and Panama markets.” Join the gCaptain Club for curated content, insider opinions, and vibrant community discussions.

Title: Blackrock reach Leinster Schools Senior Cup final after proving too strong for Roscrea

The traditionalists wouldn’t have it any other way. Brian Walsh and James Browne scored a brace of tries each as Blackrock qualified to meet Terenure in the Leinster Schools Senior Cup final at Tallaght Stadium on St Patrick’s Day. Roscrea almost got the perfect start. Rob Carney made a strong carry, taking a number of would-be tacklers with him, but Sam Cusack couldn’t quite take the offload. Blackrock hit back straight away. Harry O’Neil and Michael O’Sullivan made dents but Aiden Vetjens was rattled by Keelan Dunne for a knock-on. No matter, ‘Rock props Ben Guerin and Sam Bishti straightened an attack. The ball found Johnny O’Sullivan knifing through for Paddy Clancy to convert in the 11th minute. From a scrum, the ‘Rock boys then moved wide for Johnny O’Sullivan to eat up metres. Brian Walsh took Geoff Wall’s flat ball for a try, converted by Clancy for 14-0 in the 15th minute. Still, Roscrea’s maul was starting to gather momentum and Eoin Naughton claimed a confidence-boosting try. Jack Deegan converted. When Johnny O’Sullivan made his next incursion, Albert Lindner looked a racing certainty to make the line until Sam Cusack caused a spill in the act of grounding. [ Michael Smyth grabs hat-trick as Terenure see off St Fintan’s to book final slotOpens in new window ] Nevertheless, the Williamstown school was slipping through the gears. Something had to give and it would be Roscrea’s fringe defence off a maul. Number eight Walsh peeled off for his second try, converted by Clancy for 21-7 at half-time. Roscrea, however, were not quite ready to accept their fate and Deegan kicked a penalty to narrow the deficit early in the second half. But ‘Rock stormed back and, following a Vetjens interception, Johnny O’Sullivan sent Browne over in the corner for 26-10 in the 39th minute. Roscrea still had an ace to play. A smooth lineout was moved to Deegan, whose venomous in-to-out movement ended beside the posts where he converted for 26-17 in the 50th minute. Another interception, by Bernard Whyte this time, put Blackrock back where they wanted to be deep in Roscrea territory. Fionn Carney prevented a try by Vetjens, but Bishti couldn’t be stopped. Clancy converted for 33-17 in the 65th minute. That was the ball game. There was still time for Michael O’Sullivan’s break and sound handling to see Browne into the right corner to clinch a day with destiny. Blackrock: J Reddan, J Browne, J O’Sullivan, B White, A Vetjens; P Clancy, A Lindner; B Guerin, H O’Neill, S Bishti (Capt), G Wall, A Smykovskiy, M Walsh, M O’Sullivan, B Walsh.

Title: Software engineers at Google, Microsoft, and more share their best tips for landing a coding job in tech

Working as a software engineer isn't what it used to be — but those working in the industry have some tips for getting ahead in the increasingly crowded job market. The software engineering industry is going through a major shift driven by the adoption of AI, which has led to fewer job postings, layoffs, and evolving responsibilities for those still working in the field. In early to mid-2022, there were three times as many software engineering roles listed on Indeed. This chart shows just how much the opportunity landscape has changed. As AI coding tools like GitHub Copilot or Replit have become more prominent, a large part of the job has become automated. In Salesforce's most recent earnings call, its CEO Marc Benioff said the company is seeing a "30% productivity increase in engineering" and won't "hire any new engineers this year" in the wake of those gains. Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in an earnings call in 2024 that over a quarter of the company's code is generated by AI before being checked by employees. A manager at Microsoft similarly shared that AI reduced 70% of the time he used to spend on coding, although he noted that his daily workload hasn't been reduced. That's because software engineers do more than just code. For newer entrants to the field, though, the opportunities are narrowing, and some have struggled to get the foundational skills needed to move up. Some recent software engineering grads have said they sent hundreds of job applications with minimal responses. That's led some to pursue a "panic Master's" degree to put off the hunt. It's not all doom and gloom, though. Automating coding tasks has increased the demand for developers to leverage their creativity and experience. Here's some of the advice from industry veterans and tech CEOs on how to improve your odds of getting a job in the field — and success stories from those who have done it. Jump to

Appointment as lead plaintiff is not required to partake in any recovery. CONTACT US HERE: https://securitiesclasslaw.com/securities/merck-co-inc-loss-submission-form/?id=134090&from=3 CLASS PERIOD: February 3, 2022 to February 3, 2025 ALLEGATIONS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Merck’s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck’s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil’s growth in China. The full truth finally emerged on February 4, 2025, when Merck announced it would no longer achieve the long-forecasted $11 billion in sales of Gardasil by 2030, as it would cease shipments of Gardasil to China “through at least midyear” to facilitate a “rapid reduction of inventory.” Defendants claimed this was necessitated by the continued over-inflation of overall channel inventories as demand in China for Gardasil had “not recovered to the level we had expected.” Following this news, Merck’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $99.79 per share on February 3, 2025, Merck’s stock price fell to $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025, a decline of more than 9% in the span of just a single day.

I’m Barry Ritholtz and we’re gonna discuss how investors should think about. Inflation as a driver of returns. To help us unpack all of this and what it means for your portfolio, let’s bring in Austin Goolsbee. He’s president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. Previously he was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors and member of Barack Obama’s. Presidential Economic Recovery Advisory Board following the great financial crisis. So let’s just start out with a simple question. You’ve talked about the golden path between inflation and recession. What lesson should the Federal Reserve take from our recent and rather successful bout with, uh, disinflation? Yeah, Barry, thanks for having me on. Look, I called the Golden Path. You’ll remember as I came into the Fed, I started the very beginning of, of 2023 in December of 2022. It was the Bloomberg economist who said there was a 100% chance of recession in 2023 because. The historical record suggested that to get rid of inflation, you had to have a big, nasty recession. That’s what had happened at all times, and what I called the golden path was in 23, we had as almost as large a drop. In inflation that we have ever had in a single year. And not only was there not a recession, the unemployment rate never even got above 4%. A level that a lot of folks thought is below full employment. Um, that, so that was a Golden Path year. And I think one of the principle lessons, there were a couple of principle lessons that explain how it was possible. One was. The supply side was healing on the supply chain, and there was a big surge of labor force participation from a number of groups. I think a, a lot of it tied to the workforce flexibility, but if you saw, if you looked at self-described disabled workers, highest labor force participation ever, if you looked at, uh, child age. Women, again, highest labor force participation ever. So you got a number of positive supply shocks that are exactly what allowed for the immaculate disinflation, which the people who thought that was impossible use that phrase mockingly. But that is exactly what happened. And now, fast forward to today. Um, so in a way transitory became, as Steve Leeman’s phrase, transitory, but it, it was all because the supply side, when you get negative supply shocks, they do heal. But one of the lessons of COVI was, that might take longer than you thought ahead of time because the supply chain. Is complicated, the modern supply chain, and you, you know, that the, the Chicago Fed is the seventh district and we’re like the Saudi Arabia of, of auto production. Uh, in the seventh district. We got Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, soon. If you go talk to the auto suppliers, that’s sounds like the mother of all supply chains. Okay? So a single car has up to 30,000 different parts and components in it, and every single one of ’em has its own supply chain. And you’ve probably seen some of these people that will track one individual part. Through the US supply chain and the way that it cut, you know, a transistor came from Asia, then they sent it to Mexico, they put it into a capacitor. They put the capacitor in a seat, gets sent to the seat manufacturer in Michigan, it goes to Canada, comes back to the us, finally gets put in a car and you go buy it on the lot and drive it out. In an environment like that, the spillovers take can take a long time. That’s what we saw in Covid that. You couldn’t get computer chips, so you couldn’t make the electronic seat so they couldn’t make the car. So the price of cars went up. Then that meant the rental car companies couldn’t get new cars, so the price of rental cars went up. Then the, the whatever, the used cars salesman who used the rental car, and so that thing played out over years, not weeks. My fear now is that if you’re going to do something negative on the supply side, and make no doubt about it, tariffs on intermediate goods like steel, like parts and components, like the things that are getting sent from auto factories, from suppliers in Canada that are getting sent over the border to be fa fabricated in into the car in Michigan. That’s a negative supply shock. And I hope that it’s small enough or short-lived enough that it doesn’t reteach us the lessons of covid. But, but it might, the, the, the lesson of Covid was that can have, if it’s big enough, that can have a longer lasting impact than, than you might have thought at the beginning. So let me ask you a question, um, about. That recession that never showed up, forget a hundred percent chance of recession. 22, 23, 24. Half of the Wall Street economists were forecasting recessions and no less August. And, and well regarded economists, uh, than Lawrence Summers was saying, Hey, you’ll need 10% unemployment to bring this inflation down. What was it about? The historical models that seem to have gotten gotten, that seems to have gotten this economic cycle so wrong? Well, that, that’s the critical question. And summers said it either had to go to 10%, or if it went to 6%, it would take five years of unemployment above 6%. I think the thing that it got wrong, I That worldview got wrong is that it was rooted in almost all previous business cycles were regular demand-driven business cycles. And that’s, that’s the logic in a demand-driven business cycle. You overstimulate, e inflation goes up, inflation expectations go up, and you have a hell of a time getting it out of there. As, as you know, I was a old dear friend. With Paul Volcker, and he was a mentor of mine and, and a, and a personal hero, really. Um, and one of the lessons of the Volcker episode, which was a time when inflation expectations went way up, is that it’s extremely painful if the Fed or the central bank does not have credibility. It’s extremely painful to get rid of inflation. In an environment where the Fed is credible, so that even as headline CPI, inflation was approaching double digits, the Fed was announcing we will get inflation back to 2%. And if you go look at the market estimation from tips or from others, people believed it. If you looked at the, what do you think inflation will be in five years, they were saying it will be back to 2%. That is a sign of credibility of the central bank. So A, you must have credibility, and B, you must have the good fortune. That’s positive supply shocks in our case, one, a big increase in labor force, uh, participation. That that was enabled, I think, by some of the more flexible work arrangements. Two, that we had had such a horrible supply chain experience coming through covid with shortages, et cetera, that could heal. And then three, a pretty substantial uptick in the rate of productivity growth. That combination was a lovely combination that allowed inflation to come down without a recession. And I think that the, the chat GPT AI version of a central bank. Would’ve got it wrong because it would’ve been based on a training sample that was a whole bunch of demand shocks. And this really wasn’t a demand shock induced, uh, business cycle. And you don’t look, it doesn’t take somebody with the market acumen that you have Mary, and it certainly doesn’t take a PhD to look out and recognize that the covid business cycle was driven by. Industries that are not normally cyclical. Normally cyclicals like consumer durables. Or business investment are the thing that drives the recession. And here the demand for consumer durables went up because people could not spend money on services. This is the only recession we ever had that came from people not being able to go to the dentist. And the thing about that is like the, the, the dentist is normally recession proof. And so that’s why we, everybody should have been more humble in pronouncing. What the future would be coming out of such a weirdo business cycle. Um, and, and we’re still kinda living with that, so, so let’s talk about humility. You have specifically mentioned that the Fed needs to be, quote, more careful and more prudent about rate cuts due to the risk of inflation kicking back up again. So what specific inflation indicators are you watching closely in 2025? Okay. I’ve, I’m, I’m thankful, Barry, I thought you were gonna be like, let’s talk about humility. You once said, and I thought, you’re gonna be like, you’re not, you’re not a humble person. Look, my, I, I have actually been. B before we got to this dust in the air period where everybody’s talking about major, either geopolitical changes to conditions or changes to policy conditions that might affect inflation. I’ve been more confident. I, I, I’ve had comfort. We’re still on the path to get inflation to 2% and we could cut rates now. I’m open to, to being proven wrong, and if I adjust the, the, uh, I’m in the data dog caucus, if, if the data come in and the, the outlook is changing, for sure, I would change my view. But the, I, I think it’s critical to answer your question specifically of, well, what should we look at in inflation? I think number one. You want to look at the through line on inflation, not get overly indexed on monthly gyrations. It’s a very noisy series. Mm-hmm. Okay. So looking over a longer period and what matters is the new months coming in the the inflation that’s a 12 month backward looking average, which is usually what we’re reporting it, 11 of the 12 months. That are included in that are not new information. We already knew that. We knew, for example, that the blip up in inflation last January, more than a year ago was gonna fall out the back, and so that it would be very likely that the 12 month average would start dropping here in the first quarter, but that would not be a sign that the inflation is falling right now. The inflation already fell. This is just like how, how we do the average. So number one, I put a lot of weight on the new months coming in and trying to get the through line of that, not just react to, to one month. And. Uh, second thing that that helps me that I, that I find helpful is looking at the components of core inflation. Now, I know it can drive people nuts, like it drive my mom nuts that we put our focus on core inflation and not food and energy inflation because my mom’s like, what do you mean you’re not paying attention to food and energy inflation? That’s very public, uh, top of mind for her. It is because those are so variable. They’re up, they’re down. The, we think the better observation is to look at core, and then within core there’s goods, there’s services, there’s housing. Our problem has been. Goods inflation had returned to deflation and was looking good. Housing inflation’s been the biggest puzzle. Mm-hmm. And services inflation. Pretty persistent. The thing that have given me, the things that have given me a little more confidence lately is that even as we had a bit of a blip up in the inflation. Here, the components still look pretty good. The housing inflation has finally started falling on a pretty persistent basis as we’ve been wanting it to services getting closer, much closer to what it was pre covid housing back close to what it was pre covid. And the thing that has been firmed up here in the last couple of months has actually been goods. And the thing about goods inflation is. As you know, uh, and, and as some of my, uh, research showed before I ever got to the fed goods, inflation over long periods is actually deflation. The, the, the, the 2% inflation that we were at before Covid was housing three and a half to four. Per year services two and a half per year and goods minus a half to minus one per year. And so I think it’s overwhelmingly likely that goods will go back to that very longstanding trend and as it does, so that’s the, those are the kinds of things that give me confidence. So you mentioned housing. We seem to have two ongoing issues with housing. The first is it appears that since the financial crisis. We’ve significantly underbuilt single family homes as underbuilt. Yeah, I agree with that. As the population can and, and multifamily. So, so you have the population growing, you still have fairly, uh, decent immigration numbers. Too much demand, not enough supply. The first question, what can we do to generate more supply and housing, do higher rates? Operate as a headwind against builders, contractors, developers, putting up more housing. Look, this, this is a t tangled, uh, this is a tangled web, uh, that is critically important to, to the economy. You’ve seen the relative price of housing go way up post covid. But the one thing that I wanna highlight is. Yes, it’s very noticeable, but it’s not new. If you look like, like I said, for the whole decade plus pre covid, you had house prices going up three and a half percent a year. Goods prices going down 1% a year. If you just compare housing relative price versus going to Costco, relative price. A thing that compounds 5% a year for 15 or 20 years. Yeah, that’s gonna be a really big difference at the end of that time. And so I think one component that people are seeing, and they’re not wrong, you see the frustration of young people. They say, you know, when my, when my dad was, was 25 years old, he on one job could, could afford a decent house and I can’t buy a condo. They’re not wrong. The relative price of housing has gone way up. I think some component of that is, uh, regulatory in nature and business permits, and I’ve been convinced by a, by a bunch of the evidence that land use regulation have made it very difficult for us to build housing of any form, single family home, multi-family homes. I have a. I did some research that was about the construction industry. And the another thing going on is that overall productivity in the construction industry is not only been stagnant, it’s actually over long periods of time been negative. Mm-hmm. That we’ve, we’ve gotten worse at building the same things that, that we did 20, 30 years ago. Um, so I think that’s, that’s part of it. And I think you’re highlighting that. Uh, rates do have a twin. They, they, they do have a twin, twin effect. One is they affect demand, but the other is they do affect construction. Um, and so I, I think in a higher rate environment, if you’re trying to cool the economy, this is always true. But the shift of more and more of our mortgages to being 30 year fixed. Than they were say in 2007, um, have meant that changing rates can have more of a lock-in effect than. And, and, and it kind of dull the immediate impact of, of monetary policy than, than it does in, in a, in a more immediate mortgage impact environment. Let, let’s wonk out a little bit about housing. Yeah. Um, yeah. Owners’ equivalent rent have been this bugaboo for a long time that some people following the financial crisis said had understated housing inflation. Now there’s some people, uh, saying something similar. How do we, and I know the Fed has looked at this, there’ve been a number of white papers that have come out of the Fed. How should we think about the equivalent of renting versus ownership in terms of the impact on inflation? Uh, the, IM, uh, the, you raised several key critical points. Um, if we’re gonna walk out on housing and inflation. Point one, it’s not single family home sales prices. It’s owner equivalent rent. Plus rents. And the reason it’s that is because part of buying a house is a financial asset. So if you’re buying a house and the value’s going up and you’re selling it for more, and if there’s speculation, that’s not really housing what you’re trying to get. That’s, that’s not really inflation. What you’re trying to get for housing inflation is something like the CPI, how much more does it cost for the same housing services? Um, and that’s why they try to compute owner equivalent rent and, and, and similar 0.2, that’s, there’s a heavy lag in the way they do it. So in a way, the critics were correct that it was understating inflation. On the way up and the, the other critics are right that now it’s overstating inflation on the way down. For the same reason that it’s kind of like if you were measuring average rent and people were raising the, it was a time when the market was raising the rent. It’s gonna take time before that shows up in average rents because. The, the contracts last for a year. Andre, 12, 20 months, they’re over. So you get this automatic lag in there. I think that has been a major component of measured housing inflation because if you go look at market-based measures, like from Zillow or others, they were showing rapid drops in the inflation rate back to, or in some cases even below. What inflation was before Covid started and so that’s been the puzzle. That’s is been our impatience. Why hasn’t it shown up yet? That’s been true for quite a while. And the lag theory, it’s should start showing up. Well, finally it has, and that’s why I have a little more confidence that the housing inflation improvement. Will be lasting is, it was, it took a long time to run up and now it’s finally started coming down. So I think it’s, it’s probably got legs of coming down. Um, so I, I think those are two key components on, on the housing inflation side. We could get, we could even go into a third layer of wonky, but it’s more subtle, which is. The component if, if you think about rents and say market rents in Zillow or who are renters versus who are new home buyers, there’s sort of different markets. And so it doesn’t have to be that the inflation rate of the Zillow market rents matches the owner equivalent rents. Th that they’re measuring at at the BLS because they might be different new renters and, and existing tenants might be a little bit two separate markets. Makes a lot of sense. You mentioned the 2% inflation target in the 2010s, an era dominated by monetary policy. The Fed had a 2% inflation target. Now, in the 2020s, we have a primarily fiscally driven economy, or at least post pandemic. Yeah, that’s what it feels like. You’ve said you’ve turned 180 degrees on the inflation target questions since your initial thoughts in 2012. Tell us about that. Explain that. Okay, so in 2012 th there had been vague targets. In 2012, I believe, is when the Fed officially said, where you have a 2.0% inflation target and you go back and look, I wasn’t at the Fed. I was critical. I was publicly critical on the grounds that that conveyed a way, false sense of precision to me. That, that if, if I asked you just take the, take the standard deviation of. Of the inflation series and ask yourself, how many observations would you need to get to be able to distinguish between a 2.0% inflation rate and a 2.1% inflation rate? And the answer was like decades. You’d need decades of monthly observation before you could tell no, no, this is 2.1, not 2.0. So that was my critique. Fast forward to. The inflation, now it goes way up. And the, the, the, the, the one wonky thing that you gotta know, which you already know Barry, but the, the average person might not know is I. The 2.0% inflation target is for personal consumption, expenditure inflation. PCE inflation. That’s not CPI. It’s a little different. They have different weightings of, of what goes into it. We believe the PCE measure. Which instead of the CPI measures a basket. Mm-hmm. And the PCE measures everything consumers spend money on. So it’s the better measure. But just as a technical CPI of 2.3 is about the equivalent of a PCE of 2.0. Okay. We go through covid, the inflation post covid soar to almost double digits. In long run inflation expectations measured in the market never go up. They remain exactly and they’re off of CPI. Importantly, they remain exactly 2.3%, and so I said either that’s the biggest coincidence in the history of price indices. Or else the inflation target of 2.0 is serving as exactly the anchor that its advocates said it would be. And at that point, I changed 180 degrees and I, not only am I not opposed to the inflation target, I. I think it’s critical. It’s vital and it is serving as exactly the anchor that we needed, so So it’s a magnet, not necessarily magnet. A landing spot magnet. Exactly. Really interesting’s a you, you mentioned, but it will be the landing spot. It will be you, you, we’ll get the 2%. You mentioned inflation expectations when, when we look at some of the survey DA data in 2020 and 21, right before inflation really exploded higher. They were really low. And then go fast forward to June, 2022, just as inflation was peaking, they were really high. How close attention does the Fed pay to inflation expectation? It seems that it’s very much a lagging, not leading indicator. Uh, now fascinating. Uh, in a way a, I should have said at the beginning. Uh, you know the rules. I’m not allowed to speak for the FOMC Sure. Or the Fed only for myself. Yes. That gives them great relief. That gives my colleagues great relief. Um, in the world of food safety, the thing that characterizes almost every, uh, worker in the food supply chain is frustration. Why do we have to wash our hands all the time? There’s no, nobody’s ever getting sick from the food. And it’s only because they’re washing their hands all the time that nobody’s getting sick from the food. I feel that way. A little bit about inflation expectations. They are lagging indicators. If the Fed has credibility and is doing it right, as soon as that’s not true, they become very instructive, forward-looking indicators. The, the only thing that I want to emphasize as well is. N Now we’ve actually started to get a couple of observations where not short run expectations, but longer run expectations actually bumped up in the University of Michigan survey, and since I had said this about how important inflation expectations were as a measure, a couple of folks asked me, well, does that make you nervous? And yes, but. A, I’ve always said I value the market-based measures more than survey-based measures, and one month is no months. But make no doubt about it, if what we started to see was persistent, a persistent increase in long run expectations of inflation in surveys and markets. And for example, if you started to see long rates rising, one for one with long run inflation expectations, then that fundamentally to me means the Fed’s job is not done and we’ve got to go address that. Because if you, that’s the, that’s one of the main lessons of the Volker experience. And central banks around the world, if the expectations start rising, it is really hard to slay. You don’t have to just slay the inflation dragon. You have to go convince people that it’s going to stick, and it kind of the only way we know. The only way we know central banks have been able to convey that is to have awful recessions where they grind down wages. Mm-hmm. To convince people look that we will keep the job market, um, as suppressed as we need to. As proof that we’re serious. So we don’t ever want to get back into that situation if we can help it. Last question on inflation. You have mentioned that prioritizing real economic channels, the real economy over wealth effects. Can you, can you explain this perspective? Why does the real economy channels matter more to the wealth effects? I, I always thought the wealth effect was. So dramatically overstated because you know, it’s typically the wealthy that owns most of the stocks, and the real economy is the real economy. But I’m curious as to your perspective. Yeah, look, it, it the, I would expand it a little more than just the wealth effect. My view is the Federal Reserve Act tells us we should be looking at the real economy, maximizing employment and stabilizing prices. The stock market. Other financial markets can influence those two things, partly through the wealth effect. But I’ve, by the very first speech I gave, when I got to the, to the Fed, I went out to Indiana and the, uh, factory, um, where they make the, where they make RVs and. And, uh, a, a community college where they train people for advanced manufacturing. And I said this, look, the fed by law is supposed to be looking at the real economy and financial markets. To the extent they’re affecting the real economy, we should pay attention to them. But that’s, that’s it. Like, let’s remember the priorities. Um, I quantitatively agree with you. I think there are a number of people who overweight. The, the wealth effect and its impact on consumer spending. Uh, and I don’t want us to get into a mindset that the Fed has an accomplishment. If it does something and it changes the financial markets, that’s a, that’s a indirect, I in my, in my worldview, if you get the real economy right, the financial markets will benefit, but. Doing something to try to create higher equity prices or benefit the financial market. That should not be the Fed’s goal. The Fed’s goal should be stabilize prices, maximize employment, and and focus on the real side. And if you do both of those, stock market tends to do well under those circumstances. The stock market does great, takes care of itself. And that’s how it should be. That’s how it should be. Well, thank you Austin. This has been absolutely fascinating. I have a, so we’ve only done the first segment, but it’s 1145. How hard is your 1145 stop. 10 45 by you. What can we do? How do you think we could do the next in five minutes? No, I, I got a board. I got my, my Detroit board of directors that starts at noon in a different room. So I could go, I could go. Five, six minutes. But then I got, so let me just give you, I’ll just give you one more question on inflation and if we ever wanna redo the second discussion on monetary policy, we can always squeeze that in. But I need like, so neither you nor I are brief, so we tend, we. Tend to go a little long and they’ll tighten this up for, for broadcast. Okay. Do you want me to be tight? I can be tighter. That’s fine. Um, but to go through 10 questions can, let’s take five minutes. We got five minutes. However much we want to fit in there. All right. So let me find my best question from this. Um. You wanna know one from here and one from the other, or I’m just, yeah, I’m just looking for what, uh, what really works. All right. So here are two, two good questions. So you’ve mentioned that conditions have not materially changed despite recent economic data. Do you still expect to see, uh, interest rates a fair bit lower over the next 12 to 18 months? I still do. If we can get out of this dusty environment, look, the I I I’ve highlighted, look, you gotta look at, look at the horizon and look at the through line. And when we’re having a bunch of uncertainties that are about things that will increase prices, it’s just throwing lots and lots of dust in the air and it’s hard to see the through line. I still think that underneath there. Is a robust, healthy economy with employment, pretty much stable at full employment, inflation headed back to 2% GDP growth, solid and strong. And we can get back to the resting point of normal. Um, in, in that kind of environment if we’re gonna have an escalating. F trade war that leads to higher prices and a stagflationary kind of environment where GDP growth is falling. I could revise, um, I, I could revise my, my economic outlook, but I still think if we can get past this dusty part over 12 to 18 months. The SAP dot plot tells you that the vast majority of members of the committee believe that the ultimate settling point for rates is well below where we are today. And so I still think that, that we can get there. And our final question, I, I love your self description. You have said, I’m neither a hawk nor a dove. I’m a data dog, so now we have to add That’s right. Hawks. I don’t like birds. I don’t wanna Dogs haw, stuss and dogs. So, explain, um, how you as a data dog, how does that affect your approach to monetary policy, especially in 2025, where you are a voting member? I, it, I try to get out there. Uh, the, the first rule of the Datadog kennel. Is that there’s a time for walking and there’s a time for sniffing and know the difference and the time for sniffing is exactly when there is not clarity. Okay? And that is go get every data series you can, every frequency. Don’t throw anything away. If you can get private sector price information, get it. If you are looking at the job market, don’t just look at payroll employment when. There’s a bunch of stuff with population growth and immigration that make it noisier. Don’t just look at the unemployment rate. When labor force participation changes can, can affect it. Take ratios of unemployment to vacancies. Look at the hiring weight and the quit rate. Get out and talk to the business people in, in our regions and the kind of information that goes into the base book. All of those things are more real time than just the data series, but that mentality that if you, if you have a question, get out there and sniff. That’s the essence of the Datadog credo. If, if, if you wanna and look, it comes with some downsides. Um, if you are more theoretical, ideological, there are times when you might be right and, and you can get to the answer quicker, but. This seems like a very uncertain environment. Unusual, unprecedented business cycles, nothing like things we’ve seen before. So just personally I’m more comfortable with, with that kind of approach. Hmm. Real really fascinating stuff. Thank you, Austin, for being so generous with your time. 1149 and 30 seconds. I don’t wanna make you late. Whenever you wanna do the second, I’m a big fan and, and well thank you. It’s a real treat for me. Thank you. Very. So whenever we wanna do another one of these, we can talk about monetary policy, we can talk about whatever. Happy to schedule it at your convenience anytime. And we’ll run it whenever. That’s great. Alrighty, that’s great. Thank you so much. Talk to you later. We’ll talk to you soon and I’ll, I’ll record the intros and outros now and we’ll do that. Thank you. Austin Ya. All right, so I’m gonna end the. I’m gonna end this. I’m just gonna shut this, uh, here, and then we’ll just keep recording. Leave meeting, uh, no, no. Zoom market. Go away. All right, so I’m gonna record an outro. This is gonna be a tough one to edit. Are you gonna do it or is, uh, Colin or Bob? All right, I’ll, I’ll circle back to her. So, to wrap up. If you’re an investor interested in what’s going on in the economy, looking at inflation, looking at monetary policy, it’s simply not as black and white As you often hear about, uh, many of the voting members of the FOMC, uh, look at the data that’s out there as complex and not binary. Uh, there are a lot of moving parts. Don’t think that what you’re hearing in these headline, um, reports are remotely giving you the full color of what’s happening. There are obviously a whole lot of moving parts here, uh, a lot of complexity, and it’s reassuring when you hear from people like. Chicago Federal Reserve President and FOMC, voting member Austin Gouldsby, who are data driven, who do focus on filtering out the noise, but paying attention to the most recent trends, but following the through line. It’s not simple, it’s complicated. We really need to bring a more intelligent approach than we often see. Uh, when. In as investors, we think about. What the federal reserve’s gonna be, what’s gonna happen, what the Federal Reserve is gonna do in response to what inflation is doing. Uh, perhaps if we had a little more sophisticated approach and a little less binary, we wouldn’t see people being so wrong about when the Fed’s gonna cut, when a recession is gonna happen. What’s going on overall with the robustness of the economy. Hey, it turns out that. Economics is hard. It’s complicated. There are lots of moving parts. We oversimplify this at our own, uh, risk.

Title: Shipping Firms Pull Back from Hong Kong to Skirt US-China Risks

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Port Of Hong Kong Stock Photo: leungchopan / Shutterstock.com HONG KONG/LONDON, March 6 (Reuters) – Some shipping companies are discreetly moving operations out of Hong Kong and taking vessels off its flag registry. Others are making contingency plans to do so. Behind these low-profile moves, six shipping executives said, lie concerns that their ships could be commandeered by Chinese authorities or hit with U.S. sanctions in a conflict between Beijing and Washington. Beijing’s emphasis on the role of Hong Kong in serving Chinese security interests and growing U.S. scrutiny of the importance of China’s commercial fleet in a possible military clash, such as over Taiwan, are causing unease across the industry, the people told Reuters. The U.S. Trade Representative’s office last month proposed levying steep U.S. port fees on Chinese shipping companies and others that operate Chinese-built vessels, to counter China’s “targeted dominance” of shipbuilding and maritime logistics. USTR’s $1.5M Port Fee Proposal on Chinese Ships Sparks Industry Confusion Over Critical Definitions Washington in September warned American businesses about growing risks of operating in Hong Kong, where the U.S. already applies sanctions against officials involved in a security crackdown. Hong Kong for more than a century has been a hub for shipowners and the brokers, financiers, underwriters and lawyers supporting them. Its maritime and port industry accounted for 4.2% of GDP in 2022, official data show. The city’s flag is the eighth most-flown by ships worldwide, according to VesselsValue, a subsidiary of maritime data group Veson Nautical. Reuters interviews with two dozen people, including shipping executives, insurers and lawyers familiar with Hong Kong, revealed growing concern that commercial maritime operations could be ensnared by forces beyond their control in a U.S.-China military clash. Many pointed to China’s intensified focus on national security objectives; trade frictions; and the broad powers of Hong Kong’s leader, who is accountable to Beijing, to seize control of shipping in an emergency. “We don’t want to be in a position where China comes knocking, wanting our ships, and the U.S. is targeting us on the other side,” said one executive, who like others was granted anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue. The concerns of shipowners and their actions to curb exposure to Hong Kong have not been previously reported. The perceptions of risk have grown in recent years, coinciding with a tightening security climate in the Chinese-ruled city and tensions between the world’s two largest economies. Commercial ships must be registered, or flagged, with a particular country or jurisdiction to comply with safety and environmental rules. Despite an influx of Chinese-operated ships onto Hong Kong’s registry, the number of oceangoing vessels flagged in the city fell more than 8% to 2,366 in January from 2,580 four years earlier, according to independent analysis by VesselsValue. Government data show a similar drop. Among the ships that left Hong Kong’s registry, 74 re-flagged to Singapore and Marshall Islands in 2023 and 2024, chiefly dry-bulk carriers designed to transport commodities such as coal, iron ore and grain. Some 15 tankers and seven container ships separately left the Hong Kong registry for those flags, according to VesselsValue. The outflow of ships since 2021 marks a reversal for Hong Kong’s registry, which official data show grew roughly 400% in two decades following 1997. In response to Reuters questions, Hong Kong’s government said it was natural for shipping companies to review operations given changing geopolitical and trade circumstances, and normal for the number of ships on registries to fluctuate in the short term. Hong Kong would “continue to excel as a prominent international shipping centre”, a spokesperson said, outlining a range of incentives for shipowners, including profits tax breaks and green subsidies. Neither the laws governing the registry nor emergency provisions empowered Hong Kong’s leader to commandeer ships to serve in a Chinese merchant fleet, the spokesperson said. The spokesperson declined to elaborate when asked about industry players’ concerns over how colonial-era emergency powers might be applied during a U.S.-China conflict. The provisions allow the city’s leader to make “any regulations whatsoever”, including taking control of vessels and property. China’s defence and commerce ministries didn’t respond to questions about the role of a merchant fleet in Beijing’s warfighting plans, the potential involvement of Hong Kong-flagged vessels, and the worries of commercial shipowners. The U.S. Treasury and Pentagon declined to comment about potential sanctions, shipping executives’ concerns, and the role of Hong Kong-registered vessels in a Chinese merchant fleet. Lawyers and executives say ships can be re-flagged for various reasons through sale, charter or redeployment to different routes. Basil Karatzas, U.S.-based consultant with Karatzas Marine Advisors & Co, said Singapore had become the preferred domicile for companies with lesser exposure to Chinese shipping and cargo trade, because it offered many efficiencies, including its legal system, but less risk than Hong Kong. Singapore’s Maritime and Port Authority said decisions about domiciles and flagging were based on commercial considerations. It had not observed any “significant change” in the number of Hong Kong-based shipping companies relocating operations or re-flagging vessels to Singapore. Hong Kong’s shipping registry is widely regarded for its safety and regulatory standards, executives and lawyers say, allowing its ships to pass easily through foreign ports. Hong Kong’s flag is now flown by many of China’s state-owned international vessels. In a conflict, these tankers, bulk carriers and large container vessels would form the backbone of a merchant fleet serving the People’s Liberation Army to supply China’s oil, food and industrial needs, according to four security analysts and PLA military studies. By contrast, the U.S. has a small commercial shipbuilding industry and far fewer ships under its flag. While China’s state-owned fleet is growing in size, it would be a target for the U.S. in a military clash, and Beijing would likely require other vessels to ensure supplies given its vast needs and reliance on international sea lanes, three analysts said. Strategic maritime operations have surfaced on President Donald Trump’s radar. In his inauguration speech in January, Trump threatened to “take back” the Panama Canal, which he said had fallen under Chinese control. He did not give specifics, but Trump’s remarks focused attention on two Panama ports operated by a subsidiary of Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings 0001.HK. The group, which didn’t respond to questions about Trump’s comments, agreed this week to sell a majority stake in the subsidiary to a consortium of investors led by BlackRock BLK.N, giving U.S. interests control over the ports. Trump told Congress on Tuesday that his administration will create an office of shipbuilding in the White House and offer new tax incentives for the sector. A U.S. congressional study in November 2023 stated that “cargo ships typically transport 90% of the military equipment needed in overseas wars”. It noted that Chinese shipyards had 1,794 large oceangoing ships on order in 2022, compared with five in the U.S. Merchant vessels were vital in Britain’s long-range mission to retake the Falkland Islands from Argentina in 1982. And UK-flagged commercial ships operating out of Hong Kong – many owned by local firms dependent on or controlled by China – supplied communist Hanoi during the Vietnam War, frustrating the U.S., declassified CIA documents show. The need for a strong Chinese merchant fleet to help build China’s maritime power was outlined by President Xi Jinping in a Politburo study session in 2013. Over the last decade, Chinese government and military documents and studies have highlighted the dual-use military value of China’s merchant ships. Regulations enacted in 2015 required Chinese builders of five types of commercial vessels – including tankers, container ships and bulk carriers – to ensure they could serve military needs, according to state media. Since then, the state-owned COSCO line has grown significantly. Public COSCO documents show China is placing political commissars – officers who ensure Communist Party goals are ultimately served – on nominally civilian ships. In January, the U.S. blacklisted COSCO subsidiaries for what it said were links to the Chinese military. COSCO did not respond to questions about its deployment of commissars, the U.S. restrictions and what role the company’s ships, including Hong Kong-flagged ones, might play in a wartime scenario. Hong Kong remains an important base for shipowners, despite the geopolitical challenges. But some are quietly hedging their bets. One company founded in Hong Kong in 2014, London-listed Taylor Maritime TMI.L, now has a smaller presence in Hong Kong after making several strategic moves over the past few years. Since 2021, it has kept its ships flagged in the Marshall Islands and Singapore. Its offices are in London, Guernsey, Singapore, Hong Kong and Durban. The firm “really de-risked Hong Kong”, said a person familiar with the matter, citing investors’ concerns about a Chinese invasion of Taiwan and the Communist Party’s increasing control of Hong Kong. A Taylor Maritime spokesperson said that initially, the company moved its Asia-based commercial teams to Singapore from Hong Kong to be closer to clients. With its acquisition of shipping company Grindrod, which had its Asia office in Singapore, Taylor Maritime expanded its operation there and relocated some functions from Hong Kong, to the point where Singapore became its primary Asia hub, the spokesperson added. Hong Kong-listed Pacific Basin Shipping 2343.HK has traditionally flagged its 110-strong fleet of bulk carriers in Hong Kong but is drafting contingency plans to register them elsewhere as it gauges potential risks, said two people familiar with the matter. A Pacific Basin spokesperson said the company was constantly evaluating geopolitical risks but that its fleet was still flying the Hong Kong flag, “which at least for now outweigh(s) the challenges”. “Being in Hong Kong positions us close to China’s 40% share of global dry bulk import/export activity and close to Asia’s strong economic and industrial growth regions,” the spokesperson said. Angad Banga, chairman of the Hong Kong Shipowners Association, said shipping firms adjusted contingency plans based on risk assessments in a complex geopolitical environment but he had not encountered concerns about the commandeering of vessels. “While some may be reviewing operational strategies, we as an organisation do not to see any widespread exodus or loss of confidence in Hong Kong,” Banga told Reuters, adding that the city remained attractive for maritime commerce. Yet some industry figures described a broad unease about Hong Kong that was affecting their planning. Three lawyers said that until recent years, contracts hammered out for the growing number of ships built in China and financed by Chinese banks typically stipulated that they must fly the Hong Kong flag. But over the last two years, some have included a caveat demanded by owners to provide flexibility: a few other prominent flags are listed as options alongside Hong Kong, the lawyers said. Reuters could not independently verify the changes. Beyond China’s military modernisation and its refusal to renounce the use of force to seize Taiwan, Beijing officials have stressed the importance of Hong Kong in fulfilling national security priorities. Three executives and two lawyers told Reuters that sweeping security legislation, first imposed on Hong Kong in July 2020 and strengthened in March 2024, had added to the dangers. The lawyers said any move by Hong Kong’s leader to commandeer vessels in an emergency might prove difficult in practice, as locally registered ships often plied routes far from Hong Kong. But such long-standing powers now had to be viewed through a national security lens, they said. Some shipowners wouldn’t object to an official request to turn over their vessels, either out of patriotism or the potential to profit from a crisis, one lawyer said. But “it is better not to be in a position where you might even be asked”, said another veteran lawyer. “It was not an issue just a few years ago, in what is clearly a redrawn national security map.” (Reporting by Greg Torode and Jonathan Saul; additional reporting by Andrea Shalal and Idrees Ali in Washington, and the Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong newsrooms; editing by David Crawshaw) (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2025.

Title: As Trump Hails Taking Back of Panama Canal, Hong Kong Inc Walks Tightrope

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio tours the Miraflores locks at the Panama Canal in Panama City, Feb. 2, 2025. Mark Schiefelbein/Pool via REUTERS HONG KONG, March 6 (Reuters) – Hong Kong‘s edge as a financial hub will erode further as the city becomes embroiled in China-U.S. tensions, with the flash sale of a Hong Kong-owned global ports business highlighting geopolitical volatility, executives and analysts said. The former British colony is caught in the eye of a storm between Beijing and Washington, underlined by the decision by conglomerate CK Hutchison, controlled by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, to sell its ports network, including assets along the Panama Canal, to a U.S. consortium led by BlackRock. U.S. President Donald Trump, who claimed in January that the Panama Canal was being operated by a Chinese company, has hailed the deal. “The Trump administration is going to see that this worked…and you have to assume they’re going to follow the same play book…(they) see this as a victory,” Steven Okun, a senior adviser to financial and risk advisory Kroll, told Reuters. As the U.S. strives to contain its main global rival China on fronts including trade, shipping, technology and capital raising, a dozen business people, investors, lawyers, shipping executives and risk analysts who spoke to Reuters say this is bringing greater uncertainty and volatility to Hong Kong. Hong Kong firms have traditionally been seen as internationally-focused and independent of the Chinese state, reflecting the role of the former British colony as a freewheeling financial hub. “We have been constantly reviewing our business plan and discussing about our strategy because of the political tension,” said an executive of a listed Hong Kong company who declined to be named given the sensitivity of the topic. “For example, do we still want to list our units in Hong Kong and is Hong Kong still attractive as a listing venue, because investors could draw a China connection,” he told Reuters. Hong Kong has a separate rule of law from China and its own financial policy-making autonomy, but some lawyers, diplomats and business executives say that after China’s imposition of a national security law in 2020, the city was essentially being viewed by the West as fully under the control of Beijing. This has hurt it economically and cast doubt on whether it is a jurisdiction separate from mainland China with global best practices, they said. Earlier this year, Hong Kong’s Far East Consortium and Chow Tai Fook Enterprise, which owns a development with Star Entertainment, the embattled casino group in Brisbane, tried to buy Star out. If successful, the bid will be another test of regulators who view Hong Kong companies as Chinese. In 2018, Australia blocked a A$13 billion ($8.2 billion) takeover of the country’s biggest gas pipeline company, APA Group APA.AX, by CK Infrastructure, a unit of CK Hutchison, citing it would be against the national interest. “Hong Kong is being increasingly lumped in with China … that’s a fact,” said a board member of a leading Hong Kong business family with interests locally and overseas, including retail and property. “To a degree, this has raised the complexity and cost in our business dealings. We have to live with this.” According to a person with knowledge of the matter, CK Hutchison had initially tried to fight to keep its two main port businesses in Panama after Trump alleged the Panama Canal was under Chinese control. But later, Hutchison opted to cash out and mitigate longer term reputational risks. “People in the Hutch empire are running for cover,” said the person with knowledge of the ports negotiations, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue. “This is a nightmare situation and we’ve never dealt with anything like this before.” This source added that CK Hutchison executives were in touch with officials in Beijing while the situation unfolded. CK Hutchison did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Co-managing director Frank Sixt said in a statement this week the ports transaction was “unrelated to recent political news reports.” The Hong Kong government has said it has never interfered with the commercial operations of Hong Kong companies, and criticized U.S. officials for making what it said were unreasonable and distorted accusations regarding the operation of the Panama Canal. “It’s been politicized and weaponised,” a senior Chinese government official said of the Trump administration’s framing of Hutchison as a Chinese entity – something the firm has denied. “It’s unfortunate and regrettable,” the official told Reuters, declining to be identified. Others, including business executives and lawyers, agreed that Hong Kong is increasingly being viewed as similar to other Chinese cities, even though officials like the territory’s financial secretary, Paul Chan, say the city remains a global hub for the free flow of capital, goods and people. “The market is based on expectations,” said Vera Yuen, an economics lecturer with the University of Hong Kong business school. “The valuation (of Hong Kong) is based on what they (the world) think, not what you claim.” Even ahead of the recent Trump administration pressure on Hutchison’s Panama ports, some local firms with international reach had been drawing up contingency plans to deal with growing U.S.-China strategic rivalry – and a growing sense Hong Kong would be in the crosshairs in a conflict. In 2023, Hong Kong-based conglomerate Swire Pacific sold its Swire Coca-Cola USA unit to its controlling shareholder, John Swire & Sons Ltd headquartered in the U.K., to protect the business so that it would no longer be seen as being held by a “Chinese company,” two sources with knowledge of the matter said. A Hong Kong shipping firm executive described how his operation was already presenting its international posture in meetings with foreign investors. “The key is being as international as we can – our offices, domiciles and ships,” the executive said. “We want to be able to show we are not really based anywhere.” ($1 = 1.5780 Australian dollars) (Additional reporting by Greg Torode and Jessie Pang in Hong Kong; Scott Murdoch in Sydney and Beijing Newsroom; Writing by James Pomfret; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan) (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2025.

Video Llewellyn King is the creator, executive producer and host of “White House Chronicle,” a weekly news and public affairs program, airing nationwide on PBS and public, educational and government... Video recording of the session at the bottom of this post, along with open Q&A discussion from the session taking place actively on the Energy Central Community: Lee Zeldin, new Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, has said, “It’s important for us urgently to do everything in our power to make sure Americans have the cleanest air, land, and water. That’s something that keeps me up at night." Environmentalists and many in the energy sector believe the Trump administration is doing just the opposite. It has taken aim at a raft of laws and regulations which protect the environment, including the National Environmental Policy Act, bulwark of a vast structure of environmental laws and protections since it was signed into law by President Nixon in 1970. There is alarm in the utility industry about the administration’s antipathy to wind generation. Its enthusiasm for coal alarms clean air advocates who see it as a step backward. There also is alarm about the future of transitional funding guaranteed during the Biden administration, under the Inflation Reduction Act, to enhance clean energy and finance transition from polluting fuels to green ones. That funding is frozen and the Department of Government Efficiency operatives have slashed employment in the Department of Energy’s loan office. What now? The rural electric cooperatives are worried about $9 billion in financing they were to get from the Department of Agriculture for rural electrification projects. Lesser laws like the Endangered Species Act, it is feared by their defenders, may be repealed or circumvented. The United States Energy Association at its most recent virtual press briefing, conducted on March 5, examined what to expect from the Trump administration in its reshaping of environmental policy, and the nature and scope of the legal opposition. Court challenges have already been filed and many more are expected. As usual, a panel of experts were questioned by a panel of senior journalists who cover energy and the environment. Journalist Llewellyn King organized and moderated the press briefings, which are broadcast live on Zoom and last an hour. Mark Menezes gave welcoming remarks and was on hand to share his deep knowledge as president and CEO of USEA and as a former deputy secretary of energy. The Experts: The Reporters: Ongoing Q&As Taking Place Post Session on EnergyCentral.com: No discussions yet. Start a discussion below. The world seems unable to contain emissions. Are the various carbon capture technologies the answer?

Title: Even your weight loss drugs aren't safe from tariffs

Novo Nordisk (NVO-1.01%), the maker of the popular diabetes and weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, expects at least some short-term impacts from President Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs. “We still have products moving across borders like most global companies,” Novo Nordisk CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen told Bloomberg on Thursday. “Of course there’ll be some short-term impact as we mitigate the impact of tariffs.” The Denmark-based company’s stock fell nearly 3% Thursday morning following his comments. Jorgensen noted that even when drugmakers manufacture in the U.S., they typically rely on ingredients sourced abroad. He emphasized that generic drugs would be hit the hardest, potentially causing shortages and driving up prices in general. Since taking office, Trump has proposed several tariffs. He announced last month plans to impose tariffs “in the neighborhood of 25%” on imported vehicles, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals starting in April. Meanwhile, 25% tariffs on most imports from Mexico and Canada took effect on Tuesday, and duties on Chinese goods were raised by 10%. Trump also suggested that tariffs on imported goods from the European Union are “coming very soon.” And he recently signed a memorandum that directs his advisers to draft new “fair and reciprocal” trade tariffs on all major U.S. trading partners. Jorgensen’s comments also come as Trump has pushed pharma companies to bring more production to the U.S. as part of his broader effort to boost domestic manufacturing. In February, Trump met with top industry executives, including Eli Lilly (LLY-4.09%) CEO David Ricks. A week later, Eli Lilly announced plans to invest $27 billion in four new U.S. manufacturing facilities. Pfizer (PFE+1.81%) CEO Albert Bourla also said this week that the drugmaker could move some of its overseas manufacturing to its U.S. plants, if necessary. Novo Nordisk announced last year that it is investing $4.1 billion to build a new facility in Clayton, North Carolina.

Follow: Government by chaos is back. One day, President Donald Trump imposed a punishing tariff regime against Canada and Mexico. The next, he froze auto duties for a month after suddenly realizing that – as everyone had predicted – they could wreck a quintessential American industry. Last week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky came to the Oval Office to sign a rare-earth minerals deal that Trump billed as a triumph for the US. But Zelensky was provoked by Vice President JD Vance and kicked out of the White House. European leaders have spent days trying to fix the debacle. Elon Musk, meanwhile, is taking his chainsaw to the bureaucracy, indiscriminately firing workers and feeding agencies into the wood chipper – pitching citizens and industries who rely on government payments into uncertainty just as the economy softens and is more vulnerable to such shocks. At first, Trump’s early-term energy on multiple fronts was a bolt of energy as he scratched his Sharpie across executive orders and chased away the lethargy that marked President Joe Biden’s waning months in office. Six weeks in, however, as Trump makes gut-check calls to dismantle post-Cold War national security arrangements, the global free trade system, and the federal machine – all of which helped make the US a superpower – a new realization is dawning. There doesn’t seem to be a plan. Trump’s haphazard efforts to make peace in Ukraine, revive Rust Belt-heavy industry with 19th century-style tariffs and slash government are as improvisational as the “weave” – his name for his stream-of-consciousness campaign screeds. And the world is once again left hanging on the “America first” president’s whims and obsessions. “There’s too much unpredictability and chaos coming out of the White House right now,” Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly said Wednesday, describing US trade policy as a “psychodrama” her country can’t go through every 30 days. America’s friends are often left to puzzle over what exactly Trump is trying to do. The president, for instance, said Wednesday that Canada hadn’t done enough to stem the flow of fentanyl over the border – but only minuscule amounts of the drug are involved. Sometimes the White House complains about the flow south of undocumented migrants – but these numbers are also small. Trump also wants manufacturing to leave Canada and move south. No wonder some officials in Ottawa have concluded he’s trying to weaken their country to make it easier to annex. Still, the president can point to some successes with his threat-based foreign policy. For instance, his fury that a Hong Kong-based firm owned two ports at either end of the Panama Canal is precipitating a purchase by US investment giant BlackRock. The president had falsely claimed these ports meant China controlled the vital waterway built by the US, but the change of ownership may still improve the US strategic position. And Trump might be downgrading the transatlantic alliance that has kept world peace for 80 years – but he’s set off an unprecedented rearmament program among NATO allies that other presidents have demanded for years. But just as often, it’s as if Trump is more interested in brute force personal power than working off any long-term playbook. Michael Froman, a former US trade representative who chairs the Council on Foreign Relations, told Jim Sciutto on CNN International Wednesday that while the cost of imposing tariffs often outweighs the benefits, they can be a tool that gets other nations to the negotiating table. This is true in the case of Mexico with which the US has far wider border issues than Canada. But, Froman added, “you have to know what it is you want them to do for that leverage to be useful.” To some extent, the chaos is the point. And the theatrics of a president addicted to stunt politics are key to his political appeal. But allied governments have their own politics to worry about – a factor the Trump administration often seems to ignore. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum – who is, like Trump, new in office and keen to make a mark – said Wednesday that her country could consider alternative trade partners to the United States “if necessary.” On Tuesday, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer pointedly paid tribute in the House of Commons to British soldiers who were killed fighting alongside the United States in Iraq and Afghanistan. This followed a comment by Vance on Fox News that Ukraine needed better security guarantees than undertakings from “some random country that has not fought a war in 30 or 40 years.” The vice president’s remark caused great offensive in Britain. He said on X that claims he’d been talking about Britain and France were “absurdly dishonest,” but those are the only allies who have so far publicly volunteered to take part in a post-peace deal reassurance force in Ukraine. And French President Emmanuel Macron warned his compatriots Wednesday evening the world had changed utterly since Trump returned to the White House, adding that he was considering extending the protection of France’s nuclear arsenal to European allies. For some MAGA supporters, Trump’s genius for enraging Democrats, the media and foreign governments is an end in itself. And for ideologues on the populist nationalist right, sparking pandemonium in Washington and destroying governing agencies is a way of deconstructing the administrative state. Trump’s method was honed in his office high up in the skyscraper that bears his name in Manhattan. The future president learned through his real estate career how to push opponents off balance with outlandish demands, verbal confrontations and sudden switches of position. In government, he does the same thing to disorientate adversaries and seeks to impose power amid the mayhem. But while unpredictability is a real estate superpower, it’s a liability when running a country, an economy and a planet – where continuity and predictability are preferred. “It’s just constant, and it’s exhausting,” said Julian Vikan Karaguesian, a former Canadian Ministry of Finance official, referring to Trump’s scorched-earth tariff offensive. “It’s almost surreal. Is it real? Is it going to be real this time?” Karaguesian, who now lectures at McGill University in Montreal, added: “Maybe the modus operandi here is uncertainty. It’s not tariffs, it’s not anything else, but intentionally creating a sense of chaos and a sense of uncertainty.” The auto tariffs that the president froze for a month on Wednesday, a day after imposing blanket 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, shows how he sometimes has second thoughts about his own aggression. Perhaps his favorite barometer, the stock market, forced his hand. His concession reversed two days of steep losses on the Dow Jones Industrial Average with a handy near-500-point rebound. CNN reported Wednesday that Trump relented after conversations with the CEOs of the Big Three automakers. And his press secretary Karoline Leavitt said he was open to “hearing about additional exemptions.” The idea that well-placed CEOs can use their access to the powerful to acquire exemptions and special favors not available to ordinary Americans is the antithesis of an equitable economy. But then Trump has shown little respect for rules-based systems that eliminate the kind of patronage and potential for corruption that thrives in autocratic societies. Trump’s approach may also mean he likes threatening tariffs more than imposing them. But by constantly threatening tariffs and then creating doubt about whether or when they will be maintained, the president is causing huge uncertainty for businesses that need to establish certainty of costs and supply and consumers who could damage an already-softening economy if they rein in spending. “There’s so much uncertainty about what the administration is doing that the mere prospect of tariffs is creating a big anchor on the economy,” Bharat Ramamurti, former deputy director of Biden’s National Economic Council, told reporters on a conference call Monday. “The prospect of significant tariffs on our allies has resulted in withholding investments and preemptive price increases that are going to be borne by small businesses and, ultimately, by consumers.” Trump’s relentless bullying of America’s friends – while seemingly doing everything he can to advance its traditional adversary Russia in Ukraine – may also drain US power in the long run. “What we have seen this week is that the dollar has suffered a very sharp decline,” Ruchir Sharma, founder and chief investment officer of Breakout Capital, told Richard Quest on CNN International. “It’s revealing that the rest of the world is getting its act together … and I think investors are beginning to notice there are other countries worth investing in, given all this policy volatility that is emerging in the US,” he said. The danger for the US therefore is that four more years of Trump’s antics could reshape the globe – in a way that does not comply with his vision of US dominance but leaves Americans looking in from the outside. Mexico and Canada, for instance, can’t change the geography that makes it a no-brainer to trade with the mighty US. But both also may see advantages in expanding trade and investment with America’s rising rival China. And the European Union, which is expecting its own barrage of Trump tariffs soon, may examine similar horizons. America’s Western allies have too much invested in generations with ties with Washington to want it to fail. But they have their own national interests too. Canada can’t win a trade war against its more powerful neighbor. But its patience is thin over Trump’s brinkmanship and bullying. Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario, home to Canada’s largest provincial economy, says the only way forward is for Trump to eradicate all tariffs rather than an a la carte easing of duties industry by industry, as with autos. “All this gives us is uncertainty again,” Ford told CNN’s Phil Mattingly on Wednesday. “There is one person that’s causing that problem today: that’s President Trump.” © 2025 Cable News Network.

Title: What Happens in a Recession?

A Wealth of Common Sense Posted March 6, 2025 by Ben Carlson A reader asks: I’ve seen some pundits (*cough* Chamath *cough*) now shifting their stance to “short-term pain for long-term gain” from all of the political upheaval we’re seeing. Basically the idea is a recession will actually be useful because home prices, stock prices and interest rates will go down. I think this is nuts but wanted to hear your take — are there any positives from a recession? In just a few short months we’ve gone from worries about an economy that could be at risk of overheating to worries about the economy slowing dramatically. GDP estimates for Q1 have gone from nearly +4% a month ago to -2.8% in a hurry: These estimates are not set in stone, but economic activity is slowing. One thing we’ve learned these past few years is that no one is good at predicting the timing of recessions, but that doesn’t stop people from speculating about the potential ramifications of an economic contraction when it finally arrives. Here’s what Chamath had to say on Twitter about the prospect of Trump’s no policies potentially throwing the country into a recession: It’s a long one so allow me to summarize: A significant percentage of the country doesn’t own much in the way of financial assets like stocks or a house. If we have a recession that should bring stock prices and housing prices down which would make them more accessible to more people. He’s looking for a silver lining. I get that. I’m a glass-is-half-full guy too. This sounds great in theory. Plenty of young people would like more affordable home prices and a better entry point into the stock market. A recession would also likely mean lower borrowing costs so mortgage rates would be lower. What’s not to like? Since 1950, there have been nine bear markets. The average drawdown in those bear markets was a loss of 35.5%, lasting 406 days from peak to trough. The ability to buy stocks on sale should be a welcomed development for young people or anyone who will be a net saver in the years ahead. The problem is you don’t get to experience recessions in a vacuum. People lose their jobs. Businesses cut back or go belly up. People spend less money. It’s harder to find new employment or get a promotion. Wages fall. Big raises go away. During the 2008 financial crisis and its aftermath there was a constant drumbeat of: You’re lucky to even have a job. You want a raise. In this economy?! That lasted for years after the technical recession had ended. A lot of finance people look at recessions through the lens of spreadsheets and charts. I’m guilty of this too. But the human toll from a recession cannot be overstated. Ronald Reagan once said, “A recession is when your neighbor loses their job. A depression is when you lose yours.” Be careful what you wish for. JP Morgan once said, “In bear markets, stocks return to their rightful owners.” Some interpret that as a behavioral lesson where only those investors with enough intestinal fortitude to lean into the pain will buy when stocks are on sale. There is some truth to that. However, those “asset-light” individuals will struggle to pay their bills or keep their jobs during a recession because they have no support from financial assets. Who do you think is going to lean into the pain and buy? The people who buy will be the ones who already have the money. The top 10% of households by wealth own nearly 90% of the stocks in the United States. They’re the ones who can keep buying in a downturn. Right or wrong, those are the rightful owners JP Morgan was referring to. I also hate to be the bearer of bad news to prospective homebuyers but there is no guarantee that housing prices will fall, even if we go into a recession. This is housing price performance during every recession going back to 1960: There was a brief decline in the 1990 recession and of course the Great Financial Crisis saw housing prices get walloped. Other than that, housing prices have been among the best hedges against a recession. If the economy contracts, we may see some relief in mortgage rates. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean housing prices will drop. In fact, lower rates could actually drive more demand for homes, especially since activity has been sluggish with 7% mortgage rates. While increased market activity would be a positive development, it wouldn’t automatically lead to lower prices. It would be a good thing to see more activity in the housing market but that might actually lead to higher prices. Personally, I would rather we don’t have a recession. Job loss is painful. It can set people back years of their lives. However, you also have to recognize that you have no control over the reason for a recession–whether it be a financial crisis, pandemic, government policy, inflation or something else. Whatever your station is in life you have to be prepared for a national or personal recession at some point: Recessions can be a good thing for certain individuals and businesses. There have been a handful of great businesses founded during periods of economic pain — Airbnb, Uber, FedEx, Microsoft and LinkedIn to name a few. But I’m not going to sit here and tell you to hope for a recession. Recessions are bad and we should avoid them if possible. The drawbacks far outweigh the benefits.

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: The rocky week on Wall Street continued on Thursday as investors grappled with further uncertainty from President Donald Trump’s tariffs. US stocks opened sharply lower but fluctuated on the mixed messaging coming from the White House. All three major indexes closed lower, despite Trump announcing a nearly one-month tariff delay on all products from Mexico and Canada that are covered by the USMCA free trade treaty. Earlier in the day, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC that the president would likely announce a one-month tariff delay on products that are covered by the USMCA. The Dow closed lower by 428 points, or 0.99%. The broader S&P 500 fell 1.78% and the Nasdaq Composite slid 2.61%. The Nasdaq closed in correction territory, down 10% from its record high in December. That leaves the Dow down almost 3% on the week, on track for its worst week since March 2023. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are both on pace for their worst week since September 2024. The market is in the red during Trump’s presidency in part because of the uncertainty the administration’s trade policy has caused. The Nasdaq has fallen more than 7% since Trump took office, and the S&P 500 is down more than 4%. Investor sentiment is struggling due to the persistent uncertainty around tariffs, according to Rob Haworth, a senior investment strategist at US Bank Wealth Management. “Eventually, that uncertainty is just going to weigh too much on business decisions and those forward prospects for earnings growth,” Haworth said. Also in focus for investors: recent data revealing the extent of recent layoffs and renewed concerns about spending on artificial intelligence. Futures tied to the Dow had tumbled in early trading as new economic data showed unease in the labor market. US-based employers last month announced plans to slash 172,017 jobs, a 103% increase from January and the highest February total since 2009, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas’s latest monthly job cuts report. Related article US employers cut more jobs last month than any February since 2009 Futures tied to the Nasdaq 100 also fell in early trading as companies focused on the AI trade posted mixed earnings results and guidance for this year. Marvell Technologies (MRVL), a chipmaker, fell by almost 20%. Nvidia (NVDA) and Palantir (PLTR) also slid, dragging the Nasdaq lower. Chinese tech giant Alibaba on Thursday announced its own AI model, challenging upstart DeepSeek as well as OpenAI, raising questions about whether the AI boom in the US is worth the money that is being poured into it. Thursday’s decline is a reversal of the rally on Wednesday afternoon, highlighting that investors lack clarity and confidence about the next developments in the brewing trade war between the US and its biggest trading partners. “For now, tariff-induced inflation amid slower growth could bring the economy dangerously close to stagflation,” said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL financial, in a note Wednesday. The US dollar index, which measures the dollar’s strength relative to six other currencies, fell to its lowest level since November — signaling a weakening outlook for US economic growth. Investors will be closely attuned to the government’s monthly jobs report Friday, set to be released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics at 8:30 a.m. ET. and giving investors more insight into how the economy is doing. “I think if we see the hard data start to come in much weaker, that’ll become more and more concerning for the market,” said Haworth. “Extreme fear” has been the sentiment driving investors for the past week, according to CNN’s Fear and Greed Index.

Title: How a falling dollar index [DXY] can push Bitcoin to $100,000

The dollar index is having a positive effect on BTC. In the last 24 hours, Bitcoin [BTC] has seen a gradual price increase, crossing back into the $90,000 region. It was around $92,500 as of this writing, following a 6.12% gain. This recent accumulation is driven by the Dollar Index losing strength and investors gradually building buying momentum. If sentiment continues to grow, the asset is likely to see a major push to the upside and cross above the $100,000 region. There has been a decline in the U.S. Dollar Index [DXY], which measures the strength of the dollar against a basket of six commodities. Historically, a weakening dollar index tends to benefit cryptocurrencies like BTC and altcoins. In the last two market cycles—2017 and 2021—BTC gained ground and saw major market moves following a decline in the dollar index. A similar trend was observed with altcoins, which experienced significant gains, as seen in the chart below. Source: X If key levels hold as indicated and the DXY chart follows the pattern of the past two cycles, the cryptocurrency market, particularly BTC, could gain an edge for an upswing. The amount of Bitcoin sold in the spot market over the past 24 hours has begun to decline. As of the time of writing, BTC sales totaled $163.54 million on the 5th of March but have since dropped to $87.12 million. If this trend continues, it is more likely that investors will begin accumulating again, leading to increased exchange net inflows. Similarly, the fund market premium—which measures whether investors are buying or selling based on whether it is above or below zero—was at 0.2 at press time, indicating buying activity. Source: CryptoQuant However, a closer look at the chart shows that the fund market premium has remained at a similar level since March began, moving along a steady line. This suggests that investors are likely accumulating BTC in anticipation of a major upward move. After days of consistent market outflows from the Bitcoin exchange-traded funds [ETF] market—indicating institutional investors are selling BTC—the sentiment is shifting. BlackRock, a notable institutional investor with over $50 billion in BTC ETF via IBIT, has stopped selling. When selling slows or halts, it often signals that investors are reassessing their positions and may soon resume buying, especially in a bullish environment. At the time of writing, BTC ETFs recorded an inflow of $22 million in the past 24 hours, indicating renewed interest among institutional investors.

A biotech company’s new therapy has done something remarkable: help children who were born blind to see for the first time. Publicly-traded MeiraGTx has developed targeted gene therapy methods to treat genetic disorders, like one that degrades the retina, impacting hundreds of children born each year. But the company isn’t just working on eye-related disorders: It has its sights set on treating Parkinson’s. Zandy Forbes, an alumna of Forbes 50 Over 50 who is not related to the Forbes family, started MeiraGTx in 2015. In the first nine months of 2024, the biotech firm reported about $12 million in revenue, and Forbes expects that to increase when its first therapy is approved by regulators.

President Donald Trump exempted U.S. automakers from the 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports for one month, as the import taxes are expected to drive up the price of new cars by thousands of dollars. Trump Administration officials reportedly met with the three biggest U.S. carmakers—Ford, General Motors and Chrysler parent Stellantis—on Tuesday.

It is sustained by the pursuit of what Michael Lewis once called the “new new thing.” The Internet, the smartphone, social media: the new new thing cannot be a modest tweak at the edges. It has to transform the human race. The economic incentives are clear: a firm that popularizes a paradigm-shattering invention can make a lot of money. But there is also something larger at stake. If Silicon Valley doesn’t keep delivering new new things, it loses its privileged status as the place where the future is made. In 2022 the industry was having a bad year. After a lucrative pandemic—the five most valuable tech companies added more than $2.6 trillion to their combined market capitalization in 2020 and nearly the same amount in 2021—the sector suffered one of its sharpest-ever contractions. Amazon lost almost half of its value, Meta close to two thirds. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 33 percent, its worst performance since the 2008 financial crisis. The reasons were straightforward enough. At the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates to zero, and people stayed home, where they spent more time and money online. By 2022 both trends were in reverse. Most Americans had decided to stop worrying about the virus and were happily resuming their offline activities. Meanwhile the Fed began hiking interest rates in response to rising inflation. It would be a mistake to overstate the severity of the “tech downturn” that followed. Despite mass layoffs and declining revenue, the big firms remained larger and more profitable than they had been before the pandemic. Nonetheless a certain malaise had set in. The industry needed a dazzling new invention that could attract billions of consumers and send capital markets into a froth. One candidate was Web3, a proposal for rebuilding the Internet around blockchain, the accounting technology underlying Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Championed in particular by venture capitalists, who hoped that it would enrich them by empowering a new generation of start-ups to unseat the big firms, Web3 never proved useful for anything except speculation, and even the speculators got soaked as various schemes imploded under the pressure of high interest rates. Another possibility was the metaverse, Mark Zuckerberg’s dream of an immersive Internet experienced through a VR headset. It, too, struggled to demonstrate any practical advantage. Worse, it was unpleasant: a glitchy simulacrum of a postapocalyptic shopping mall as designed by David Lynch, where fish-eyed avatars with no legs floated through sparsely populated cartoon worlds. Then, on November 30, 2022, OpenAI released ChatGPT. A powerful AI system paired with an affable conversational interface, it let anyone ask a question and get an impressively humanoid (though not always correct) response. By January 2023 the chatbot had amassed 100 million users, making it the fastest-growing Web application ever. It was storybook Silicon Valley: OpenAI, which at the time had only a few hundred employees, caught everyone by surprise and, virtually overnight, established “generative AI”—the category of software to which ChatGPT belongs—as the new master concept of the entire industry. The tech giants rushed to respond, setting off a stampede. Everything from search engines to e-mail clients began sprouting generative AI features. In 2023 the Nasdaq climbed 55 percent, its best performance since 1999. The new new thing had been found. It’s too soon to know whether generative AI will prove to be a pot of gold or a blast of hot air. Opinions are divided. Some companies have done fabulously well: Nvidia, the boom’s breakout star, is raking it in, since its chips are the basic infrastructure on which generative AI is built. The cloud divisions of Microsoft, Google, and Amazon have also grown considerably, which their executives attribute to increased demand for AI services. But these are, in the parlance of the financial press, “picks and shovels” plays. Nobody doubts that there is money to be made from selling companies the paraphernalia they need to use generative AI. The real question is whether generative AI helps those companies make any money themselves. Skeptics point out that the high cost of creating and running generative AI software is a potential obstacle. This negates the traditional advantage of digital technology: its low marginal costs. Starting an online bookstore worked for Amazon because it was cheaper than going the brick-and-mortar route, as Jim Covello, head of global equity research at Goldman Sachs, noted in a June 2024 report. AI, by contrast, is not cheap—which means “AI applications must solve extremely complex and important problems for enterprises to earn an appropriate return on investment.” Covello, for one, doubts that they will. Yet companies, like people, are not entirely rational. When a firm decides to adopt a new technology, it rarely does so on the basis of economic considerations alone. “Such decisions are more often than not grounded upon hunches, faith, ego, delight, and deals,” observes the historian David Noble. Looking at American factories after World War II, Noble identified a number of reasons for their shift to “numerical control” technology: a “fascination with automation,” a devotion to the idea of technological progress, an urge to be associated with the prestige of the cutting edge, and a “fear of falling behind the competition,” among others.1 Advertisement Noble does, however, put special emphasis on one motivation that is at least partly rooted in economic rationality: labor discipline. By mechanizing the production process, managers could more fully master the workers within it. The philosopher Matteo Pasquinelli takes a similar view in his recent book The Eye of the Master: A Social History of Artificial Intelligence. In the introduction, Pasquinelli, a professor at the Ca’ Foscari University of Venice, explains that he won’t be offering a “linear history of mathematical achievements.” Rather, he wants to provide a “social genealogy” that treats AI not merely as a technological pursuit but “as a vision of the world.” The centerpiece of this vision is the automation—and domination—of labor. Contemporary AI is best understood, he believes, as the latest in a long line of efforts to increase the power of the boss. In The Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith famously argued that the manufacture of pins could be made more efficient through the division of labor. Instead of having a single pinmaker do everything, you could break the job down into several distinct tasks and distribute them to make pins more quickly. This is the canonical principle of capitalist production and the one that automation epitomizes and enforces. First you make work more mechanical, then you delegate it to machines. An important popularizer of this principle was Charles Babbage, a central figure in Pasquinelli’s book. Originally a mathematician, Babbage became what we would now call a “thought leader” among the nineteenth-century British bourgeoisie. Today he is better known as one of the inventors of the computer. His work on computation began with the observation that the division of labor could be “applied with equal success to mental as to mechanical operations,” as he stated in an influential 1832 treatise. The same method of industrial management then remolding the British worker could be transported outside of the factory and applied to a very different kind of labor, Babbage believed: mathematical calculation. He took inspiration from Gaspard de Prony, a French mathematician who came up with a scheme for streamlining the creation of logarithmic tables by reducing most of the work to a series of simple additions and subtractions. In de Prony’s arrangement, a handful of experts and managers planned the job and did the more difficult calculations while an army of menial number crunchers did lots of basic arithmetic. If the poor grunts at the bottom of this pyramid were basically automatons, why not automate them? In the factory the division of labor went hand in hand with automation. In fact, according to Babbage, it was precisely the simplification of the labor process that made it possible to introduce machinery. “When each process has been reduced to the use of some simple tool,” he wrote, “the union of all these tools, actuated by one moving power, constitutes a machine.” In 1819 he began designing what he called the Difference Engine, which automated the labor of arithmetic with three rotating cylinders and was powered by a steam engine. Babbage’s ambition was enormous. He wanted to “establish the business of calculation at an industrial scale,” Pasquinelli writes, by harnessing the same energy source that was revolutionizing British industry. The mass production of error-free logarithmic tables would also make for a profitable business, because such tables allowed the United Kingdom’s formidable mercantile and military fleets to determine their position at sea. The British government, recognizing the economic and geopolitical value of Babbage’s venture, provided funding. The investment failed. Babbage managed to construct a small prototype, but the full design proved too complicated to implement. In 1842 the government pulled its support, by which point Babbage had begun dreaming of an even less buildable machine: the Analytical Engine. Designed with the help of the mathematician Ada Lovelace, this extraordinary mechanism would have been the first general-purpose computer, able to be programmed to perform any calculation. Thus, amid the smog and soot of Victorian England, the idea of software was born. The division of labor was never just about efficiency; it was also about control. By fragmenting craft production—picture a shoemaker making a pair of shoes—into a set of modular routines, the division of labor eliminated the autonomy of the artisan. Now management brought workers together under a single roof, which meant they could be told what to do and watched while they did it. Advertisement Pasquinelli believes that Babbage’s engines, originating as they did in a “project to mechanize the division of mental labor,” were driven by the same managerial imperatives. They were, he writes, “an implementation of the analytical eye of the factory’s master,” a sort of mechanical representation of the watchful, despotic boss. Pasquinelli goes so far as to call them “cousins” of Jeremy Bentham’s notorious panopticon. But these imperatives presumably remained latent, since the gadgets never worked as designed. Babbage tried to use mechanical gears to represent decimal numbers, which meant he struggled with the problem of how to automate the “carryover”—the process whereby one column resets to zero and the next column increases by one—when a digit reaches 10. It would take the simplifications of the binary system, the invention of electronics, and the many advances bankrolled by the ample military budgets of World War II to make automatic computation finally feasible in the 1940s. By then capitalism had become a more international affair, which made the matter of managing workers more complicated. “The more the division of labor extended into a globalized world,” Pasquinelli writes, “the more troublesome its management became,” as “the ‘intelligence’ of the factory’s master could no longer survey the entire production process in a single glance.” Thus, he contends, the need for “infrastructures of communication” that “could achieve this role of supervision and quantification.” The modern computer, in the decades following its arrival in the 1940s, helped satisfy this need. Computers extended the “eye of the master” across space, Pasquinelli argues, enabling capitalists to coordinate the increasingly cumbersome logistics of industrial production. If Babbage had wanted to construct a prosthesis with which to project managerial power, as Pasquinelli suggests, then computation’s triumph in the twentieth century as the indispensable instrument of capitalist globalization should be understood as a fulfillment of the technology’s founding spirit. Moreover, this spirit appears to have intensified as computers continued to evolve. “Since the end of the twentieth century,” Pasquinelli writes, the management of labor has turned all of society into a “digital factory” and has taken the form of the software of search engines, online maps, messaging apps, social networks, gig-economy platforms, mobility services, and ultimately AI algorithms. AI, he concludes, is accelerating this transformation. There is no doubt that computers are often used to the advantage of employers, from the scheduling software that reduces labor costs by saddling retail and restaurant workers with unpredictable schedules to the several species of “bossware” that enable the remote surveillance and supervision of office employees, Uber drivers, and long-haul truckers. But to argue that such uses are the raison d’être of digital technology, as Pasquinelli seems to, is to overstate the case. Labor discipline is one use to which computers can be put; there are many others. And it was not central to the technology’s development: the core innovations of computing arose in response to military prerogatives, not economic ones. The desires to crack enemy cryptography, calculate the correct angles for aiming artillery, and perform the math necessary for making the hydrogen bomb were a few of the motivations for building computers in the 1940s. The US government became infatuated with the technology and spent millions on research and procurement in the subsequent decades. Computers would prove integral to a variety of imperial pursuits, from assembling intercontinental missiles capable of (precisely) incinerating millions of Soviets to storing and analyzing intercepts sourced from listening stations around the world. American corporations followed behind, adapting the contraptions cooked up by the security state to various commercial ends. Still, if Pasquinelli’s claims do not always convince, there is much to learn from the material he presents. Publishers have inundated readers with books about AI in recent years—enough to fill a small bookstore.2 Most have an undercooked quality. The Eye of the Master is, if anything, overcooked: there is an enormous amount of thinking compressed into its pages. Pasquinelli’s omnivorous intellect often mesmerizes. Nonetheless, I sometimes found myself wishing he would slow down to scaffold his provocations with more evidence. The fact that Babbage drew from the playbook of industrial management in designing his protocomputers is an interesting piece of history. But its relevance to later developments, or even just its resonance with them, can be determined only by looking closely at how computers actually transformed work in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, which Pasquinelli does not do. Instead he takes a sharp turn halfway through the book, pivoting from nineteenth-century industrial Britain to the early AI researchers of mid-twentieth-century America, focusing in particular on the field’s “connectionist” school. Connectionism, as Pasquinelli notes, departed in significant ways from the automatic computation of Babbage. For Babbage the soul of the computer was the algorithm, a step-by-step procedure that traditionally makes up the principal ingredient of a computer program. When Alan Turing, John von Neumann, and others created the modern computer in the twentieth century, what they created was a device for executing algorithms. The programmer writes a set of rules for transforming an input into an output, and the computer obeys. This ethos also guided “symbolic AI,” the philosophy that came to dominate the first generation of AI research. Its adherents believed that by programming a computer to follow a series of rules they could turn a machine into a mind. This method had its limits. Formalizing an activity as a logical sequence works fine if the activity is relatively simple. As it becomes more complex, however, hard-coded instructions are less useful. I could give you an exact set of directions for driving from my house to yours, but I couldn’t use the same technique to tell you how to drive. An alternative approach emerged from cybernetics, a postwar intellectual movement with extremely eclectic interests. Among these was the aspiration to create automata with the adaptability of living things. “Rather than imitating the rules of human reasoning,” Pasquinelli writes, the cyberneticians “aimed at imitating the rules by which organisms organize themselves and adapt to the environment.” These efforts led to the invention of the artificial neural network, a data-processing architecture loosely modeled on the brain. By using such networks to perceive patterns in data, computers can train themselves in a particular task. A neural network learns to do things not by simplifying a process into a procedure but by observing a process—again and again and again—and drawing statistical relationships across the many examples. One of connectionism’s progenitors was Friedrich Hayek, the subject of Pasquinelli’s most intriguing chapter. Hayek is best known as a leading theorist of neoliberalism, but as a young man he developed an interest in the brain while working in the Zurich lab of the famous neuropathologist Constantin von Monakow. For Hayek the mind was like a market: he saw both as self-organizing entities from which a spontaneous order arises through the decentralized interaction of their components. These ideas would help influence the development of artificial neural networks, which in fact function much like the market mind of the Hayekian imagination. When a psychologist named Frank Rosenblatt implemented the first neural network with the help of a navy grant in 1957, he acknowledged his debt to Hayek. But Hayek also diverged from the cyberneticians in important respects. Cybernetics, as the philosopher Norbert Wiener defined it in his eponymous 1948 book, involved the scientific study of “control and communication in the animal and the machine.” The term, coined by Wiener, was derived from the ancient Greek word for the steersman of a ship, which shares the same root as the word for government. The cyberneticians wanted to create technological systems that could govern themselves—a prospect that appealed to a Pentagon looking for ways to gain a military advantage in the cold war. The navy funded Rosenblatt in the hopes that his neural network could assist in “the automation of target classification,” Pasquinelli explains, by using its powers of pattern recognition to detect enemy vessels. For Hayek, by contrast, connectionism offered a way to think about a system that eluded control. He had a special kind of control in mind: economic planning. In his view, the brainlike complexity and distributed architecture of the market meant that socialism could never work. Thus the need for neoliberal policies that, in the words of the historian Quinn Slobodian, would “encase the unknowable economy,” protecting it from government interference.3 Nonetheless, Hayek and the other connectionists were very much on the same team. Rosenblatt and his colleagues were able to secure funding for their research because the US government believed their ideas could help defeat socialist armies. Hayek was in the business of defeating socialist ideas. At first, connectionism failed to fulfill its promise. By the early 1970s it had fallen out of favor in the AI world. Still, neural networks continued to develop quietly over the subsequent decades, enjoying some breakthroughs in the 1980s and 1990s. Then, in the 2010s, came connectionism’s quantum leap. Training a neural network, as Rosenblatt once pointed out, requires “exposure to a large sample of stimuli.” Size matters: since neural networks learn by studying data, how much they can learn depends in part on the quantity of data available to them. For much of computing’s history, data was expensive to store and difficult to transmit. By the second decade of the twenty-first century, both barriers had dissolved. Plummeting storage costs, combined with the birth and growth of the Web, meant that a mountain of words, photos, and videos was accessible to anyone with an Internet connection. Researchers used this information to train neural networks. The abundance of training data, along with new techniques and more powerful hardware, led to swift progress in fields like natural language processing and computer vision. Today AI based on neural networks is ubiquitous, at work in everything from Siri to self-driving cars to the algorithms that curate social media feeds. Neural networks also underpin generative AI systems like ChatGPT. Such systems are particularly large—meaning they are composed of many layers of neural networks—and their appetite for data is immense. The reason that ChatGPT sounds so lifelike and seems to know so many things about the world is that the “large language model” inside it has been trained on terabytes of text drawn from the Internet, including millions of websites, Wikipedia articles, and full-length books. This is what Pasquinelli means when he writes that the neural networks of contemporary AI are “not a model of the biological brain but of the collective mind,” a social endeavor to which many people have contributed. Not everyone is pleased by this fact. Generative AI’s voraciousness is responsible for what the podcast host Michael Barbaro calls its “original sin”: copyrighted material is among the information ingested. The New York Times has sued OpenAI for copyright infringement; so has the Authors Guild, alongside Jonathan Franzen, George Saunders, and several other writers. While OpenAI and the other major “model creators” do not disclose the details of their training data, OpenAI has conceded that copyrighted works are included—yet maintains that this falls under fair use. Meanwhile the demand for training data keeps growing, compelling tech companies to find new ways of obtaining it. OpenAI, Meta, and others have struck licensing deals with publishers such as Reuters, Axel Springer, and the Associated Press, and they are exploring similar arrangements with Hollywood studios. For Pasquinelli there is a lesson here. Contemporary AI’s reliance on our aggregated contributions proves that intelligence is a “social process by constitution.” It is communal, emergent, diffuse—and thus a perfect match for the connectionist paradigm. “It comes as no surprise that the most successful AI technique, namely artificial neural networks, is the one that can best mirror, and therefore best capture, social cooperation,” he writes. There is a Marxist coloring to this argument: intelligence resides in the creativity of the masses. But it is also an argument that could have been made by the profoundly anti-Marxist Hayek. The old Austrian would be gratified to know that the “intellect” of the most sophisticated software in history is sourced from the unplanned activities of a multitude. He would have been further tickled by the fact that such software is, like his beloved market, fundamentally unknowable. The strangeness at the heart of the generative AI boom is that nobody really knows how the technology works. We know how the large language models within ChatGPT and its counterparts are trained, even if we don’t always know which data they’re being trained on: they are asked to predict the next string of characters in a sequence. But exactly how they arrive at any given prediction is a mystery. The computations that occur inside the model are simply too intricate for any human to comprehend. You can’t just pop the hood and watch the gears click away. In the absence of direct observation, one is left with a more oblique method: interpretation. An entire technical field has sprung up around AI “interpretability” or “explainability,” with the goal of puzzling out how such systems work. Its practitioners across academia and industry talk in scientistic terms, but their endeavor has a devotional quality, not unlike the exegesis of holy texts or of the entrails of freshly sacrificed sheep. There is a limit to how much meaning can be made. Mortals must content themselves with partial truths. If today’s “AI monopolies” represent “the new ‘eye of the master,’” as Pasquinelli believes, it is an eye with a limited field of vision. The factories of Babbage’s day were zones of visibility: by concentrating work and workers, they put the labor process in full view. Contemporary AI is the opposite. Its casing is stubbornly opaque. Not even the master can see inside.

Title: Super Micro Computer (SMCI) March-Quarter Revenue To Be Impacted By “Blackwell Queue” And NVIDIA’s Ongoing Preference For Hyperscalers, As Per The Insights Gleaned By An Analyst From A Fireside Chat

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), one of the most prominent retailers of data center servers and liquid-cooled AI racks, has been trapped in the market's purgatory ever since the stock cleared its biggest near-term overhang by filing its requisite financial statements with the SEC in the nick of time to avoid a damaging delisting event. Now, a Wall Street analyst has stepped up to provide some much-needed context to SMCI's confounding weakness. Super Micro Computer recently provided a fairly disappointing near-term guidance, but was able to limit the fallout by aggressively ramping up its projections for FY 2026. To wit, SMCI now expects to earn $40 billion in full-year revenue in FY 2026 vs. Wall Street's consensus estimate of just $29 billion. Now, Northland analyst Nehal Chokshi is out with an important investment note on Super Micro Computer's prospects. To wit, Chokshi hosted SMCI's IR team for a fireside chat on the 28th of February, after the company had filed its "delayed FY24 10K, F1Q25 10Q (Sept Q) and F2Q25 (Dec Q) 10Q on Tuesday, February 25th, NVDA reporting modest data center upside on Wednesday, February 26th and key peer DELL reporting results on Thursday, February 27th." Bear in mind that NVIDIA and CoreWeave are Super Micro Computer's biggest customers, while Dell is its biggest competitor. Before going further, do note that Super Micro Computer reported $5.65 billion in revenue for its fiscal Q2'25 and guided to a range of between $5 billion and $6 billion in revenue for its fiscal Q3'25 (March-ending quarter), which corresponds to a QoQ decline of ~6 percent at the low-end, and a QoQ increase of ~12 percent at the high-end of the range. Coming back, Chokshi notes that the stated trajectory of Super Micro Computer's March-ending quarter - "guided down 12% q/q to up 6% q/q" - is largely a function of the fact that the company's GPU-as-a-Service (GPUaaS) customers "are unlikely to be at the front of the Blackwell queue." Here, Chokshi adds additional color by noting that Blackwell GPUs constituted ~31 percent of NVIDIA's January-ending quarter revenue, "driving NVDA data center revenue up 16% q/q, implying Hopper shipments down 20% q/q." Chokshi also notes that "consensus for DELL servers and networking is being projected flat q/q for the April Q, consistent with SMCI midpoint guidance, leading us to believe NVDA Blackwell shipments for the Jan Q indexed towards hyperscalers that DELL nor SMCI typically serve." Bear in mind that there is a roughly 8-week lag between when NVIDIA recognizes GPU revenue to when server OEMs recognize their top-line metric. So, according to Chokshi, Super Micro Computer's near-term revenue is being impacted by NVIDIA's Blackwell queue and its preferential treatment of hyperscalers.

We rely on your support for our independence, diversity and quality. Germany’s recent election results highlight deepening political fractures, with the rise of the far-right Alternate for Deutschland and the weakening of the center-left Social Democratic Party. Economic struggles and immigration concerns have fueled AfD’s support, especially in former East Germany. This instability could undermine Germany’s leadership in Europe, leaving the continent vulnerable. This article saved into your bookmarks. Click here to view your bookmarks. Germany’s recent election results have brought to the forefront the deepening fractures within the nation’s politics and society. The election showcased a significant shift in the political landscape, with the rise of the Alternative for Germany (AfD), a far-right party that has gained considerable support, particularly in the former East German territories. This, in conjunction with a weakening of the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) and a fragmented political environment, reveals the complexities Germany faces in its efforts to govern effectively. A divided political landscape The election results underscored the ongoing fragmentation of Germany’s political system. The SPD, led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz, saw a significant decline, securing only 16.4% of the vote. While this result was expected due to the party’s struggles in recent years, it has led to a situation where the SPD has lost much of its influence in shaping the nation’s future. On the other hand, the Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU), while victorious, achieved only 28.6% of the vote. This result demonstrates that even the center-right, long the dominant force in German politics, is no longer able to secure a decisive win without relying on coalitions. The rise of the AfD, which secured 20.8% of the vote, is perhaps the most striking outcome of this election. Although their support is still strongest in the former East Germany, where they garnered 29.7% of the vote, the AfD is beginning to make inroads into the West, achieving 13% of the vote in regions that were once firmly supportive of the CDU/CSU. This growing influence of the AfD highlights the increasing polarization of German politics and society, driven in part by economic insecurity, immigration concerns and the cultural tensions surrounding globalization. In addition to the rise of the AfD, the election results also revealed the diminished strength of the SPD, the Greens and the Free Democratic Party (FDP). These parties, which had formed the previous traffic light coalition government, struggled to present a unified front. The fractious nature of this coalition led to inefficiencies in governance and left the electorate dissatisfied. The lack of progress on key issues such as inflation, immigration and economic reform contributed to the overall sense of disillusionment with the current political establishment. The roots of AfD support: economic struggles and immigration concerns The AfD’s strong performance can be attributed to a combination of factors, with two key issues standing out: economic discontent and concerns over immigration. Germany’s economy has struggled in recent years, with no GDP growth for several consecutive years. The country has faced multiple crises, from the effects of the Russia–Ukraine war to challenges stemming from global inflation. These economic difficulties have taken a toll on the German population, particularly in the former East, where unemployment rates remain higher and economic opportunities more limited. Moreover, immigration has become a deeply divisive issue in German society. With a growing percentage of the population born outside of Germany, many citizens feel a sense of cultural insecurity and fear that the nation’s identity is being eroded. The AfD has capitalized on these fears, advocating for tighter immigration controls and a reassertion of German values. Their message has resonated particularly in the East, where the legacy of reunification remains a source of tension. While Germany does require immigration to address its demographic challenges and labor shortages, the rapid pace of immigration has created a perception of cultural and economic strain. This issue has been exacerbated by the ongoing debates over asylum policies and the EU’s handling of migration. The AfD’s success can thus be seen as a reaction to the perceived failure of the political establishment to address these concerns effectively. The CDU’s shift toward the far-right In response to the AfD’s growing influence, the CDU, under the leadership of Friedrich Merz, has begun to shift its stance toward the far-right. Merz, a former lawyer with ties to major international firms, including BlackRock, has sought to consolidate the center-right vote by adopting some of the AfD’s positions, particularly on issues like immigration. His proposals for stricter asylum laws and the tightening of border controls echo the policies championed by the AfD and reflect the growing pressure on the CDU to adopt a tougher stance on migration. Merz’s strategy, however, raises questions about the future direction of the CDU and its relationship with the AfD. While some analysts argue that the CDU is attempting to outflank the AfD on the right, others warn that this could further erode the party’s centrist identity and deepen the political polarization in Germany. The shift to the right is already being felt in the party’s rhetoric, with Merz calling for deregulation of the economy and stronger defense policies in line with the rising nationalist sentiment in Europe. The impact of Germany’s political instability on Europe Germany’s political instability and economic challenges have broader implications for the future of Europe. As the heart of the European Union, Germany’s struggles to maintain political cohesion and economic stability could have far-reaching consequences for the entire continent. A fractured Germany is unlikely to provide the leadership needed to navigate the complex geopolitical challenges facing Europe, from the ongoing conflict in Ukraine to the growing threat posed by Russia. The lack of a strong, unified German government also undermines Europe’s ability to respond effectively to global challenges. With the United States increasingly focused on domestic issues and shifting its attention away from Europe, the continent may find itself exposed to geopolitical risks. In the absence of a coherent European strategy, populist leaders like Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin could exploit Europe’s weaknesses, further undermining the region’s influence on the global stage. Germany’s failure to address its internal divisions could result in a Europe that is fragmented, weakened and increasingly susceptible to external pressures. As the continent grapples with an aging population, economic stagnation and rising political extremism, the prospect of a more cohesive EU seems increasingly unlikely. A long road ahead Germany’s political future is uncertain, with deep divisions in society and a lack of consensus on key issues. The rise of the AfD and the CDU’s shift toward the far-right reflect the growing dissatisfaction with the political establishment and the challenges facing Germany in the 21st century. As the country grapples with economic stagnation, immigration concerns and a fractured political system, the path forward will require difficult compromises and painful reforms. Without a strong and unified government, Germany risks losing its leadership role in Europe, leaving the continent vulnerable to external threats and internal disarray. The coming years will be critical in determining whether Germany can overcome its political paralysis and reclaim its position as a stable and effective force in Europe and the world.

The lack of progress on key issues such as inflation, immigration and economic reform contributed to the overall sense of disillusionment with the current political establishment. The AfD’s strong performance can be attributed to a combination of factors, with two key issues standing out: economic discontent and concerns over immigration. Germany’s economy has struggled in recent years, with no GDP growth for several consecutive years. The country has faced multiple crises, from the effects of the Russia–Ukraine war to challenges stemming from global inflation. These economic difficulties have taken a toll on the German population, particularly in the former East, where unemployment rates remain higher and economic opportunities more limited. Moreover, immigration has become a deeply divisive issue in German society. With a growing percentage of the population born outside of Germany, many citizens feel a sense of cultural insecurity and fear that the nation’s identity is being eroded. The AfD has capitalized on these fears, advocating for tighter immigration controls and a reassertion of German values. Their message has resonated particularly in the East, where the legacy of reunification remains a source of tension. While Germany does require immigration to address its demographic challenges and labor shortages, the rapid pace of immigration has created a perception of cultural and economic strain. This issue has been exacerbated by the ongoing debates over asylum policies and the EU’s handling of migration. The AfD’s success can thus be seen as a reaction to the perceived failure of the political establishment to address these concerns effectively. In response to the AfD’s growing influence, the CDU, under the leadership of Friedrich Merz, has begun to shift its stance toward the far-right. Merz, a former lawyer with ties to major international firms, including BlackRock, has sought to consolidate the center-right vote by adopting some of the AfD’s positions, particularly on issues like immigration. His proposals for stricter asylum laws and the tightening of border controls echo the policies championed by the AfD and reflect the growing pressure on the CDU to adopt a tougher stance on migration. Merz’s strategy, however, raises questions about the future direction of the CDU and its relationship with the AfD. While some analysts argue that the CDU is attempting to outflank the AfD on the right, others warn that this could further erode the party’s centrist identity and deepen the political polarization in Germany. The shift to the right is already being felt in the party’s rhetoric, with Merz calling for deregulation of the economy and stronger defense policies in line with the rising nationalist sentiment in Europe. Germany’s political instability and economic challenges have broader implications for the future of Europe. As the heart of the European Union, Germany’s struggles to maintain political cohesion and economic stability could have far-reaching consequences for the entire continent. A fractured Germany is unlikely to provide the leadership needed to navigate the complex geopolitical challenges facing Europe, from the ongoing conflict in Ukraine to the growing threat posed by Russia. The lack of a strong, unified German government also undermines Europe’s ability to respond effectively to global challenges. With the United States increasingly focused on domestic issues and shifting its attention away from Europe, the continent may find itself exposed to geopolitical risks. In the absence of a coherent European strategy, populist leaders like Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin could exploit Europe’s weaknesses, further undermining the region’s influence on the global stage. Germany’s failure to address its internal divisions could result in a Europe that is fragmented, weakened and increasingly susceptible to external pressures. As the continent grapples with an aging population, economic stagnation and rising political extremism, the prospect of a more cohesive EU seems increasingly unlikely. Germany’s political future is uncertain, with deep divisions in society and a lack of consensus on key issues. The rise of the AfD and the CDU’s shift toward the far-right reflect the growing dissatisfaction with the political establishment and the challenges facing Germany in the 21st century. As the country grapples with economic stagnation, immigration concerns and a fractured political system, the path forward will require difficult compromises and painful reforms. Without a strong and unified government, Germany risks losing its leadership role in Europe, leaving the continent vulnerable to external threats and internal disarray. The coming years will be critical in determining whether Germany can overcome its political paralysis and reclaim its position as a stable and effective force in Europe and the world.

Title: Wall Street is turning its back on Elon Musk | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Liberals and government employees aren’t the only people angry with Elon Musk. Tesla’s plunging share price means many investors are angry, too. Shares of Tesla shot up 91% after election day, peaking just before Christmas, as investors anticipated Musk and his car company would be big winners as a result of Donald Trump’s second term as president. Musk was Trump’s largest financial supporter during the campaign, and has since become the highest-profile member of his administration, by far. In his role as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (or DOGE), he has been trying to impose deep cuts in spending that had been previously approved by Congress, laying off thousands of federal workers. But shares tumbled 5.6% in trading Thursday and are now down 45% from their December peak, giving up 96% of that post-election bump. Just since Trump took office and Musk began wielding power they have lost 38% of their overall value. The drop in share price probably reflects the concern that Musk has been much a more visible – and polarizing – figure in the Trump administration than he was expected to be immediately after the election. Many investors likely figured Musk would be a more traditional “behind the scenes” kind of adviser, not necessarily taking an active role in enacting controversial policies. Musk had enough other business interests, running companies ranging from Tesla to SpaceX to Neuralink to X, to keep him occupied. But the drop in Tesla’s value is also a sign of the headwinds the company is facing, in addition to increased competition from other automakers, especially those from China, who have made significant gains in their home market and in Europe as well. Whether it’s one problem or a myriad of problems causing the slump, however, it is clear now that Tesla’s sales woes are dragging the stock price down, too. And it’s not clear what, if anything, could lift Tesla sales going forward. While electric vehicle sales in Europe shot up 34% overall in January, sales of Teslas plummeted 50%. Tesla’s sales fell 29% in China, the company’s second largest market after the United States, over the course of the first two months of the year, according to Reuters. And Tesla’s US sales suffered a 16% drop in US sales between December and January, according to an estimate from Cox Automotive. It’s difficult to directly attribute the drops to any one cause, however, as a drop in that period is typical for the company, which usually makes a major push for year-end sales to hit its full-year financial results target, followed by a drop in January. Sales in January 2024, for instance, were off 24% from its December 2023 sales. “Globally his sales are imploding,” said Gordon Johnson, an analyst who is mostly critical of Tesla and its shares. “The sales drop in China is about competition but in western nations, people are pissed at him. Whether that’s driving down the sales in western countries, or it’s competition doesn’t matter. There’s little he can do reverse it. And we know he’s not going to have full self-driving. I think this could be the year the Tesla’s shares finally collapse.” Even even some bullish investors already think Musk is going to wildly miss the mark when it comes to Tesla’s growth this year. “I think investors are coming to a new expectation around what deliveries are going to look like for the year,” said Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management. “Three or four months ago, Musk guided to 20% to 30% delivery growth in 2025. And then a month ago he didn’t make any mention of the previous target, which analysts and investors correctly assumed that that meant that target is no longer on the table.” The question is how much of the plunge is a reaction to Musk’s political profile. Munster, who still considers himself a Tesla bull, said he believes about three-quarters is blowback. “At the time of the election, it was unclear how visible Musk would be (in the Trump administration),” Munster said. “Some believed the whole DOGE thing wouldn’t get off the ground. At this point Tesla investors are seeing Musk as having more authority than Trump. There’s some brand damage that comes from that.” There were protests outside Tesla stores throughout the country Saturday, with scattered reports of vandalized Teslas. One person was arrested in Loveland, Colorado and faces federal criminal charges after prior acts of vandalism against a Tesla store, and possession of “incendiary devices.” Perhaps the biggest sign of shift in how badly people want to own a Telsa comes from S&P Global Mobility, which has sales data on a state-by-state basis. It broke the data down into “blue states,” meaning states that voted for the Democratic candidate in the last four presidential elections, and “red states,” where Republicans won four straight elections. And within each group of states, it looked at the loyalty rate, meaning the percentage of households that have bought more than one Tesla. In the blue states, the percentage of repeat Tesla buyers fell, from 72% in the last quarter of 2023 to 65% in the last quarter of 2024. Meanwhile, repeat Tesla buyers in red states edged up very slightly from 47.6% at the end of 2023 to 48.2% during the last three months of last year. The drop in loyalty rate for Tesla owners in blue states resulted in Tesla losing about a percentage point of market share in those states, which includes some of the nation’s biggest car markets, such as California. A poll last month by Morning Consult that shows that nearly 32% of US buyers “would not consider” buying a Tesla. That’s up from 27% in a Morning Consult survey a year ago, and only 17% when it asked the question in in February 2021. By comparison, only 16% of potential buyers were almost certain or very likely to look at a Tesla before buying in the most recent survey, a figure that hasn’t changed much over the last four years. There’s also been anecdotal backlash against Musk on social media, including videos of people booing Cybertrucks which then needed a police escort out during the Mardi Gras parade in New Orleans, as well as people voicing approval for acts of vandalism against Teslas and accidents involving Tesla stores or vehicles. Beyond any concerns about liberals who might now avoid buying Teslas in reaction to Musk’s politics, Munster said there’s a concern that Musk is distracted from running Tesla, the company on which the majority of his fortune is based on. “Musk really rewrote the book in terms of leaders’ capacity to do different things. That used to be frowned upon,” Munster said, referring to Musk’s job not only as CEO of Tesla but also SpaceX, the primary owner of social media platform X, as well as the founder of artificial intelligence company xAI and Neuralink, which aims to implant computer chips into people’s brain to control computers. “I think there are natural limitations to what he can do. He has a lot going on.” In addition there could be growing concerns that as trade tensions rise between China and the United States that the Chinese could target Tesla for action because of his role in the Trump administration. “Beijing grants favors and withholds favors,” according to Isaac Stone Fish, the CEO of Strategy Risks, a business intelligence firm. “They have many levers over Elon Musk and Tesla.” But Tesla bulls say there is still an argument for how Musk’s ties to the Trump administration could benefit the automaker, such as easier approval for its plans for self-driving “robotaxis.” While many Teslas now have a “Full Self Driving” feature that can handle some driving maneuvers, drivers are required to be behind the steering wheel ready to take control of the car. And there are still accidents involving FSD, prompting a number of investigations by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. But Musk has promised that by June he’ll have vehicles ready to provide autonomous operations without drivers transporting passengers in a ride hailing service in Austin, Texas, Tesla’s home base, although Uber and Alphabet’s Waymo unit have already beaten Tesla with a driverless service in that city. And he expects that service to spread quickly and for a Cybercab vehicle to be on the roads by next year without steering wheels, brake or accelerator pedals. Those promises have bulls still excited about Tesla’s prospects, no matter the current sales problems. They believe the current decline in share price is a buying opportunity for those who believe in that future. “The real unlock of Tesla value is on autonomy,” said Munster. “Trump loves Musk, and Musk is going to get some of the things he wants, and the big thing is more opportunity to prove the safety of robotaxis. I think that’s going to happen.” Others have severe doubts about that. Johnson, the Tesla bear analyst, says that Musk has been promising that truly autonomous vehicles have been just a year or so way for the last decade, and that any problems living up to his latest promises will cause a sharp drop in the stock price, as will the first quarter sales figures due out in early April. – CNN’s Juliana Liu contributed to this report Correction: An earlier version of this story understated the gain in Tesla shares after the election through a December peak.

Title: Trump hails retaliatory tariffs in defense of America's jobs and its soul

Manufacturers are already shifting some operations from Asia in response to his policy, Trump says. By Mike Firn for RFA 2025.03.05 BANGKOK -- U.S. President Donald Trump defended on Tuesday his policy on tariffs saying reciprocal duties to be imposed across the board from April 2 would not only protect U.S. jobs but would defend the soul of the country. Trump, in his address to a joint session of Congress six weeks after taking office for a second term, said tariffs was "a beautiful word" and his policy was already seeing manufacturers relocating facilities to the U.S. from Asia. "On April 2, reciprocal tariffs kick in and whatever they charge us on tariffs we will charge them, a reciprocal back and forth," Trump said to the applause of his Republican supporters. "If they use non-monetary tariffs to keep us out of their market, we will use non-monetary barriers to keep them out of our market." Earlier on Tuesday, the U.S. imposed 25% duties on Mexican and Canadian imports and doubled tariffs imposed on China last month to 20%. China responded immediately, taxing U.S. farm imports by as much as 15%. It also imposed export and investment restrictions on 25 American firms, citing national security. "The Chinese people will not be intimidated," Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said at a regular news conference. In his speech to Congress, Trump said China was already taxing U.S. exporters too much. "China's average tariff is twice what we charge them," he said, adding that he would match any country's retaliatory tariffs. Trump said the threat of tariffs had already had an impact on the business plans of Japan's Honda, America's Apple and Taiwan chipmaker TSMC. All three companies recently announced large investments to shift some manufacturing to the U.S. "If you don't make your product in America you will pay a tariff," Trump said. "Tariffs are not just about protecting American jobs, they are about protecting the soul of our country." While economists have warned of the impact of tariffs on pushing up prices for U.S. consumers, Trump dismissed concerns of any negative impact. "There may be a little bit of a disturbance but we're OK with that," he said. Trump said he could balance the budget while offering "tax cuts for everyone." China's premier Li Qiang said China's economy would match last year's growth in spite of a trade war with the U.S. Speaking at the opening of the annual National People's Congress in Beijing on Wednesday, he said the economy would expand by around 5% this year. Li said Beijing was willing to let the budget deficit expand to fuel an upturn in domestic demand as the "main engine and anchor" of growth. Trading accusations on drugs Part of the reason for Trump's tariffs on Mexico and Canada is what he says is their failure to stop the flow of deadly fentanyl into the United States, which the U.S. president said Tuesday was "destroying our families." Both of those countries have defended their actions to stop drug smuggling. Trump has also accused China of failing to stamp out production of the synthetic opioid but China says it has already done its part to control the drug and it should not be blamed for a U.S. "governance failure." On Tuesday, Beijing released a white paper highlighting the steps it had taken to control the spread of fentanyl. "These have delivered notable results," it said. Reporting on the findings, the state-run tabloid Global Times hit out at Trump for blaming China for America's opioid problem and punishing it with tariffs. "Shifting the responsibility for domestic governance failures onto others and abusing tariffs as a means of pressure and coercion will not cure America's ills, nor will it help Washington achieve its political objectives," it said in an editorial. In his speech, Trump also repeated his pledge to take control of the Panama Canal. "It was given away by the Carter administration for one dollar but that agreement has been violated," he said. "We didn't give it to China. We gave it to Panama and we're taking it back." Earlier on Tuesday, Hong Kong's CK Hutchison Holding said a consortium including America's BlackRock would acquire Hutchison Ports and Panama Ports giving it control of the ports at either end of the canal.

Global Times By Global Times Published: Mar 05, 2025 04:57 PM In response to media inquiries regarding a consortium led by US investment firm BlackRock potentially acquiring a Hong Kong company with the aim of taking control of Hong Kong company's stake in the Panama Canal, saying the move is under pressure of the White House, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian stated that we don't comment on the relevant business transaction. He noted that the Hong Kong SAR government had previously addressed issues related to the company's port operations. As a matter of principle, Lin emphasized that China supports its enterprises, including those from Hong Kong, in investing and developing businesses overseas. He also stressed that all countries should provide a fair and just environment for relevant enterprises, adding that we oppose the use of coercion and pressure in international economic and trade relations. When addressing another question related to the Panama Canal, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian stated that China supports Panama's sovereignty over the Panama Canal and is committed to upholding the Canal's status as a permanently neutral international waterway. He emphasized that China has never participated in managing or operating the Canal, nor has it interfered in its affairs. The claim that "China controls the Canal" is completely a lie, according to CCTV News on Wednesday.

Title: Panama President Mulino says Trump ‘lying’ about reclaiming the canal
URL: https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/6/panama-president-mulino-says-trump-lying-about-reclaiming-the-canal

Panamanian leader says sale of a Chinese company’s port operation to a US firm does not amount to retaking the waterway. Panama President Jose Raul Mulino has accused his American counterpart, Donald Trump, of lying when he told members of Congress that the United States is “reclaiming” the Panama Canal. In a statement posted on X on Wednesday, Mulino said the man-made waterway that connects the Atlantic and Pacific oceans “is not in the process of recovery” by Trump and the US government. “Once again, President Trump is lying,” Mulino wrote on X. “I reject, on behalf of Panama and all Panamanians, this new affront to the truth and to our dignity as a nation,” Mulino added. During the annual presidential address to the US Congress on Tuesday, Trump declared that Washington would be reclaiming the Panama Canal “to further enhance” US national security. “We’ve already started doing it. We’re taking it back.” He was referencing a deal announced on Tuesday for a consortium, led by the US investment management company BlackRock Inc, to buy a controlling stake in the company held by a Chinese group that operates ports at both ends of one of the busiest water channels in the world. In a filing, CK Hutchison Holding had announced that it would sell all shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and in Hutchison Port Group Holdings to BlackRock in a deal valued at nearly $23bn, including $5bn in debt. The deal has to be approved by Panama’s government. Trump has been talking about retaking the Panama Canal since his campaign, arguing the US should have never turned control over to the Panamanians and that the US was being overcharged for using it. Since returning to the White House, he has also started complaining that China controls the canal, and did not rule out a military invasion to regain control of it. Panama maintains it has full control over the canal and that the Hong Kong-based group’s operation of the ports did not amount to Chinese control over the waterway, and therefore the private sale to a US-based company would not represent any US “reclaiming” of the canal. In February, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Mulino and insisted that China was exerting influence over the canal’s operations. Panama rejected that China had any influence over canal operations. Beijing has also consistently denied interfering in the canal. The US built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on December 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. Trump has claimed that Carter “foolishly” gave the canal away. The 80km (50-mile) canal handles 5 percent of global maritime trade and 40 percent of US container traffic. Follow Al Jazeera English:

Title: Brevan Howard's pitch to deep-pocketed investors: The 'true risk' of crypto is not having exposure
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/brevan-howard-digital-assets-crypto-investing-investor-pitch-aron-landy-2025-3
Time Published: 2025-03-06T10:03:01Z
Full Content:
Aron Landy — the CEO of $34 billion macro investment manager Brevan Howard — believes the "tipping point" that will lead institutional investors to pile into crypto is on the horizon. Years of volatility and big-name bad actors have kept institutions away from digital assets. Still, with a new administration in the US and asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity becoming more entrenched in the space, the world's biggest investors will slowly wade into the space — and then dive fully in. London-based Brevan Howard, through its $2.5 billion stand-alone crypto unit that was up over 52% last year, is aiming to be the place to go for crypto-curious institutions. "The predominant mindset in the institutional space has been that any exposure to digital assets is a little too volatile," Landy told Business Insider. "I believe that a shift in mindset is happening and that soon, even this year, having zero exposure to digital assets will be the true risk." "At the moment, it's kind of a separate asset class, but over time, there'll be a convergence," he added. That convergence may be sped up by President Donald Trump's administration. After years of frustration under former President Joe Biden's SEC commissioner Gary Gensler, President Donald Trump, and his crypto czar David Sacks have provided a jolt to the space. While some have been frustrated with the administration's crypto agenda, including the creation of meme coins related to Trump and the first lady, Melania Trump, and the strategic reserve of different digital assets, the election was a positive change for the industry, said Gautam Sharma, the CEO and chief investment officer of Brevan Howard Digital. Sharma declined to provide additional comment on the creation of the reserve. The size of the talent pool and the amount of capital in the US means the "vibe" around an industry can matter just as much as a specific policy, Sharma said. Brevan thinks of the industry as a "transformational technology" akin to the internet, Landy said, and "any new innovation needs two things: talent and capital," Sharma said. The two executives said there should be plenty of momentum to attract ambitious young people to the industry. "The digital asset universe has tailwinds, not headwinds," Landy said. September will be the unit's fourth anniversary, and Sharma told BI that the goal remains the same as when they launched in 2021. "Our objective is to be the leading asset manager for institutional investors in digital assets," he said, noting that the manager is working on a few additional products for institutional investors to add alongside its flagship multi-manager crypto fund. As the digital asset space becomes more integrated into financial institutions and accepted by regulators, big-name asset managers will follow suit. Former crypto critics, like Citadel Securities' Ken Griffin, are embracing the space and building out their offerings because of the tailwinds. Among alternative investors, especially those catering to large institutional investors like sovereign wealth and pension funds, Brevan has a relative headstart thanks partly to its founder, billionaire Alan Howard. Howard has been interested in the space for close to a decade and started investing his personal capital in 2016 and has seen firsthand how the industry has changed, Sharma said. "Alan understands this space better than most, not just the investing side of it but the systems," said Sharma, who previously ran internal projects for the hedge fund and oversaw the buildout of the digital assets business alongside Natalie Smith, the firm's head of strategy and client partnership group. Howard's enthusiasm led Brevan Howard Digital to focus not just on hiring investing staff, technologists, and engineers. The firm built the unit's infrastructure from scratch over six months in 2021 and now has a team of more than 60 people in eight offices that can trade around the clock. A person close to Brevan said the firm's digital asset investment products have "relatively long lock-up periods" to help the firm withstand volatility. It aligns with the firm's belief that small bumps in the road will be just that: bumps in the road. The digital asset industry "could be worth many multiples than what it is now," Landy said, and the firm wants to partner with institutions willing to back that long-term vision. The separate digital-asset unit invests in liquid coins such as Bitcoin but also options, derivatives, and private stakes in startups. Brevan Howard Digital also helps diversity the firm's largest multistrategy funds, managing sleeves of capital for the $12 billion master fund. "The reason to invest is not because it's going up, or that it's gone down and therefore cheap," but instead to be exposed to something transformational for all industries, Landy said. The firm's conviction in the industry comes not just from Howard's personal interest, but the many engineers and technologists inside the firm who have been passionate about the space for years, he said. "From a macro investing perspective, investors should have some exposure to it," he said, and the firm is ready for the "tipping point" that will lead to institutions flooding in. "Having some exposure will be the norm," Landy said, and those who choose Brevan "invest with us because they want our expertise." Jump to

Title: Country club culture no more: Inside Microsoft's move to cull staff on performance
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-performance-management-low-performers-country-club-2025-2
Time Published: 2025-03-06T10:00:02Z
Full Content:
In 2023, a Microsoft employee asked to take on a lighter workload when his wife was found to have terminal cancer. His managers were supportive, and they appeared happy with his performance during his wife's illness as recently as late 2024, when they told him to expect 120% of his bonus. Then, on January 22, the employee said, an HR representative unexpectedly joined his weekly manager meeting. The employee was fired without severance and was told his health insurance would expire that night. The employee's wife had to skip chemotherapy treatments for a month after. "I'm still shocked," he told Business Insider in a recent interview. "Shocked and angry. I did everything right." The Microsoft employee asked not to be identified to protect future career prospects. BI has verified his identity and confirmed details of his performance, his termination, and his wife's illness through documentation. A Microsoft spokesperson, Frank Shaw, said performance-based terminations rarely come as a surprise to employees and people could elect to have COBRA coverage. This person is one of nearly 2,000 fired by Microsoft in January and February in a culling of those deemed low performers, according to a person familiar with the cuts. This kind of performance-based mass cut is a shift for the tech giant, which continues to review the approach. Managers spent months evaluating employees all the way up to the executive level as the company considers changes to its performance review and management process, several people with knowledge of the plans said. "We aspire to have a high-performance culture and want to make sure managers have the ability to drive that and that expectations are clear," Shaw said, adding that the company wasn't trying to design a tougher system, but one that removes ambiguity, provides clarity and flexibility, and allows managers and teams to move with speed. Microsoft's new approach to performance management is shaping up to be one of the biggest changes to the company's management strategy since Satya Nadella became CEO more than a decade ago. Before he arrived in 2014, Microsoft had a reputation for a cutthroat performance-review system, at least in a tech industry that often mollycoddled talented employees. Nadella softened that considerably. Microsoft once had a reputation for a "country club" culture, as Amazon's founder, Jeff Bezos, called it, a place employees would go after they were done working hard in their careers and wanted to coast before retirement. Now, some leaders worry the company has gotten too soft, making it difficult to shed underperformers, according to the people familiar with Microsoft's plans. The company is looking to new external leaders, such as the former Google executive Mustafa Suleyman and a former Meta engineering chief, Jay Parikh, along with existing executives like the company's senior leadership team and LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky, to help design a new way to evaluate employees, these people said. Microsoft has had an incredibly successful decade, becoming a leading cloud provider and AI player. It's worth about $3 trillion, making the software giant the third-largest company by that measure. The stock has stagnated over the past year, however, as questions mount about the company's Copilot technology, and as AI competition intensifies. The broader tech industry is facing other challenges, and Microsoft is not immune. A decadelong hiring boom has fizzled as companies focus more on profit, and AI coding tools reduce competition for software engineering talent. Meta recently cut about 5% of its workforce to "raise the bar on performance management." Amazon is culling managers. Even Google is trimming jobs. Employees who were let go in Microsoft's recent round of performance cuts got termination letters explaining the abrupt exit. "The reason(s) for the termination of your employment include your job performance has not met minimum performance standards and expectations for your position," said the letters, which BI viewed. "You are relieved of all job duties effective immediately and your access to Microsoft systems, accounts, and buildings will be removed effective today. You are not to perform any further work on behalf of Microsoft." The letters mentioned severance but said medical, prescription, and dental benefits ended on the last day of employment. The letters also said Microsoft would consider past performance and termination if the person applied for other jobs at the company in the future. "At Microsoft we focus on high performance talent," a company spokesperson told BI recently. "We are always working on helping people learn and grow. When people are not performing, we take the appropriate action." Deena Merlen, a partner at Reavis Page Jump LLP, told BI her law firm had received more inquiries about performance-based layoffs as of late. "Employers generally have the right to fire, just as an employee has the right to quit," she said. "As long as Microsoft's alleged performance-based reasons are not for some other, unlawful reason, Microsoft is within its rights to engage in these layoffs." The company has no obligation to provide severance, but such agreements often come with a release of legal claims that can protect the company from lawsuits, Merlen added. Before 2014, Microsoft used a controversial system to evaluate employee performance. Called stack ranking, it forced managers to put employees on a curve and cut the lowest performers. At Microsoft, that meant managers had to rank employees from 1 to 5, and someone always had to get a 5, the lowest score, no matter how well they or the team performed. Shaw, the Microsoft spokesperson, said that the system was especially problematic for small teams and that while terminating the lowest rung was not a companywide policy, it happened on some teams. Stack ranking was unpopular internally and was seen as prioritizing individual work, pitting employees against one another and creating a barrier to collaboration. Developers and even entire organizations had a tendency to reject acceptable solutions to problems if they hadn't developed those solutions themselves, the company's chief people officer, Kathleen Hogan, previously told BI. There's even a famous cartoon depicting Microsoft's org chart as warring factions. The company officially abandoned stack ranking just before Nadella took over as CEO in early 2014. He redesigned the company's performance-review system around the "growth mindset" concept. The idea is that skills are developed through hard work and that challenges and failures are opportunities to learn. This is counter to a "fixed mindset," which assumes talent is innate and struggles are a sign of failure. Nadella and his new leadership team applied this growth mindset to a new framework called "model, coach, care," which called on managers to set a positive example for employees, help staffers adapt and learn, and invest in people's professional growth. Instead of ranking employees from 1 to 5, Microsoft moved to a performance-review system that gives managers a simple payroll budget they could divide and dole out to employees based on performance. Kevin Oakes, the CEO of the Institute for Corporate Productivity, has worked with Microsoft on implementing a growth mindset. He told BI this approach was a way to encourage top performers but noted that even companies like Microsoft need to cull their workforces to become leaner and higher performing. "Any high-performing organization should make sure employees are performing at an acceptable level, and they should be weeding out people who are not performing at an acceptable level," he said. "Over time, you tend to get a little bloated as a big company where you've let hiring go unchecked in some areas and need to get back to a lean, efficient machine." Today, employees are evaluated on a scale from 0 to 200 called the "ManageRewards slider." The process begins with frontline managers, who evaluate an employee's impact and recommend where they think they should land on the slider. Then, a higher-level manager considers "differentiation" — i.e., making sure the team is distributed along the slider. The middle of the range is 100, while 0, 60, and 80 are lower performers and 120, 140, and 200 are higher performers. Those ratings influence how much an employee receives in stock awards and cash bonuses. A score of "Impact 60," for example, generally gives employees 0% of their stock award and 30% of their maximum cash bonuses while the slightly higher rating of "Impact 80" gives them 60% of their normal stock award and 80% of their maximum bonus. Shaw, Microsoft's spokesperson, said 100 would be considered a good score and mean an employee had met all of their objectives. In general, the company's senior leadership team gives managers a budget that allows for every employee on the team an average score of 109. "So you want to pay someone impact 140 for doing an outstanding job? Find 3 people you're giving Impact 100 so it's affordable," one executive-level manager explained. "Keep this guy around. He'll be paying for everyone's bonuses." The manager said they typically had paid top performers by finding a set of people who failed in the previous year and giving them all zero or reduced rewards. This person asked not to be identified discussing sensitive topics. "That's a bad manager," Shaw said. "You certainly can't give everybody high rewards," but you can give one person high rewards and the rest of the people around 100. While low rewards can indicate a performance issue, Microsoft's actual system for managing out low performers is separate from this employee-rating process. Generally, managers email an internal system called AskHR@ and request a consultation for performance concerns, and the manager will be matched with an internal consultant. More seasoned consultants are used for higher-level employees, or if the situation is difficult. These consultants give written formal feedback to employees, saying they delivered "Less Impact than Expected" and start a three-month performance-management process. Some managers can cut low performers who don't improve within about four months through this process. But sometimes Microsoft's HR department concludes that managers haven't done enough performance coaching, one manager said, meaning they have not generated enough documentation showing employees have been given the opportunity to improve and have repeatedly failed. It can take two or three more 90-day programs before these employees are ousted. One high-level manager said the average time to exit a low performer was seven months from the time a manager notified HR about the situation, which often comes after sustained low performance. "It takes too long to performance-manage folks out," one executive said. These exits can be further delayed by leaves of absence. One of the Microsoft managers who talked to BI said employees sometimes shared tips on how to complicate the company's performance-improvement process. One common suggestion: If your manager is working to fire you, go to a doctor and say you have certain symptoms, get a supporting letter, and secure health-related time off work. This can pause or reset aspects of the process, this person said. Short-term paid disability typically covers 60 to 90 days away from work, and Microsoft's HR department can be reluctant to exit these employees for some time after that, the person said. "For employees gaming the short-term disability policies, you can be talking 12 to 18 months to get to a point where HR is comfortable firing them," they added. In the US, a common refrain for the 0-to-200 performance reviews was, "One Year, One Reward," meaning employees are judged on a single year's performance. The separation between rewards and the formal performance-management process gave flexibility to managers to "harvest the budget," as one manager said, in other words give lower ratings to relatively adequate performers so big rewards could be doled out to high performers. They could do this without much risk to the employment status of the adequate performers. Shaw, the Microsoft spokesperson, said this was not company policy. Hogan, Microsoft's chief people officer, in an internal email in 2023 instructed managers to give fewer employees "exceptional rewards," meaning a high performance rating that leads to higher pay and bonuses. "More will need to be at the middle of the range," Hogan said in the email. Shaw, the spokesperson, said the email was specific to that year and that rewards changed annually based on factors like the economy and company performance. Changes to this year's rewards cycle won't be solidified until later in the year, he said. "Microsoft just summarily terminated hundreds of employees who had year-over-year insufficient performance based on rewards, without a lengthy documentation and feedback process," one executive said, adding that this coming rewards season would be more difficult on managers, who would have to be more careful about doling out low rewards. Shaw, the Microsoft spokesperson, confirmed that the decisions about whom to cut came from looking at rewards year over year but said the company still believed in "one year, one reward." Just because an employee gets high rewards one year, for example, doesn't mean they've earned it the next. As Microsoft evaluates its performance-review process, people familiar with the plans say the company is looking for perspectives from new leaders such as Suleyman, the former Google executive who is now Microsoft's CEO of AI, and Parikh, the former head of engineering at Meta who runs AI platforms at Microsoft. Shaw said that Suleyman and Parikh were just some of the people providing perspective and that Roslansky, the LinkedIn CEO, had also provided a lot of input. "The company will have a much stronger point of view, like some of our competitors," one Microsoft executive said. The company is making other changes to prioritize engineering talent and level out organizations, taking a page from Amazon. Separate from its performance-management processes, Microsoft is starting to weigh how it can become leaner and more engineering-focused. The company measures what it calls "good attrition," which is reviewed at the executive level, the Microsoft executive said. That's reminiscent of Amazon's "unregretted attrition." Right now there are no targets for this Microsoft metric. But the company is borrowing from Amazon in trying to increase the ratio of engineers working on projects. Amazon has something called the "Builder Ratio," which analyzes the ratio of software engineers to "non-builders," such as program managers and project managers. The goal is to try to keep organizations lean. Charlie Bell, Microsoft's security boss who came from Amazon's cloud unit, has brought this metric to Microsoft. Microsoft tracks the "PM ratio" which is the ratio of product managers or program managers to engineers, and has increased targets in the current fiscal year. For example, Bell's security organization right now is around 5.5 engineers to one PM, and his goal is to reach 10:1, according to a person familiar with Bell's plans. Have a tip?

Title: The dot-com bubble burst 25 years ago. What does that history say about stocks today?
URL: https://qz.com/dot-com-bubble-stock-market-crash-anniversary-ai-1851767436
Time Published: 2025-03-06T10:00:00Z

On March 10, 2000, the Nasdaq Composite index peaked at 5,048.62, more than double its value from just a year earlier. Internet startups with “dot-com” slapped on the end of their names and little more than ideas to sell to investors had soared to astronomical valuations over the previous five years. But all parties come to an end. Within weeks of that high, the index began its fall, with a mix of factors spooking investors. Eventually, the Nasdaq shed more than 75% of its value, wiping out $5 trillion in market capitalization. The age of irrational exuberance was over. A quarter-century later, the rise of AI has market veterans debating whether history repeats, or merely runs the same bubble algorithm with new inputs. Some market watchers see structural differences preventing an immediate collapse, while tech critics warn we’re debugging the same old bubble logic. Beyond balance sheets lies a deeper concern: We keep forgetting that the social costs of tech revolutions outlast their market corrections. There are similarities between the market today and 25 years ago as some investors grow nervous, according to Kairong Xiao, a finance professor at Columbia Business School. But if the moment we are in ends up bursting, the market structure means things will look different than 2000. “The dot-com bubble was characterized by a lot of IPOs, with companies trying to get into the biggest asset class in the Nasdaq” Xiao said. “Today, due to regulation and many other structural changes, new investments nowadays have been through the private equity market.” That structural shift from public to private funding represents one of the most significant changes. While Netscape’s 1995 IPO sparked a gold rush of public offerings from internet startups, today’s most prominent AI developers — OpenAI and Anthropic — remain private despite valuations in the tens of billions. They can access enormous capital without facing public market scrutiny or quarterly earnings pressure. The companies leading today’s tech wave also differ markedly from their dot-com predecessors. In 2000, many market darlings were freshly minted startups with minimal revenue. Today, AI innovation is largely funded by cash-rich tech giants including Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOGL), and Nvidia (NVDA), companies with diverse revenue streams and substantial profits. This concentration of resources among established players may provide a cushion against market volatility that didn’t exist during the dot-com era. “The big companies can survive if there’s a crash in the market because they have other ways to raise financing, whereas the small guys get eliminated,” Xiao said. Yet not all market observers are convinced we’ll avoid a reckoning entirely. Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, said today’s AI boom has runway left — but also an expiration date. “I still think we got another two good years left in the market,” Munster said. “Unfortunately, it’s gonna end in the same way that it did 25 years ago.” For Munster, the key indicator isn’t current valuations but the psychological state of the market, which he sees as “euphoric” right now. He defines euphoria — that intoxicating moment when rational investing gives way to the fear-of-missing-out — as when the forward price-to-earnings multiple exceeds 50 times. Today’s Nasdaq trades around 25 times earnings. But Munster said that euphoric threshold could be reached by 2027, potentially triggering what he described as a “spectacular burst.” While Munster said he believes the substance of AI will eventually exceed the hype, that likely won’t happen in time to avoid a market correction. “By the time the numbers start to improve, the bubble will have burst,” Munster said. “I lived through the dot-com bubble. I don’t want to see people’s lives get blown up, but I also think that AI is going to be more impactful than the internet.” Yet for all the structural differences between eras, some experts warn that we risk repeating the same fundamental mistakes. Mar Hicks, a history of technology professor at the University of Virginia and author of “Programmed Inequality,” said our retrospective view of previous tech bubbles often minimizes their negative impacts. Those harms, Hicks said, include substantial erosion of privacy norms and labor market transformations that began during the first internet boom. Early e-commerce companies like Kozmo.com used venture capital to offer services at unsustainably low prices, conditioning consumers to expect convenience without cost — a precursor to today’s gig economy. “That led to getting people used to this idea that you can have anything for free, essentially,” Hicks said. “It made it so that people either didn’t think about the labor and paying the labor of the people who are doing this work, or it completely changed the structure of the labor market.” Hicks suggested that while Silicon Valley’s memory may be short, its executives aren’t entirely forgetting history — they’re strategically misremembering it. Today’s AI leaders appear to have studied the dot-com collapse primarily as a public relations case study rather than a substantive business lesson. “The way in which they’re being mindful is they now know what they have to say in order to maybe get people to not get upset about these new revolutionary technologies,” Hicks said. “They’re giving lip service to it because they don’t ever address any of the real problems.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: JioStar Employees with Rs 1 Crore+ Salaries Seek Jobs Amid Massive Layoffs
URL: https://www.medianama.com/2025/03/223-jiostar-employees-with-₹1-crore-salaries-seek-jobs-amid-massive-layoffs/
Time Published: 2025-03-06T07:51:20Z
Full Content:
MEDIANAMA Technology and policy in India JioStar is laying off more than 1,100 employees to eliminate overlapping job positions following the merger between Reliance Industries Ltd.’s Viacom18 and The Walt Disney Company’s India division, according to a report by LiveMint. The layoff drive includes job losses for entry-level employees, senior managers, directors, and even those at the assistant vice president level. “The departures started a month ago, and they are not ending anytime soon,” said one of the people quoted in LiveMint’s report. The downsizing will continue until June and will primarily focus on corporate-level positions in JioStar’s distribution, finance, commercial, and legal departments, according to people interviewed by LiveMint. This move comes at a time when JioStar is targeting to increase the efficiency of its operations and focus on high-growth verticals—specifically digital streaming and sports. “Whenever two large companies with similar businesses merge, redundancies are inevitable,” an industry executive told LiveMint. “This restructuring is about optimizing resources and reducing duplication, ensuring the joint venture operates as a leaner and more efficient entity,” they added. A rival media company’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) confirmed that they have been receiving resumes from JioStar employees—many of whom have annual salaries exceeding Rs 1 crore—ready to make the switch. However, the laid-off employees will receive a severance package from JioStar, which is a silver lining: affected workers will receive six to twelve months’ salary as part of the payout plan. The company will provide employees with one full month’s salary for every year they have worked, in addition to a notice period of one to three months. For example, an employee who has worked for less than six years will receive a minimum of seven months’ pay and benefits, including the notice period. Meanwhile, those with longer tenures at the company will receive up to 15 months of compensation. Even employees who have not completed the compulsory five-year period for gratuity eligibility will receive a pro-rata payout. On the other hand, some affected employees, specifically from tech and digital services, will reportedly get jobs within Jio or the wider Reliance ecosystem. The only unaffected department when it comes to the current job cuts at JioStar is the sports department, as the media giant plans to expand its sports portfolio and launch new sports channels. For context, JioStar currently offers broadcast and online streaming of the ICC Champions Trophy, the Women’s Premier League (WPL), the FIH Hockey Pro League, the Premier League, and the Indian Super League, on its Star Sports TV channels and JioHotstar streaming platform. This offering will further expand in about two weeks’ time as the Indian Premier League (IPL) – which is scheduled to take place over two months – kicks off on March 22. As a result, there won’t be any panic about job losses or layoffs in its sports department for now. JioStar’s sports portfolio expansion aligns with the company’s 2023 strategy, when its JioCinema platform secured exclusive streaming rights for the IPL from the now-defunct Disney+ Hotstar. In a similar vein the streaming platform carried out another invaluable coup when it agreed a deal with Warner Bros. to stream its entire content library after Disney+ Hotstar chose not to renew its contract. At the end of the day, JioStar’s overarching aim with all these acquisitions is to rival and eventually marginalise streaming giants Netflix and Amazon Prime Video in the Indian online streaming market.

Title: Proxy Adviser Glass Lewis Sticks With Diversity Guidance, Will Flag Risks

Proxy adviser Glass Lewis will continue to consider boardroom diversity when advising how to vote at U.S. company annual meetings, but plans to be clearer about the counter argument for critical vote recommendations to help clients avoid rising political risks. The change comes amid a wave of retreat by U.S. corporations from their diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts, under threat of legal action by U.S. President Donald Trump’s Justice Department. The decision by Glass Lewis to remain largely committed to diversity follows a review of its policies and after proxy advisor rival Institutional Shareholder Services last month said it would no longer consider diversity when making its boardroom recommendations. In an e-mail to clients seen by Reuters, Glass Lewis said it will stand by its 2025 benchmark guidelines for U.S. companies, which include that shareholders vote against certain directors at some of the largest U.S. companies whose boards lack gender, racial or LGBTQ diversity. But when it recommends votes against a director in any way related to diversity, Glass Lewis said it will also flag information that could support an alternative vote by the client. “This approach allows Glass Lewis to deliver the vote recommendations expected by clients while also clearly flagging the potential risk that may result from an AGAINST vote decision and providing a clear path should some clients choose to vote FOR the proposal,” the firm said. A Glass Lewis spokeswoman said it also will likely include more context when making recommendations on diversity-related shareholder proposals. Glass Lewis and ISS dominate the U.S. market for selling recommendations about how investors should vote at corporate meetings on matters such as boardroom elections or executive pay. Glass Lewis counts some 1,300 clients globally including top pension plans, mutual funds and asset managers with more than $40 trillion in collective assets. Their policies are widely used by investors including mutual funds and pension plans which may not have the resources to do due diligence on every company in their portfolio. “Certainly, we would have preferred not to have had to deliberate over long-standing policy guidelines on board diversity and DEI shareholder proposals, but the U.S. Administration’s opposition to DEI is compelling companies, institutional investors and their proxy advisors to consider changes, now or in the future,” Glass Lewis’ note said. The move echoes steps taken by major asset managers including BlackRock BLK.N and Vanguard, which faced pressure over their voting decisions and in response looked to give clients more control.

Title: Panama President Issues Defiant Response To Trump Over 'Reclaiming' Canal Line

PANAMA CITY (AP) — Panama President José Raúl Mulino on Wednesday accused U.S. President Donald Trump of lying when he said in his address to Congress that his administration was “reclaiming” the Panama Canal. Trump was referencing a deal announced Tuesday for a consortium led by the U.S. investment management company BlackRock Inc. to buy a controlling stake in the company held by a Chinese group that operates ports at both ends of the Panama Canal. Panama maintains that it has full control over the canal and that the Hong Kong-based group’s operation of the ports did not amount to Chinese control over the waterway, and that therefore the sale to a U.S.-based company would not represent any U.S. “reclaiming” of the canal. Panama’s government on Tuesday called the sale a private transaction. Mulino in a message posted to X on Wednesday, rejected that the deal came about because of U.S. pressure. “I reject in the name of Panama and all Panamanians this new affront to the truth and our dignity as a nation,” he wrote. He accused Trump of “lying again.” Trump has talked about retaking the Panama Canal since his campaign, arguing that the U.S. should have never turned control over to the Panamanians and that the U.S. was being overcharged for using it. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Mulino in early February and insisted that China was exerting influence over the canal’s operations. The focus was the Chinese consortium running the ports. Panama rejected that China had any influence over canal operations. “Cooperation between our governments passes through clear understandings in terms of issues of mutual interest,” Mulino wrote. “It doesn’t have anything to do with ‘reclaiming the canal’ nor with tarnishing our national sovereignty.” In a filing, CK Hutchison Holding said Tuesday that it would sell all shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and in Hutchison Port Group Holdings to the BlackRock consortium in a deal valued at nearly $23 billion, including $5 billion in debt. The deal has to be approved by Panama’s government. The United States built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. Trump has claimed that Carter “foolishly” gave the canal away. Frank Sixt, co-managing director of CK Hutchison, said in a statement that the transaction was “the result of a rapid, discrete but competitive process in which numerous bids and expressions of interest were received.” The next four years will change America forever.

Title: How has ‘public squalor’ become so normalised in our towns and cities?

Housing vacancy is again making headlines. Figures from GeoDirectory, which is a joint venture between Tailte Éireann and An Post, estimates the housing vacancy rate at 3.8 per cent or 81,449 houses. Census 2022 by the CSO calculated Ireland’s housing vacancy at more than 163,000 houses, or 7.7 per cent. Forty-eight thousand houses were vacant for more than five years and, again according to GeoDirectory, an additional 20,092 were derelict. We need some degree of vacancy to align sellers and buyers, and based on GeoDirectory figures we do not have a housing vacancy problem. A stroll through many of the State’s cities and towns, however, would suggest that this conclusion is perhaps optimistic. (Questions to GeoDirectory about the difference between its figures and CSO calculations went unanswered.) Last year architects Frank O’Connor and Jude Sherry recorded 700 empty properties within two kilometres of Cork city centre, about 70 per cent of which was housing. At the same time, there are 2,893 households on the Cork City social housing waiting list, or just 300 houses for sale if that is your preferred metric. “Dereliction eats away the urban fabric [and] wastes vital resources, makes areas look ugly and feel unsafe. So why has it been normalised and enabled by the State?” O’Connor asks. It is a fair question. A cultural aversion to interfering with what people do with their properties or even asking owners what they are doing with them is part of the problem. An assumption that property rights are non-negotiable and take precedence over the common good has also led to a propensity for people doing what they want with their property or nothing at all. There are penalties on buildings that end up on a council’s Derelict Sites Register, but their application nationally is sclerotic. At the end of 2023, Dublin City Council was owed €6.8 million in unpaid derelict buildings fines. Councils are also culprits themselves: “Chances are, in Dublin, if it has buddleia growing on it, it’s owned by the local authority,” Ciarán Cuffe, the former councillor and MEP, recently told the Dublin Inquirer. [ Derelict Victorian houses ‘crumbling’ six years after €700,000 purchase by Dublin City CouncilOpens in new window ] A “vacancy relief” for commercial rates for those with unoccupied shops and offices, including those above the shop, is also questionable. In France, nearly 3,700 towns have introduced a tax of 17 per cent of the rental value of a property empty for more than one year, rising to 34 per cent in year two. Here, as this newspaper’s recent series on Derelict Dublin showed, important and run-of-the-mill buildings lie vacant for decades to the point of dereliction and we pay little heed and often no penalties. As with a lot of Irish regulation, laissez-faire enforcement is the norm, and it just doesn’t work. Vacant and derelict buildings stem from market, policy and ideological failure. The result is unpleasant environments, and towns and villages dying for the want of inhabitants, at the same time as multiple buildings sit empty. Sometimes for reasons of affordability, sometimes because the town isn’t attractive – and sometimes just because of their own notions of grandeur – people build new houses outside towns and drive everywhere. Both practices are unsustainable. Legislation, policy or technical solutions can only do so much – in the end it is about the State as much as it is about individuals Attempts to beautify towns and woo back inhabitants to by improving the urban experience with more public seating, pedestrian crossings and wider footpaths, for example, often run into sand for one reason: councillors don’t want any parking removed. Yet research shows three things: walking, cycling and public realm improvements can increase retail sales by 30 per cent; Irish retailers overestimate the proportion of their customers who arrive by car to do their shopping and underestimate those who walk; and people who walk to the shops go there more often. A good public realm is a good business realm. In towns where the public realm has been improved, footfall and business has increased. See Blackrock, Co Dublin, or Virginia, Co Cavan, or Clonakilty, Co Cork. Ireland’s market towns in particular, the Strokestowns and Templemores with their wide streets, have huge potential for attractive urban realms to entice new families and business. Ireland’s capital exhibits the characteristics of both a shanty town and a beautiful town. The difference between Dublin and comparable international cities is that these characteristics often exist side-by-side on the same street, including its main thoroughfare; what Jude Sherry calls “public squalor”. Dublin city had more than 18,000 vacant residential units in Census 2022, with more than 5,000 of these recorded as available “for rent” (there were 34,000 nationwide). A lot of these are illegal short-term lets – the Airbnb phenomenon is another example of letting people do what they want with their property at the expense of wider society. There is now a new Bill to regulate short-terms lets. Buildings aside, the most memorable feature of good cities is the public transport system. Despite being open since December 2017, neither Cabra nor Phibsboro Luas stops have any public street signage. Look at the beautiful bus and metro stations in European cities – with actual signage. We get bus stops on the side of roads with not even a seat or shelter from the rain. In 2017, Fianna Fáil’s Barry Cowen brought forward a good vacant house refurbishment Bill. More recently, the Greens had something similar, but it lapsed with the election. There are refurbishment grants available for vacant and derelict housing, but these are paid retrospectively, reducing their usefulness. There has been limited progress on easing the conversion of vacant above-the-shop units with some exceptions – Waterford City and County Council has been doing good work via the Repair and Lease Scheme. Dereliction and vacancy – and our tolerance for both – are symptoms of a bigger problem: the low value we put on place. Unfortunately, as with road safety, there seems to be only so much legislation, policy or technical solutions can do. In the end it is an issue of attitude – of the State as much as of individuals. For a country allegedly obsessed with property we care surprisingly little for it, apart from its financial value of course. The engraving on 19th century engineer Thomas Drummond’s plinth in Dublin City Hall reads: “Property has its duties as well as its rights.” It should be imprinted on the deeds of every building in the country.

Title: Trump lays out bold vision for America in first joint session of Congress

The address was met with a mix of fervent applause and predictable jeers from Democrats, who have become the embodiment of obstructionism and defeatism in the face of Trumpâs bold agenda. From reclaiming the Panama Canal to cracking down on illegal immigration and vowing to plant the American flag on Mars, Trumpâs speech was a clarion call for a stronger, prouder, and more self-reliant America. Reclaiming the Panama Canal and securing Greenland One of the most striking moments of the speech came when Trump announced his administrationâs efforts to âreclaim the Panama Canalâ for the United States. âThe Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others,â Trump declared, referencing reports that U.S. investment firm BlackRock is set to purchase the canalâs port infrastructure from its current Chinese owner. Trumpâs remarks underscored his unwavering commitment to restoring American control over strategic assets that have been mismanaged or exploited by foreign powers. âWe didnât give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and weâre taking it back,â he said, drawing thunderous applause from his supporters. The president also reignited his push to secure Greenland, a move that has long been a point of contention with Denmark. âThe people of Greenland deserve the right to determine their future,â Trump said, suggesting that the island could break away from Denmark and join the United States. âWe need Greenland, and we will secure it one way or the other,â he added, signaling his determination to expand American influence in the Arctic region. Ending the Ukraine conflict and restoring American diplomacy Trump also addressed the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, reiterating his commitment to ending what he called a âsenselessâ war. He criticized Democratic leaders, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, for their apparent willingness to prolong the conflict. âSome people would rather see this war drag on for another five years,â Trump said, taking a swipe at Warren, whom he derisively referred to as âPocahontas.â The president highlighted his administrationâs efforts to broker peace between Ukraine and Russia, emphasizing that fostering normal diplomatic relations with Moscow serves American interests. Despite recent tensions with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, Trump announced that a minerals agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine was back on track, citing Zelenskyâs renewed commitment to peace and partnership. Cracking down on illegal immigration and ending wokism Domestically, Trump focused on his administrationâs achievements in border security and immigration enforcement. He invited several guests to Capitol Hill whose stories shine a light on the human cost of illegal immigration, including family members of crime victims targeted by undocumented immigrants and a Border Patrol agent injured in the line of duty. Trump also took aim at the cultural left, declaring an end to the âtyranny of so-called diversity, equity, and inclusion policies.â He called on Congress to criminalize âsex changes on children,â denouncing the idea that a child can be âtrapped in the wrong bodyâ as âa big lie.â His supporters cheered the move as a long-overdue measure to protect children from irreversible medical procedures. The president also defended his decision to reinstate the ban on transgender individuals serving in the military, stating, âOur soldiers wonât be activists and ideologues â they will be fighters and warriors.â Elon Musk, Mars, and the American spirit of innovation Trump reserved special praise for Elon Musk, whose leadership at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has uncovered billions in government waste and fraud. âElon Musk is a true American pioneer,â Trump said, celebrating Muskâs efforts to dismantle the ârule by unelected bureaucrats.â Looking to the future, Trump vowed that his second term would yield historic accomplishments, including the colonization of Mars. âWe are going to lead humanity into space and plant the American flag on the planet Mars and even far beyond,â he declared, echoing Muskâs vision for interplanetary exploration. Trumpâs speech was a powerful reminder of the resilience and determination that have defined America throughout its history. From reclaiming strategic assets to ending cultural divisiveness and pushing the boundaries of human achievement, Trumpâs vision for America is one of strength, pride, and boundless possibility. As the nation moves forward under Trumpâs leadership, the contrast between his bold agenda and the petulant obstructionism of the Democrats could not be clearer. While the left clings to its dogma of division and decline, Trumpâs America is rising, stronger and more united than ever. The road ahead is long, but with courage, common sense, and an unwavering commitment to the American spirit, the best is yet to come.

Despite recent tensions with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, Trump announced that a minerals agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine was back on track, citing Zelenskyâs renewed commitment to peace and partnership. Cracking down on illegal immigration and ending wokism Domestically, Trump focused on his administrationâs achievements in border security and immigration enforcement. He invited several guests to Capitol Hill whose stories shine a light on the human cost of illegal immigration, including family members of crime victims targeted by undocumented immigrants and a Border Patrol agent injured in the line of duty. Trump also took aim at the cultural left, declaring an end to the âtyranny of so-called diversity, equity, and inclusion policies.â He called on Congress to criminalize âsex changes on children,â denouncing the idea that a child can be âtrapped in the wrong bodyâ as âa big lie.â His supporters cheered the move as a long-overdue measure to protect children from irreversible medical procedures. The president also defended his decision to reinstate the ban on transgender individuals serving in the military, stating, âOur soldiers wonât be activists and ideologues â they will be fighters and warriors.â Elon Musk, Mars, and the American spirit of innovation Trump reserved special praise for Elon Musk, whose leadership at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has uncovered billions in government waste and fraud. âElon Musk is a true American pioneer,â Trump said, celebrating Muskâs efforts to dismantle the ârule by unelected bureaucrats.â Looking to the future, Trump vowed that his second term would yield historic accomplishments, including the colonization of Mars. âWe are going to lead humanity into space and plant the American flag on the planet Mars and even far beyond,â he declared, echoing Muskâs vision for interplanetary exploration. Trumpâs speech was a powerful reminder of the resilience and determination that have defined America throughout its history. From reclaiming strategic assets to ending cultural divisiveness and pushing the boundaries of human achievement, Trumpâs vision for America is one of strength, pride, and boundless possibility. As the nation moves forward under Trumpâs leadership, the contrast between his bold agenda and the petulant obstructionism of the Democrats could not be clearer. While the left clings to its dogma of division and decline, Trumpâs America is rising, stronger and more united than ever. The road ahead is long, but with courage, common sense, and an unwavering commitment to the American spirit, the best is yet to come. Sources include: RT.com RT.com Enoch, Brighteon.ai Trumpâs remarks underscored his unwavering commitment to restoring American control over strategic assets that have been mismanaged or exploited by foreign powers. âWe didnât give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and weâre taking it back,â he said, drawing thunderous applause from his supporters. The president also reignited his push to secure Greenland, a move that has long been a point of contention with Denmark. âThe people of Greenland deserve the right to determine their future,â Trump said, suggesting that the island could break away from Denmark and join the United States. âWe need Greenland, and we will secure it one way or the other,â he added, signaling his determination to expand American influence in the Arctic region.

The Wyoming-incorporated tech firm released its Ethereum Strategy Whitepaper alongside the announcement, detailing its rationale behind choosing Ethereum over the more commonly adopted Bitcoin for corporate treasury management. "While Bitcoin remains a strong store of value, Ethereum provides broader utility as a programmable financial platform," the firm wrote on its Whitepaper, published Wednesday. BioNexus touts Ethereum's yield-generation capabilities through staking as a key advantage over Bitcoin, despite the latter’s adoption by institutional investors last year. "Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum provides an additional revenue stream through staking. Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake mechanism allows holders to generate 3-5% annual yield," the firm said in its Whitepaper, adding it could potentially turn Ethereum "from a passive asset into an income-generating treasury instrument." BioNexus points to Ethereum's institutional credibility as another factor, noting Ethereum's adoption by major financial entities such as BlackRock and Fidelity validates "its long-term potential as a financial instrument." "Our goal is to strategically position Ethereum as a core component of our treasury over time," BioNexus CEO Sam Tan told Decrypt in an emailed statement. "I can confirm that our Board’s approval provides flexibility. We intend to allocate a meaningful portion of our reserves to Ethereum." Tan declined to disclose an exact percentage for its Ethereum allocation "at this stage," but said the company's team has been "preparing for this shift for some time." "We’re currently weighing whether to operate our own validator nodes or partner with established third-party staking providers," Tan said. "Our choice will hinge on security, efficiency, and compliance, and we’ll finalize this as we scale our Ethereum holdings." The company also cites Ethereum's role in the global financial system, claiming the network "underpins trillions in stablecoin transactions annually, acting as the settlement layer for USDT, USDC, and other stablecoins." BioNexus’ Ethereum Strategy Whitepaper specifically references the upcoming Pectra protocol upgrade, which it sees as something that could reinforce Ethereum's stature "as a dependable long-term infrastructure for businesses." Despite the optimism, Pectra’s update has faced issues in recent weeks including during its Sepolia test network run early Wednesday, following similar roadblocks from its earlier Holesky testing phase. BioNexus operates primarily in Asia through its Malaysian subsidiary, working in genomic diagnostics and chemical distribution. Its provision of industrial chemical supplies for the automotive and aerospace sectors accounts for 90% of its total revenue. It has also developed RNA-based blood tests for early detection of cancers and inflammatory diseases, a segment that represents 10% of its revenue. But for all its prospects with Ethereum, BioNexus appears to be battling financial challenges of its own. In December last year, the company received a Nasdaq notice for non-compliance with the minimum $1 bid price rule.A temporary exception was granted, giving it until May 1, 2025, to regain compliance. To address this, BioNexus plans a reverse stock split by April 7, 2025. The company reported $9.26 million in trailing twelve-month revenue, over a $5.88 million market cap, with its stock trading at $0.32, down 61% on the year, data from the Financial Times shows.

The effect of President Trump’s policies appear to be disinflationary in the immediate term with crude oil slumping to ~USD 70/bbl while the impact of higher US tariffs is yet to be seen and would depend on various scenarios (refer our note). As such, the euphoria around President Trump’s victory seems to be fading with the dollar index giving away a large part of its gains since Sep’24 while the INR has also started to rise.

(Neutral) Market Closing Commentary Nifty broke its 10-session losing streak, ending Wednesday’s trading up by 1.15% at 22,337.30. The benchmark indices saw a strong recovery from the oversold zone. The pullback was driven by several factors, including strength in Asian markets, bargain buying in oversold stocks, and value buying in blue-chip stocks. All 13 major sectoral indices closed in the green, with Metals, Information Technology, and Automobile stocks leading the rally. The BSE Midcap and BSE Smallcap indices surged by 2.66% and 2.8%, respectively. Nifty Outlook Index formed a strong bull candle with a higher high and higher low, indicating buying demand emerging for the second session from the 22,000 levels. We anticipate the current pullback to extend toward the 22,500 level, which corresponds to the gap down area from February 28, 2025. Overall, the index is expected to consolidate within the range of 21,700 to 22,500 in the upcoming sessions. Key support levels are identified between 22,000- 21,700, as this range. For a reversal of the short-term corrective trend, the index needs to consistently form higher highs and higher lows. Bank nifty Outlook Bank Nifty formed a second consecutive bull candle with a higher high and higher low highlighting buying demand emerging from the lower band of the last 8 weeks range placed around 48,000-47,800. We expect the index to trade in the range of 47,800-49,000 in the coming sessions. A breach below the lower band of the range will lead to extended decline towards 47,000 levels in the coming sessions. While holding above the support area of will lead to pullback towards the 49,000 levels. Bank Nifty has been consolidating in the broad range of 47,800-50,500 in the last 8 weeks.

Title: Trump Preparing Executive Order to Strengthen U.S. Shipbuilding

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump pumps his fist as he steps from Air Force One upon his arrival in West Palm Beach, Florida, U.S., February 28, 2025. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo By Lisa Baertlein LOS ANGELES, March 5 (Reuters) – U.S. President Donald Trump is drafting an executive order aimed at resuscitating domestic shipbuilding and reducing China’s grip on the $150 billion global ocean shipping industry and countering its rising naval power. A draft fact sheet seen by Reuters on Wednesday includes an 18-point plan that includes funding the effort with fees from imports arriving on Chinese-made ships. It would also establish a Maritime Security Trust Fund as a dedicated funding source and create shipbuilding incentives that include tax credits, grants and loans. “The White House is standing up an office at the National Security Council to lead a whole-of-government effort to strengthen the maritime industrial base,” the document said, following Trump’s announcement of the plans during an address to Congress on Tuesday. Republican and Democratic U.S. lawmakers for years have warned about China’s growing dominance on the seas and diminishing U.S. naval readiness. The pending executive order appears to be influenced by existing proposals, including legislation with bipartisan backing. Trump’s initiative comes two months after the Biden administration concluded a nearly year-long probe requested by the United Steelworkers and other unions, which concluded that China uses unfair policies and practices to dominate the sector. Michael Wessel, president of the Wessel Group, who helped coordinate that investigation under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, called Trump’s announcement an encouraging step forward after years of efforts by unions to revitalize the industry. “We can still be the industrial leaders of the world – but only if we act,” he said. “Now is the time for Trump to turn words into action and follow through on his commitments.” Mike Waltz, Trump’s national security adviser and a former House Republican from Florida, last year introduced a bill with Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly from Arizona to reinvigorate commercial and military shipbuilding in the United States. The U.S. Trade Representative’s office last month proposed charging up to $1.5 million for Chinese-built vessels entering U.S. ports as part of its probe of China’s growing domination of the global shipbuilding, maritime and logistics sectors. Trump on Tuesday hailed an unrelated deal led by U.S. firm BlackRock to buy most of the $22.8 billion ports business of Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison. The deal will give the U.S. consortium control of key Panama Canal ports amid White House calls to remove them from what it says is Chinese ownership. “My administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we’ve already started doing it,” Trump told the U.S. Congress. That BlackRock announcement followed last month’s reintroduction of bipartisan legislation that would require the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense to develop a strategy to monitor China’s efforts to build, buy, or own strategic ports. Other measures in the draft document would direct Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency to review government procurement processes, including at the U.S. Navy; increase wages for nuclear shipyard workers; and develop a security strategy for the Arctic.

March 05, 2025 17:26 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, March 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The following statement is being issued by Levi & Korsinsky, LLP: To: All persons or entities who purchased or otherwise acquired securities of AppLovin Corporation (“AppLovin” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: APP) between May 10, 2023 to February 25, 2025, both dates inclusive. You are hereby notified that the class action lawsuit Michael Querio v. AppLovin Corporation, et al. (Case No. 5:25-cv-02294) has been commenced in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. To get more information go to: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/applovin-corporation-lawsuit-submission-form or contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. either via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. There is no cost or obligation to you. According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inglate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. If you suffered a loss in APP securities, you have until May 5, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn’t require that you serve as a lead plaintiff.

The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.”On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume.

Title: Canary Capital Files to Launch ETF Tracking Cross-Chain Protocol Axelar (AXL)

Full Content:
Canary Capital, the digital asset-focused investment firm founded by former Valkyrie Funds co-founder Steven McClurg, is planning on launching an exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracking the price of Axelar (AXL). The firm submitted an S-1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday, kicking off the process to launch such a fund. The hedge fund has previously filed paperwork for several other ETFs. Some of these have already been acknowledged by the Commission and await approval. "Axelar has one of the best dev teams in blockchain. Most viable protocols work with them on chain interoperability," said Steven McClurg, Chief Executive Officer at Canary Capital. "There is no question that AXL will be a top 20 token by market capitalization as the market discovers them. This is why we took the risk." AXL is the native token of the Alexar Network, a cross-chain protocol that connects other blockchains, enabling decentralized, secure cross-chain transactions. Unlike many interoperability solutions that rely on a small set of validators, Axelar operates on a proof-of-stake consensus model, allowing anyone to participate in its network, Sergey Gorbunov, co-founder of Axelar protocol, said in an interview with CoinDesk. The protocol, which has previously been integrated by J.P. Morgan’s Kinexys platform, Microsoft’s Azure marketplace as well as Uniswap and MetaMask, also announced the appointment of former Coinbase chief legal officer and Acting Comptroller of the Currency Brian Brooks to its newly formed Institutional Advisory Board. “Brian comes with a pretty deep understanding of how do you actually make sure blockchain is adopted by traditional finance,” said Gorbunov. “He understands what pain points these asset issuers have and he believes that decentralized interoperability is very essential to not introduce all of those issues in the process.” According to Gorbunov, stablecoins and tokenization are poised to be the next major trends for institutions in crypto, driven by regulatory developments and efficiency gains. A stablecoin bill expected in the coming months could open the door for more financial institutions to issue and integrate stablecoins, with firms like PayPal, BlackRock, and Robinhood already exploring their use for settlement to reduce costs. AXL currently trades at $0.36 and stands at a market cap of $340 million, according to CoinDesk data. The token reached an all-time high in March 2024 at $2.69 but has since dropped.

Title: Greenland, Panama fiercely reject Trump’s ambitions in address to Congress

President Donald Trump says the U.S. needs Greenland for national and international security during a joint address to Congress. Leaders from both Greenland and Panama issued messages on Wednesday fervently rejecting the comments made by President Donald Trump during his address to Congress in which he again reiterated his ambitions to grab hold of the strategically important areas. Trump has made clear he intends to "acquire" both Greenland and the Panama Canal, and previously refused to rule out military intervention to achieve his expansionist goals. In his joint address to Congress, the president said his administration had already taken steps to "take back" the Panama Canal and reiterated his push to acquire Greenland, which is currently a territory of Denmark. TRUMP SAYS AMERICA WOULD WELCOME GREENLAND DURING JOINT ADDRESS TO CONGRESS President Donald Trump addresses a joint session of Congress at the Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday. (Win McNamee/Getty Images) Trump spoke directly to Greenland in his address on Tuesday night and said, "We strongly support your right to determine your own future, and if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America." "We will keep you safe. We will make you rich. And together we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before," he added. Trump then said his administration was "working with everybody involved to try to get it." "We need it really for international world security. And I think we’re going to get it," he continued. "One way or the other, we’re going to get it." Greenland Prime Minister Múte Egede on Wednesday made clear he is neither interested in American nor Danish ownership. "We do not want to be Americans, nor Danes, we are Kalaallit (Greenlanders). The Americans and their leader must understand that," Egede said in a post on Facebook translated by Reuters. "We are not for sale and cannot be taken. Our future is determined by us in Greenland," he added. Greenland Prime Minister Múte Egede, left, and President Donald Trump. (Getty Images | Fox News Digital) Trump’s comments regarding the Panama Canal on Tuesday night were just as direct when he said, "My administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal." "We've already started doing it," he added. Trump has claimed China has taken over the important waterway as a Hong Kong-based company operates ports on either end of the canal — which the administration has claimed could cut off the U.S. from the canal if Beijing directed it to. However, Panama has repeatedly rejected the claim that China runs the canal.

(Arnulfo Franco/AFP via Getty Images) "Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals," Trump said. Trump's comments were in reference to a $23 billion BlackRock Inc.-TiL Consortium deal made with Hutchison Port Holdings, the Hong Kong conglomerate, announced on Tuesday. The consortium, made up of BlackRock Inc., Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment Limited, would acquire "90% interests in Panama Ports Company (the "PPC Transaction"), which owns and operates the ports of Balboa and Cristobal in Panama," according to a Tuesday press release. But Panama’s president took issue with Trump’s comments saying in part, "Once again, President Trump, is lying."

"I reject, on behalf of Panama and all Panamanians, this new affront to the truth and to our dignity as a nation." "It has nothing to do with the ‘recovery of the Canal’ or with tarnishing our national sovereignty," he added. "The Canal is Panamanian and will continue to be Panamanian!"

The CEO of Amazon-owned One Medical, Trent Green, will leave that position to become CEO of National Research Corporation, a publicly traded provider of healthcare solutions doing business as NRC Health. NRC Health announced the move in a Wednesday (March 5) press release, saying Green will join the company June 1. Green will leave One Medical April 4, CNBC reported Wednesday, citing an internal Amazon memo. “After nearly three years with Amazon One Medical, CEO Trent Green has decided to leave the company,” an Amazon spokesperson said, per the report. “We are grateful to Trent for his many contributions and wish him well on his next endeavor.” Green became CEO of One Medical in September 2023, about six months after Amazon completed its acquisition of the company, according to the report. During his time in that role, One Medical, which is a primary care provider, expanded into new geographic areas, opened more offices, and integrated further into Amazon, in part by offering services for Prime members, per the report. At NRC Health, which provides a healthcare experience management platform, Green will use his experience in care delivery, digital transformation and strategic business execution to advance the company’s personalized, data-driven solutions and strengthen its market presence, according to the press release. “I am excited to join NRC Health and lead the company during this transformative period,” Green said in the release. “I look forward to working alongside NRC’s talented associates to advance innovative solutions that enhance healthcare experiences for patients, providers and caregivers and drive sustainable growth for our investors.” When Amazon announced its $3.9 billion acquisition of One Medical in July 2022, it said it aimed to reinvent healthcare and described One Medical as a tech-powered primary care provider that offers in-person, digital and virtual care services. It was reported in February 2024 that Amazon was cutting “a few hundred” jobs across its healthcare units One Medical and Amazon Pharmacy while working to save another $100 million in 2024 and decrease its operating losses. The cuts in its healthcare units were the latest in a series of layoffs announced by Amazon around that time. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Add the teachers' union to the list of investors worried about Tesla's sliding stock
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-stock-price-selloff-elon-musk-ev-teachers-union-aft-2025-3
Time Published: 2025-03-05T20:38:50Z

Volatility in the price of Tesla stock is sparking anxiety beyond Wall Street. Now, a union of 1.8 million teachers is expressing concern about further declines from its sky-high valuation. The American Federation of Teachers has openly questioned Tesla's valuation, urging top asset managers to review investments in the electric vehicle maker. In letters sent to asset managers including BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street, the AFT warned that Tesla's market decline poses a considerable risk to teacher pensions, which have an estimated $4 trillion of members' deferred wages invested, AFT President Randi Weingarten said. The union argued that Tesla stock's aggressive tumble is a growing threat to teachers' retirement funds. The shares are down 42.5% from a mid-December peak, and At $275 per share, they're trading nearly at pre-election levels. "I'm asking the experts, because frankly, if the stock all of a sudden goes down even more precipitously than it has, and tens of billions of dollars are invested in it, then how do you create the replacement income in terms of these retirements?" Weingarten told Yahoo Finance on Monday. At least one of the letters cites a projected price target of $135 for Tesla stock, quoting recent JPMorgan commentary that the shares are "completely divorced" of fundamentals. But the fundamentals themselves are also driving the union's skittishness. "Tesla's latest financial disclosures should raise alarms," the letter said, citing a 23% profit decline and 71% revenue drop year-over-year. Regarding missed fourth-quarter margin expectations, it added, "These are not isolated incidents but rather a troubling pattern that suggests Tesla's pricing power is eroding, leaving it vulnerable to market fluctuations and increased competition." Recent weeks have fuelled the bear case for Tesla, as data from China and Europe reveal declining sales of the company's EVs and heightened competition. According to the German Federal Motor Transport Authority, sales in Germany plummeted 76% in February. Such trends have caught the attention of other investors as well. Ross Gerber, a Tesla-believer-turned-bear, now expects the stock to see even more pain in 2025. While he remains a shareholder, he told Business Insider that he's whittled down his firm's position and he's pessimistic about Tesla's premium valuation. Other bears have also warned about a steep sell-off to come. Earlier this year, Roth MKM analyst Craig Irwin suggested that AI hype has severely overvalued the company, which is why Tesla stock will fall 70% to $85 a share. Weingarten emphasized that the AFT's letters to asset managers were not political, and noted that the union has a history of publishing reports about financial concerns. According to Weingarten, the union has been behind legal action against the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency, due to actions it has taken against the Department of Education. Jump to

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by nearly 500 points, recovering from a steep decline earlier in the week as the major U.S. automakers are given a one-month exemption from new tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports. “We spoke with the Big Three auto dealers. We are going to give a one month exemption on any autos coming through USMCA,” President Donald Trump said, according to a statement provided by White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt during a news conference.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by nearly 500 points, recovering from a steep decline earlier in the week as the major U.S. automakers are given a one-month exemption from new tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports. “We spoke with the Big Three auto dealers. We are going to give a one month exemption on any autos coming through USMCA,” President Donald Trump said, according to a statement provided by White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt during a news conference.

Title: Here's what Trump's tariff barrage could mean for your 401(k) plan

Watch CBS News By Aimee Picchi Edited By Alain Sherter Updated on: March 5, 2025 / 4:03 PM EST / CBS News During his Tuesday night address to Congress, President Trump acknowledged his barrage of tariffs might cause "a little disturbance." But with the stock market tumbling this week in reaction to his import duties, workers with 401(k) plans may wonder about how much that disturbance could affect their retirement savings. The S&P 500 has lost about 3% of its value since Friday, with Wall Street tumbling on Monday and Tuesday after Mr. Trump decided to move forward with 25% tariffs on nearly all goods imported from Mexico and Canada, and an additional 10% on Chinese imports. The stock index regained some ground on Wednesday, rising 21 points, or 0.4%, to 5,799 in afternoon trading. According to Wall Street analysts, the market reaction reflects investor concerns that a trade war could crimp U.S. economic growth and reignite inflation, putting pressure on U.S. consumers who are already financially strained after grappling with several years of elevated price increases. Some recent economic data also points to souring outlooks from consumers and businesses, with both groups now expecting higher inflation in the face of Mr. Trump's new tariffs. With uncertainty on the rise, employees exposed to stocks through their retirement plans should brace for more investment volatility, experts say. "There is evidence that a cooling in the economy is underway," Adam Crisafulli, an analyst and founder of Vital Knowledge, told CBS MoneyWatch. "U.S. equities are bearing the brunt of what we're seeing in the U.S. economy right now." The Trump administration has also sometimes sent mixed messages about its tariff plans, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Tuesday night saying the administration might "modify the tariffs somewhat." Those mixed signals add to the challenges facing businesses in deciding their strategy, experts say. Because tariffs are paid by U.S. businesses on goods they import from other nations, some companies are uncertain about the costs they'll face moving forward under the Trump administration, Crisafulli said. "I look at tariffs as a corporate tax," he said. "Imagine if corporate tax rates were set in this chaotic of a fashion — it would create a lot of hesitation among companies. They don't know what the ground rules will be." Walmart executives, noting that the U.S. is entering what they characterized as "an uncertain time," said last month that consumers are paring their spending, while Target on Tuesday said costs from tariffs could put "meaningful pressure" on the retailer's profits. Such caution is also fueling market volatility, experts said. "Uncertainty around the scope and implementation of tariffs is high," investment firm BlackRock said in a March 5 note to investors. "In markets, we think U.S. equities could come under pressure in the next few months as investors seek additional compensation for these risks." While investors spooked by the roller-coaster stock swings might be tempted to exit the market, that's generally a losing strategy, Crisafulli said. Timing the market, or attempting to buy and sell stocks to capture gains and avoid losses, is almost impossible to execute and typically leads to financial losses and lost opportunities, Charles Schwab research has found. The strategy is almost always doomed to fail because investors don't know when to get back into the market to capture the rebound, while the stock market has historically always recovered even from major setbacks. For instance, investors who sold during the March 2020 rout that followed the eruption of COVID-19 around the U.S. and failed to re-enter the market that year could have missed out on the rebound, with the S&P 500 gaining 15% by the end of December. For most investors with a 401(k) plan, sticking tight and avoiding checking your balance each day may be the best strategy for coping with volatile periods, experts say. "Your 401(k) should be on autopilot, and you don't look at day-to-day volatility," Crisafulli said. "I don't think people should make dramatic changes with their 401(k)s." Still, investors may want to examine their asset allocation and shift to investments that could provide more protection in the face of a possible global trade war, researchers note. For instance, automobile companies could be hard-hit by the Trump administration's tariffs, BlackRock notes, given that U.S. automakers import many components from Mexico and Canada. Restaurants and grocery companies could also feel the impact of the new tariffs, as U.S. food costs could increase by 3% due to the higher import duties, BlackRock noted. "On the other hand, financials and health care services may be relatively insulated, since these sectors have minimal exposure to imported goods," the wealth management firm noted. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump vowed that his tariffs "are about making America rich again and making America great again." Some of his goals in implementing the tariffs are to bring about a resurgence in U.S. manufacturing by convincing companies to move factories to the U.S. While that could take months or even years to pan out, investment experts say it's also important to keep a long-term view on the U.S. economy. "It may be hard for investors to believe, but there is more to market volatility than reacting to the latest Trump executive action," Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street, wrote in a new report. Despite recent data that suggests the U.S. economy is slowing, "an economic growth scare is not the same thing as a recession. And the economic environment remains respectable. U.S. real GDP is likely to expand in the first quarter," he added. Given that the economy is continuing to grow, the labor market remains strong and inflation is still cooling, it's important to "differentiate between signal and noise," Arone said. "And, rightly or wrongly, the Trump administration uses the economy and stock market as barometers for its success," he added. "They won't purposefully harm the economy or the bull market."

Title: BlackRock Agrees to Buy Panama Canal Ports as Trump Continues Threats

BlackRock, America’s largest asset manager which handles over $11 trillion in assets, has agreed to purchase two ports on either end of the Panama Canal. BlackRock is buying the ports from Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison in a deal worth about $22.8 billion. The announcement of the deal comes as President Donald Trump has made threats against Panama over China’s involvement in the canal. The president has said the U.S. never should’ve handed over control of the canal in the 1970s after building the canal in the early 20th century. And Trump has even suggested the canal would be taken by force in necessary. Trump boasted in an address to Congress on Tuesday night that the U.S. was “reclaiming the Panama Canal,” without giving details about who was actually buying the ports there. “Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals,” Trump said. The part he left out? BlackRock is doing the buying, a company that’s not too popular with Trump’s base. The far-right often casts BlackRock as part of a “globalist” cabal controlling the world, commentary that often surfaces anti-semitic memes about Trump’s business connections. “It was given away by the Carter administration for one dollar, but that agreement has been violated very severely,” Trump said, referring to the 1970s hand-off. “We didn’t give it to China. We gave it to Panama and we’re taking it back.” As CNN notes, the BlackRock deal also includes interests in 199 other berths in 23 countries, though none of those ports have the same geopolitical tensions as the Panama Canal right now. The co-managing director of CK Hutchinson, Frank Sixt, said in a statement posted online that the deal was the result of a “rapid, discrete but competitive process in which numerous bids and expressions of interest were received.” Sixt went on to describe the deal as “compelling” but insisted it had nothing to do with the current geopolitical tensions between the U.S., China, and Panama. “I would like to stress that the Transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports,” Sixt insisted. “It must be noted that, however, the Transaction does remain subject to confirmatory due diligence, settlement of definitive documentations, and normal and usual completion procedures, adjustments and conditions as well as compliance by HPH with the rights of minority shareholders under existing shareholders agreements relating to the Sold HPH Interests.” Blackrock CEO Larry Fink said in a press release posted online by CK Hutchison that he was “thrilled” about the investment. “This agreement is a powerful illustration of BlackRock and GIPâs combined platform and our ability to deliver differentiated investments for clients,” Fink said. “These world-class ports facilitate global growth. Through our deep connectivity to organizations like Hutchison and MSC/TIL and governments around the world, we are increasingly the first call for partners seeking patient, long-term capital. We are thrilled our clients can participate in this investment.â Will BlackRock’s purchase of two ports at the Panama Canal be enough to please Trump and stop him from threatening the country with military invasion? That part isn’t clear yet. But even if it is, Trump still has plenty of other allies he wants to invade, including Greenland, Mexico, and Canada.

Title: Futarchy As Meta Governance

Time Published: 2025-03-05T18:37:44Z
Full Content:
While anyone can buy stock in public firms, private firms are instead held by a more concentrated and exclusive set of owners. Such firms tend to make higher returns than public firms, and are more responsive to investment opportunities. They tend to be taken public when they reach a stable situation where managers can just “milk the cow”, while public firms tend to be taken private when they start to face many big new decisions. The basic idea is this: when CEOs of public firms make substantial and uncertain investments, they face the immediate judgment of market speculators, expressed in the firm’s stock price. And without a good inside view of particular investments, speculators have to rely on the average return of such public firm investments, which tends to be bad. So the firm stock price falls, after which the CEO may not last long enough to see if their investments actually pay off. Thus CEOs of public firms tend to invest only when they can show speculators enough to convince them of their investments’ unusual value. So they tend to make investments that are clearly much like successful prior projects, and so can be judged on the track records of such projects. In contrast, CEOs of private firms typically hold far larger personal fractions of the firm’s stock, and so consider their investments more carefully. They can invest using info that they can’t effectively communicate to market speculators, and so they can make novel investments, different from what they and others have done before. Thus private firms seem to be a superior form of firm governance. Why then are there any public firms? Because there are only a limited number of skilled CEOs and trusted partners rich enough to take firms private. Over the decades, we have been creating more such people, and a larger fraction of business firms have been converted to private equity. And until the public can more easily invest in private firms, their money will have to go somewhere. All this could be see as a critique of futarchy, since futarchy picks actions using the info that is available to market speculators. Without access to the extra info typically available to private firm CEOs, such speculators must make the sorts of judgments that public firm speculators typically do about possible firm investments. Thus, for max profits, it seems better to take a firm private than to have it run either by a CEO responsive to a public stock price, or by futarchy speculators who advise particular decisions. Futarchy might be able to advise a public firm on whether to go private, but that decision seems to be well made by a simple auction. If private investors are willing to pay more for the firm than public investors, it should go private. But alas we typically block this sort of solution via poison pills, and maybe people would be more willing to listen to futarchy advice on this key decision. Futarchy seems to have a better chance of advising public firms on key decisions where we suspect the CEO might be biased. Such on whether to replace the CEO, or on how much more money to raise from investors, when, and at what price. But while this is a reasonable hope, it is far from a sure thing. The best case for futarchy seems to be in cases where we are just not sure that max profits, even if expertly executed, is the outcome we want. Then we can use a futarchy tied to some other outcomes that we better trust, and ask futarchy either re specific decisions, or whether to hand off decisions to something else, like a private firm. Or whether to later change back from a private allocation. Competing private firms seem to be our best known institution for getting the most profits from some area of life. And we economists do have good reasons to expect that this is often the best way for everyone to get the more of what they want. But we economists also know of many plausible exceptions, and many others have stronger doubts than economists about for-profit ventures. So there’s a place for an institution that makes reliable, unbiased judgements about the effects of key decisions on other outcomes, judgements that are quite well informed compared to most other institutions, even if not as well informed as private choices. We can plausibly best trust this institution for our most meta decisions, on which other institutions to use when and where. The main more meta decision that remains is: what are the ex-post measurable outcomes for futarchy to use when making these decisions? It seems like you're using the term "private equity firm" as a synonym for "private firm" here, considering that you contrast and compare it with "public firm." Are you using the term right? To my understanding a private equity firm is a private firm that manages a portfolio of investments in other firms. It's not just any firm that's privately owned. I'm not so sure about your explanation for why a private firm would have a higher rate of return. If the problem with public firms is that CEOs are getting ousted too quickly, it's not the average uninformed investor doing that - it's large activist investors and board members. Activist investors and board members would be highly informed in what's going on with the company. I hear that, once adjusted for size and leverage, profitability is about the same. That being said, all equity is by nature overvalued and the threat if PE keeps it somewhat sane. No posts Ready for more?

Panama President José Raúl Mulino has accused U.S. President Donald Trump of lying when Trump said in his address to Congress the night before that his administration was “reclaiming” the Panama Canal PANAMA CITY -- Panama President José Raúl Mulino on Wednesday accused U.S. President Donald Trump of lying when he said in his address to Congress that his administration was “reclaiming” the Panama Canal. Trump was referencing a deal announced Tuesday for a consortium led by the U.S. investment management company BlackRock Inc. to buy a controlling stake in the company held by a Chinese group that operates ports at both ends of the Panama Canal.

Panama's government on Tuesday called the sale a private transaction.

He accused Trump of “lying again.” Trump has talked about retaking the Panama Canal since his campaign, arguing that the U.S. should have never turned control over to the Panamanians and that the U.S. was being overcharged for using it. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Mulino in early February and insisted that China was exerting influence over the canal’s operations.

In a filing, CK Hutchison Holding said Tuesday that it would sell all shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and in Hutchison Port Group Holdings to the BlackRock consortium in a deal valued at nearly $23 billion, including $5 billion in debt. The deal has to be approved by Panama’s government. The United States built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. Trump has claimed that Carter “foolishly” gave the canal away. Frank Sixt, co-managing director of CK Hutchison, said in a statement that the transaction was “the result of a rapid, discrete but competitive process in which numerous bids and expressions of interest were received.” “I would like to stress that the transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports,” Sixt said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Panama President Mulino: Trump's Canal Remarks Are an 'Affront to the Truth and Our Dignity as a Nation'

President of Panama José Raúl Mulino on Wednesday morning accused President Donald Trump of “lying again” after Trump reiterated his call to take back control of the Panama Canal in a speech to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night. “Once again, President Trump is lying. The Panama Canal is not in the process of recovery and much less is the task that in our conversations with Secretary Rubio or any other has even been discussed,” Mulino said on social media. “On behalf of Panama and all Panamanians, I reject this new affront to the truth and to our dignity as a nation.” “Cooperation between our governments is based on clear understandings on issues of mutual interest, as we have been doing. Nothing has to do either with the ‘recovery of the Canal’ or with sullying our national sovereignty,” he continued. “The Canal is Panamanian and will remain Panamanian!” Trump, during his speech to Congress, said that to enhance national security, the United States will reclaim the Panama Canal and declared “we’ve already started doing it.” He referred to a deal announced hours before the speech between Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings Limited and asset manager BlackRock for the purchase of a majority stake of Panama Ports Company, a Hutchison subsidiary that, since 1997, has administered two ports located at opposite ends of the Panama Canal. “Just today a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple other canals,” President Trump said. “The Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others. But others could use it.” In December, Trump started a debate over the Panama Canal, an interoceanic trade route built by the United States in 1914 and whose control was handed over to Panama in 1999. The canal left American possession under an agreement signed by both nations during the administration of former U.S. President Jimmy Carter in 1977. Trump has repeatedly expressed that the United States should take back control of the Canal due to the “exorbitant” transit fees imposed on U.S. ships. Increasing U.S. stakes in the canal’s operations could forestall China’s growing influence over the important trade route. “It was given away by the Carter administration for $1. But that agreement has been violated very severely. We didn’t give it to China, we gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back,” President Trump said on Tuesday. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian refuted President Trump’s statements in remarks during his regular briefing on Wednesday. “On the Panama Canal issue, China supports Panama’s sovereignty over the Canal, and stays committed to maintaining the status of the Canal as a permanently neutral international waterway,” Lin said. “China has never engaged in the management and operation of the Canal. Never ever have we interfered. The so-called China’s control over the Canal is nothing but a lie.” The Chinese spokesman asserted that he had “no comment” on the deal between Hutchison and BlackRock, but asserted that China supports Chinese companies, “including” those from Hong Kong, which must abide by Chinese law after the Chinese communist regime ended the “One Country, Two Systems” policy in 2020. “Hope they can have access to a fair and just business environment everywhere they go. We oppose any abuse of coercion and pressuring in international trade and economic relations,” Lin said. The ongoing debate over the Panama Canal has seen several Panamanian and Chinese government officials dismiss President Trump’s claims of Chinese influence in the trade route and calls to have the United States take back control of it. In February, the Chinese embassy in Panama claimed that the accusations made by the United States over Chinese influence in the canal were a “pure lie.” The comment was in response to the then-ongoing two-day visit of United States Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) Commander Adm. Alvin Holsey to the Central American nation. Holsey met with several Panamanian government officials to discuss topics including safeguarding the Panama Canal area from “Chinese Communist Party influence and control.” President Mulino, in a social media post, referred to Adm. Holsey’s visit by stating that the bilateral agenda with the United States is important and relevant — but stressed that, for Panama, it does not involve analyzing “situations that are not true.” President Mulino has repeatedly dismissed any possible negotiations pertaining to returning control of the Panama Canal to the United States, asserting that the trade route will remain fully under Panamanian control. Mulino, after stating that he would wait for President Trump to take office on January 20 before issuing any kind of official response, issued a formal letter to United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres hours after President Trump took office, expressing his “concerns” over Trump’s calls to retake control of the Panama Canal.

Title: Amgen just got one step closer to bringing its Ozempic competitor to market

Amgen (AMGN+2.98%) is getting closer to challenging the weight-loss drug duopoly of Novo Nordisk (NVO-1.01%), the maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, and Eli Lilly (LLY-4.09%), which produces Zepbound. The pharma company announced today that it has begun two late-stage clinical trials for its experimental weight-loss drug, MariTide. If successful, MariTide could disrupt the market by offering a less frequent dosing regimen than the current weekly injections on the market. The drug has been tested as a once-monthly treatment, as well as with dosing intervals of every other month and once every three months. Amgen’s executive vice president of research and development, Jay Bradner, shared key details of the new trials Wednesday morning at TD Cowen’s annual healthcare conference. The two trials will enroll about 4,500 patients in total. One study will recruit 3,500 participants that are obese or overweight, while the other will include 999 people who are both obese or overweight and have type 2 diabetes. The primary objective of both studies is to assess the percentage of weight loss at 72 weeks. Amgen will test three dose levels — low, medium, and high — starting patients at a lower dose and gradually increasing it to the target doses. According to ClinicalTrials.gov, the studies are set to begin officially on March 17 and are expected to conclude in early 2027. In November, the company reported that MariTide helped patients with obesity or excess weight shed an average of 20% of their body weight in an earlier 52-week trial. For comparison, the highest dose of Wegovy resulted in an average weight loss of 15% after 68 weeks in clinical trials. Meanwhile, patients taking the highest dose of Eli Lilly’s rival drug, Zepbound, achieved over 20% weight loss after 72 weeks.

Title: Deals: Samsung S25+ $150 off + $50 credit and 2x storage, Lenovo Snapdragon PC $500 off, Bose QuietComfort Ultra buds, more

We have now moved on to day 3 of the massive Discover Samsung sale and the highlight deal of the day is now live – Galaxy S25+ with $700 trade value, or up to $150 off with a bonus $50 credit and double storage for FREE. From there, we have unlocked Pixel 8a handsets at up to $132 off as well as Lenovo’s Snapdragon X Plus IdeaPad 5 Copilot+ PC at 50% off, and some deep deals on the wonderful Bose QuietComfort Ultra wireless buds. All of that and more awaits below in today’s 9to5Toys Lunch Break. The official Discover Samsung rolls into day 3 today with big-time deals across just about every product category you’ll find on the official site. Today’s headliner 24-hour sale features the new Galaxy S25+. While there are weeklong deals on all of the new S25 models through Sunday, these daily deals offer up some seriously notable extra savings, with today’s offer landing with up to $700 in instant trade-in value, or a straight up $150 price drop without a trade-in alongside a bonus $50 Samsung credit and double the storage on select colorways. Remember to select the “No, Get $100 – $150 Samsung instant savings” in the trade-in section to redeem the deal – this will side-step the trade-in options and apply the discount directly to your order. But you can’t stack the trade-in value with this deal (it’s one or the other). You’ll also want to pop down to the “Make your Galaxy epic with an exclusive” section near the bottom of the Galaxy S25+ listing page – this is where you’ll find special discounts on add-on items, like headphones, and Galaxy Rings, and Galaxy Watches, and more at prices far lower than buying them individually. Today’s 24-hour deal is easily one of the best we have tracked outside of some of the bundle deals we featured during the pre-order phase, and is only going to get slightly worse starting tomorrow. That said the ongoing weeklong Galaxy S25 deals (seen below) are pretty notable nonetheless, you just might not want to miss out on today’s special offer if you’re going to pull the trigger at any time soon: The release of the new Pixel 9a is all but imminent at this point. We expect it to launch in the last week of March at the same price as the Pixel 9 with a few upgrades, and a look closer to that of a previous-gen iPhone – Google appears to be doing away with the camera bar with some leaks suggesting quite a cheap-looking handset. But if you like your Pixels the way they are, or just want to save a solid $100 on the current-generation entry-level model instead of the full list on the new 9a later this month, Amazon is now offering the unlocked Pixel 8a down at $399 shipped. Regularly $499, this is a straight up $100 discount to land on par with last year’s Black Friday price. Today’s deal at Amazon lands on the most affordable Pixel 8a configuration, and on three different colorways: Obsidian black, Aloe green, and Bay blue. As we mentioned above, this deal is on par with just about every price drop we have tracked on the device over the last several months. Update: This deal is now back in stock. Details below in the original post. While we still have some notable exclusive price drops on the Chipolo Google Find My Device trackers via the brand’s official site, we just spotted the Chipolo Card Point model down at the $24 Amazon all-time low. Shipping is free for Prime members or in orders over $35 on Amazon. Over at B&H, you’ll find Lenovo’s IdeaPad 5 Copilot+ PC with Snapdragon X Plus/16GB/1TB down at $499.99 shipped. This is regularly a $1,000 notebook which is now seeing a solid $500 markdown. We saw the 16GB RAM and 512GB variant of this machine drop to $510 earlier this year, but this is the first time we’re tracking a deal on this model with more storage. Today’s 50% discount lands this machine $500 below its usual going rate, making it a great time to snag. Head below for more details. We are now tracking some notable deals on the wonderful flagship Bose QuietComfort Ultra Wireless Earbuds. Amazon is now offering a series of colorways down at $219 shipped – that’s $80 off the regular $299 list price and the same deal you’ll find directly from Bose right now for a limited-time. This includes the sweet champagne and off-white Diamond 60th Anniversary Edition too. Today’s deal is $10 under the official 2024 Black Friday price and among the lowest we have ever tracked for a brand-new condition set – there have been a few fleeting deals for a couple bucks less at other retailers but only on limited colorways. If you’re a Costco member, you’ll want to head below for another notable chance to save. Costco has teamed up with Bose on this deal as well. That means Costco members can score the same $219 discounted price (White Smoke and Black only on this offer) and also claim a FREE $50 gift card – Apple, Spotify, Hulu, Google Play, Sirius XM, DoorDash, Uber Eats, or Xbox. Again this deal is only for Costco members, but here’s how it works: FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More. Check out 9to5Google on YouTube for more news:

Title: China Market Update: NPC’s Government Work Report Reviewed – Consumption, Consumption, Consumption & AI

ByBrendan Ahern ByBrendan Ahern , Senior Contributor. CLN At the National People’s Congress, Premier Li provided the government work report. The lack of Western media coverage is interesting, so I pulled out the choice lines. Consumption comes up a lot, indicating where policy support is headed. Artificial intelligence was also explicitly mentioned. Real estate was not as big of a focus, though a large part of the bond issuance is linked to real estate support as local governments have been given more latitude to support project completion. Jonathan Krane’s thesis in creating our firm was to align China investment products with government policy. We are looking good in 2025 as this top-down consumption directive is implemented by government agencies and local governments. Numerically, the report was largely in line with expectations that were low to begin with, though the verbal was stronger than anticipated. It is important that the government recognizes deflation because ignoring it means not fixing it. They did not ignore it. On Thursday, the heads of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, PBOC, and Ministry of Finance are hosting a press conference at 10 am Beijing time. Further articulation of consumption policies would be interesting. China’s Uber for truck drivers company Full Truck Alliance (YMM U.S.) announced Q4 results after the Hong Kong close/pre-U.S. market opened. Asian equities were higher overnight, led by Hong Kong, Thailand, and Indonesia, while Vietnam was off as Trump’s cabinet tried to talk up markets on tariff deals after the close as the U.S. dollar weakened. However, it is important to remember that Trump’s cabinet is made up of staff and not stakeholders, as only the big guy counts. Hong Kong had a strong day, though volumes were a touch light, and advancers trounced decliners, led by Hong Kong’s most heavily traded stocks by value, including Xiaomi, +7.22%; Tencent, +2.95%; Alibaba, +1.64%; Meituan, +6.39%; and Semiconductor Manufacturing International, +6.6%. The NPC’s government work report contributed to Hong Kong-listed growth stocks' strong outperformance, though it was a broad rally. Superman was flying as CK Hutchison (Hong Kong ticker 1, how cool is that) gained +21.86% after selling their Panama ports to BlackRock (founder Li Ka-Shing is known as Superman for his business acumen). Mainland investors bought a net $1.08 billion worth of Hong Kong-listed stocks and ETFs, including Alibaba, which was a large net buy via Southbound Stock Connect. Mainland China had a good, but not great, day as technology and growth stocks also outperformed, though decliners outpaced advancers. Remember, stocks are reflective of consumer confidence. Real estate stocks were a rare underperformer in both markets, though remember there are very few stocks left in MSCI indices, which is why we’ve favored the bonds over the stocks. It is interesting that CATL fell by -0.76% as electric vehicles weren’t highly noted. The Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech gained 2.84% and 4.02%, respectively, on volume down 4.02% from Tuesday, which is 167% of the 1-year average; 428 stocks advanced, while 65 declined. Main Board short turnover decreased by -12.87% from Tuesday, which is 169% of the 1-year average, as 16% of turnover was short turnover (Hong Kong short turnover includes ETF short volume, which is driven by market makers’ ETF hedging). The growth factor and small capitalization stocks outperformed the value factor and large capitalization stocks. The top-performing sectors were Information Technology, +6.23%; Materials, +3.92%; and Communication Services, +2.99%. Meanwhile, the worst-performing sector was Real Estate, which fell 0.30%. The top-performing subsectors were industry conglomerates, semiconductors, and construction materials. Meanwhile, household appliances were the worst-performing subsector. Southbound Stock Connect volumes were light of late as Mainland investors bought a net $1.076 billion worth of Hong Kong-listed stocks and ETFs, led by Alibaba, a large net buy; Tencent, a moderate net buy; Xiaomi, Ubtech Robotics, and Hua Hong Semiconductors, which were small net buys; SMIC and Meituan were small net sells. Shanghai, Shenzhen, and the STAR Board gained 0.53%, 0.41%, and 0.29%, respectively, on volume up 4.12% from yesterday, which is 129% of the 1-year average; 2,180 stocks advanced, while 2,798 declined. The value factor and large capitalization stocks outperformed the growth factor and small capitalization stocks. The top-performing sectors were communication services, +1.40%; financials, +1.31%; and consumer discretionary, +1.09%. Meanwhile, the worst-performing sectors were real estate, which fell 1.07%; health care, which fell 0.52%; and consumer staples, which did an inverse James Bond to close down by 0.07%. The top-performing subsectors were construction machinery, internet, and telecommunication, while leisure products, petrochemicals, and real estate were the worst. Northbound Stock Connect volumes were above average. CNY and the Asia Dollar Index rose versus the U.S. dollar. The Treasury bond curve steepened. Copper and steel fell.

Title: Tech and Non-Tech Stacks to Run Listen Notes (2025)
URL: https://www.listennotes.fm/p/tech-and-non-tech-stacks-to-run-listen
Time Published: 2025-03-05T15:59:28Z

I wrote about the tech stack of Listen Notes in early 2018 (with a slight update in 2019) in a blog post that got shared several times on Hacker News. It’s 2025 now, and with the evolution of our product lineup, my mindset, and technology itself (plus the decay of outdated tools), I think it’s time for a refresh. Back in 2018/2019, during the early years of Listen Notes, I focused on how to build products fast and get the right product off the ground. It was our “building phase”—similar to opening a new coffee shop, where you focus on interior design, sourcing coffee beans, designing the menu, etc. Now in 2025, Listen Notes has a mature product lineup. Our main focus has shifted to stability (aiming for ~100% uptime) and sustainability (ensuring Listen Notes remains a key player in podcasting even 10 or 20 years from now), much like running a coffee shop that consistently serves great coffee day in and day out. Listen Notes, Inc. is a company I started in October 2017. Initially, it was a single-page web app to search podcast episodes by keyword. This is how listennotes.com looked like in 2017: As you can see, the 2017 version of ListenNotes.com was quite basic. I hope this inspires you to launch your own web projects. Remember, launching is just the beginning—most of the work comes afterward. Now in 2025, Listen Notes is one database with three user interfaces (UIs): One Database: The best podcast database with high-quality metadata and (ideally) close to zero AI-generated fake podcasts. Three UIs to query the database: A website for discovering podcasts: ListenNotes.com A Podcast API for developers to integrate podcast discovery into their apps: PodcastAPI.com A “bring your own UI” option where you get raw data from us and use your preferred UIs (e.g., Excel, Google Sheets, SQLite, etc.) to explore the data. We also offer a few small-ish products. For example, we have a Cloudflare-based open-source CMS called microfeed and a fast podcast transcription/summarization tool called Listen411 (or Transcript.New). At this point, Listen Notes has more than one person to work on it (with a single-digit team size, and some even part-time). The exact number fluctuates based on our current technical and non-technical tasks. I believe we’ll see more companies like this—lean, efficient teams where not everyone needs to be full-time. I’ve been inspired by how Gumroad is run. I’d like to openly share how we run Listen Notes. However, as a private company, I can only disclose what I feel comfortable with. Like other companies (e.g., 37signals), we strive for a certain level of transparency but choose not to share revenue or highly detailed stats. While some startups embrace radical transparency (kudos to them!), most companies—including ours—prefer to keep some things private. We appreciate your understanding. You might find this article interesting: The Golden Era of Being an Open Startup Is Gone. There’s a darker side to human nature—when you try to be transparent, some people criticize you for not being transparent enough. It’s like donating to someone, only to be told it wasn’t enough. Let’s see how this goes. Fingers crossed. This will be a long post, but here’s a quick summary of the Listen Notes tech and non-tech stack in 2025. (Apologies if some cool, new tools you love are missing!) Engineering OS: Ubuntu Linux Cloud Hosting: Amazon AWS, Google Cloud, Cloudflare R2 + Pages Web Backend: Python, astral-sh/uv, Django, uwsgi, Nginx, supervisord Web Frontend: ReactJs, Tailwind, Webpack, Volta Async Workers: Celery, bash scripts, Docker DevOps: Ansible, Slack Datastore: Postgres, Elasticsearch, Redis, ClickHouse Dev Tools: Parallels, Vagrant, Packer, PyCharm Monitoring & Alerting: BetterStack Performance & Security: Cloudflare CDN / Firewalls / Turnstile Payments: Stripe, PayPal AI-Assisted Coding: ChatGPT Design: Figma Non-Engineering Documents: Notion, Microsoft Office 365 Legal: Clerky, Stripe Atlas Contractors / Freelancers: UpWork, 99designs, Facebook Groups Payrolls & Benefits: Gusto, Lively, Schwab, E*TRADE Domain Names: Cloudflare Registrar Helpdesk: HelpScout Emails: Superhuman, Google Workspace, Cloudflare Email Routing Small Website Building: microfeed.org with Cloudflare R2 & Pages Banking & Credit Cards: Mercury, Amex, Chase Bookkeeping: Quickbooks Online Office / Company address: WeWork The main products of Listen Notes are not particularly “technical”, because we don’t do deep AI research like OpenAI or build defense tech like Anduril or cure cancer. We just build superficial CRUD apps—like many web products today. As mentioned earlier, our main web app consists of one database and three UIs. Our code lives in a monorepo containing Django/Python for the backend, ReactJs for the web frontend, and various bash scripts/Ansible YAML files for DevOps. We use multiple data stores, including Postgres, Elasticsearch, Redis, and ClickHouse. Other small-ish projects (like microfeed and Listen411) have separate repos, but this article primarily focuses on our main Listen Notes business—the monorepo. If I remember correctly, the most profitable AWS products are all database-related. While we run on AWS, we don’t pay for those managed database products—we run open-source datastore software on AWS EC2 instances for cost efficiency. Sustainability is key: we want to provide excellent service without running out of money. Personally I enjoy shopping for new EC2 instance types—comparing specs, pricing, and benchmarking—especially after AWS re:Invent each year. It's a bit like how others love shopping for handbags, watches, or cars. I don’t know if it's a healthy (and admittedly expensive) hobby! We use Postgres as our primary data store, which has grown to over 1.2 TB. In the doomsday scenario, even if the code base or servers were gone, with our Postgres dump, the business could be restored. That’s how critical it is. When Listen Notes started, we used Postgres 9.6; now we’re on Postgres 17.0 (as of writing this post in early 2025). I remember each major upgrade vividly, almost like flipping through a family album. Our Python code—running on async worker servers (from compute-optimized EC2 instances like c5 to c6i to c7g)—ingests and processes podcast metadata, which then flows into Postgres. Most data related to the website (e.g., user info) & API are also stored in Postgres. Our Postgres cluster typically has 3 (sometimes 4 or 5) instances: one primary (for writes and some reads) and several read-only replicas with short query timeouts (e.g., 30 seconds). These servers run on storage-optimized EC2 instances (e.g., i3 → i3en → im4gn & is4gen). We avoid AWS RDS for cost and control reasons (e.g., lack of root access). Over time, we’ve accumulated many custom bash scripts for routine DBA tasks, some scheduled, others ad-hoc. The heart of Listen Notes is our podcast search engine. We index all public podcasts and episodes in the world—now totaling over ~200 million documents. (For comparison, in 1998 Google indexed ~25 million web pages, which was a lot then.) Our Elasticsearch cluster runs on storage-optimized EC2 instances. Whenever a podcast or episode is added, updated, or deleted, we sync the corresponding document from Postgres to Elasticsearch. We run periodic jobs to keep the two copies of data almost perfectly in sync. Search queries—whether triggered on the website, via the Podcast API, or from internal scripts—are routed from our Python code to the Elasticsearch cluster. We store analytics data (like API / listen / search logs) in our own ClickHouse installation. Added to our tech stack around 2020, ClickHouse has proven to be robust and fast for data warehousing. Kudos to the ClickHouse team! We rely on Redis as a cache for rate limiting, feature switches, and other performance-critical functions. Our Redis instances, hosted on memory-optimized EC2 instances, are among the longest-running servers in production, sometimes for 2–3 years before an instance upgrade—remember I enjoy shopping for new EC2 instance types? :) Technically, our “one database” is the logical “Podcast Database.” In practice, various data types are spread across Postgres, Elasticsearch, ClickHouse, and Redis. Even data like API / listen / search logs contribute indirectly (e.g., to our Listen Score). In any CRUD app, the data layer is critical—and it’s especially true for our business. In today’s world, UIs aren’t necessarily graphical—APIs and even voice interfaces (e.g., Amazon Echo) count. For Listen Notes, our three UIs are: Our website is a typical Django app with Views, Models, Celery tasks, and more. When I first wrote Listen Notes (late 2016), I used Django 1.9 and Python 2.7; today, we run Django 5.1 and Python 3.13. We organize our Django code into “apps” (e.g., playlists, episodes, datasets) with standard files like views.py, models.py, and admin.py. As some files grew large, we broke them into multiple view files (e.g., views_xxx.py, views_yyy.py, views_zzz.py, etc.) We used to use virtualenv and pip, but since early 2025 we’ve switched to uv. We found that uv is extremely useful for managing multiple Python projects across various versions—even when some dependency libraries don't yet support Python 3.13. Most webpages on ListenNotes.com are partly server-side rendered (Django templates) and partly client-side (a React single-page app compiled via Webpack with Volta to pin NodeJs versions). Although some criticize JS bundles and prefer vanilla JavaScript, we haven’t found major issues with our current approach. We simply cannot commit to a multi-week migration project based solely on a random blog post on the Internet—what works as best practices for others may not suit our needs. For async tasks triggered by user events (e.g., sending transactional emails), we offload to Celery async workers. In production, Django is served via uwsgi (managed by supervisord) behind an nginx load balancer. We group uwsgi processes to prevent one slow page type (e.g., search) from affecting other page types (e.g., feed). I wrote about building our Podcast API a few years ago. While the core remains the same, we’ve added more API endpoints, data attributes, SDKs for multiple languages, and even a self-hosted code playground. We launched the API in December 2017, and it’s now integrated into thousands of apps and websites. Initially, we used RapidAPI (then Mashape) to manage and monetize the API. However, after experiencing multiple RapidAPI outages, we spent a month building our own API gateway. This not only improved our reliability but also saved us from paying RapidAPI's 20% commission fee. While paying 20% might be acceptable for a side project, it's simply too high for a serious API business. Our API gateway is now part of our monolithic Django app, handling rate limits, authentication, authorization, caching, and the actual request processing. To let users try the API without writing code, we built our own multi-language code playground using Docker for an isolated environment. We allow customers to export raw podcast metadata and explore it in their favorite tools (Excel, Google Sheets, etc.). As a small business that serves many other small businesses, we favor an on-demand pricing model. Small customers might spend $10–$20 multiple times a year to access just the data they need, while larger customers can purchase the entire podcast database delivered as a SQLite file. We have extensive Python scripts to handle batch data exports and automatically deduplicate records from previous orders. When we first started Listen Notes, we used Sketch for all our design assets. In mid-2018, while working with a designer on our website redesign, we were introduced to Figma. Since then, it has become our go-to tool for all design assets. I know some idealistic developers believe everything on the Internet should be free or that the only moral way to earn is via a 9-to-5 job or donations. Listen Notes is a for-profit company—like a coffee shop, we have operating costs, and the people behind Listen Notes need to earn a living. If money wasn’t a concern (e.g., maybe become a trust fund kid in my next life?:), Listen Notes might be 100% free. We monetization via the aforementioned three UIs: UI #1 (Website): Free for 99.9% of users (with ads), with some premium features behind a paywall (no ads). Instead of forcing long-term subscriptions, we offer one-time “2-day passes” (think Disneyland tickets) by default, which many customers repurchase over several years. UI #2 (API): Operates on a freemium model. There’s a free plan for side projects, a self-service PRO plan (with fair pricing—if you use zero requests, you pay nothing), and an Enterprise plan involving a sales process. UI #3 (Data Exports): Self-service options let users buy a small piece of data on demand, while enterprise customers follow a full sales process. We use PandaDoc for contract management and both Stripe and PayPal for payment collection. Using two payment processors offers peace of mind in case one fails or bans us. We appreciate Stripe’s highly friendly and competent customer support, along with its excellent developer experience. However, when it comes to handling dispute charges, PayPal significantly outperforms Stripe. Any business that accepts credit card payments will inevitably face customer disputes—malicious claims are simply unavoidable. Fortunately, Listen Notes experiences only one or two disputes per year. When processed via PayPal, our win rate is nearly 100%, compared to about 15% when handled through Stripe. To be clear, this isn’t Stripe’s fault; it’s the credit card networks (Visa, MasterCard, American Express) that ultimately decide the outcome, with Stripe merely acting as the intermediary. To minimize disputes, we follow several best practices: offering a great product, providing excellent customer service, and ensuring that customers clearly understand the terms before payment. For our self-service tools, we display a prominent modal that outlines the terms and requires customers to click the “I Agree” button before proceeding. While this might deter some users, it effectively reduces the risk of future disputes—a trade-off we are willing to make. Additionally, our self-service tools automatically send PDF invoices to customers. These invoices are created by taking a screenshot of the HTML version of the invoice using headless Chrome and Puppeteer. Running a database business means continuously maintaining and cleaning the data. Our internal tools help us: Manually review newly added podcasts to ensure they don’t violate our content policies. Auto-detect AI-generated fake podcasts and streamline the review process. Handle user account operations (merging duplicate accounts, blocking bad actors, etc.). Toggle feature switches to ensure confidence when launching new features. Enhance customer support by instantly retrieving all essential details about a specific user or podcast—it’s like having a co-pilot. … These internal tools are built into our monolithic Django app and include a web portal as well as ChatOps (command-line tools within Slack) for quick operations. We maintain several small repos for AI/ML projects, primarily for features like “PEOPLE ALSO LIKE THESE PODCASTS.” But recently, we’ve had to use AI to fight AI — With tools like NotebookLM making it easier than ever to mass-produce fake podcasts, spammers have begun inserting casino links into AI-generated podcasts and distributing them across platforms. Listen Notes was the first to crack down on this issue. We developed multiple models to detect AI-generated fake podcasts and even open-sourced a simple one: notebooklm-detector. A few months ago, we reached out to Notebook LM’s lead PM to ask if they had tools for detecting Notebook LM-generated audio. She initially said yes but struggled for weeks to follow up before eventually leaving Google with several colleagues. It’s unclear how serious Google is about this project. Regardless, fighting AI-generated fake podcasts remains an ongoing effort. We invested in a maxed-out Mac Mini with an M4 chip to train models and refine our detection and review process. We’ve also uploaded some generated fake podcasts to Kaggle, hoping the community can collaborate to combat AI-generated spam effectively. We host our repos on both Bitbucket and GitHub for vendor redundancy. All production servers run on Ubuntu Linux. As for our devbox, we run Ubuntu inside Parallels + Vagrant on macOS. I personally code in PyCharm. I tried VS Code a few times in the past few years but always returned to PyCharm (I'm sorry; I promise I'll give VC Code another try in a few months to see if the chemistry is there. :) I also used GitHub Copilot for a year (2024) but eventually canceled the subscription. Nowadays, I often rely on ChatGPT for writing small bash scripts, React components, or Python functions—it’s like having an intern to do self-contained coding tasks for $20/month. In 2017, we used three $10/month DigitalOcean droplets. In early 2018, we switched to AWS (thanks to WeWork’s $5,000 AWS credits). Since then, we’ve become a loyal AWS customer. While cheaper alternatives exist, the cost of downtime or poor support is far higher in human and customer trust terms. AWS remains our choice, even though it’s our second biggest expense after human costs. For EC2 instances, we always purchase reserved instances and pre-pay where possible. It’s a significant expense but well worth it. We provision servers using Ansible. This lets us spin up an EC2 instance and have it fully configured automatically. Our primary data (in Postgres) is our single source of truth, replicated across multiple servers in realtime. We also run daily backups like this (encapsulated in a cron job): Run pg_dump on one of our read-only Postgres servers. Encrypt the dump with GPG. Upload to AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Cloudflare R2 - I hope these three public companies don’t lose our data all at once :) We deploy our Django and React code directly from MacBook Pro using an Ansible-orchestrated script. Our process is simple and effective—compile assets (JS/CSS), upload to Cloudflare R2 (served via Cloudflare CDN), and check out latest Django code on production servers via Ansible. A load balancer (nginx) ensures zero downtime by temporarily removing some uwsgi processes during deployments. In the past, we used Datadog, PagerDuty, and Atlassian Statuspage, costing ~$3,500 annually. As a small business owner, I frequently evaluate whether there are more affordable and better alternatives to the tools we use. Recently (early 2025), I found BetterStack. And we’ve already moved our entire monitoring & alerting stack to BetterStack—a bundled solution that cut our monitoring costs by 90% and offers responsive, friendly support. All requests to ListenNotes.com & Podcast API pass through Cloudflare, which provides CDN, firewall, and DDoS protection. We’ve set up custom firewall rules for different web pages and API endpoints. Our internal tools also integrate with Cloudflare’s API, allowing us to block or challenge malicious IP addresses with a click. To protect some compute-intensive pages on our website, we used to use Google reCAPTCHA, but since early 2025 we’ve switched to Cloudflare Turnstile—it's free and works well. We periodically upgrade key software components—such as Ubuntu, Postgres, Elasticsearch, and Django—to apply bug fixes, introduce new features, enhance security, and boost performance. Additionally, we update our EC2 instance types to optimize the price/performance ratio. Each upgrade is meticulously planned and rehearsed, which has prevented outages over the past eight years. These tasks remain too critical to fully trust to AI for now. This section covers the non-technical aspects of running the company—the parts I wish someone had shared at length when I started Listen Notes in 2017. Great customer support is the best form of marketing. I personally reply to most customer support emails, typically within an hour (and almost always within 12 hours). Two key tools help us do great customer support: Documentation & Help Articles: We use HelpScout for our helpdesk (listennotes.help). We used to use Intercom until I switched to HelpScout: more affordable and better! Email Client: I use Superhuman. Over the years, I’ve accumulated a lot of email snippets that lets me reply to most customer support messages within seconds—right inside Superhuman using shortcuts. We treat our customers the way we wish to be treated by any software or hardware vendor's support team. As customers, we all want prompt responses and we want to deal with honest, friendly, and competent human beings. We have multiple marketing channels. But the two most effective channels so far are: Providing great customer service that leads to positive word-of-mouth. Buy Google Ads. We’ve experimented with Facebook and Twitter ads, but Google Ads has proven most effective for us. We hold several checking accounts with major U.S. banks and Mercury that allows no-fee international wires. Why do we maintain checking accounts at multiple banks? Simply in case one experiences technical issues, goes bankrupt, or de-banks us—vendor redundancy gives us peace of mind. We also park our cash in Vanguard (VUSXX yielding 4+% as of early 2025). Caveat: Opening a Vanguard business account required multiple phone calls—a true test of patience. For business credit cards, we favor: Amex Business Gold: 4x points for advertising and software/hardware (except AWS). Amex Blue Business Plus: 2x points for all expenses under $50k/year. Chase Ink Business Preferred: 3x points for travel expenses. Amex Amazon Business Prime: 5x cashback on Amazon expenses, including AWS. These cards help us maximize rewards by allowing points transfers to airline and hotel loyalty programs (e.g., Chase to Hyatt), significantly reducing our conference travel expenses. We incorporated Listen Notes, Inc. through Stripe Atlas in 2017. Stripe’s customer support has always been friendly, competent, and incredibly helpful. For quick legal paperwork, we use Clerky, which offers on-demand pricing. For more complex legal matters, such as sales contracts, we work with a local law firm. We’ve used Notion since early 2018 for wikis and project planning. While it might not be perfect for every feature, it consolidates many useful tools in one place. We maintain runbooks for DevOps, DBA tasks, financial tables, and monthly kanban boards. Although cool kids use Linear nowadays, Notion works well for our small team. We also pay for Microsoft Office 365 to ensure compatibility with enterprise customers who rely on Word, Excel, and Teams. Since 2017, Gusto has reliably handled our payroll without excessive upselling. We also use it to send job offers, which significantly streamlines the process. Additionally, Gusto manages our payroll-related taxes, including withholding taxes and W-2 forms. It's a very reliable service—we love it. We use Lively (integrated with Schwab) for HSA and E*TRADE for 401k. It took me quite a while to figure out how to do these things—a lot of Googling, Reddit-ing, and many phone calls with other humans in the pre-ChatGPT era—but I’m glad it’s finally done. This might be the fun (or not-so-fun) part of being a small business owner! I personally believe that in the future, it will be normal for people to work multiple part-time jobs and have multiple income streams. Pay cycles will likely become more frequent than the traditional bi-weekly paycheck—ideally in real time, where you get paid immediately after completing a task. At Listen Notes, we frequently work with contractors and freelancers. A common example is hiring a CPA for tax prep—there’s no need for a full-time, in-house CPA at a tiny company. For design work or experimental projects, we often turn to platforms like Upwork or 99designs. I also enjoy hiring multiple people for the same task and comparing their results. While this approach can be more expensive, I value redundancy and having options. Occasionally, we also find freelancers through Facebook Groups, generate contracts using Clerky, and process payments via Gusto. We register dozens of domains through Cloudflare, GoDaddy, and Namecheap (since some TLDs are only available on certain registrars). Our corporate emails (e.g., hello@listennotes.com) are managed through Google Workspace, while some wildcard/project-specific addresses are handled via Cloudflare Email Routing (e.g., hello@listen411.com). BTW - we have several domain names for sale. Email hello@listennotes.com if you are interested: breaker.fm listen.host listenhost.com inka.fm Aside from our core products, we run several small websites using our own opensource project microfeed - Listen Notes Changelogs: changelog.listennotes.com Our mascot llamacorn: llamacorn.listennotes.com Listen Notes brand assets: brand-assets.listennotes.com Microfeed is a lightweight CMS built on the Cloudflare stack and originally designed for podcast hosting. Using microfeed allows us to host these “micro” sites on Cloudflare at virtually no cost. We plan to create more fun “micro” sites with microfeed in the future! Before COVID, we had a small office at WeWork. During the pandemic, we shifted to working from home. Now, we've returned to a dedicated private office at WeWork, which also serves as our business address. While knowledge workers can technically work from home, having a separate workspace often boosts productivity—at least it does for me. We do bookkeeping on our own using Quickbooks Online. While there was indeed a learning curve for us in early 2018, we have steadily improved over the past few years. Many VC-funded tax startups aim to generate recurring revenue by offering bookkeeping services (kind of like SaaS?), which in turn helps justify their valuations. However, as a small business owner, you might not need these services. If your financial operations are straightforward, handling bookkeeping internally can deepen your understanding of your business finances and enhance your financial acumen. After all, if you can flip binary tree, there's no reason you can't grasp some basic financial principles :) Thanks for reading this long blog post. I truly wish I’d had a resource like this when I started Listen Notes in 2017. I hope sharing our practical tools and practices can help others running a small software business. You don't have to chase every new tool or tech trend. Many of the tools we rely on have been around for over a decade—some even longer. In fact, podcast as a media format is 20+ years old! Our focus remains on stability and sustainability. We’ve been around for 8 years. Look forward to next 8 years~ This blog post was initially published at https://www.listennotes.com/blog/tech-non-tech-stacks-to-run-listen-notes-2025-113/ No posts Ready for more?

Title: The price of Wegovy was just cut by more than half — if you pay cash
URL: https://qz.com/wegovy-ozempic-novo-nordisk-price-cut-insurance-1851767802
Time Published: 2025-03-05T15:07:00Z
Full Content:
Following in the steps of its rival Eli Lilly (LLY-4.09%), Novo Nordisk (NVO-1.01%), the maker of the blockbuster drug Ozempic, is cutting the price of its weight loss drug by more than half for patients that pay without insurance. Novo Nordisk announced on Wednesday that it is now offering all doses of its popular weight loss drug Wegovy for $499 a month. That’s a more than 60% discount from the drug’s $1,349.02 list price. The catch is the offer is only available through the company’s direct-to-consumer service, NovoCare Pharmacy. And it applies only to uninsured patients or those with commercial insurance that doesn’t cover obesity treatments. “Novo Nordisk continues to advance solutions for patients that improve affordability and access to our medicines, whether they have insurance or not,” said Dave Moore, executive vice president of U.S. operations at Novo Nordisk, in a statement. “With NovoCare Pharmacy, patients and prescribers alike have another option that provides convenient access to all doses of real, FDA-approved Wegovy at a reduced cost in our high-quality pen.” Eli Lilly launched a similar offer last year through its direct-to-consumer program, selling the lowest doses of its weight loss drug Zepbound starting at $399. However, the medication came in single-dose vials, requiring patients to use a traditional syringe instead of the more convenient auto-injector pen that treatment usually comes in. Since then, the company has lowered the price and expanded the program to include all dose sizes. Novo Nordisk’s announcement comes as Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently removed semaglutide — the active ingredient in Wegovy and Zepbound — from its drug shortage list. The move put pressure on companies that have been able to sell off-brand, or compounded, versions of the drug amid past shortages. The FDA said that state-licensed pharmacies and physicians, known as 503A compounders, must stop making and distributing off-brand semaglutide products by April 22. Outsourcing facilities, known as 503B’s, have until May 22 to do the same. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: The 100 Best Artworks of the 21st Century

By The Editors of ARTnews, Art in America March 5, 2025 8:00am A global recession, a pandemic, 9/11, the Arab Spring, Brexit, the rise of Web 2.0, unrest in the face of economic stability, wars in Afghanistan, Ukraine, Gaza, and elsewhere: these were but a few of the many events that have defined the past 25 years, a period characterized by tumult and uncertainty. That all may explain why art appeared to change faster than ever all the while, with artists burning through styles and tendencies with each coming year. With the 21st century now at the quarter point, we’ve taken the opportunity to pinpoint the greatest artworks of the past 25 years. Even though we set down some parameters for ourselves (more on that here), it was no small task—one made more difficult by the restless creativity of artists during this period. The joy of an epic list like this one is that it can’t encapsulate everything: we know we’ve left some artworks off, simply because there was no shortage to choose from. We hope you’ll discover some amazing pieces here, reflect on some that are much-loved already, and debate the merits of others. And moreover, we hope to learn of new artworks through the conversations we hope our list inspires. Below, a look back at the greatest 100 artworks of the 21st century so far, as selected by the editors of ARTnews and Art in America. This article features contributions from the following writers: Francesca Aton, Andy Battaglia, Daniel Cassady, Anne Doran, Sarah Douglas, Maximilíano Durón, Alex Greenberger, Harrison Jacobs, Tessa Solomon, and Emily Watlington. Even from pictures, I can still feel the headache I got from this work’s pungent presence. Half a million cigarettes lean against each other to form a tiger skin carpet; walk around it, and see the colors change. By the time it premiered at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, the world’s tobacco-growing capital had shifted from Virginia to China, where Xu Bing is based. Yet in Chinese branding, “Virginia Tabacco” and other romanticized references to colonial lore still abound. Xu chose the cigarette brand 1st Class because it was one of the few still grown and distributed in the United States. The work’s mass and materiality were not only stunning and stinky; the piece’s enormity gave a glimpse of global supply chains. —E.W. In the uneasy images from this series, crowds of people look up at trees or poles that seem totally unremarkable. In fact, those trees once contained something horrifying: lynched Latinx, Asian, and Native American men. These lynchings have not often been recognized in the historical record, and Ken Gonzales-Day wanted to call attention to them. Rather than reproduce the bodies of these men, however, Gonzales-Day used image editing software to remove them. The focus here, instead, is the white people who attended the lynchings, creating a public spectacle of this brutality and then circulating images of it via postcards, which the artist collected. Gonzales-Day’s jarring images force viewers to reckon with a form of collective violence that is perpetrated by regular people, frequently with little to no consequences. —M.D. Before becoming an artist, Jordan worked as a diver. Underwater, she became fascinated by the symbiotic relationships shared by sea cucumbers and certain fish, who hide from predators in, of all places, the sea cucumber’s anus. Longing for such symbiosis, she turned to the potato, a German transplant much like herself, welcoming it in. First, she made a video in which she appeared to grow a potato in her own butt. Then, when the Humboldt Forum reopened in Berlin in 2021, the project got a second life. In protest of the institution, Jordan replied to the Forum’s invitation with a proposal astronomically overbudget. Home to looted objects in what was once an Imperialist palace, the Forum was occupied by Friedrich II—the king who made potatoes, native to the Andes, a German staple. Miraculously, the Forum accepted. At the grand reopening, Jordan lined the entrance with 3D-printed copies of her rump—33 of them, that butt-shaped number—all with tubers growing from her anus. This cheeky retort to nationalism and imperialism was a reminder that Germany’s treasures, even its cuisine, are extracted from elsewhere. More recently an image of Jordan’s potato-filled rump was used on posters protesting Germany’s crackdown on immigration, as if asking, will they deport kartoffel next? —E.W. Produced in the wake of Occupy Wall Street and a couple years after Meta (né Facebook) made facial recognition ubiquitous, Zach Blas’s Facial Weaponization Suite explores the sinister undercurrent of our surveillance state. For the work, Blas held workshops to collect the facial data of participants, and aggregated it to produce what he termed “collective masks.” Bulbous, strange, and an off-putting shade of magenta, the masks are meant not only to make users unidentifiable, but to protest the technology’s supposed objectivity. The most successful of them, Fag Face Mask, was generated with data solely from queer men in response to efforts to use the technology to determine sexual orientation, a goal obviously ripe for pseudoscience and stereotyping. Other versions respond to the targeting of immigrants and other minorities. More than a decade later, with immigrants, minorities, queer, and trans people under ever-heightening threat, perhaps it’s time to take up Blas’s call to challenge the techno-capitalist order. —H.J. As Schutz’s canvases have grown larger and her compositions more elaborate over the years, it is easy to forget the raw energy of the “Frank” paintings. An exhibition of them, at the now-defunct Zach Feuer gallery in New York, was the first time many of us encountered Schutz’s work and the punch that it packed. The show was called “Frank from Observation,” Frank being a fictional character Schutz made up; he lived on a desert island and was the last person alive. I’ve always considered the title of the show a double entendre: To paint something frankly is to paint something made of paint. Or, as David Salle has observed is Schutz’s greatest asset, “the imagining is inseparable from the paint itself.” (Or, again, as Nicole Eisenman put it more recently: “Someone like Dana Schutz is fantastic because she is painting with her eyes closed.”) This painting stands out from the other Frank paintings in the series because Frank has apparently become something else: a proboscis monkey. Is his mind so addled from isolation that he is imagining this? Is this a painting of Frank’s imagination? The mysteries have only deepened and become more complex with Schutz’s more recent canvases—which have occasionally courted controversy, as one did during the 2017 Whitney Biennial. —S.D. Barriers (Stanchions) comprises rows and rows of retractable belt barriers, arranged to form a maze. At the end stands a vinyl poster printed with a poignant statement borrowed from materials disseminated by the organization Immigration Equality: “FOR LGBT IMMIGRANTS, DEPORTATION CAN BE A DEATH SENTENCE. IT’S TIME FOR A NEW APPROACH.” What would such an approach entail? Surely, one that requires fewer of these seemingly innocuous barriers seen everywhere from national borders to airports, from DMV offices to museum admissions desks. —A.G. Wellness often gets talked about as if it is a science: Which treatments are the best, and how do they work? This leaves out a whole lot: the feelings elicited by buying things in search of healing, and the culture that wellness has brought about. Long before Gwyneth Paltrow’s pivot to Goop girlboss, Shana Moulton created an alter ego named Cynthia who was obsessed, like Paltrow, with finding the perfect cure. Cynthia isn’t trying to sell you anything, though. In this 10-part online soap opera, absurdist videos show Cynthia chasing the high of trying something new. She does so with a wink and a nod—and also with earnest hope, something that distances Whispering Pines from the woman-hating found in many critiques of wellness culture. Moulton’s series was pivotal in steering feminist art’s conversations about bodily difference toward the realm of disability, making space for ailments as a subject in art. —E.W. New Red Order, a public secret society founded in 2016 that comprises artists Jackson Polys, Adam Khalil, and Zack Khalil, along with their collaborators, has slyly critiqued settler colonialism via installation art that calls for greater recognition than simple land acknowledgments. The group’s film Give It Back: Crimes Against Realty focuses on the Land Back movement, which seeks the return of ancestral lands to Indigenous people. Commissioned by Creative Time, the film features testimonials about white people who have given their land back, but this is no documentary. Jim Fletcher, a white actor who has played Indigenous characters, is shown here giving an MTV Cribs-style tour of the Upper East Side apartment that houses the Gochman Family Collection, which focuses on Indigenous contemporary art. Fletcher then uses the New Red Order film as a platform to recruit others to the cause. This is a classic New Red Order gag in which irony and seriousness combine, confusing any potential allies. As usual, New Red Order gets the last laugh. —M.D. This video was a case of right place, right time. As serious conversations about the presence of Confederate monuments in American cities were gaining momentum, the Serbian artist made this essay film about monuments cropping up in the Western Balkans after the Yugoslav wars. These statues offered a means to remember histories without heroes: The artist dubbed them “turbo sculptures,” drawing on turbo-folk, a musical genre that emerged in the former Yugoslavia, combining folk tunes with techno. The video introduces bizarre statues of Bruce Lee in Bosnia, then Rocky Balboa and Johnny Depp in Serbia, asking whether these pop icons represented a healthy rejection of nationalism, or just denial in the wake of ethnic wars. Turbo sculpture’s absurdism was not unlike that proffered by other Eastern European artists who were introduced chaotically to capitalism’s dizzying variety. Last year, for her Kunsthalle Vienna retrospective, Domanović updated the work to account for the citizen toppling of the Bruce Lee statue, a reminder that nothing is permanent, neither humor nor history, no matter how sturdily sculpted. —E.W. The US military’s Iraq War–era insistence that waterboarding was not “torture” defied credulity. Bilal made a proposition to test the claim. Online, the Iraqi artist created a poll, asking the world to vote: Should he waterboard a dog or himself? If waterboarding wasn’t torture, after all, it should be no big deal to enlist others—or was it only no big deal when Iraqis were the recipients? Bilal “won” the poll after PETA stepped in (fair enough, considering the artist was the only consenting party). On video, he covered his face in cloth before pouring water over it in a process that simulates drowning. At the end of the video, Bilal, choking, says that “anyone who said it’s not torture should try it.” Here as ever, he puts his skin in the game in solidarity with the many other bodies on the line. —E.W. This brilliant artwork correctly diagnosed the art fair as a site for entertainment: Visitors pay their $30 admission and expect something big and shiny in return, and so, we got Jeff Koons’s diamond rings and hanging hearts and balloon dogs to gawk at—what critic Ben Davis called “bling conceptualism,” exemplified by Terence Koh redoing a Sol Lewitt in gold leaf and bronze (along with a gold leaf and bronze pile of dog poop). When you strolled past the booth of Gavin Brown’s Enterprise at Art Basel Miami Beach 2006 and saw nothing but a crumpled-up cigarette pack on the floor, you felt swindled. But if you stood there for a moment and waited, the thing, attached by transparent fishing line to an unseen mechanism in the ceiling, started dancing around. It is still one of the funniest things I’ve ever seen, a real fuck-you to the whole system. —S.D. In the mid-’90s, Laura Aguilar began a body of work in which she photographed herself and others in the nude, in a variety of landscapes. “Grounded,” her final series and the only one she ever did in color, was photographed in the rugged desert landscape of Joshua Tree National Park. These images are most impactful when they verge on abstraction. In Grounded #111, we see her nude body from behind in front of a much larger beige rock. She is seated on the ground, her back curving as she leans forward, and it takes a second to register that her body is indeed a body at all. The majesty of this natural landscape now includes Aguilar, and that was exactly her point: She wanted viewers to confront her nude fat body and appreciate it in the same way one might contemplate a desert. In doing so, Aguilar forced viewers to confront their own standards of beauty. —M.D. Growing up in Manhattan—specifically, Chelsea—Johnson has witnessed the increasing privatization of urban space firsthand. “Loiter” began when he noticed a certain form this phenomenon took: those medieval-looking spiked-metal contraptions affixed to standpipes, installed to prevent people from sitting on them as benches have become increasingly rare. To draw attention to this form of privatization, and to intervene in it, Johnson began removing the spikes from public areas, displaying them in galleries. This made the standpipes potential seating once again and produced new sculptures too. The effect is critique and repair together: not just a found object with a dark story, but one whose displacement is a victory. —E.W. During the 2005 Venice Biennale, Frieze magazine sent out SMS messages with hints as to what you would see in the national pavilions. The one for Germany was especially cryptic: The display was said to be “so contemporary.” This was the first time many encountered—“encounter” being the operative word—the work of Tino Sehgal, whose performers were seen dancing around you as soon as you made your way into the building. “This is so contemporary, contemporary, contemporary!” they sang. Sehgal had by then become known among curators as one of the primary figures associated with relational aesthetics, a tendency in which artists offered conversations and interactions, not objects, as artworks. A fair number of such works were whimsical and moving: Rirkrit Tiravanija’s 1990s meals-as-art come to mind. But This Is So Contemporary! was relational aesthetics at its most charming. —S.D. When President Joe Biden ended the war in Afghanistan, he did so abruptly: US troops left overnight with no real plan in place for an Afghan future. Predictably, the Taliban took over the next day. In their scramble, the troops left behind a bunch of trash: Gatorade bottles, junk food bags, tires, jugs. Hazara kindly collected all that garbage, effectively cleaning up the mess the Americans left behind for a gesture he has referred to as “a gift to the American people.” Then, he assembled it all into various installations that have traveled to Melbourne, Milan, Bombay, Kolkata, Sharjah, and Berlin. Next fall, at SculptureCenter in New York, the trash will return home, in a pointed provocation ultimately made of flimsy, powerless stuff. —E.W. Santiago Yahuarcani was one of the standouts of a 2024 Venice Biennale that celebrated the vastness and underacknowledged variety of the world, and El mundo del agua (The world of the water) is one of the paintings that broadcast his spirited engagement with Indigenous histories and allegiance to the land. As a member of the Aimeni (White Heron) clan of the Uitoto Nation of northern Amazonia, Yahuarcani channels stories of cosmological creatures, colonial conflict, and ancestral legacies, often on llanchama (a type of parchment made from bark). In El mundo del agua, mermaids rise, snakes writhe, and a marine organism smokes a pipe—all with a sense of intricacy and electricity that make it seem ancient and contemporary at once. —A.B. Though her output has encompassed a dizzying range of mediums, German artist Isa Genzken is best known for her sculpture, from fabricated pieces such as her lacquered-wood “Ellipsoids” of the 1970s and architectonic cast-concrete pieces of the late 1980s to her mixed-media assemblages of the 1990s (which, being in step with the work of younger American artists like Rachel Harrison and Jessica Stockholder, brought her increased visibility in the United States). Despite shifts in modes and materials, a consistent theme in Genzken’s art has been a fascination with modernist design and architecture, particularly their interaction with the messy business of urban life. First shown at New York’s AC Project Room in 2000, “Fuck the Bauhaus (New Buildings for New York)”—a group of six sculptures pieced together from scraps of found cardboard, foam core, plastic, and glass—epitomize the irreverent yet formally sophisticated approach that has marked Genzken’s art for half a century. —A.D. Kudzu, a fast-growing plant that the American government brought from Japan to the US in 1876, is an invasive species that is difficult to contain. In this installation, however, kudzu is something to behold, a species that fascinates because of its unwillingness to be hemmed in. Taking the work’s title from a Fred Moten essay, Precious Okoyomon intended the kudzu as a parallel for Blackness, given the plant’s history as a means of fighting the lingering environmental effects of cotton production in the American South. Fittingly, the artist has described both kudzu and Blackness as being “indispensable to and irreconcilable with Western civilization.” —A.G. Four decades ago, the Guerilla Girls made a name for themselves by provocatively calling attention to the disparities faced by women artists within museums and galleries. In 2018 they returned with an incisive rumination on how the art world handles allegations of sexual harassment and assault against artists—straight white males in particular—in the wake of the #MeToo movement. For this work, the Guerrilla Girls took on the case of artist Chuck Close, who the previous year had been accused of sexual harassment by women who had modeled for him. They presented three versions of a museum wall label for the artist’s 1992 portrait of Bill Clinton: one for museums “afraid of alienating billionaire trustees,” one for “conflicted” museums, and one for “museums who need help from the Guerrilla Girls.” The final text is the only one to mention the allegations; it ends with “the art world tolerates abuse because it believes art is above it all, and rules don’t apply to ‘genius’ white male artists. WRONG!” The work reminds viewers that even something as simple and didactic as a museum label is never objective. —M.D. The community of Kinngait (known as Cape Dorset until 2020) in Nunavut, northern Canada, has produced such renowned Inuit artists as Kananginak Pootoogook, Pitseolak Ashoona, and Kenojuak Ashevak, largely through the West Baffin Eskimo Cooperative, an art studio established in 1959. Until late in the 20th century, works from this cooperative tended toward subjects such as birds, fish, and other animals, as well as idealized scenes of traditional Inuit life. Both Ashoona, Annie Pootoogook’s grandmother, and Napachie Pootoogook, her mother, however, were among the first Inuit artists to create autobiographical artworks. Following their example, Pootoogook likewise based her drawings on personal experience, including her struggles with addiction and—as here—abusive relationships. Her work found fame in the larger world (it was included in Documenta 12 in 2007), but the artist drowned in Ottawa’s Rideau River in 2016 at age 47. Whether an accident, suicide, or murder, her death remains a mystery. —A.D. The imminent has at last caught up with Tishan Hsu, whose work since the 1980s has imagined how digital technologies might transform our visual world, our consciousness, and even our bodies. The pieces Hsu made while a denizen of the 1980s East Village art scene comported with the quasi-minimalist sculptures of the time, but they differed from those by, say, Ashley Bickerton or Haim Steinbach in that they pondered a data-driven future rather than a commodity-oriented present. As Hsu told art critic Martha Schwendener in 2021, “All of my work is really an effort to come up with something that would convey this paradigm that I felt would become very influential, that would have a huge impact on our reality, and that I was already seeing [happen] in much simpler ways.” By the 1990s Hsu was using emerging software like Photoshop to create silk-screened works with photo-based imagery. Since then, rapid advances in computer imaging have afforded the artist the tools he needed to produce hybrid pieces like this one, which combines references to bodies (photos of eyes and flesh-colored silicone protuberances); a screenshot of a quotidian exchange between a user and a program; and an enveloping, vaguely reptilian digital “skin.” —A.D. Perhaps you want to license a digital photograph of a nubile young woman bent over an open dishwasher and smelling a freshly laundered flip-flop? You can do so, for only $200, via DISimages, a library of stock photography that enlisted artists such as Katja Novitskova, Dora Budor, and Anicka Yi to produce the hundreds of images hosted on a website that effectively offers the same services as iStock and Shutterstock. The photographs DIS sold here appropriate the sleek brightly lit aesthetic of stock pictures, except that here, all the subject matter appears dark and downright bizarre. Was DISimages an ironic stunt, a ploy for attention? Not even the collective’s members could agree. But when DISimages went viral on social media, it laid bare an online appetite for meaninglessness, with a side of absurdist humor. —A.G. Debates about who is allowed to represent whom lit the internet on fire when Dana Schutz showed a painting of Emmett Till, a Black teenager abducted and lynched by a white mob, at the 2017 Whitney Biennial. In one particularly controversial remark, Schutz defended herself, saying, “I don’t know what it is like to be black in America. But I do know what it is like to be a mother.” Hamishi Farah extended her logic, painting a blond child Farah claimed was Schutz’s son, Arlo, an image of whom he had found online. In so doing, Farah asked how it feels to have one’s child painted into a political debate. —A.G. In this 11-minute film, one of the most intimate artworks I’ve ever seen, we watch Sophie Calle’s mother’s final moments. At first, the French artist hadn’t meant for the video to be art at all; she had simply left a camera rolling in her mother’s final days, hoping to stay connected when she had to step out and run errands. But then she noticed something profound she thought was worth sharing: though in the footage you are watching someone die, death itself is impossible to see. In the video, Calle’s mother is shown lying still in bed, and after she dies, she simply lies still some more—this is a moving image that doesn’t move. Here, Calle managed to show me something I’d truly never seen before, even though it happens every day. —E.W. After the curator Okwui Enwezor stumbled upon a screening in India by the history-major-turned-filmmaker Amar Kanwar, he liked the film he saw—A Season Outside (1997)—so much that he commissioned a sequel. The follow-up, A Night of Prophecy (2002), premiered in Documenta 11, Enwezor’s defining exhibition that ushered in contemporary art’s so called “global turn.” In this feature film, Kanwar records vernacular poetry—sayings people share—derived from times of conflict, spanning eleven languages from across India. In one memorable line, a young Dalit boy asks his mother whether he is Hindu or Muslim. She replies with a searing line borrowed from a 1970s Prakash Jadhav poem—one likely passed down orally, as few Dalits then had access to literacy education—telling him, “You are an abandoned spark of the world’s lusty fires.” A Night of Prophecy implies that history is recorded not through timelines or forensics so much as the traces of poetry that they leave behind, the stories those most affected pass down. —E.W. A multitude of artists mined archives of all kinds during the 21st century, re-presenting information about under-examined histories in unexpected ways. Tiona Nekkia McClodden exemplified the trend with her multipart “Brad Johnson Project,” examining the archive of the Black American queer poet Brad Johnson, who died in 2011. In a series of 10 videos, McClodden recites Johnson’s works; the final entry shows her hanging upside-down as she reads his 1988 poem “On Subjugation,” as a way to make visceral the subjugation Johnson describes. For the installation version of this work, McClodden places a screen showing the video behind the structure from which she was suspended; that structure is itself hung with her boots and accompanied by a smattering of earth, rose petals, and naval and leather/BDSM paraphernalia. Taken together, these objects give us a fuller sense of Johnson and the life he lived. In looking to queer ancestors of the past and filling in the gaps, McClodden was able to make something wholly new, moving, and poignant. —M.D. Why does the woman in this picture look so familiar? Because she’s meant to. Conceptual artist Christopher Williams’s work, usually produced by professional studios, often mimics 20th-century commercial, ethnographic, or architectural photographs. While deconstructing how such photographs continue to shape our present late-late-capitalist reality, the artist also deconstructs how they were made—here, by including a usually hidden Kodak tool. The photo’s subject is a model Williams chose using the criteria given in a casting call for Jacques Tati’s 1967 film Playtime. Her pose, open-mouthed smile, and towel-wrapped hair vividly recall bath soap ads of the 1960s and ’70s. In another nod to Kodak, the towel is the exact shade of the company’s signature yellow packaging. Despite, or perhaps because of, such extreme deliberation, the resulting artwork is as seductive as the advertisements that inspired it. —A.D. Informed by a visit to a pearl-making facility in China in 2014, this video captures the delicate and repetitive tasks Mika Rottenberg witnessed—in particular, the extracting and sorting of pearls. In her absurdist take on the subject, Rottenberg links these activities with a range of other seemingly unconnected ones: an administrative worker rings a bell that prompts a Chinese factory worker to turn a handle, powering a fan that then blows pollen from a bouquet of flowers into her nose. The sneezes that result mimic the way that oysters, when irritated by grains of sand, eventually produce pearls. But you don’t need to know that Rottenberg’s strange fictions are in fact based in truth for this video, which highlights the global economy’s various forms of exploitation and production that ultimately give way to the treasures we call our own. —F.A. Like many of the most memorable creations by the perennially probing and prescient Pierre Huyghe, After ALife Ahead became all the more identifiable as a work by Huyghe when it started to stray from the control of the artist himself. He created this work—a “time-based bio-technical system,” as he called it—for the 2017 edition of Skulptur Projekte Münster, where it took the form of a sort of excavation of a former ice rink that was transformed into an alternately earthy and technology-abetted biosphere, with materials including bacteria, algae, bees, human cancer cells, and phreatic water (water from below the water table), along with a variety of snail whose patterned shell provided information that triggered sound- and color-changing aquarium glass. Altogether it was a kind of tribute to old and new life forces that are stranger than science-fiction. —A.B. It would be easy, in 2025, as Ai Weiwei produces countless LEGO re-creations of art history, to forget just how revolutionary the Chinese artist-activist’s work has been. Travel back to 2008, however, and Ai was in a very different place in his career. That year, a devastating earthquake hit China’s Sichuan province, killing nearly 90,000 people. It was a national tragedy made more devastating by the government’s censorship of information about it. No one truly knew the scope—no one outside the immediate area, that is—until Ai created “a citizen investigation team” to interview survivors, uncovering widespread corruption in building construction, which was to blame for many of the deaths. That effort resulted in Straight. For the installation, Ai and his team collected 200 tons of mangled rebar rods from schools that had collapsed and meticulously straightened them by hand. The rods were then laid out to resemble tectonic plates in a gallery where the names of 5,000 schoolchildren who had died in the quake were displayed on the walls. A tribute to those lost, the installation is a crushing emotional experience to walk through. And, as Ai recalled in 2018, Straight and his other works around the earthquake made him “the most dangerous person in China.” —H.J. South African photographer Zanele Muholi, whose work was the subject of a recent retrospective at Tate Modern, prefers to be known as a visual activist. Born in 1972, they began studying at photojournalist David Goldblatt’s famed Market Photo Workshop in Johannesburg in 2001. The following year, they began photographing members of South Africa’s LGBTQI community, individuals whose rights are constitutionally protected but who are nevertheless frequent victims of discrimination, harassment, and sexual and physical violence. In the series of portraits “Faces and Phases” (2006–14), from which this photograph is taken, Muholi focused largely on Black South African lesbians and trans men, a population with which the artist most identifies. While Muholi has since expanded into theatrical self-portraits and color images of LGBTQI people in public places, these tender black-and-white depictions, which insist on the humanity of their subjects, remain some of Muholi’s most poignant images. —A.D. For nearly a decade now, rafa esparza has transformed institutions with installations made of adobe. His installation tierra, made for the 2016 edition of the Hammer Museum’s Made in L.A. biennial, was among the first of these high-profile interventions, covering the museum’s north terrace with adobe bricks that were produced using dirt from Elysian Park, the site of Dodgers Stadium, which had once been a vibrant Chicano community known as Chavez Ravine. At the Hammer, esparza installed found objects in his adobe brick road, including a mailbox and a blue armchair accompanied by a cactus. Such interventions, esparza has said, stem from his “interest in browning the white cube” as a “response to entering traditional art spaces and not seeing myself reflected.” A vital part of this project has been enlisting members of his community in his art: He learned to make adobe bricks from his father, and for this iteration, he brought on his mother and siblings to help out. —M.D. When Luc Tuymans debuted this painting in the aughts, it seemed that the world had little use for more images of Condoleezza Rice. Then National Security Advisor to President George W. Bush, she was responsible for controversially authorizing waterboarding in the so-called “war on terror” while advocating for the invasion of Iraq, falsely claiming the nation possessed weapons of mass destruction. But the Belgian artist’s portrait and its attendant commentary would prove more relevant still. Tuymans was inspired to paint Rice after her 2005 trip to Belgium, when the nation’s foreign affairs minister called her a “strong, not unpretty woman.” Her neck and chin are cropped out, and her brow is furrowed. The painting’s sickly grays and muted beiges offer a decidedly unheroic vision of this high-ranking politician, neatly encapsulating the distrust of authority that was in the air post-9/11 in the US and beyond, and turning the power dynamics of portraiture on its head. —A.G. In 2014 Israeli soldiers in the occupied West Bank shot and killed two unarmed teenagers, Nadeem Nawara and Mohammad Abu Daher. The case hinged at the time on whether the soldiers used rubber bullets, as they claimed, or illegally fired live rounds. Together with Forensic Architecture, the London-based research group that investigates armed conflicts, Lawrence Abu Hamdan performed an acoustic analysis of the gunshots, audio of which was captured and disseminated widely alongside video of the incident. Israel initially claimed that its soldiers could not have killed the two teens, but Abu Hamdan’s research suggested otherwise: The soldiers, he ultimately proved, had fired live rounds. A year or so later, he reimagined the body of evidence as Earshot, an installation comprising photographs, video, and audio. The gallery thus became another court of culpability. Here, art functioned as journalism should, with the power to hold politics accountable to fact. —T.S. During the late ’90s, Apple’s Macintosh computer touted a sleek aesthetic, distinct from the less user-friendly PC. That’s why, for this “desktop performance,” as the artists call it, the Dutch duo JODI—Joan Heemskerk and Dirk Paesmans—used a Mac to induce a dizzying experience, one at odds with Apple’s claims of seamlessness. Using an OS 9 operating system, JODI opened up folders within folders, files upon files, until it all climaxed into chaos. Hosted as an interactive work on JODI’s website and later recorded via screen capture, the piece required its user to close out of an overwhelming barrage of windows, putting Apple’s marketing to the stress test. With My%Desktop, one of the defining works of net art, JODI shows how Apple streamlined, and perhaps even sanitized, the act of computing, alluding to how the corporation tried to obscure computational processes. —A.G. Wangechi Mutu had in mind a specific mother while creating this collage: Funmilayo Anikulapo-Kuti, whose son was the pioneering Nigerian musician Fela Kuti. Yet the woman shown here is just as easily a stand-in for many more women, specifically “all the mothers who give us our voices and empower us to be who we are and believe in our talents,” as Mutu put it in an interview published alongside her 2023 New Museum retrospective. Her subject is shown sinking a stiletto into the neck of a severed serpent, a “monster that managed to span two … continents,” per Mutu, who has also said that the work shows opposites colliding: “African/European, archaic/modern, religion/pornography.” The result is a fantastical world filled with disco balls and gigantic jellyfish, with implicit critiques, unglued from reality, laying the ground for a whole new world. —A.G. This installation was a progenitor of the blockbuster immersive video boom that critics love to hate. Indeed, it got the kinds of criticism such videos get today: that it was too pretty, that it was merely spectacle. When it debuted at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, Jerry Saltz wrote that the piece served as but a backdrop while visitors typed on laptops or hung out. In protest of the video’s lulling, hypnotic appeal, another artist even staged a yoga class inside MoMA. But beneath the piece’s consumable veneer, Rist sneaked in something subversive: this sleepy, gorgeous film is about menstrual blood. In it, Rist’s protagonist sets out to collect her menses in a silver chalice, but rendered in fuchsia instead of scarlet. Floating freely in an underwater world, her blood feels palatable, even pretty. Rist’s feat was making menstrual blood as boring and ordinary as it really is. —E.W. Paul Chan’s 1st Light conjures a sense of wonder by way of a sort of shadow play projected on the floor. For 14 minutes, in a state of soundlessness that grows more and more profound, the work cycles through a succession of slow-motion imagery that fluctuates between the familiar and the abstract. As if backlit by a window nowhere to be found, a series of squiggles and lines is accompanied by the silhouettes of birds flying off in the distance. Then, shortly after, the shadows of bodies begin to tumble and fall upside-down, turning the mood unmistakably somber. The presence of streetlights and railroad cars suggests an urban setting being torn asunder, and in that, 1st Light summons memories of 9/11 that remain just as haunting now as they were when Chan debuted this work in 2005, four years after that tragic day. —A.B. In 2010 Basel Abbas and Ruanne Abou-Rahme were in Palestine, watching the Arab Spring uprisings through social media. The images of protesting, dancing, and singing that passed through the digital slipstream made them determined to counteract the amnesia of the internet. That impulse evolved into an ongoing project to document and preserve Palestinian culture against its ongoing erasure at the hands of the Israeli state. The work has taken many forms: installations, an interactive web project, public performances, and sculptures. While the ground-level urgency of May amnesia… has never been more clear following the decimation of Gaza, the work is also formally daring. By engaging a digital vernacular that blurs boundaries between artist, subject, and audience, this work refuses a frozen, historicized vision of Palestinian identity. We are still here, the work says in so many ways—still dancing, still singing, still resisting. —H.J. Louise Lawler took this photograph just after Art Basel Miami Beach held its first edition. The weirdness of the fair—its rampant commercialism and fast-paced sales, both seemingly at odds with much of the conceptual art showcased there—may explain Lawler’s unusual approach to photographing Marian Goodman Gallery’s inaugural booth at this event. Here as in other works, Lawler takes aim at works by her well-known male colleagues—in this case, Maurizio Cattelan’s sculpture of Pablo Picasso and Thomas Struth’s photograph of a museum. Rather than shooting these objects straight-on, Lawler pictures them mid-install, such that the head of the Cattelan sculpture is shown separate from the body, which lies on a blanket beneath the Struth photograph. With the Cattelan sculpture represented as though decapitated, Lawler dressed down Picasso, that symbol of male genius, while also offering an unglamorized glimpse of how the sausage that is the art world gets made. —A.G. Themes of capitalism, colonialism, and immigration meet in this work, a one-to-one replica of Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi’s Statue of Liberty. The work’s 300 or so pieces commissioned in 2010 from a fabricator in Shanghai remain forever disassembled. Depending on how they are exhibited and where, the isolated pieces resemble welded copper abstractions, salvaged artifacts or scrap metal sold on the cheap (one piece was even reported missing in 2014). Myriad readings befit the installation, which alludes to the malleability of state symbols, particularly those purporting to represent freedom—whatever that currently means in America. “We the People is not about going to the past,” Vo said of the work on its debut. “Since it’s one of the most important icons for Western liberty I think [it] is very much about the present and our future.” —T.S. For 10 months, artist Paulo Nazareth traversed the Americas, starting from his home state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, and ending in Miami, for an edition of Art Basel Miami Beach. Nazareth has described the trek, covering several thousands of miles and 15 countries, as “a residency in transit” and an “accidental residency.” Along the way, Nazareth documented what he saw in photos, videos, texts, and found objects, providing a firsthand look at how grueling the process of migrating from South America to the United States can be, both physically and geopolitically. In one image from the series, a tiny US flag lies under the artist’s bloated dirty feet; in another, he stands before a sign demarcating the Arizona state border holding a placard that reads WE HAVE RIGHTS AT THIS LANDSCAPE. In many ways, the project points to the absurdity of man-made borders, particularly when confronting the perseverance needed to navigate them. —M.D. Second Life, a multiplayer virtual platform popular during the 2000s, beckoned users with the promise of a fresh start in an online-only world. Yet in using the platform for this piece, Cao Fei showed that digital dreams were inextricable from the IRL world. Named after the shorthand used to describe the Chinese yuan, RMB City may have seemed like an escape from 21st-century China, whose citizenry had been reshaped—and alienated—by attempts at globalization. In Cao’s alternate reality, one found a floating panda, carefully manicured fields, and a giant spinning wheel set on a sunny blue isle. But one also found the stuff of unchecked urbanization: a crane, slick yet scarcely populated skyscrapers, a smokestack belching fire. All this combined to form a landscape that was at once familiar and fantastic, showing how our fantasies are hard to cleave neatly from the worlds we know. —A.G. When this 2-channel, 37-minute piece debuted, the animation felt frighteningly cutting-edge. Over a decade on, it’s still uncanny. It’s clear now that this owes less to the technology, which is already dated, than to how Atkins uses it, blending CGI’s sleek hyperrealism with realism of a gritty variety. The computer-generated skinhead protagonist of Us Dead Talk Love has phrases tattooed on his face—they change over the video’s duration, from ASSHOLE to FML to DON’T DIE. We watch him smoking, shirtless, singing a melancholy tune with lyrics proclaiming that love makes us sad, and sadness makes us drink. Scenes show a limp dick, a man passed out at the bar, words like ENFEEBLED and DISAFFECTION hovering in cheesy fonts. It’s all chillingly affecting—its sadness too real, its presentation not real at all, the video’s sheen incongruous with its sorrow. As ever, it’s Atkins’s skillful, poetic writing that carries the piece. —E.W. The protagonist of Wildness is not a person but a place: the Silver Platter, a Los Angeles bar that narrates the film. Founded in the 1960s in the city’s MacArthur Park neighborhood, the Silver Platter has long offered a safe haven to LA’s queer and trans communities, as well as to immigrants from Latin America. (The bar shut down in 2010 and has since reopened under new management.) The film’s backdrop is the bar’s weekly “Wildness” party, organized by director Wu Tsang, who also stars, and DJs NGUZUNGUZU & Total Freedom. Noirish shots of the bar and its environs, weekly drag performances, and people dancing are interspersed with talking-head interviews. Amid all this is a moody narration spoken by Mariana Marroquín and drawn from oral histories by Tsang. Wildness is a portrait of both a bar and a community built by it, where “the struggle to find adequate labels/identities/descriptors for this ‘community’ is precisely what the film is about,” as Tsang once put it. —M.D. Posters and ephemera salvaged from the streets of Mark Bradford’s South Central Los Angeles neighborhood are layered to form the surface of this unconventional painting, which he made by sanding down its various strata, exposing fragments of information embedded between them. The result looks like a form of cartography—a map, perhaps, of a dense network found in the vast metropolis that Bradford calls home. Yet the painting is not only a celebration of South Central: Its title refers to a Roman term of appeasement used to distract the public from more substantial issues, like poverty and disenfranchisement. The work’s beautiful surface could serve as a similar kind of distraction, but his materials make clear that he’s dealing with real problems impacting his community. —F.A. We may want to imagine that nostalgia-inducing franchises from the past are set in stone. But Cory Arcangel suggested with his 2002 installation Super Mario Clouds that everything is inherently fungible. To make the work, Arcangel undertook the laborious process of hacking a Super Mario Bros. cartridge, removing every element except the game’s pixelated clouds and vibrant blue sky. Presented on monitors and projected on nearby walls simultaneously, those clouds now float on without Mario, Luigi, or their cohort to race around beneath them. From the detritus of consumerism, Arcangel forged something new: an artwork that resembled its source material in spirit alone. —A.G. The sculpture represents a person with the creviced face of a 50-year-old man and the body of a grade-school boy—the contrast would be jarring enough even if it weren’t, well, him. Cattelan himself said he nearly destroyed the piece depicting Adolf Hitler after completing it, but in the end, he made it in an edition of three (a fourth copy, the artist’s proof, sold for $17 million at Christie’s in 2016). We think of Hitler as a dark cloud looming over history, but here we are able to look down on the man, who is posed as a supplicant. Cattelan called the piece “a test for our psychoses.” He completed it in early 2001; a half year later came 9/11 to prove that, pace Fukuyama, history had not ended. We live in it still. —S.D. Some 15,000 objects—roughly half of which remain at large today—were looted from the National Museum of Iraq in Baghdad after the American invasion of the country in April 2003. A few years later, Michael Rakowitz set out with the goal of creating to-scale reproductions of every stolen artifact, a project so epic that it is still ongoing. Each replica is made using Middle Eastern commercial packaging for foodstuffs and local Arabic newspapers that were then exported to the US. Though these looted artifacts are now made visible once more, Rakowitz’s efforts also underscore the fragile nature of the originals, which may never return to the Museum. The piece doubles as both a form of institutional critique and a kind of research art: Accompanying labels reveal each original object’s status, and provide additional contextual information about its whereabouts from experts. —F.A. One way to establish intimacy with an audience is to stage an artwork that revolves around plaintively strumming a guitar while naked in a bathtub and singing a song that tugs at the heart and explodes with emotion. That is what Ragnar Kjartansson did for The Visitors, a mesmeric nine-screen video installation that features the Icelandic artist and a cast of his friends bowing, plucking, and picking their way through a cryptic piece of music whose soft spot for slyness and sentiment is clear. Though the title alludes to the name of Swedish pop group ABBA’s last album, the lyrics draw from a poem written by Ásdís Sif Gunnarsdóttir, Kjartansson’s ex-wife, with whom he had recently split. The words aren’t easy to decipher (they’re both sad and uplifting, and the breakup was said to be amicable), but they strike an improbably moving chord when they cycle back around to a much-repeated chorus: “once again I fell into my feminine ways.” —A.B. When Jill Magid was denied access to the professional archives of Mexican architect Luis Barragán—which were bought by the Swiss furniture company Vitra—she turned the problem into an opportunity, steering the genre of institutional critique away from museums and toward corporations. First, she contrived clever ways to get around copyright restrictions. Instead of paying a licensing fee to reproduce a photograph, for instance, she bought a book that had already printed it, then framed the whole book. Forbidden from re-creating his iconic pyramidal lectern, she skirted copyright law by adjusting the scale—that is, until a French show under new jurisdiction required she throw a blanket on top. Despite these persistent public pleas, archival access remained restricted. Then, Magid managed permission for something even wilder: with the consent of Barragán’s family, she exhumed his ashes and turned them into a diamond, which she then used to propose to the archive’s keeper. The offer of her proposal still stands. —E.W. If you needed a reminder of the sheer power of this artwork, you had a chance to see it last year during Paul Pfeiffer’s survey at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. I saw that show, and can report that John 3:16 has aged exceptionally well, given that, if anything, we revere sports stars even more now than we did at the turn of the millennium. On a tiny screen, a basketball appears to dart around a court in the absence of players, their hands merely hinted at. You have to get up close to see this little screen, as you would with a liturgical manuscript. (The piece is named for the famous biblical passage: “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”) In casting basketball as revelation, Pfeiffer mined footage from the NBA, splicing together clips with the utmost meticulousness, doing for the game what Christian Marclay did for time with The Clock. —S.D. After the Yes Men made DowEthics.com, a website spoofing Dow Chemicals, they received an invitation from a BBC journalist who was apparently not in on the joke. Andy Bichlbaum, a member of the art collective, gleefully accepted, appearing in front of 350 million viewers on the 20th anniversary of the 1984 Bhopal disaster that exposed hundreds of thousands of Indians to toxic gas. The artist, pretending to be a businessman, took “full responsibility” for the gas leak at a pesticide plant and issued an apology to the thousands killed and the many more rendered chronically ill. Stocks plummeted; the Dow retracted. The Yes Men highlighted the authority we bestow on white men in suits, then wielded that power against, well, power itself. —E.W. In the 1980s, after retiring as a machinist at the Pullman boxcar factory in Bessemer, Alabama, Thornton Dial started making assemblage sculptures and reliefs. By the time of his death in 2016 at the age of 87, he had been widely recognized as a major contemporary artist whose work—materially inventive, formally rigorous, and politically astute—rendered the distinction between trained and self-taught immaterial. In 2011 Dial embarked on a series of reliefs inspired by natural disasters, including the Tuscaloosa tornadoes of 2000 and the Japanese earthquake and tsunami of 2011. In this piece, an undulating wave of tree branches, torn metal, and scraps of sequined fabric set against a watery blue and white painted background, he memorialized the devastation Hurricane Katrina caused in New Orleans in 2005 and its disproportionate effect on the city’s largely Black Lower Ninth Ward. —A.D. When the Statue of Liberty reopened following its eight-year hiatus, the mood was tense. Though the destruction of the 9/11 attacks that prompted the closure was in the distance, the trauma of that fateful day remained present. Steve McQueen captured the spirit of this post-9/11 moment with Static, a film in which the camera circles the motionless Lady Liberty pinned to a tiny island not far from Manhattan. Shot from a helicopter, McQueen’s film takes on the perspective of the surveillance technology that became pervasive after the Twin Towers fell, but offers no direct statement on wounded national pride, and thus comes off confounding rather than clarifying. Therein lies its power: It’s a disorienting gesture for a directionless time. —A.G. Jana Euler has strategically deployed ugly images, sometimes in bad taste, as a means of aesthetic assault, and though nearly every one of these efforts is a banger, her most provocative pictures are the ones in her “GWF” series (2019), in which elongated sharks leap out of the ocean. There can be no mistaking the fact that these sharks, with their ribbed gullets and raging heads, look more than a bit like erect phalli. Yet these sharks are hardly seductive: the one shown in GWF 1 flails ungracefully, bearing its teeth and gazing down at the viewer, who seems poised to become the fish’s lunch. Large for a phallus and agile for a shark, Euler’s apex predator is no object of admiration. Instead, it’s simply a dick joke. —A.G. On its face, Daniel Joseph Martinez’s The House America Built seems like a simple, large-scale installation of a small cabin split in two and painted in complementary colors. But what house is this, really? That’s the point of Martinez’s inquiry: the place could belong to just about anyone, even though his reference points are highly specific to American history. The structure is a 1:1 replica of the remote cabin that Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber, built and lived in, and the color palette draws from Martha Stewart’s seasonal collection of interior paints. Kaczynski and Stewart are both Polish Americans, born within a year of each other, and while they took very different paths in life, both were incarcerated in 2004, the year Martinez made the original installation. The piece presents the ends of what Martinez sees as the spectrum of Americanness: Stewart and high capitalism on one, Kaczynski and anarchy and domestic terrorism on the other. —M.D. El Anatsui has made an artistic practice out of stringing together thousands of metal bottle caps to form large, vibrant tapestries, and while he’s repeated the format many times over, it never gets old. Anatsui’s oeuvre reached new heights with this 24-foot-long sheet of caps, which was originally created for the central exhibition in the 2007 Venice Biennale. This work, like his others, cleverly references contemporary overconsumption in material resulting from that consumerism, and is fashioned with gentle folds in a way that recalls traditional Ghanaian craft traditions, like kente cloth. But here, more so than in other works, Anatsui also makes clear that the strung-together caps nod specifically to his own community, whose many members help him make his grandly scaled art. The title, he has said, could be translated from the Ewe to “communal patchwork made by a team of townspeople.” —F.A. Before 3D printing was widely accepted as an artistic medium, Josh Kline embraced it for this unsettling sculpture of a Manhattan hotel housekeeper named Aleyda, whom Kline interviewed and scanned. Featuring to-scale, 3D-printed versions of several of Aleyda’s body parts along with cleaning supplies arrayed on a janitor’s cart, the piece comments on how technology has forever altered the workforce. The plastic cart was purchased and will last, but the body parts and tools of her trade are disposable prototypes about which a question looms: What role will the human hand play in the future of our lives and our art? —A.G. Animators Meriem Bennani and Orian Barki created this series of eight short videos during the first months of the 2020 Covid-19 lockdown in New York City. The videos portray friends, strangers, and the artists themselves as digitally created avatars superimposed on real-life footage. Bennani and Barki star as the titular lizards; friends appear as a snow leopard and a hummingbird, among other creatures; and Dr. Anthony Fauci is depicted as a fanged green snake. Strangely, this approach conveys the weirdness of that time and place more effectively than if the artists had made a straightforward documentary. Moments of panic (the lizards freak out during a nighttime drive through a depopulated Brooklyn) and distress (a hospital-nurse cat recalls helping a wife put through a call to her husband, who is on a ventilator) alternate with scenes of resilience: a Zoom birthday, a stoop meet-up, an impromptu street concert. It is a piercing reminder to anyone who was in the city at that time of just how bizarre things were. —A.D. Pope.L began crawling urban streets in 1978, and though much of his work was made in the 20th century, his influence grew wider after the turn of the millennium. He was overlooked before in part because his public performances were easy to read as regular New York nonsense—and because the art world was not yet ready for his abjection, his pranks, or his Blackness. For this particular Crawl, he shimmied up the entire length of Broadway, going at it in chunks over the course of nine years. And he did so alone, on elbows and knees in a Superman suit. The cartoon-reference humor was strategic: in New York, a Black man on the ground is too likely to be ignored. Pope.L refuted this with a Superman suit that screamed: Look at me. —E.W. To experience this work by Sondra Perry, one must climb onto an upright stationary exercise bicycle, thereby experiencing a degree of discomfort. And discomfort is the point, as Perry’s digitally produced avatar, appearing on the video screen that replaces the bicycle’s control panel, demonstrates when it asks “How does your body feel inside us?” The avatar is an imperfect simulacrum of Perry: Its movements are stuttering, its voice robotic, its body thinner than the artist’s and hairless. This is not Perry’s fault, the avatar tells us, but the fault of the program that created it, which had no preexisting template for Perry’s body type. Over the course of a 9-minute video, the idea of discomfort is expanded to include the question of whether racial uplift must entail making a Black body a neutral body, a process that the avatar likens to working on an exercise machine with its pedals installed backward and no hex key. “We are not as helpful or Caucasian as we sound,” the Perry avatar says. “We have no safe mode.” —A.D. In 2001 Palestinian artist Emily Jacir, who holds an American passport, asked Palestinians unable to enter to Israel, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip, as well as Palestinians in those three places whose movements are restricted, “If I could do anything for you, anywhere in Palestine, what would it be?” For the next six months, she did her best to fulfill their requests, documenting her attempts in text and photos. One man asked her to visit his mother; another asked for a photo of his family (they gave her strawberries and lemons grown on their land to take back to him). A third asked her to pick an orange in Jericho and eat it (this, she was unable to do). About this piece, the late Palestinian-American scholar Edward Said wrote, “[Jacir’s] compositions slip though the nets of bureaucracies and nonnegotiable borders, time and space, in search not of grandiose dreams or clotted fantasies, but rather of humdrum objects and simple gestures like visits, hugs, watering a tree, eating a meal—the kinds of things that maybe all Palestinians will be able to do someday.” —A.D. Many artists this century grappled with how painting for its own sake is seen as a Western construct, with Frieda Toranzo Jaeger’s contribution being among the most articulate. In altarpiece-style works with panels on hinges, she renders her subjects in a manner that appears amateurish; she then hires family members to embroider her surfaces using a traditional Mexican technique. Here, her altarpiece format approximates the shape of a Tesla, a subject Toranzo Jaeger took on after noticing that many fellow Indigenous artists were at work to preserve history in the face of erasure. She wanted to supplement these efforts by ensuring that Indigenous imaginations had a voice in visions of the future, and indeed, her Musk mockery would prove prophetic. In the background of her painting, a mansion standing in for the old world order is on fire; in the foreground, a fast car promises both a getaway and an intimate interior, or a private reprieve. —E.W. When Julia Child’s cooking show aired on TV, her network briefly experimented with open rather than closed captions, meaning they could not be turned on and off. Lazard, a disabled artist, picks up here, remixing an episode of Child’s show but taking its commitment to access one step further. Child already describes her actions, since the show is didactic. But where the captions fail to describe sound (only dialogue) and Child’s monologue neglects the scenery (only directions), Lazard fills in the gaps, looping in D/deaf and blind audiences. All this quickly accumulates into cacophony, which Lazard embraces. The crescendo, narrated by artist Constantina Zavitsanos, is a manifesto overlaying it all. Lazard revealed the limits of treating access as an afterthought; other artists—Zavitsanos among them—followed, making work that Geelia Ronkina dubbed “access materiality.” A movement was born, centered around works taking up captions, ramps, image descriptions, and so on as a medium—all recently chronicled in The Agency of Access, a book by art historian Amanda Cachia. —E.W. For several centuries in the West, history painting was considered the highest form of art-making. Yet its scope was narrow, leaving so much history always overlooked. Artists like Marakatt-Labba revisited the genre in the 21st century, filling gaps by depicting histories that had not yet been told widely. Historjá is a 77-foot-long embroidered epic that translates the tradition into fiber, and ambitiously aims to depict the whole of the Sámi people’s history: their Nordic Indigenous lore, rituals, prosperity, and oppression rendered scene-by-scene via spare tableaux stitched into linen in a manner not unlike the canonical Bayeux tapestry. Refuting any narrative of progress that might posit modernism over Indigeneity, it begins and ends in a forest, whence the Sámi came. —A.G. The 7th Havana Biennial, at which Tania Bruguera’s Untitled (Havana, 2000) debuted, invited artists to explore mass communication in the new millennium. But rather than a great connector, Bruguera framed communication as a tool for exploitation in Cuba. Bruguera’s work comprised fermenting sugarcane piled several inches high in a darkened tunnel in the Cabaña fortress, a military bunker once used to jail prisoners of conscience. At the end of the space was its sole illumination: a small television monitor suspended from the ceiling that played footage of Fidel Castro, who was still in power at the time. Only as they approached the monitor could visitors notice several nude male performers fiercely rubbing their hands together. The piece spoke to all that lay at the limits of vision in Cuba, a country whose repressive leadership has long tried to keep dissent out of sight, out of mind. Untitled (Havana, 2000) didn’t stay on view long—it was shut down by authorities hours after going up—but it was enough to spur on many dissident Cuban artists after Bruguera. —T.S. Cremaster 3 is a strong candidate for the best movie ever about lamb-eating giants, balletically crashing cars, and Richard Serra flinging molten petroleum jelly inside one of our most august sanctuaries for the appreciation and narrativization of art. The longest feature film in a five-part cycle and the last to be released, the 3-hour fantasia plays as a sort of wordless cinematic tone poem filled with considerations of human evolution and reproduction (the “cremaster” muscle controls male testicles, and figures in the sexual differentiation of an embryo) and interconnected allusions to Matthew Barney’s expansive artistic universe. Starkly divergent vignettes vary from mysterious happenings within New York’s iconic Chrysler Building (the site of a surreal staging of six automobiles smashing into one another, over and over again) to an extravagant set piece in the Guggenheim Museum’s famous rotunda that features Busby Berkeley–style dancing, a hardcore-punk battle of the bands, and Barney himself climbing up and down the walls while interacting with a spectral woman who changes form into a cheetah. While it’s far from easy to apprehend, the film proves transfixing in its elusive and hyper-imaginative flights of fancy. —A.B. For an ambitious undergraduate senior thesis, Shvarts artificially inseminated herself each month for nine months—a routine she followed up with an herbal abortifacient. Her work highlighted the uncertainty that accompanies having a body, especially one that can become pregnant, and it drew attention to those womanly experiences that can be traumatic and ordinary at the same time. Each month, she would bleed heavily, not knowing whether the blood signaled a period, a miscarriage, or an early-stage abortion. Shvarts’s interventions lay bare the ways that bodies rub up against ideologies, existing in ways for which we often lack the language or knowledge to express. Or so argued Harvard art historian Carrie Lambert-Beatty in her 2009 October article defending the young artist, who’d been subjected to vitriol, even death threats. —E.W. For a show at Kunsthalle Portikus, located on a small island in Frankfurt, Germany, Raza rerouted the Main River so that it ran right through the museum. He didn’t stop there: inside, he filtered the water through a very fine coffee filter, then boiled it and added some minerals. Suddenly, the hydrologist-approved water was drinkable; guests were offered glasses of it. It was at once a mind-blowing feat and an extremely simple gesture. Beyond that, Diversion was galvanizing for the way it made survival and reconnecting with nature seem well within reach. —E.W. In 2001, a shocking item appeared in eBay’s “Black Americana” category: an object that was labeled “Keith Obadike’s Blackness (Item #117601036).” It came with an opening bid of just $10 and a list of potential benefits and warnings, including one that read: “The Seller does not recommend that this Blackness be used in the process of making or selling ‘serious’ art.” In placing the work for sale on eBay, the Obadikes drew a connection between the history of enslavement, the auction block, and the website’s “Black Americana” category. The listing did not last long: eBay removed it after four days, by which point bidding had risen to $152.50. Yet Blackness for Sale has had a more enduring legacy, serving as an important intervention in the history of net.art, which had until then mostly avoided discussions about race. In doing so, the work prefigured later conversations around Blackness on the internet. —M.D. The practice of quipu-making comes from pre-Columbian Peru, wherein various Andean peoples tied cords and colorful strands into knots to record events, information, and stories. For decades, Cecilia Vicuña has been making sculptural works that bring this age-old format into the present day, often with a feminist undercurrent. This work, one of the biggest pieces in the “Red Thread” series, was made for Documenta 14. Vicuña created 52 red wool strands, or chorros, and suspended them in a circular ring that hangs from the ceiling. The cascade of red fiber recalls the tenuous nature of life itself, bringing to mind flows of blood that result from wounds and menstruation; from certain angles, her wool forms even look like umbilical cords. Vicuña powerfully connects Indigenous modes of communication and feminine wisdom, suggesting that there are forms of knowledge that exist beyond history books and archives. —F.A. For a formative show at Essex Street Gallery in New York (now Maxwell Graham), McArthur gathered 20 ramps, most of which had been improvised to accommodate the artist, a wheelchair user, during her visits to otherwise inaccessible art spaces between 2010 and 2013. The makeshift ramps were made of materials including plywood boards, a cupboard door, and handmade wedges. The show took place more than 20 years after the Americans with Disabilities Act was signed into law, and highlighted both the inaccessible entrances that still punctuated McArthur’s every day and the caring improvisation that ensued. But it was more than an autobiographical show or a complaint about lack of compliance, with McArthur’s most crucial gesture easy to miss: Printed on one wall was the URL for the Wikipedia page McArthur built for Marta Russell, a disabled activist who wrote Beyond Ramps (1998), a book arguing that certain American economic policies are greater threats to the quality of disabled life than impairment itself. McArthur shined a spotlight on how disability is politically constructed, and a whole artistic movement took off in the wake. —E.W. Vertigo Sea seems to take place in the past, present, and future simultaneously, clocks ticking throughout the duration of this arresting three-screen video. Archival oceanic images of whales, seals, and enslaved people recur alongside newer shots of people in 19th-century European garb pondering cloud-covered landscapes. The soundtrack features quotations from the abolitionist Olaudah Equiano and novelist Herman Melville alongside other musings on the ocean, ranging from maritime disasters during the transatlantic slave trade to rising sea levels now and in the future. This haunted 48-minute installation can feel too intense to bear as interwoven historical strands accrete. Akomfrah presents history as an unstable narrative, filled with bits and pieces that get dispersed, reassembled, and reshaped in the wake of so much death and destruction. Conventional senses of time and chronology offer no aid in wading through the roiled waters of history. —A.G. No material is more elemental than earth, which Colombian artist Delcy Morelos enlisted to alternately exhilarating and disquieting effect with El abrazo, an enormous arrangement of dirt (or, more properly, a mix of clay and soil laced with hay and coir) that filled a building in the Chelsea gallery district of New York. Commissioned by the Dia Art Foundation, the work was a sort of counterpoint to Walter De Maria’s New York Earth Room—another Dia installation that is basically the soil-filled floor of a building in Soho on view since 1977. But its purview ventured into more worldly, even cosmological, terrain in the way it channeled Andean, Amazonian, and many other belief systems that have been cultivated through the ages. El abrazo was also a rare artwork that granted permission to touch: as Morelos stated in a brochure, “Let the hands listen, see the smell of the earth with the fingertips, let its taste be savored by the skin.” And then, at the end: “To touch the earth is to be touched by her.” —A.B. During the late 2000s, beer gardens became a familiar motif in works by Nicole Eisenman, who sought to vividly evoke contemporary society; this one is her most poignant. Overtly modeled on Renoir’s Bal du moulin de la Galette, the painting updates that famous tableau for modern times. Eisenman masterfully throws art history into a blender, evoking Impressionism, Expressionism (channeling Munch in particular), and contemporary cartoons all at once. The forlorn tank-topped figure in the foreground, fiddling with his BlackBerry while gazing vacantly at the viewer, is a subtle reminder of the backdrop of this gathering: a global recession. Thus, the painting recognizably belongs to a specific time and place, and fulfills Eisenman’s goal of creating art that belongs distinctly to the present. —S.D. Airport blueprints from around the world form the basis of this 20-foot-wide abstract painting. The emphasis on travel appears biographical: Julie Mehretu and her family fled political instability in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and wound up in East Lansing, Michigan, and the artist is now based in New York. But, ultimately, almost everyone is migratory now, and the painting is an apt reflection of our time. The painting is engrossing up close—its intricate marks draw the eye in—but from afar, the work appears even more resonant. Its dramatic scale mimics the sheer vastness of our world, which seemed to grow ever wider as the economy became more global during the 2000s. —F.A. At the start of this video, nearly all the foul-mouthed, catty protagonists seem to be named Jenny. By the end, they take on other aliases. The fka-Jennys film each other, partake in dance-offs, lob insults, and drunkenly run through chroma-key green halls. Along the way, these characters paint their faces in tones ranging from pewter to green, don wigs, sport fake facial hair, and apply garish makeup. Like all Ryan Trecartin’s videos, Center Jenny epitomizes the frenetic pace and glut of options the internet enabled, emblematizing how people began to adopt personas as they broadcast themselves to the world. No surprise that most TikToks now look a lot like this video, with its chatterbox youths, cacophonous soundtrack, and twitchy editing style. —A.G. The water crisis in the majority-Black Michigan city Flint began in 2014 and remains ongoing. That year, the water source for locals was switched from Lake Huron to the Flint River, whose contaminated flow was soon consumed as drinking water. The community was forever altered by resulting illnesses and death. To offer visual evidence of all the destruction, photographer LaToya Ruby Frazier documented the lives of those impacted by the crisis. The resulting photographs were not only touching and deeply personal but also doubled as a means of exposing environmental injustice. Initially released as a photobook, this series showed that documentary photography need not be either objective or impersonal, plotting a fresh path for this 20th-century genre in a new era. —F.A. For her breakout show at the Kitchen in New York, Yi swabbed DNA from 100 women in the art world and mixed all the samples together. Working with synthetic biologist Tal Danino, Yi installed the bacteria in a glass vitrine, where it bloomed to spell out the titular phrase. The show ushered in a whole new generation of bio art, work that involves using living material as a medium. But unlike the bio art of yore, exemplified by Eduardo Kac’s glowing green bunny, this new wave drew less from synthetic biology and resisted dominating nature. Rather, the bio art Yi heralded reveals and reveres the dense networks of organisms that we depend on to survive. You Can Call Me F melds this idea with a feminist critique of the lone genius, highlighting the support network behind the artist. —E.W. Eight hands draw crooked lines that connect disparate countries. Eight disaffected voices narrate tumultuous journeys—across seas, through cities, into and out of refugee camps. Eight hanging screens feature unbroken takes of hands running markers across maps. Such are the elements of Bouchra Khalili’s Mapping Journey Project, a video installation that concisely highlights the geographic (and bureaucratic) barriers faced by people who left their homelands for new lives in Europe. Khalili captures the difficulties of these voyages, as well as the long-term impact of the pain experienced along the way, playing recorded testimonials from migrants in European cities. Khalili asked all her interviewees to draw using permanent markers, their lines lingering forever on the artist’s maps, like scars running under vast oceans and across mountain ranges. —A.G. What happens when music becomes a weapon of war? This video offers one answer. Here, Tony Cokes draws on the accounts of Iraqi and Afghan civilians who endured a form of torture that involved playing American tunes at a deafening volume. Chart-topping hits from the likes of Eminem and Britney Spears, Metallica and Bruce Springsteen roared as text excerpts from “Disco Inferno,” Moustafa Bayoumi’s 2005 article from the Nation flashed by, slideshow-style. “Disco isn’t dead,” the video informs us at one point. “It has gone to war.” Cokes shows that mainstream music—heard daily on the radio, where it seems so innocuous—can be used as a weapon, a form of psychological manipulation, and a means of American imperialism all in one. —F.A. The task of choosing one Deana Lawson work was excruciating. Unlike most photographers, whose sensibilities are best portrayed through whole projects rather than single images, nearly every Lawson photo holds its own, triumphant in scale and offering lots to look at. Here, as in most of her portraits of Black people in domestic interiors, you are left to wonder what of it is staged. Lace curtains sag awkwardly and seem candid, yet our subject is dressed up in a satin gown with a hole in the front, where her pregnant bare belly protrudes. The outfit is clearly a choice—hardly what one expects in a photo of a person at home—yet its significance is elusive. As ever, Lawson might get you to believe at first that you are seeing an intimate scene. But incongruous details—wearing heels in bed, posters hung upside down—make it clear the setup is contrived, reminding just how little you can know of a person from a picture. —E.W. Maria Eichhorn lent the phrase “paid time off” new meaning with this piece, for which she shuttered London’s Chisenhale Gallery for the time span noted in the work’s title. Employees were directed not to answer phones, not to reply to most of their emails, and not to report to work at all. Instead, Chisenhale’s staff was given five weeks of free time with pay. Meanwhile, the gallery remained shuttered to the public; all there was to see was a sign with a short text that explained the staff was “not working.” The piece was a salient reminder that any artwork exhibited is indebted to the labor of others. —A.G. Rare are the gestures profoundly poetic and political at once, affecting and effecting without compromising one for the other. Mirror Shield Project is among the finest such examples. Luger, a member of the Three Affiliated Tribes of Fort Berthold, was born on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, whose name made headlines during the 2016 #NoDAPL movement protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline, which was scheduled to run through sacred land and disrupt water supply. Inspired by civil unrest that unfolded in Ukraine, Luger made a video showing masses how to construct DIY mirrored shields from simple materials. Protesters arrived in droves, holding the mirror shields up against officials in riot gear, building a barrier while inviting those on the other side to reflect. —E.W. The Atlas Group is credited with numerous artworks concerning the 1975–90 Lebanese Civil Wars. Often, these are detailed and painstakingly comprehensive research-based works: a journal tracking every car bomb detonated during the conflict, photographs of bullet-hole-pocked buildings overlaid with color-coded dots that correspond to different types of ammunition, clues to who fired the shots. The Atlas Group, though, was mostly the work of a single artist: a carefully crafted persona named so that you might trust its authority; the Group is an artwork unto itself. You might wonder how an artist could gather data this definitive or, perhaps, how anyone could. It takes only a mildly studious eye to catch the farce: the date of the group’s origin varies in different shows. The Atlas Group parodied the absurdism in claims to comprehension, and pointed to how facts and data can be hardest to procure when they are most urgent, most politicized. This may seem more obvious today than when the project began, but it isn’t any less essential. —E.W. Over the past 35 years, Andrea Fraser has critiqued the systems and structures of the art world, offering biting commentary on its pretensions and class distinctions largely through venturesome video performances. In Museum Highlights: A Gallery Talk (1989), she passed herself off as a docent at the Philadelphia Museum, flummoxing visitors with an unhinged commentary on the institution and its history as well as social and political issues. More notoriously, in Untitled (2003), she videotaped herself having sex with the anonymous art collector to whom she presold the piece, literalizing the blurred lines between personal and financial relationships in the art business. In this video from 2001, Fraser takes on the Guggenheim Bilbao and its audio guide extolling the glories of the Frank Gehry–designed museum building. Fraser pantomimes exaggerated responses to the guide’s litany of wonders, until, prompted to stroke one of the museum’s pillars, she lifts her skirt and ecstatically rubs herself against it. “Critique,” Fraser told ARTnews in 2016, “at its best is a verb.” —A.D. Simone Leigh won the Golden Lion at the Venice Biennale in 2022 for this sculpture, a 16-foot-tall, 5,900-pound bronze bust. The work originally presided over the High Line in New York City; it is part of a larger series by Leigh in which female forms fuse with historical and contemporary signifiers of Africa and the African diaspora. Here, cowrie shells, a reference to a material used widely in African art, adorn the figure’s cornrows; its skirt honors the architectural traditions of Benin, Togo, Chad, and Cameroon, among others. Few of these references were made plain to viewers, however—if they knew, they knew, and if they weren’t curious, they wouldn’t learn. Brick House evinced a kind of withholding that was widely seen in art of the past decade, rarely with such grace as in Leigh’s sculpture. —T.S. Technically, this piece had a mouthful for a full title: “the Marvelous Sugar Baby an Homage to the unpaid and overworked Artisans who have refined our Sweet tastes from the cane fields to the Kitchens of the New World on the Occasion of the demolition of the Domino Sugar Refining Plant.” Certainly, with this sculpture, Kara Walker gave those artisans their due. It was with this piece that Walker, who had become known for her work in silhouetted paper cutouts that told harrowing stories of enslavement, made a radical shift in scale to the monumental. Drawing on the history of labor in sugar processing, and leaning heavily into the metaphor of its refinement (bleaching from brown to white), Walker created an object that may have tasted sweet but smelled acrid and looked formidable, almost menacing. A sphinx sculpture made from 160,000 pounds of sugar, it was a great artwork—and a controversial one too, many claiming that its highly sexualized representation of a Black woman worked to no end. Like it or not, however, it was a statement of intent from an artist who was just 44 at the time. Walker went on to make other enormous pieces, including a fountain shown at the Turbine Hall at Tate Modern, and remains a force to be reckoned with. —S.D. It was one of those experiences that was so cool you couldn’t believe you got to be part of it. Ace Gallery had a cavernous space in downtown Manhattan, and for this work, it was kept pitch-dark. You were given a little blue penlight and permission to navigate. Here and there, you’d see other blue pinpricks of light—other humans!—but the light was not quite enough to fully illuminate them. There were almost no other objects in the space. By the time he made this piece, David Hammons was already a master of audience participation or, put another way, audience provocation, Exhibit A being a 1983 piece in which he sold snowballs on the sidewalk in New York’s East Village. This work, though, was stranger and more subtle, made during a time—just after 9/11, just after anthrax in the mail—when, in New York, it felt as if we were all fumbling in the dark, wondering what would next happen, what kind of world we lived in, even who among us was safe and who might pose us harm. This Century artwork list was being compiled long before Hauser & Wirth decided to re-create Hammons’s Concerto in Black and Blue at its LA gallery during Frieze Los Angeles this past February; the gallery did well to do so. —S.D. For the 2003 Istanbul Biennial, Doris Salcedo piled 1,550 wooden chairs in a gap between two buildings in the city’s center. Rising almost three stories, the chairs pressed right up against the edge of the sidewalk. The work built upon one made the year prior, in which Salcedo lowered dozens of chairs from the roof of Bogotá’s Palace of Justice to commemorate a siege there. In Istanbul, the historical reference point was more ambiguous, hinting at the city’s history of migration and displacement while also speaking to a desire to “represent war in general” and create a “topography of war,” as Salcedo once said. The totality of this work, in both its location and size, made it hard to miss, a reminder that these histories and the people they affect can be overwhelming when made manifest. —M.D. Sometimes, masterpieces create monsters. So it was for Harun Farocki, whose style of essay film many have emulated, few successfully. The late German filmmaker was deft at exposing the industry of images, and at revealing various systems of power often hidden in plain sight. Eye/Machine I is the first video in a trilogy, and it highlights footage that is more data than aesthetic, with blurry clips of airports unintelligible to the untrained eye. It opens with found footage—aerial surveillance collected by the US in 1991, during the war on Iraq—and features an unseen narrator calling such pictures “devoid of social intent.” Yet Farocki masters the art of show, don’t tell, with Eye/Machine’s narrator intervening strategically, decrypting only the images that are illegible to the human eye. As for the rest, he lets you see for yourself. —E.W. With this piece staged for the Mexican Pavilion at the Venice Biennale, Teresa Margolles transformed the grisly residue of death into art. Known for addressing violence fueled by Mexico’s narcotics trade, Margolles here used materials like bloodstained cloths and shattered glass to expose the human cost of systemic inequities. The piece included fabric soaked in blood from murder sites, along with an accompanying performance that impressively—and grotesquely—involved a man mopping the floor with fluid from the dead acquired from morgues in Mexico. For even greater effect, Margolles distributed cards that doubled as cocaine cutters, suggesting that global consumer culture itself was complicit in sustaining the very carnage she highlighted. It was all unsettling and deeply uncomfortable because it offered material proof of violence that is sometimes tough to see. —D.C. I probably watched Grosse Fatigue in its entirety three times during the 2013 Venice Biennale (curated by Massimiliano Gioni), and with every viewing, new elements of the piece came to the fore. Against a techno/jazz beat by Joakim Bouaziz, artist Akwetey Orraca-Tetteh recites a poem written by Henrot and poet Jacob Bromberg that begins with the first words of the Bible: “In the beginning…” We start on a computer home screen, from which blossoms a mesmerizing bouquet of images. It is impossible to catalog them: snippets of old master paintings, a copy of The Origin of Species next to a Charles Darwin bobblehead, a fish head, a sculpture of an ancient god. (Much of the imagery came from objects Henrot encountered during a residency at the Smithsonian Institution.) What is most striking about the piece is the way it seems to echo the process each of us goes through every day in our digital age in our attempts to make sense of an image-saturated world, to create some kind of narrative out of chaos. In an art world that was going increasingly online (remember all those articles about art on Instagram?), Henrot’s work struck just the right chord. It still does. —S.D. Time flies when you’re having fun watching time—or so it seems when in the thrall of The Clock, a 24-hour assemblage of found footage starring timepieces of different kinds from the past century of film and TV. Drawing on his legacy as a maestro of remix culture (both musical and other), Christian Marclay spent three years combing the annals of moving-image history for brief clips he sequenced together. The result is a cinematic collage made up of appropriated scenes of actors glancing at their watches or waiting for seconds and minutes to tick down on clocks, alarms, and more. Each scene corresponds with the progression of a full day, so that the times in the clips sync up with the points at which they appear in Marclay’s work. While The Clock is an organizational and technical marvel (how did he find the thousands of clips, and how did he piece them all together?), the experience of watching the work as a movie of its own is just as awe-inspiring as the process. Taking stock of time manages to capture the essence of suspense and turn it inside out, leaving a viewer to wonder what it is about viewing that can leave us so rapt. —A.B. This sculpture appears innocuous, as though merely a simple metal corner desk. But a text provided by the artist reveals that it was produced by inmates at the Attica Correctional Facility in New York, who at the time were given hourly rates between $0.16 and $1.25. Rowland was working within the tradition of the readymade sculpture, but unlike Marcel Duchamp and his ilk, the artist was questioning more than artistic authorship, showing instead that everyday objects such as desks could unfurl knotty, horrifying histories of systemic exploitation. When the work was initially exhibited at New York’s Artists Space, it was no coincidence that the desk might have been mistaken for a staffer’s workstation. It was a reminder that objects produced through systems of underpaid, even forced, labor are just about everywhere. —A.G. With a series of essays and videos produced during the early 2010s, Hito Steyerl became the greatest observer of the state of total visibility brought on by the internet and rampant surveillance. Is it possible not to be seen today? Steyerl’s 2013 magnum opus asked that question, then offered a few tips, some practical, others absurdist—like “being female and over 50.” The video demystifies optical engineering by the US Air Force, green-screen technology, and more, all in 15 minutes, so as to suggest that in the age of image overload, none of us will escape becoming pixels to be played with. Her attempts to escape feel comically futile: in one memorable sequence, she smears her face with green paint, revealing color charts that were added in post-production. She goes invisible, becoming a part of the digital ether. —A.G. Completed the year before Kerry James Marshall’s midcareer retrospective at the Met, which went on to acquire this work, Untitled (Studio) exemplifies the noun referenced in the intentionally misspelled title of that show, “Mastry.” There is mastery in the whole, and in all its glorious parts: the crisply modeled dog, the bouquet out of an old master painting, the drapery, the paintbrushes, that Tiepolo sky glimpsed through a window, the uncompleted canvas on an easel, passages of which, viewed up close, can read as pure abstraction. And that is to say nothing of its subject. Here, Marshall took on a scene that to date had mainly been the province of white artists: the studio. He stepped into the pantheon of Matisse, Courbet, and their ilk, inserting and asserting the Black artist as a protagonist in art history. It’s the kind of painting that makes you say to yourself: OK, now he’s just showing off! Shouldn’t he be allowed to do just that? —S.D. Adrian Piper’s conceptual art of the 20th century may have made a bigger mark on art history, but this video is significant for the way it throws all that work into sharp relief. The artist is known for pointed work that tackles serious subjects, from racial inequity to transcendental philosophy. But her sensibility was often playful and irreverent, even when her work was sharp and intense, and this video makes that much obvious. It shows Piper dancing improvisationally in Berlin’s Alexanderplatz, the center of the city she has called home since fleeing the US in 2006. Piper dances for an hour, and she dances quite well, accompanied by 2000s Berlin house music. This is an artist who sees the world’s evils as clearly as she does its joys. —E.W. A scorching sun; Notorious B.I.G. rapping; Martin Luther King Jr. riding in a car; police committing violence; protests raging for civil rights and Black Lives Matter; Barack Obama grieving the victims of the Charleston church shooting; Mahalia Jackson performing. These are among the memorable clips packed into this video, which aspires to distill the rich range of Black experience in the US into just seven minutes. Working from his extensive archive of other peoples’ pictures, Arthur Jafa offered a full gamut of experiences from death to celebration, at a time when footage of Black Americans dying violent deaths at the hands of police proliferated in the media. Set to Kanye West’s “Ultralight Beam,” Jafa’s video is a sublime artwork that teeters between abject horror and bona fide beauty. Its final image is tough to shake: a clip of James Brown performing his ecstatic music until he collapses. —A.G. Get our latest stories in the feed of your favorite networks We want to hear from you!

If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Participation at the NFL Scouting Combine has dwindled in recent years. None of my top five prospects -- Cam Ward, Abdul Carter, Travis Hunter, Mason Graham, and Jalon Walker -- tested in Indianapolis. That being said, it is still a great proving ground for unheralded players in the middle rounds of the NFL Draft. It's also a good check to make evaluators go back to the tape to see what they missed in both positive and negative ways. One position that showed out in a big way were the running backs. Even taking positional value into account, six running backs made my top 100 -- the most I've had in any year since 2018. Fourteen different backs ran sub-4.50-second 40-yard dash times at Lucas Oil Stadium -- and that's without everyone's RB1, Ashton Jeanty, even testing! Expect a ton of starters to emerge from this year's crop. After reviewing the tape on combine standouts like Texas wide receiver Matthew Golden and Texas A&M defensive end Shemar Stewart, here's how my top-100 board shakes out after a week of testing in Indy. Note: Positional value is taken into account when assembling my draft board. Cam Ward oozes the kind of confidence you want from a franchise quarterback prospect. He also has top-tier arm talent with a career trajectory firmly pointed towards the ceiling. He may not be the same caliber of prospect we saw at the top of last year's class, but he's no less talented. Abdul Carter has only been a full-time edge rusher for one season. Over the course of that season, he quite dominantly established himself as the top pass-rusher in the country. He has All-Pro-caliber tools. The most dynamic athlete in the draft class has the highest grade at both wide receiver and cornerback for me in the draft class. Travis Hunter is a truly special prospect who can legitimately still play some of both positions in the NFL. Mason Graham may not be the most physically imposing defensive tackle, but he's just darn good. He's uber-consistent and plays with a motor that won't quit. There's very little to dislike. Explosiveness, ferocity and an innate feel for rushing the passer -- Jalon Walker has a jam-packed toolbox. His size will be his biggest knock, but there's numerous defenders rushing the passer at a high-level with similar frames. Kelvin Banks Jr. is a three-year starter who showed signs of growth every single fall. He was battle-tested this past season iin the SEC and passed every single one. He's an easy people mover in the run game and has a tremendous anchor for a true junior. Tetairoa McMillan is a unique receiver prospect who's every bit of 6-feet-5. He's gone for 3,414 yards and 26 scores in three seasons for the Wildcats. His ability to make plays outside his frame is the best in the draft class. Colston Loveland is a young, natural receiving tight end. While not much of an inline blocker, he has room to grow at only 20 years old currently. He's a terror when climbing past the linebacker level of the defense. Armand Membou has been a right tackle for Missouri, but with his stout body type, I believe he can be an All-Pro guard. His ability to gain natural leverage is outstanding and he's one of the best in the class at finding linebackers in space. Will Campbell is a three-year starter at left tackle and arguably the most technically advanced lineman in the draft class. Some may see him as a guard, but I see no reason not to start him at tackle. Will Johnson came into this season as the top-ranked player on my board and only fell due to a turf-toe injury that limited him to only 279 snaps. He's a big, physical press corner who's held his own against some of college football's best the past couple of seasons. Walter Nolen is explosive, flexible and only scratching the surface of his potential. He's a plug-and-play run defender who can get in opposing backfields with ease. What I love most about projecting his game to boost him into my top 10 is his ability to finish plays in space for a defensive tackle. Mykel Williams is one of the biggest enigma's in the draft class. He played out of position much of the season as a between-the-tackles player when he'll be an edge rusher in the NFL. The twitch he possesses combined with extraordinary length and play strength should be a nightmare for opposing offensive tackles. Malaki Starks is the kind of versatile safety who's worthy of a top-10 pick. He may not be a high-end playmaker, but he's the kind of Swiss Army Knife who can fill any role in the secondary. Tyler Warren is Jason Witten for a new generation. It's a pleasure to watch him work in- and out-breakers like clockwork. He also has excellent size to be an inline option. Few have raised their stocks as much as Derrick Harmon this past fall. There's really not much to dislike about his tape. He's got the kind of versatile body type to play any technique on the interior while still being effective against both run and pass. Mike Green flashed in a part-time role a year ago before breaking out and leading college football with 17 sacks this past fall. He's outstanding at shedding blocks for an undersized outside linebacker and developed a ton physically over his career. I take positional value into account for my board, which means Ashton Jeanty takes a hit. If all positions were created equal, he could easily be the top prospect in this class. There's very few holes in his game. Jihaad Campbell is the kind of jumbo off-ball linebacker who can rush the passer like a defensive end that are the wave in the NFL. He did a little bit of everything for Alabama's defense in a breakout campaign this past fall. Luther Burden III a YAC-monster who can create easy separation out of his breaks. He's also got some extremely reliable hands with a drop rate under 5% in each of the past two seasons. Nick Emmanwori might have the best range of any safety in this class while simultaneously being the biggest safety in the class. That's a unique combination that will translate to the next level. Jahdae Barron was mostly a slot corner until this past fall where he became a star on the outside. Barron brought that physical slot mentality to the outside and it paid off. He intercepted five passes, which exceeded his entire career prior. Emeka Egbuka is an incredibly high-floor wide receiver. He ticks a ton of boxes for the position and already has NFL-veteran level chops as a route-runner. The biggest athletic marvel in the draft class, Shemar Stewart is the closest thing to Myles Garrett physically since Garrett came out in 2017. NFL evaluators will have to figure out why his collegiate production paled in comparison to Garrett's and every other top edge rusher in the class, though. Edge is a position where you still bet on traits, even if the production hasn't caught up yet. Matthew Golden is a graceful route-runner who you can trust to run the full tree. Golden is versatile and ascending as a true junior coming out. Kenneth Grant is a physical freak who holds over 330 pounds with ease. While you might think that makes him a nose tackle, his first step plays anywhere along the defensive line. Tyler Booker is a brick wall in pass protection. When defensive tackles try to overpower him, they end up going nowhere. While he's not the most fleet of foot, Booker is always on balance and able to mirror quicks on the interior. Josh Simmons was firmly on track to be a top-15 pick before he went down with a patellar tendon tear in his knee in Ohio State's midseason game against Oregon. He's a smooth pass protector who rarely gets out over his skis. I'll lean on Nic Scourton's scintillating sophomore tape in his evaluation when he was primarily a stand-up edge rusher at Purdue. One might think at 285 pounds that Scourton would be better over tackles as a 4-3 or 3-4 defensive end, but it was when he had a head of steam that Scourton was at his best. One of the youngest prospects in the class, Scourton has so much room for development. I'm going out on a limb before the Senior Bowl considering we haven't seen David Walker face any semblance of NFL-quality tackle play. His dominance at the FCS level, however, was unlike anything I've seen in my decade of doing this. Walker is a Brandon Graham-esque edge rusher with a bowling ball frame and explosive first step that give opposing tackles nightmares. Benjamin Morrison has some of the best man-mirror tape of any corner in the class. Unfortunately, he also is coming off a season-ending hip injury that could scare some away. I'm still betting on the talent who picked off six passes as an 18-year-old freshman in 2022. Jared Ivey is a jumbo defensive end who was a big-time riser this season. He's gifted with his hand usage and knows how to win with his length. While Ivey isn't a first-round-caliber athlete, he's got other traits to make up for it. James Pearce Jr. may very well be the most athletic defensive lineman in this draft class. His movement skills could pass for that of a wide receiver. The problem is that so could his frame. If he can beef up, he'll be a problem in the league. Grey Zabel rides the back of an outstanding Senior Bowl performance all the way to this ranking. His natural coordination shined as he looked like a veteran at all three interior positions after only having played left tackle last fall. Shavon Revel Jr. is a massive corner who's incredibly fluid for a man his size. He's also outstanding at locating the football in the air. The only worry is an ACL tear he suffered in practice early on in the 2024 campaign. Josh Conerly Jr. is still more traits than polish, but the latter is catching up quickly. He may be the twitchiest offensive lineman in the entire class, and you see that in his ability to eliminate space on edge rushers. Donovan Jackson made himself as much money as anyone with his play over the course of the College Football Playoff. After two seasons starting at left guard, Jackson took over at left tackle midway through this past season. In Ohio State's four playoff games, Jackson allowed all of two pressures against some of college football's best defensive lines. One of the most explosive receivers in the draft class, Kyle Williams has an easy accelerator on tape. More importantly, he also possesses an easy brake pedal as he can send defenders flying past with his suddenness. Azareye'h Thomas is another 20-year-old who's already started for more than two seasons. This past season opposing offenses didn't even challenge him most games as the 6-2 corner smothers opposing receivers. Donovan Ezeiruaku is the most technically advanced edge rusher in the class. He has a myriad of moves at his disposal and racked up double-digit sacks this past fall because of it. His athletic testing will be big because on tape he rarely impressed in that regard. Shedeur Sanders has the numbers and the experience, but his arm strength and frame leave a little to be desired. I expect him to go higher than this ranking, but such is the nature of need at the quarterback position. Dillon Gabriel has played more football than any other quarterback in college football history. 63 starts all together. And unlike many quarterbacks in this class, Gabriel was already playing high-level football as a true freshman when he averaged over 9.0 yards per attempt for UCF. His size won't be for everyone, but his accuracy and ability to handle an NFL offense should be. Dylan Sampson has elite ability to consistently find the right crease. And when he does, the undersized running back hits it at full speed. Sampson consistently overcame poor run blocking to produce in the SEC. Trey Amos has been stingy for a while now. In each of his four seasons prior to transferring to Ole Miss, Amos allowed a sub-50 completion percentage. Most of those came at Louisiana Lafayette, however. It wasn't until he balled out for a full season as a starter in the SEC that NFL evaluators started to buy in. He had double-digit pass breakups this past fall for the Rebels. Charles Grant is arguably the most athletic tackle in the class. While he may not be NFL-ready given his level of competition, give him a couple years of seasoning and you could have a perennial Pro Bowler with his tools. CJ West is a stout and imposing nose tackle. He may only be 6-1, but at 316 pounds no one wants to get in a trench brawl with him. West was the tone-setter for the second-best run defense in the country last season. Kevin Winston Jr. missed most of this season with a partial ACL tear, but still declared for the NFL Draft early as a junior. That's because his sophomore tape showed an enforcer on the back end who only added explosiveness and strength early on in 2024. He's an outstanding tackler who's not afraid to stick his nose in it. Maxwell Hairston has real-deal wheels. His 4.28 speed shows on tape when tracking down deep balls or breaking on routes underneath. While he was banged-up this past fall, Hairston's sophomore tape when he had five picks was outstanding. Jayden Higgins is one of the few "X" receivers in the class with the kind of size and burst to win on the outside consistently. Higgins has racked up more than 2,000 yards as Iowa State's top passing option the past two seasons. Jaxson Dart is an ascending quarterback prospect with a ton of ball under his belt. He's been starting ever since midway through his freshman year at USC in 2021. After getting usurped by Caleb Williams, Dart transferred to Ole Miss and improved by leaps and bounds every single season en route to 4,276 passing yards this past fall. Wyatt Milum takes the fight to every defender in his path. If he gets his hands on you it can get ugly. While he plays left tackle for the Mountaineers, Milum projects to guard at the next level. Darius Alexander is a versatile defensive tackle who's shown the ability to line up anywhere along the defensive line of scrimmage. He's got a good get-off that he pairs with active hands to find opposing quarterbacks. Elic Ayomanor is a big-bodied wide receiver who has some sneaky speed to his game. His ability to fight through contact along his routes is tremendous and will suit him well translating to the NFL. Ayomanor was Stanford's No. 1 option in both his seasons, but the quarterback situation cost him better numbers. Alfred Collins is put together how you want a stout interior run defender. He's got a massive, long frame that can keep opposing linemen at bay. Collins took over right where T'Vondre Sweat left off at Texas. Carson Schwesinger plays the linebacker with an uncoachable ferocity you can't help but root for. The former walk-on turned himself into a tackling machine in his first season as a starter last fall, leading the Big Ten with 136 total tackles. Tyleik Williams looks like a sure thing in the run game with a solidly-built frame and heavy hands. The big question is whether he can rush the passer, as he never quite progressed from the player we saw early in his career at Ohio State. What Aeneas Peebles lacks in size, he makes up for in motor. He's the kind of defensive tackle I love to root for because he'll never give up on a rep. NFL defenses are getting more adept at taking advantage of interior defenders with first steps like Peebles. Terrance Ferguson is a loose route-runner who can shake linebackers and safeties at the top of his routes. He was also the best testing athlete at the position at the NFL combine. That's a good combination to develop at tight end. Aireontae Ersery is a smooth and effective offensive tackle prospect. In a class full of guard converts, Ersery is a tackle all day. He never allowed more than 15 pressures in a year in his three seasons as a starter. Harold Fannin Jr. was college football's leading receiver last year ... as a tight end. His 1,555 yards is unheard of production at the tight end position, as it smashed the previous record. He's obviously undersized for the position at 6-3 and 241 pounds, but his ability to get open isn't in question. Darien Porter is one of the weirdest prospects in the draft class. He's a sixth-year player, but only spent the last three on defense after switching from wide receiver -- and he still wasn't a full-time starter this past fall. When he was out there, though, Porter was one of the most impressive specimen in the entire country. He's got elite downfield speed and at 6-4 is still somehow fluid enough to stick with smaller wide receivers. Danny Stutsman is a three-down middle linebacker with great range to make plays around the line of scrimmage. He racked up more than 100 tackles in each of the past three seasons for the Sooners. While others from the conference will surely get drafted ahead of Bradyn Swinson come draft day, no one in the SEC was more productive as a pass-rusher this past fall. His 60 pressures led the conference as he routinely won the edge. Jalen Royals is an incredibly crafty wide receiver who was en route to a massive season before injury struck. He had 839 yards in only seven games this season for the Aggies. He may not be tall, but he's well put together to play a physical brand of football. Omarion Hampton is a hard-nosed, between-the-tackles runner who will maximize every opportunity he gets. You will not see him ever shy away from contact as he not only has power, but also an explosive element to his game. Jamaree Caldwell is very nimble for a big fella; he can play around blocks as well as through. He's one of the few nose tackles in the class who you're not necessarily taking off the field on passing downs. Demetrius Knight Jr. is a former quarterback turned linebacker, although you'd never guess by the way he plays. That's because he's one of the biggest hitters in the linebacker class with easy speed to track down ball-carriers sideline-to-sideline. Jacob Parrish may be short, but he's not small and he's definitely not unathletic. Parrish closes to the football in the air with a relentlessness that's a joy to watch. His tape was good enough for him to declare early after two years as a starter. Elijah Arroyo may very well be the most athletic tight end in the class. He had a monster breakout campaign with more yards in Week 1 (89) than his previous two seasons combined. He finished with 590 yards on the year while averaging a healthy 16.9 yards per catch. Deone Walker is a unique specimen. He's one of the tallest defensive tackles I've ever seen at over 6-7 and 344 pounds. At that size, he's incredibly nimble. He just can't hold up to double teams or play as many snaps as Kentucky asked him to. Still only 20 years old, Walker has time to figure it out. Jaylin Noel is an explosive slot receiver who can take the top off the defense with ease. He went for 1,193 yards this past fall and blazed a 4.39-second 40-yard dash at the NFL combine. Tyler Shough is a unique quarterback prospect who'll be 26 years old before he takes a snap in the NFL. He would have been in the NFL already had it not been for three straight seasons getting derailed by injury. Once he was fully healthy this past fall at Louisville, he showed outstanding arm talent and an ability to operate under pressure that few in the draft class can match. Tez Johnson is the smallest player in the draft class at 154 pounds, but watch him run routes and his weight concerns slowly start to drift away. He runs away from everyone and nearly impossible to get hands on in space. Vernon Broughton waited patiently behind numerous NFL defensive tackles at Texas before finally getting his turn this past fall. It was worth the wait as the fifth-year defensive tackle racked up 32 pressures and 22 run stops. Xavier Watts is one of the most instinctive safeties in the draft class with a nose for the football. Over the past two seasons he's racked up 13 interceptions. Joshua Farmer definitely looks the part of an NFL defensive tackle. He's got one of the best frames in the draft class with a 6-10 wingspan, 10.5-inch hands and 35 ¼ inch arms at 314 pounds. He may not be much as a pass-rusher, but his power plays in the run game. Jordan Burch is an ascending edge prospect who's one of the most explosive athletes in the class. At 279 pounds, Burch ran a 4.67-second 40-yard dash. For context, Aaron Donald ran a 4.68 at only six pounds heavier. That's good company and it shows when bull-rushes opposing tackles. Tre Harris may not have great long speed, but he wins with his burst at the top of routes. He's got a lanky frame that he uses to pluck balls out of the air with ease. He was the most productive receiver in college football last fall when healthy averaging 5.12 yards per route. Jonah Savaiinaea is a three-year starter with experience at right guard, right tackle and left tackle. While his arm length and testing numbers say he could be a tackle, one look at Savaiinaea's frame and it's hard to think he won't end up at guard in the NFL. While he's light on his feet for a bigger lineman, Savaiinaea's hands need work in staying attached to blocks. Tyler Baron has been seeing significant time ever since his true freshman season at Tennessee in 2020, but never quite made a big leap as a pass-rusher. He has the tools to do so in the NFL, though, as he can really bend for a bigger defensive end. Nick Martin is one of the most athletic linebackers in the draft class. Even though he's undersized, no one seems to have told him. Martin plays like an alpha and hits like a brick. Andrew Mukuba was yet another breakout star in Texas' secondary this season. He's one of the twitchiest safeties in the class with an easy ability to mirror from an off alignment. Elijah Roberts is a powerful defensive end who's racked up pressures for the Mustangs the past two seasons. Over that span his 131 pressures are the most in the draft class. Jack Sawyer has been extremely productive in his time at Ohio State, but he comes with serious limitations when projecting to the NFL. Not only is he a middling athlete by NFL standards, he also has very short arms for a defensive end (31 ¾ inches). TJ Sanders is a trim 3-technique defensive tackle who can get off the line of scrimmage and into backfield. While he needs to fill out his frame, Sanders presents pass-rushing upside. Quandarrius Robinson is one of the most athletic edges in the class. He also has a great frame for the edge position with 33.5-inch arms at 6-4 and 243 pounds. He may profile to a pass-rush only player at the next level, but he's got the goods in that regard. Cameron Williams looks like a future starter, but on tape it's clear he needs more reps. The junior had only one season of starting under his belt when he declared and struggled against top competition. Josiah Stewart is an undersized butt-kicker who attacks play after play. At 6-foot-1 and 249 pounds, he won't be everyone's cup of tea, but when you watch him knock back tackles on contact consistently, you see a path to success for him in the NFL. Jack Bech is one of the best possession receivers in the draft class. With great hands and good size, he can be counted on to move the chains. He did so a lot for the Horned Frogs this past fall as he racked up his first 1,000-yard season. Clay Webb started off his career at Georgia before transferring to Jackvsonville State and dominating the past few years. In three seasons he allowed all of 13 pressures. Cam Skattebo is arguably the hardest runner in the draft class. He refuses to go down on first contact and has the kind of light feet to avoid defenders in the hole. Skattebo may not have home run speed, but he'll rake in short yardage. There hasn't been a 5-foot-10 starting offensive linemen in the modern NFL. I think that changes with Willie Lampkin. At that size, he still has a 6-foot-6 wingspan -- bigger than LSU's Will Campbell and NDSU's Grey Zabel. If he can get his weight into the 280s up from 270, Lampkin can start at center in the NFL. Chris Paul Jr. was highly productive this past fall at Ole Miss after transferring from Arkansas. He was everywhere around the line of scrimmage for the Rebels with an innate feel for sorting through trash. Paul also missed only four of his 89 tackle attempts all season. Jonas Sanker is a big, explosive and fluid safety. He's the kind of athlete who can wear a lot of different hats in a defense. Quinn Ewers college career was marred by injury and unmet expectations, but the talent that made him the former No. 1 overall recruit never disappeared. Quinshon Judkins played second fiddle to Tre Henderson this past fall for the Buckeyes, but that was through no fault of his own. He's one of the best tackle breakers in the draft class and showed at the combine he's one of the best athletes as well. Anthony Belton is a massive tackle prospect who may end up on the interior at the next level. He uses his hands so well for a bigger tackle and has an easy anchor at that size. Thomas Fidone II was a former No. 1 tight end recruit who couldn't stay healthy and struggled to develop because of that. This past fall, though, you saw his special traits in action. He's a sudden route-runner with a massive frame. Jared Wilson is the most athletic interior linemen in the draft class. Even though he's only a one-year starter, Wilson cracks this top 100. While he still needs more reps, he has a high-ceiling. One of the forgotten men in the running back class because of eligibility issues this past fall, Jacory Croskey-Merritt is a name to remember. He won the MVP of the Shrine Bowl and was easily the most impressive back in attendance with his electric footwork to manipulate defenders. The 2025 NFL Draft is to take place from April 24-26 at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin.

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Trump celebrates his first weeks back in office in a speech to Congress. Border Patrol agents are accused of targeting people based on their skin color during a “fishing expedition.” And director Bong Joon-ho talks about his upcoming movie, “Mickey 17.” Here’s what to know today. Donald Trump touted the first weeks of his second term as president as a ringing success in a speech before a joint session of Congress, declaring "America is back" and that his administration has "accomplished more in 43 days than most administrations accomplished in four years or eight years." Republicans showered Trump with applause as he touched on his economic plans, culture war issues, immigration and more. Democrats demonstrated that they are not as impressed. Though mostly silent, one representative, Al Green of Texas, shouted at Trump until he was removed from the House chamber (See video of the interruption). Trump taunted Democrats for not applauding him and repeated his derisive nickname for Sen. Elizabeth Warren, “Pocahontas,” when talking about Ukraine. This is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. Trump’s speech, which at an hour and 40 minutes was the longest speech ever delivered by a president to Congress, covered a variety of topics. Here are a few highlights: → On the economy, Trump acknowledged that newly imposed tariffs could cause pain for Americans. “A little disturbance,” he said, “but we’re OK with that.” He also renewed his pledge to eliminate taxes on tips, Social Security benefits and overtime pay — even though the budget that the House passed last month would make room only for extending the tax cuts from his first term. → On foreign policy, Trump pledged to sign a deal that would give the U.S. mineral rights in Ukraine, though his discussion of the war was relatively short despite it dominating the White House’s agenda in recent days. He also said Secretary of State Marco Rubio would oversee efforts to regain control of the Panama Canal and invited Greenland to join the U.S. “if you choose.” → On immigration, Trump said he is waging the “most sweeping border and immigration crackdown in American history.” He also highlighted the passage of the Laken Riley Act. → Missing from the speech was any mention of the thousands of federal workers who have been fired since Trump has taken office. However, he mentioned Elon Musk several times and claimed without evidence that he had found “hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud” in the government. Read the full story here. Less than a day after new tariffs against Canada, Mexico and China took effect, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated relief may be in sight. An interim agreement with Canada and Mexico could come as soon as today, Lutnick said yesterday in an interview on Fox Business Network, and allow tariffs on Canada and Mexico to be rolled back to some degree. Reaction to the tariffs — 25% on nearly all goods from Mexico and Canada and additional 10% on all imports from China — was swift, with economists and companies warning about the potential wide-ranging implications: 🚗 The price of cars could increase, even for vehicles assembled in the U.S. 🏠 The cost of building a new home could rise by as much as $10,000 per house, an economist said, which would impact the real estate market as a whole. 🛍️ Target and Best Buy have warned of price hikes, though some businesses have vowed to hold the line on costs. China and Canada have already imposed retaliatory tariffs on the U.S., and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said her country would respond by Sunday. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said imposing tariffs “is a very dumb thing to do.” Read the full story here. Border Patrol agents are accused of carrying out a “fishing expedition” in Kern County, California, allegedly targeting people of a certain color in a search for criminal immigrants, making arrests without warrants and using trickery to get people to leave the country, according to a recent lawsuit. Border Patrol said that 60 agents arrested 78 people, all who were unlawfully in the U.S. in the three-day operation. However, attorneys said some of the people arrested had no criminal convictions. On. Jan. 8, agents arrested Ernesto Campos Gutierrez, a 44-year-old U.S. citizen and resident of Bakersfield for 20 years, after they blocked his truck, slashed his tires, and dragged a passenger from the truck. The same day, Yolanda Agiulera Martinez, a 56-year-old lawful permanent resident was ordered out of her car and thrown to the ground before she was arrested. After she showed agents a photo of her legal residency card, she was told to “get the f--- out of here,” according to the lawsuit. The arrests have left many people in the Latino-majority county traumatized, attorneys said. Read the full story here. “Parasite” director Bong Joon-ho returns with his signature blend of drama and absurdist comedy with “Mickey 17.” The film, out Friday, stars Robert Pattinson as an “expendable” — a worker who takes on potentially fatal assignments during an expedition to a new planet, with the expectation of being cloned if he dies. Bong, who speaks Korean, talks about how he nails his specific brand of comedy in another language, his special bond with Pattinson and how getting his big break in his 50s means he can stay truer to himself. — Jessi Prois, NBC Asian America editorial director Retinol helps with accelerating skin cell turnover, which is why so many experts recommend incorporating it into your routine.

Title: Nvidia Stock: Are Tariff Fears Overblown?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team , Contributor. SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA - FEBRUARY 26: The Nvidia logo is displayed on a sign at the Nvidia ... [+] headquarters on February 26, 2025 in Santa Clara, California. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Nvidia stock fell nearly 9% during Monday’s trading session, while the broader Nasdaq index declined by just over 2%. The market-wide sell-off coincided with U.S. President Donald Trump’s confirmation that his administration would impose 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico starting Tuesday. Additionally, Nvidia’s drop was further exacerbated by investigations into Chinese buyers suspected of bypassing U.S. export controls on advanced semiconductor chips. How will these developments affect Nvidia stock? We do not believe that the Trump Administration’s initial tariffs will have a material impact on Nvidia. Nvidia’s chips are primarily manufactured by TSMC in Taiwan; however, some systems and computers utilizing these chips are produced in other regions, including Mexico. It is possible that these segments of the business might experience some impact. Nonetheless, the core of Nvidia’s operations—the high-margin GPU division—should remain mostly unaffected. Last month, President Trump also suggested the possibility of a “25% or higher” tariff on all semiconductor chips imported into the United States. Investors will need to monitor this development closely, although we believe it will not have a significant impact on Nvidia’s bottom line. As of 2024, Nvidia reported an adjusted gross margin of approximately 75.5%, indicating that the cost of its imported products is likely less than 25% of its revenues. Furthermore, since Nvidia generates around 47% of its sales from the U.S., the impact on its margins is probably even more constrained. In addition, TSMC, which is Nvidia’s main contract manufacturer for GPUs, has announced plans to invest roughly $100 billion in new chip fabrication facilities in the United States. Nvidia executives have indicated that they plan to produce chips at these new facilities, potentially helping the company mitigate long-term tariff risks. However, if you are seeking growth with less volatility than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since its inception. The United States has implemented export control restrictions on most of Nvidia’s newest AI chipset offerings to China, with the exception of the H20 chips, due to national security concerns. Nevertheless, reports indicate that gray market resellers are utilizing entities registered outside China to purchase servers incorporating Nvidia’s latest offerings from companies based in several countries, such as Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Vietnam. This concern is substantiated by the fact that Singapore has emerged as Nvidia’s second-largest market, representing approximately $23 billion in sales in FY’25, or about 18% of revenue, compared to only $2.3 billion, or 8% of revenue, in FY’23. Singapore has now launched an investigation into these potential loopholes. The emergence of China’s DeepSeek open-source AI model also suggests that the country is advancing significantly in AI, with both prominent startups and major companies like Alibaba and Baidu investing heavily in AI infrastructure. Should Chinese companies bypass sanctions and face stricter enforcement measures that eventually close these loopholes, Nvidia’s revenues could be affected. Over the past four years, NVDA stock's performance has been inconsistent, with annual returns displaying much greater volatility than the S&P 500. The stock returned 125% in 2021, -50% in 2022, 239% in 2023, and 171% in 2024. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, which comprises 30 stocks, exhibits significantly less volatility. It has also comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four years. Why is this the case? Overall, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index, resulting in a less turbulent performance as demonstrated in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics. In light of the current uncertain macroeconomic climate, marked by potential rate cuts and several conflicts, might NVDA experience a scenario similar to 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months, or will it experience a robust surge? We estimate Nvidia stock to be valued at approximately $101 per share, which is about 20% below the current market price. Refer to our analysis of Nvidia valuation: Expensive or Cheap. There are several reasons why we currently hold a negative outlook on the stock. We believe that the AI wave, driven by a “fear-of-missing-out” over the past two years, might subside due to diminishing incremental performance improvements from larger models and because high-quality training data may become a bottleneck. This transition towards more efficient models could further intensify the effects of a potential slowdown for GPU manufacturers like Nvidia. Additionally, Nvidia is encountering increasing competition from companies such as AMD and even from its own clients, like Amazon, which are focusing on developing and deploying their own AI chips. Although Nvidia boasts a comprehensive software ecosystem surrounding its AI processors—including programming languages that help secure customer loyalty—the company could still face pressure. Its premium valuation might not fully account for these risks at present. NVDA Return Compared With Trefis Reinforced Portfolio Invest with Trefis Market Beating Portfolios | Rules-Based Wealth

Dear friends, Welcome to the March issue of Mutual Fund Observer. I am surprised, sometimes, at how much I now appreciate some of the stuff that I found most mindless and annoying in high school. (I’m still not there with Moby Dick; the whole idea of a monomaniacally obsessed old guy leading his ship to destruction because he can’t be reasoned with and won’t back down, just strikes me as implausible, but I’m willing to listen.) My secret hope as a professor is that I’m like the gardener scattering seeds too early, in patches that seem disconsolate, for those seeds still sprout whither they would. And so, I teach my students about Thorstein Veblen, one of his age’s most impenetrable geniuses (he coined “conspicuous consumption”), and Sherry Turkle, one of our age’s most thoughtful, who asks “What do we become when we talk to machines?” We read about Hitler, and about the disastrous misjudgments – by mainstream politicians who had faith that they could control him and German industrialists who had faith that they could harness him to their everlasting profit – that led to the rise of Hitler. We read the reflections of the decent, hardworking Germans who convinced themselves that it was better to keep their heads down and pray. This separation of government from people, this widening of the gap, took place so gradually and so insensibly, each step disguised (perhaps not even intentionally) as a temporary emergency measure or associated with true patriotic allegiance or with real social purposes. And all the crises and reforms (real reforms, too) so occupied the people that they did not see the slow-motion underneath, of the whole process of government growing remoter and remoter. . . (A German professor speaking with Milton Mayer, They Thought They Were Free: The Germans, 1933-45. University of Chicago Press, 1955) We read the final report of Herbert Hoover’s 1929 Committee on Recent Economic Changes that hailed an “almost insatiable appetite for goods and services,” and envisaged “a boundless field before us … new wants that make way endlessly for newer wants, as fast as they are satisfied.” The kids from Nepal and Mongolia read it alongside the kids from Naperville and Milwaukee, read it very differently from one another, and speak to each other with increasing confidence about how they connect to the readings … and connect to each other. And so, in the spring of my 41st year at the college, I’ll continue scattering seeds and nurturing hope. Heck, perhaps one day they’ll reflect on my classes as I’ve reflected on Dickens. “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.” ― Charles Dickens, A Tale of Two Cities (1859) Our colleague Lynn Bolin continues looking at bonds as an attractive alternative, on a risk-adjusted and valuation basis, to stocks just now. “Spicy Bond Funds” explores “spicier” (higher-yielding) bond investments in the current market environment. Lynn analyzes various risk factors including inflation, duration risk, and policy uncertainty, and provides a comprehensive ranking system for bond funds. Spoiler: you might want to check Janus Henderson AAA CLO ETF (JAAA) as a relatively safe way to achieve higher yields in the current market, Lynn complements that with a new take on an old strategy, bond laddering. In “ETF Bond Ladders,” he examines ETFs designed for bond laddering, focusing on products from Invesco (BulletShares) and BlackRock (iShares iBonds). The essay concludes with the note that corporate BBB-rated bond ladders will be Lynn’s mainstay investment, with potential additions of high-yield bonds for near-term investments and municipal bonds for tax-efficient accounts. In “The Great Rotation” (below), I highlight the surprising extent of the change in stock investors’ preferences – small, value, international, and emerging are being rediscovered – and offer up the funds that should be on an investor’s shortlist. Not to put too fine a point on it, but the Trump administration has gutted efforts to minimize global warming, coordinate international responses to it, or maintain a credible information infrastructure for it. In January we noted that the necessary response to allowing such a collapse was a shift to infrastructure investing to manage the effects. In February, we extended the analysis to water infrastructure. In “The Climate Denial Profit Paradox,” we update the state of government efforts and lay out additional investing opportunities. (I’ll go back to being optimistic about the future next month.) After markets get pricier and shakier, asset managers are doing what asset managers do: they’re rolling out new products in new asset classes using new algorithms that guarantee that happy days will be here again. After walking through the sad wreckage of other “can’t miss” innovations, we highlight the risks surrounding three new funds and ETFs in “Liquid Promises, Illiquid Reality.” All of which brought to mind the stunning collapse of Firsthand Technology Value Fund, a tale that continues to this day. Launched in 1994, the fund returned 60% a year in the 1990s and gave rise to a half dozen siblings. Twenty years after launch it became a business development company doing private equity investing in the same sorts of tech companies. And ten years later, the fund is trading for $0.06/share and isn’t even able to liquidate. The cautionary tale is in “The Rise and Fall of Firsthand Technology Value Fund.” Speaking of rising and falling, The Shadow documents the death of Matthews Asian Growth & Income, a fund made famous by Paul Matthews and Andrew Foster as the least volatile, most consistently excellent way to invest in Asia equities from 1994 to about 2011. But thereafter … We can establish two things about the stock market with great confidence: The US stock market has a giant problem. “Giant” in the sense that investors have poured money so steadily and so long into a handful of leaders that their valuations are beginning to redefine “irrational.” Jason Zweig notes, “Even after the stumble in tech stocks late last month, the Magnificent Seven traded this week at an average of 43.3 times what analysts expect them to earn over the next 12 months” (“What You Should Do About the Stock Market’s Giant Problem,” com, 2/7/25). That leaves most of the US market and virtually all of the rest of the world with tolerable valuations. Spencer Jakab reports that “developed-market large growth stocks were trading last week at 98th-percentile valuations… [meaning] they have been more expensive only 2% of the time.” (Ever.) Simultaneously, “developed-market large value is at the 2nd percentile, so it has been cheaper only 2% of the time” (“Stocks have a big, expensive problem,” WSJ, 2/25/25, B10). Morningstar pictures it this way: Source: Morningstar.com, Market Valuation View, 2/28/2025 Leuthold Group reports that small caps are selling at a 26% discount to large caps, adjusted for earnings, and value is selling at a near-historic discount to growth. Investors have noticed. As of March 3, 2025, Vanguard Value ETF is up 4.5% on the year, Vanguard Growth ETF is down 1.2%. Similarly, the Vanguard FTSE EM ETF is up 1.6%, Vanguard Total International Stock ETF is up 5.7% and the value-oriented Vanguard International High Dividend Yield ETF is up 6.6%. Contrarily, the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF is down 6% YTD. Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF is down 2%. Tesla is down 27% YTD. Google is down 10%. Trump Media & Tech is down 32%. All of this is separate from broader concerns about chaos, tariffs, reciprocal tariffs, escalating tariffs, government shutdowns, and burgeoning deficits. What might an investor consider? If you’re a young investor with a diversified portfolio (think more than 50 stocks representing many different industries, ideally spread over several countries), do nothing to your portfolio. You’re fine. This might be unpleasant, but that’s part of the price of playing the game. If you’re an investor with all of your eggs in one small basket (you have a tech ETF and shares of Nvidia, Google, and Amazon), broaden your exposure. That doesn’t mean selling what you own. It might mean adding something like Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP). At base, the equal weight 500 counteracts the large/growth/momentum biases embedded in many portfolios. It gives equal exposure to the largest and smallest companies in the S&P 500 which creates an immediate contrarian balance. It is more oriented toward less expensive stocks, smaller stocks, old-economy stocks, and dividends than the S&P or the typical portfolio. In Morningstar terms, it is a one-star fund which is precisely its appeal: it invests in the companies left for dead by the FAANG/MAG7 mania. If you want to increase your exposure to value-oriented stocks, consider Wisdom Tree US Value ETF (WTV) or Goodhaven Fund (GOODX). Why these two? We turned to the MFO Premium screener which allows us to assess open-end funds, closed-end funds, and exchange-traded funds side-by-side. We screeners for funds with three essential characteristics: We applied that screener to large value, mid-cap value, and multi-cap value funds for the past three years. Thirty-four value funds and ETFs showed both excellent manager performance and excellent resilience over the past three years. Wisdom Tree US Value had the highest information ratio of all, and Goodhaven had the highest ratio for all mutual funds. If you want to increase your exposure to small cap stocks, consider Vanguard Strategic Small Cap Equity, North Square Dynamic Small Cap, or Adirondack Small Cap. Vanguard Strategic Small Cap Equity is an actively managed, low-cost small-cap blend fund that holds about 500 names (yikes! But it works) with a growth-at-a-reasonable-price discipline. It charges one-third of the category average and is about as diversified as can be. North Square Dynamic Small Cap employs a systematic, quantitative approach to identify behavioral inefficiencies in small-cap equity markets, leveraging sophisticated data science to exploit pricing dislocations caused by investor biases. That “behavioral finance” angle is fairly distinctive. Adirondack Small Cap is the top-performing small value fund, earning a remarkable 11% annual return in one of the market’s left-for-dead categories. The fund specializes in identifying undervalued small-cap companies that have fallen out of favor with investors, seeking to capitalize on these “turnaround situations” before mainstream investors take notice. They target companies that might rebound within three years. The team has been around forever and is heavily invested in the fund. If you want to increase your exposure to international stocks, consider the Janus Henderson Global Research or Moerus Worldwide Value. The Janus Henderson Global Research is a global large-cap growth fund that employs a distinctive sector-driven approach where specialized teams of dedicated sector analysts build high-conviction portfolios of their best ideas worldwide. They also work to hedge away most macroeconomic risks leaving the portfolio performance mostly driven by stock selection. Moerus Worldwide Value is a globally unconstrained deep value fund managed by Amit Wadhwaney, who employs a disciplined approach to identifying companies trading at significant discounts to intrinsic value across developed and emerging markets, with a particular emphasis on strong balance sheets over income statements. Amit has three decades of value investing experience and willingness to embrace market turmoil as an opportunity, seeking out underfollowed businesses, complex situations, and temporarily distressed sectors that most investors avoid, creating a distinctive portfolio of 30-40 high-conviction holdings with minimal index overlap. And if you’re simply freaked out, (a) welcome to the club and (b) increase the strategic cash allocation in your portfolio. Cash and cash alternatives are paying 4-5% a year with minimal downside. If you don’t have any great conviction in risk assets, take a deep breath and invest in some variation of an ultra-short bond fund or money market. CrossingBridge is run by David Sherman & co., and they have an outstanding record of low-risk income investing. Fidelity Conservative Income is a cheap, active, middle-of-the-road ultra-short bond fund. The “cheap” is really useful here. We’ve also included the profile of the money market peer group. In reality, there’s no downside to any of them and precious little upside deviation. So, the whole group sits at 4.2% give-or-take 0.2%. Pick whichever one is convenient to you if you don’t want the prospect of adding just a bit of upside with CrossingBridge or Fido. The bottom line: running around in panic is not your friend. Hiding is not your friend. Taking a deep breath and making rational adjustments is. We’ll help. March has been designated as “B Corp Month.” Hallmark has not yet taken notice. In an era of growing disillusionment with traditional corporate structures, B Corps stand as beacons of a more conscientious approach to business. While many companies prioritize profits at any cost, Benefit Corporations (B Corps) represent a revolutionary paradigm that balances financial success with positive social and environmental impact. B Corps are businesses that meet rigorous standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency. Unlike conventional corporations that answer primarily to shareholders, B Corps legally commit to considering all stakeholders: workers, customers, suppliers, community, and the environment. In the US, 2,400 corporations are organized as B Corps. Worldwide, that swells to 9,500. What makes B Corps worth celebrating? They’re proving that business can be a force for good. From fair wages and diverse workforces to sustainable sourcing and ethical production, these companies demonstrate that profit and purpose aren’t mutually exclusive, they’re mutually reinforcing. The B Corp movement isn’t just idealism; it’s pragmatism for our times. As consumers increasingly vote with their dollars for companies that reflect their values, B Corps are showing that ethical business practices create resilience, innovation, and long-term success. The Annual Report of B Lab documents a lot of ways in which these companies really are different. I am not surprised, though I am slightly appalled, by the speed with which Corporate America as a whole has thrown all principles except shareholder (and executive) gains under the bus. By supporting the good guys, you aren’t underwriting the swift abandonment of employees, communities, and the environment by the billionaire-dollar corporations that were cheerleading for it, flying rainbow flags, and signing on to global initiatives … for precisely as long as it was convenient. Support how?? Follow B Lab Global, the certifying body, on social media (LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, X) and follow the #GenB or #BCorpMonth hashtag to see the different stuff happening throughout March. You can also use the ‘Find a B Corp’ directory to discover businesses that are part of the community and use your purchasing power to support B Corp companies, and the movement of business as a force for good. You might also consider Bookshop.org as an ethical alternative to Amazon, at least as a bookseller. They’ve donated $36+ million in profits to local bookshops since their launch during Covid. Nice people, good selection. Amazon has recently changed policy, they now forbid Kindle users from downloading their books, giving them permanent control of your purchases. (You might recall their freakish decision to remove the book 1984 from all Kindle readers a few years ago.) Bookshop has e-books and is working with folks like Kobo to make them available on readers. Similarly, a handful of major retailers have recognized the business case of sustaining a diverse and vibrant workforce and have, to date, refused to roll back corporate efforts to support their employees. Those include Costco, Crate & Barrel, Home Depot, Ikea, Kroger, Sprouts Wayfair, West Elm … and Whole Foods (?).

To, Sara from Brooklyn, Charles of Michigan, Ronald from Alexandria, Marjorie (thank you, ma’am, I also get such a headache some days) of Chicago, The Grinch Redux, and dear Binod from Houston, thanks! And for more than just financial support. You make a difference. It’s planting time. Chip is busily searching seed catalogs for spring-planted garlic (stiff neck mostly, because they generate delicious garlic scapes) and mild onions. I’ll continue searching for the perfect potato. And somewhere in there, more native wildflowers and grass (sheep fescue looks cool) will continue their relentless incursion on our lawn. Planting is an act of hope.

March 04, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, March 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC), Elastic N.V. (NYSE:ESTC), Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTLA), and Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC) Class Period: November 16, 2023 - February 4, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 14, 2025 The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants allegedly failed to disclose to investors: (1) the Company’s channel management initiatives were not progressing as represented; (2) that, faced with pricing pressure, the Company had made the decision not to compete on prices and instead walk away from sales opportunities; (3) that, as a result, the Company had inflated inventory in the channels in “LATAM, including Brazil, Asia, including India, as well as Canada and Eastern Europe;” and (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. For more information on the FMC class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/FMC Elastic N.V. (NYSE:ESTC) Class Period: May 31, 2024 - August 29, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 14, 2025 The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, the Complaint alleges that Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Elastic had implemented significant changes to its sales operations, particularly with respect to its customer segments in the Americas; (2) the foregoing changes were likely to, and did, disrupt Elastic's sales operations during the first quarter of its FY 2025; (3) accordingly, Defendants had overstated the stability of Elastic's sales operations; (4) as a result of all the foregoing, Elastic was unlikely to meet its own previously issued revenue guidance for its FY 2025; and (5) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. For more information on the Elastic class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ESTC Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTLA) Class Period: July 30, 2024 - January 8, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 14, 2025 According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Intellia's Phase 1/2 study evaluating NTLA-3001 for the treatment of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD)-associated lung disease. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in the Company’s timeline for the aforementioned study, specifically that Intellia expected to dose the first patient in the second half of 2024. Defendants failed to disclose inter alia that the demand for viral-based editing was rapidly dwindling as non-viral delivery methods became a main target of the scientific research community due to their cost-effectiveness and more efficient development, thus making NTLA-3001 an inefficient program for Intellia to maintain. The alleged truth emerged on January 9, 2025, when Intellia published a press release announcing Company reorganization. In pertinent part, defendants disclosed that Intellia would be halting all NTLA-3001 research and studies and that the Company would be reducing its workforce by 27% in 2025. Specifically, the Company announced that management decided to focus Intellia’s resources on other pharmaceutical development and would be implementing cost saving in the form of a major reduction in force. As a result, defendants pipeline priority readjustment resulted in the Company’s once-touted NTLA-3001’s discontinuation. Following this news, Intellia’s stock price fell from a closing market price of $12.02 per share on January 8, 2025 to $10.20 per share on January 10, 2025. For more information on the Intellia class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/NTLA Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK) Class Period: February 3, 2022 - February 3, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 14, 2025 The Merck class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Merck's projected revenue outlook and anticipated growth of Gardasil while also minimizing risk from competition and drug approval development, such as China's approval to shift Gardasil to a 2-dose regimen; (ii) in truth, Merck's optimistic reports of growth, claims of successful consumer activation and education in China, overall ability to drive demand, and efforts to downplay the impact of competition on Gardasil fell short of the reality; and (iii) Merck's ability to push Gardasil in China had materially diminished. The Merck class action lawsuit further alleges that on July 30, 2024, Merck revealed that in the second quarter of 2024 "there was a significant step down in shipments from our distributor and commercialization partner, Zhifei, into the points of vaccination, compared with prior quarters, resulting in above normal inventory levels at Zhifei." On this news, the price of Merck stock fell nearly 10%, according to the complaint. Then, on February 4, 2025, the Merck class action lawsuit alleges that Merck published its fourth quarter fiscal year 2024 results, disclosing that "GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 Sales Declined 3% to $8.6 Billion; Excluding the Impact of Foreign Exchange, Sales Declined 2%" "primarily due to lower demand in China, partially offset by higher demand in most international regions, particularly in Japan." On this news, the price of Merck stock fell more than 9%, according to the complaint.

(NASDAQ: QUBT) Class Period: March 30, 2020 - January 15, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 28, 2025 The lawsuit alleges that, during the Class Period, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Defendants overstated the capabilities of QCI’s quantum computing technologies, products, and/or services; (ii) Defendants overstated the scope and nature of QCI’s relationship with NASA, as well as the scope and nature of QCI’s NASA-related contracts and/or subcontracts; (iii) Defendants overstated QCI’s progress in developing a TFLN foundry, the scale of the purported TFLN foundry, and orders for the Company’s TFLN chips; (iv) QCI’s business dealings with Quad M and millionways both qualified as related party transactions; (v) accordingly, QCI’s revenues relied, at least in part, on undisclosed related party transactions; (vi) all the foregoing, once revealed, was likely to have a significant negative impact on QCI’s business and reputation; and (vii) as a result, Defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

(NASDAQ: RKLB) Class Period: November 12, 2024 - February 25, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 28, 2025 On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

Title: IPO-bound CoreWeave to buy AI developer Weights & Biases for a reported $1.4B
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/03/04/ipo-bound-coreweave-buy-ai-developer-weights-biases-reported-1-4b/
Time Published: 2025-03-05T01:07:49Z
Full Content:
UPDATED 20:07 EST / MARCH 04 2025 by Mike Wheatley Cloud-based artificial intelligence infrastructure startup CoreWeave Inc. today announced it plans to buy the AI model development firm Weights & Biases Inc. for an undisclosed price. The company confirmed the acquisition plan just minutes after The Information first reported that it was “in talks” to buy Weights & Biases in a deal valued at $1.7 billion. CoreWeave has emerged as one of the AI industry’s hottest properties because it provides enterprises with access to that most treasured resource: the graphics processing units that power today’s AI services. Through its cloud infrastructure, enterprise customers such as Meta Platforms Inc. can obtain on-demand access to some of Nvidia’s most powerful GPUs, including its H100 and H200 chips, which are designed to provide accelerated computing power for large language models and other AI workloads. San Francisco-based Weights & Biases, which had raised more than $250 million in funding from investors since its founding in 2017, has built a platform that promises to speed up the development of AI models. It provides extensive capabilities to AI developers, including tools for managing training datasets, testing how changes to a model affect its performance, and troubleshooting technical problems. In addition, Weights & Biases offers more specialized capabilities, including a set of features for fixing so-called “hallucinations,” or erroneous responses that are sometimes generated by large language models. Its platform has proved to be a major hit, and the company claims it’s being used by more than 1 million AI engineers, including some from enterprises such as OpenAI, Meta, Nvidia Corp., Snowflake Inc. and Toyota Motor Co. CoreWeave said it will integrate Weights & Biases’ capabilities into its cloud infrastructure platform in order to give customers a more comprehensive “end-to-end” AI experience. Not only will they be able to run their models in its cloud, they’ll also be able to build and test their own. Collectively, the two companies aim to help customers accelerate their AI roadmaps and bring new applications to market faster. It promised that Weights & Biases’ existing customers will continue to be allowed to deploy their AI models wherever they like, meaning they won’t be forced onto its cloud infrastructure – though they’ll likely be “encouraged” to consider it. Holger Mueller of Constellation Research Inc. told SiliconANGLE that CoreWeave’s management has recognized that many enterprises prefer to buy a complete AI solution that can simplify their forays into AI application and model development, housing everything under one roof. “They want a turnkey cloud platform that lets them build and operate their next-generation AI applications and do everything associated with them in one place, and that’s what CoreWeave aims to give them,” he said. CoreWeave co-founder and Chief Executive Michael Intrator described Weights & Biases as a “phenomenal platform” that helps companies of any size to get a handle on the complexities of building AI models, deploying them and monitoring their performance. “Together with CoreWeave, we will bring this grit and passion for innovation to customers at an even greater scale, with the goal of rapidly accelerating adoption across the world’s leading AI labs and enterprises,” promised Weights & Biases CEO Lukas Biewald. The acquisition is subject to “customary closing conditions” and is expected to be finalized in the first half of the year. Assuming it does go ahead as planned, it will bring an even greater sense of urgency to CoreWeave’s plan to list on the Nasdaq stock exchange later this year. Only yesterday, the company revealed it had filed the necessary paperwork for its initial public offering, saying it intends to trade on the Nasdaq exchange under the “CRWV” ticker symbol. CoreWeave’s IPO filing revealed that the company has seen dramatic growth over the last year, with its revenue rising by a stunning 700%, to $1.92 billion, in fiscal 2024. It’s expecting to grow even faster in the future, too, with more than $15 billion in signed contracts that it has yet to fulfill. The company remains unprofitable, though, posting a loss of $863.4 million that year.

Title: GOP Is ‘Trying to Gaslight’ Americans Into Believing Trump Has Made Their Lives Better, Tara Setmayer Says | Video

“I don’t think that’s what the American people voted for,” the former GOP comms director adds Tara Setmayer thinks the GOP is doing a lot of gaslighting to keep the American people convinced President Donald Trump is making their lives better. In the wake of Trump’s renewed push to place major tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, the stock market took a hit and prices around the U.S. continued to increase. Setmayer – a former communications director for the GOP – explained that the party is having to cover for the president’s choices with a lot of gaslighting for promises made before the election. Watch her breakdown while on MSNBC Tuesday below: “I think the Republicans are going to have to explain to the American people why Donald Trump’s actions so far in his few weeks that he’s been in office, how has that improved their lives?” Setmayer said. “It hasn’t and no matter what they keep saying, they’re trying to gaslight the American people into thinking everything’s better. ‘This is much better — you’re going to have to go through some pain but it will be better eventually.’ I don’t think that’s what the American people voted for.” She continued: “They didn’t hear about that ‘some pain’ part first in order to get this magical better economic situation. The economic situation was actually pretty good under Joe Biden, but a lot of the American people didn’t feel it.” The Nasdaq, Dow Jones and S&P 500 were all down about 2% on Tuesday, a day after the president said he would be imposing tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico. Big tech has been hit especially hard since Trump took office – ironic since many of them were prominently displayed behind him on Inauguration Day. Amazon, Apple, Tesla and Alphabet, Google’s parent company, all who were represented at Trump’s swearing in, have seen their shares take a sizable hit since 2025 began. Only Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta has enjoyed a price climb so far.

March 04, 2025 17:26 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, March 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important March 25, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1.” Defendants’ statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants’ statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk’s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: Trump tariffs are a risk for Big Tech. But 'don't run for the hills,' analysts say

President Donald Trump’s broad-ranging tariffs went into effect earlier Tuesday, sending the market in a downward spiral. The United States will be enacting 25% duties on all Mexican goods and most Canadian goods, and 20% on all imports from China. Retaliatory tariffs followed promptly: Canada imposed 25% tariff on $107 billion worth of American goods, as China announced duties of up to 15% on agricultural products and targeted actions at more than 20 companies, including artificial intelligence startups and drone makers. Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum said she will announce retaliatory measures on Sunday. The tech industry is wary. Shares of Tesla (TSLA-0.21%), which owns a major assembly plant in China, were down more than 3% in Tuesday late afternoon trading. The stock gained back some of its losses from earlier in the day when several investors downgraded the stock due to tariff fears. Retailer Best Buy (BBY+0.14%) warned investors that the duties could increase the price of the electronics it sells. “In terms of visibility of goods, I’d say Apple (AAPL+1.97%) and Tesla are probably the headliners,” D.A. Davidson head of technology Gil Luria told Quartz. But the tariffs and their immediate impact is by no means unexpected by global markets as Trump made his fondness of tariffs clear even on the campaign trail. Tech analysts are more worried about how long the tariffs will last, as well as whether or not further escalation in reciprocals will occur — and if they’ll extend beyond tariffs on physical goods. “It’s far more likely that this time, they’re going to hurt the U.S. where it matters,” Luria said, adding that the big tech companies are “the best target.” If Canada, Mexico or China decide that the U.S. has taken a confrontational approach to tariffs, they can respond in kind by penalizing big tech companies like Microsoft (MSFT-1.50%), Google (GOOGL+0.86%), Meta (META-1.17%) or Amazon (AMZN-1.51%). This, Luria said, would be “the most meaningful and most broad in its impact.” “In China, for instance, they can just eliminate the sales of iPhone altogether,” Luria said. “These are all things that any country that the U.S. is getting into a confrontation with could decide to do in order to exert pressure on the U.S. to reduce those tariffs.” Following the first set of 10% tariffs on Chinese imports last month, Beijing was quick to retaliate with an investigation into alleged antitrust violations by Google while reportedly laying the groundwork for a formal probe into Apple’s App Store. Last month, the Financial Times reported that the EU is ready to impose retaliatory measures on Big Tech companies in the case of a potential dispute with the Trump administration. Trump has threatened to use tariffs on the EU several times. But some are optimistic that things won’t escalate to that point. “As we navigated in 2018/2019 we caution this is all a game of high stakes poker to get other countries to the negotiating table and will very likely not last for an elongated period of time,” Wedbush’s Dan Ives wrote in Tuesday morning’s note. An aggressive approach towards China and chip export controls is “the biggest risk” to the artificial intelligence trade, according to Ives. Nvidia (NVDA+0.45%) stock closed down 8.7% on Monday after Singaporean police uncovered an illegal export operation aiming to take servers containing Nvidia chips to mainland China in violation of American chip export controls that the market fears the U.S. might now further restrict. “Outside of the U.S., there’s been a surprising amount of openness to working on DeepSeek models, and the more the U.S. alienates its trading partners, the more likely they are to gravitate to Chinese models,” Luria said. But any slowdown in the AI trade associated with these tariff-borne near-term risks will be short-lived, according to Wedbush analysts. “Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Palantir (PLTR+3.74%), Salesforce (CRM-1.93%), Tesla, Apple will remain the stocks to own and any weakness is a buying opportunity in our view given the fundamental demand picture,” Ives wrote. “This will be an ‘uncomfortable time for growth investors’... but ultimately this is not the time to run for the hills in the tech trade and instead own these tech AI winners.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Click here to subscribe and get it in your inbox every Tuesday. Women experienced less gender discrimination when working remotely than when working in-person, according to a new study. As companies (and the government) continue to bring their employees back to the office, researchers at the University of Toronto recently published a study that shows remote work is protecting women from gender discrimination. The December 2024 report shows that of the more than 1,000 women surveyed, 31% experienced gender discrimination when working at their physical workplace, compared to 17% of those working remotely. The research is part of a larger group of studies that show how women benefit from remote work. From increased participation in the labor market to flexible childcare options, flexible work arrangements have been seen as a large win for working women. Meanwhile, men continue to “disproportionately” benefit from in-person work, according to HR Dive. Still, the study’s authors warned against extrapolating the results too far––remote work won’t fix workplace discrimination, they warned, but the data shows such instances are decreasing. Happy reading, and hope you have a lovely week! Practical insights and advice from Forbes staff and contributors to help you succeed in your job, accelerate your career and lead smarter Here’s how to grow in your career if you don’t want to be a manager. If you fear layoffs may be in your company’s future, here’s how to protect your career. Still thinking about The Oscars? Here are the leadership lessons you can learn from Sunday’s biggest moments. Melly Barajas, owner and head distiller of Leyenda de Mexico made this year's 50 Over 50 Global list. When Melly Barajas, now known as the “Queen of Tequila” among industry circles, first started hiring for her Leyenda de Mexico Tequila distillery, she was shocked to find only women showed up for the job openings. Today, the company produces 20,000 liters of tequila a day to be sold across her brands. I spoke with Barajas, an honoree of this year’s 50 Over 50 Global list, about what it means to run an all-women team, the rise in female distillers, and how she empowers her employees. This is an excerpt of that conversation, of which you can listen to in full here. The tequila industry has been dominated by men for quite some time. Can you walk me through the choice to hire only women to work in the factory when you first started 25 years ago? It wasn’t conscious. Only women started working with me not because I decided to do so. I mean, in the towns of Mexico, you know that most of the men go to the United States or elsewhere to look for other opportunities. So the town was full of daughters, mothers, grandmothers who wanted to do something. So, the fact that they believed in me, that is to say, gave me the driving force that now drives me. They came in and were like “Oh, ma’am I learned how to distill and my son congratulated me and they had never said anything to me!” So they were really excited about contributing. And I had to teach them to have strength and to believe in themselves, too, because it was also very difficult. I would arrive and ask them: “What do you want to do?” “No, well I know how to sweep and mop.” “But what else would you like to learn about? What about this machine?” And they wouldn’t believe they could do it, so a lot of it was also teaching them that they can do it and learn more skills. How have you seen the industry change since you started? I really think this industry needed the female touch. They’ll kill me for having said that, but it’s the truth. I mean, there are really a lot of people, as I said, who have all their lives and pedigree and everything, but women really get to do things a little bit differently. When they tell me that so-and-so died, and the wife, instead of selling the tequila plant she is going to take charge, I applaud them! Or that so-and-so is going to leave his daughter at the front of the tequila factory, I applaud them, to tell you the truth. It is very nice because, whether you like it or not, we give real added value. Women do not subtract. And in this industry the feminine touch was missing. I used to feel horrible arriving at industry meetings and it was all men, and I was standing around like a kid. And now it is so nice to see two, three, four, five women in the room. The pandemic was a really big turning point for lots of businesses and workers alike. Can you talk about how you and Leyenda de Mexico were impacted? We did not close our doors a single day. I’d hear about other distilleries closing and that was like a stake through my heart, you know? I wondered how I was still going, if I should go on. But I kept motivating our workers. I told them: No ladies, we keep going, you can do it. And then sometimes there was a time when I said well, we are going to close even if it is only for 15 days, but when they came and told me, “Ma’am, do you remember my dad would get angry because I came to work? Yes, now he sits down to talk to me at night because I’m financially maintaining our household.” You think I was going to close after that? No. Wow, it’s really about motivating them, right? How have you seen your employees take that motivation and put it into action? Yes. Like I told you before, it’s about teaching them to try different things. After the pandemic, we ramped up production by five times, all with the same amount of staff. The girls would tell me: “Listen, ma’am, I can do this in X-amount of time. But if you buy this new machine I’ll be able to do twice as much.” And that’s how we grew quickly. News from the world of work A top Pentagon DOGE staffer looks like a successful founder, having raised $10 million for a telehealth startup. But Justin Fulcher’s story doesn’t always add up: The company went bankrupt, and he is now being accused of unpaid bills and overstating his credentials, David Jeans reports. Some economists worry that job growth is increasingly limited to a few industries. The unemployment rate remains low, but new jobs are mostly coming from the healthcare and hospitality fields, while the white collar market remains stagnant. Meta must face a lawsuit alleging it prefers to hire international visa-holders over American workers because of cheaper labor, a federal judge ruled last week. The tech giant isn’t the only company currently in litigation over alleged “systemic preferences” for visa holders: Current and former employees of Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC are suing the company over alleged “anti-American” discrimination. Workers at the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Education are being offered thousands of dollars to quit, up to $50,000 and $25,000, respectively. Corporate America has been known to use pay-to-quit programs as a way to reduce headcount. When Amazon bought Zappos in 2014, for instance, Jeff Bezos implemented a similar program. Meanwhile, the Federal Aviation Agency announced a “hiring supercharge” for more air traffic controllers after a start of the year filled with high-profile plane accidents. But with long training times, don’t expect the controller shortage to be resolved soon. AI data centers were supposed to be job creator havens, as the companies behind them and politicians touted a boom in employment. But the hiring spree is limited to building the data centers themselves, after which only a few hundred are required to run the large facilities, the Wall Street Journal reports. “Life Is a Game And You Can Change The Costume You Wear At Any Time” What workplace messaging app was down last Wednesday, with some users experiencing difficulties from morning into the early evening?

The S&P 500 took a sharp hit on Tuesday as newly implemented tariffs rattled investors’ confidence and continued a selloff that has now fully erased the market’s gains since the election of President Donald Trump in November. Trade war concerns prompted the S&P 500 to drop to an intraday low of 5,732.59 during a widespread market selloff, falling well below its close of 5,929.04 on Nov. 6, the day after the election. The index, after having its worst day of the year on Monday, finished Tuesday with a loss of 1.2%. “This is the first market day we’ve had in which investors have been saying they’re really afraid of an economic slowdown,” Chris Grisanti, chief market strategist at MAI Capital Management, told Quartz. Trading was very unusual on Tuesday, with industrials and banks way off. Other major indices, such as the Nasdaq Composite, shed 0.35%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 670 points or 1.5% by the end of the day in New York. Tesla (TSLA-0.21%) stock declined on Tuesday due to rising fears about tariffs among investors — car prices may be driven higher by the duties. The company also has a large presence in China, including a major assembly plant, and so may be vulnerable to retaliation by Beijing. Additionally, Bank of America (BAC-0.02%) reduced its price target for the stock to $380 from $490 while maintaining a Neutral rating. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas yesterday had designated Tesla stock as a “Top Pick” in the U.S. automotive sector and raised his price target to $430. Target’s (TGT-0.16%) stock fell after it said it expects a “meaningful” year-on-year decline in first-quarter profits compared and CEO Brian Cornell warned that the new tariffs may prompt the retailer to increase prices as soon as next week. The company’s fourth-quarter earnings beat Wall Street’s expectations. Best Buy (BBY+0.14%) stock dropped 12% after company executives warned that the duties could increase the prices of goods it sells and could reduce its comparable sales if they stay in place for a full year. The electronics retailer reported fourth-quarter results that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations. Chipotle (CMG-3.57%) shares declined due to concerns about the restaurant chain’s dependence on avocados that are 50% sourced from Mexico. The company has said its diverse supply chain could help it withstand the tariffs. — Francisco Velasquez and Josh Fellman contributed to this article.

Title: LA Times Will Label Opinion Articles With AI-Powered ‘Bias Meter’

The Los Angeles Times has seen better days as the company’s billionaire owner continues taking a wrecking ball to the nearly 150-year-old institution. Waves of layoffs and editorial interference by Patrick Soon-Shiong, a vocal Trump supporter, has tanked morale, and now the owner has set his sights on AI as the panacea that will improve trust and, ultimately, the fortunes of the newspaper. Soon-Shiong announced this week that opinion articles will now include an AI-powered bias meter that labels articles based on an algorithm’s perceived interpretation of its political leanings. The new labels include âLeft, Center Left, Center, Center Right or Right,â and are determined by a startup called Particle.News, which was founded by former Twitter engineers. There will also be a section called “Viewspoints,” powered by AI startup Perplexity, that will display alternative views to those put forth in an article. These new AI products will apply not just to opinion pieces but any âarticles that offer a point of view on an issue,â according to a statement received by The Guardian. Opinion-oriented articles will be more clearly delineated from straight news reports with a new “Voices” label. Standard news articles will not include the AI features. Voices and Insights button now live â¦@latimesâ©. Try it. Now the voice and perspective from all sides can be heard, seen and read âno more echo chamber. Thanks to our talented content management software team running this Graphene platform pic.twitter.com/HslD5dKinz — Dr. Pat Soon-Shiong (@DrPatSoonShiong) March 3, 2025 Trust in media is notoriously low, and it is worth experimenting to see how the tide can be turned. But it is all a bit ironic that Soon-Shiong claims to be trying to improve trust in the media while he repeatedly interferes in reporting. The billionaire caught flak in 2024 after sharing on X an opinion piece that the original author claimed was altered after submission to make it appear more positive about Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Multiple staffers left after Soon-Shiong similarly interfered in an article regarding one of his friends who got into an altercation over a dog attack. It does not instill much “trust” when the billionaire owner is second-guessing journalists’ decisions about newsworthiness and getting personally involved when reporters are investigating his friends. While the Times’ editorial union is not necessarily opposed to displaying alternative opinions against an article, they say that AI is not the way to do this. The AI-generated viewpoints will not be scrutinized by editors, and of course, AI models continue to make up information and get basic queries wrong (during the recent Oscars, ChatGPT surfaced nominees from the wrong year). Already, the Guardian reports that some of the contrasting viewpoints suggested by the AI tool were featured in the article itself. âThe money for this endeavor could have been directed elsewhere: supporting our journalists on the ground who have had no cost-of-living increase since 2021,â said Matt Hamilton, vice president of the LATimes Guild. It seems inevitable that we are heading towards a place where the internet is rife with AI-created, pseudo-academic writing filled with made-up facts and quotes, which will then get cemented into âknowledgeâ as those articles become the training fodder for future models. How much of this will end up in the alternative viewpoints on Times articles?Â Perplexity, it should be noted, has shown disdain for the journalism industry in general by scraping articles and regurgitating them almost whole-cloth in its chatbot, claiming fair use over the practice. When New York Times staffers went on strike last year during labor negotiations, Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas offered to provide AI tools that he suggested could replace them. Showing similar disdain for his own employees, it would not be surprising to see Soon-Shiong expand the use of AI to write entire articles. Other news organizations have experimented with AI in small and subtle ways. The Washington Post now automatically summarizes articles and surfaces key points at the top. That newspaper is experiencing its own turmoil as billionaire owner Jeff Bezos pivots from a hands-off ownership to exerting more control and making its opinion section entirely pro-capitalism and “free markets.” The Post lost hundreds of thousands of subscribers since Bezos blocked the newspaper from endorsing Kamala Harris and has again bled subscribers following the changes to the opinion section. It was only a few years ago that the likes of Bezos appeared to be benevolent billionaires who would swoop in and save legacy media from the destruction wrought by the internet. We were naive to believe that. This was always going to be the problem with news organizations owned by billionaires with conflicting interests. Today, the name of the game is pleasing President Trump so he does not go on the attack against Amazon, and perhaps tosses Blue Origin some new contracts.

U.S. stocks plummeted again on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping 670 points as President Donald Trump’s newly imposed 25% tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico, and China prompted retaliatory measures from some of the affected countries. China imposed additional duties of up to 15% on certain U.S. products. Ottawa retaliated with 25% tariffs on $30 billion worth of U.S. goods starting Tuesday, rising to cover $125 billion of merchandise in 21 days. Canada’s provinces are taking their own actions, and irate citizens are boycotting U.S. products. As the day ended in New York, the Nasdaq Composite dipped by 0.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 670 points or 1.5%.

Title: How Trump’s Tariffs Are Ushering In A New World Order
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/cfo/2025/03/04/how-trumps-tariffs-are-ushering-in-a-new-world-order/

Today is the day: The sweeping 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada that President Donald Trump has been talking about since his term began are here. Whether or not they would actually start today was an open question until late Monday afternoon when Trump confirmed them, as well as an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, upping new tariffs on the U.S.’s third-largest trading partner to 20%. The announcement sent many key economic indicators way down. Stocks fell across the board, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq and S&P cratering. Chip maker Nvidia took an unusually deep tumble, with its stock falling more than 8.6%—though that can be partially attributed to how Chinese buyers are getting around export controls to get Nvidia’s powerful AI chips, according to a Wall Street Journal report. The across-the-board selloff continued Tuesday morning, with all indexes dropping more than 1.4% in the first hour of trading. The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow forecast, a constantly updated forecast of GDP growth based on real-time economic conditions, plummeted from more than 2% to -2.8% based on the tariff announcement. Analysts say that Trump is watching the stock market closely and may use it as an indicator to temper his policies. Forbes’ Sergei Klebnikov and Matt Schifrin write that the markets may be the only true check on Trump’s policies—the Republican majority Congress has so far bowed to his wishes with few questions, and many judicial rulings against Trump’s agenda have been appealed and largely unheeded so far. In his first term, Klebnikov and Schifrin write, Trump paid attention to the markets, signing a 2018 trade agreement with China after a tariff announcement caused the markets to fall 5% in one week. But Trump’s reaction may not be the same this week. After all, he’s been talking about tariffs since the campaign trail, calling himself the “Tariff Man” and proclaiming tariff “the most beautiful word in the dictionary.” A post on Truth Social yesterday tells farmers that they should get ready to export less because of the coming levies—“Have fun!” China immediately announced retaliatory tariffs and blacklisted some U.S. companies, while Canada introduced a slate of its own charges on the U.S. Target CEO Brian Cornell warned consumers will likely see higher prices this week, since the bulk of fruits and vegetables are imported from Mexico this time of year. But Trump is sure to trumpet tariffs and his economic plan at his address to Congress tonight. The reception—both from Congress and Americans watching—will be telling. And this is just one set: New tariffs on aluminum and steel imports and reciprocal tariffs on all countries are slated to go into effect next month. Even if it all goes away or is reduced, Trump's aggressive policy swings may not bode well for the economy as a whole. Forbes senior contributor Christian Weller wrote about the most recent Economic Policy Uncertainty Index, compiled by researchers from Northwestern University, Stanford University and the University of Chicago. Policy uncertainty leads to a slowing economy, with lower consumer sentiment and industrial production. In other words, certainty is a vital ingredient for economic growth. Since Trump’s election, the uncertainty index has increased by more than 66%. The way businesses operate is likely seeing a permanent change from Trump’s tariffs. Last week, I talked to Paul Johnson, executive director of the Gabelli Center for Global Security Analysis at Fordham University’s Gabelli School of Business, about what it means to business leaders. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. And a reminder that we’re seeking feedback from leaders to help compile Forbes’ next installment of the New Ivies—the public and private colleges that are graduating the most prepared and competitive young talent. Please share your experience in this survey. getty The saga of the Corporate Transparency Act continues. This week, the Treasury Department announced that only foreign companies need to comply with the beneficial ownership information reporting, writes Forbes’ Kelly Phillips Erb. President Trump praised the decision in a Truth Social post, saying the CTA reporting was an “outrageous and invasive” requirement. It’s not surprising Trump doesn’t like the law—he vetoed the bill that contained it in 2021. A bipartisan coalition in Congress overrode his veto. The law sought to shed some light on anonymous shell companies, and as written, required companies to disclose who controls it to the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. Since it became law, the CTA’s beneficial ownership information reporting requirement has been challenged in federal court cases, putting the requirement on hold, then allowing it to go forward. Before this announcement, the requirement was back, and FinCEN extended the reporting deadline to March 21. It’s unclear what will happen with the still-pending cases. Also unclear: Whether the Republican-majority Congress will object to the president unilaterally halting a bipartisan initiative. President Donald Trump. Since the campaign trail, Trump has said he will create a national cryptocurrency reserve. He announced it on Truth Social over the weekend, saying that the new “crypto strategic reserve” will have bitcoin and ethereum at its core, but will also include XRP, solana and ADA. The announcement builds on a January 23 executive order to create a working group to propose regulations for cryptocurrency and evaluate a “national digital asset stockpile.” However, many big names in crypto and tech didn’t like Trump’s weekend announcement. Forbes’ Derek Saul writes that Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong posted on X that the best option would be using only bitcoin to become the “successor to gold” for the government. Trump supporter and Palantir cofounder Joe Lonsdale said it’s “wrong to tax me for crypto bro schemes” and “not the proper, principled role of government” to finance a crypto reserve. And Jason Calacanis, who co-hosts the “All-In” Silicon Valley podcast with Trump’s “crypto czar” David Sacks, called the move the “Trump Pump” and called it “an insane grift.” A table at a job fair in Florida last year. While it hasn’t shown up yet in economic reports, major U.S. job losses are coming. Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger writes that retail closures at national chains Party City and Joann’s will bring 16,000 and 19,000 fewer jobs, respectively. Estée Lauder, Starbucks, Kohl’s and Walmart have also announced major layoffs. And outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported retail job cuts in January were 20% higher than a year ago. Massive job cuts are on the way in other sectors as well. Through Elon Musk’s federal spending slashing as part of the Department of Government Efficiency, tens of thousands of federal government employees have lost their jobs. The job slashing continues, with agencies reportedly offering employees up to $50,000 to voluntarily resign. Paul Johnson, executive director of the Gabelli Center for Global Security Analysis at Fordham University’s Gabelli School of Business. Trump’s tariffs are going from largely a threat to reality today, causing major changes for many businesses worldwide. Before most of them took effect, I talked to Paul Johnson, executive director of the Gabelli Center for Global Security Analysis at Fordham University’s Gabelli School of Business, about what businesses should be doing. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. How have tariff threats impacted businesses so far? Johnson: Tariffs increase prices. Prices will go up. If I’m a business leader, the odds are greater than zero that the tariffs will be put in place. When they do, I know that that product for me is going to go up in price. So if I am a prudent leader, I am out looking for alternative sources. The administration wants us to believe that’s a positive, so [businesses] will start shopping in the U.S. But a thoughtful leader's already been canvasing the planet for the lowest cost of that product. There’s lots of reasons you buy things, and most businesses are to some degree always on the lookout for a cheaper, better way to do things. That’s standard business practice. Now, all of a sudden, there’s a new administration and we’re talking tariffs. Everybody is starting to look for alternatives. If those exist in the U.S., that company supplier may benefit from that. But you have to ask yourself, well, why wasn’t the customer in this case already buying American? There’s so much uncertainty. I know that anything I import or anything I buy from somebody who imported it, the price is going up. That’s facts. Now I’m scrambling [to] see what our alternatives are. If it’s a U.S. solution, I suspect that that solution is already more expensive than the import. If the import goes up by a lot, then all of a sudden I may have no choice but to buy American. I don’t mean that as a negative, but I have no choice but to buy a more expensive product made in America. Business people are not paid to be patriotic. They’re paid to be efficient. Businesses likely have been looking at their supply chains and potential impacts for months because of what Trump has said about tariffs. Should they consider these changes as fixes for now, or is this the beginning of a new world order? Absolutely we have a new world order. Anybody who’s looking at the model—the 70 years post World War II—that’s gone. Dead. And I don’t know that we [will] ever recover it. There’s no question that the old rules have changed. Covid started it, and this is now accelerating it. What should companies do? At the board level, it should be a holistic review of the business. What is our value add? If your value add is that you were nothing more than an importer, that business has changed dramatically. If your business is delivering value in other ways, it’s time to reevaluate. It’s a great wake up call. It’s frustrating, there’s a lot of uncertainty, but in a sense it could be incredibly healthy. The smart ones are going to say, ‘Hold on a second, why are we in business? What is it we’re delivering to our customers? What is that value? What do they value? What's the relationship like?’ It doesn’t have to be an eight-month study. Let’s have this discussion: Where are we crossing borders one way or the other? Exporting or importing? Where are we affected on the demand side? Are we shipping outside the U.S.? Are we importing raw material? Are we importing finished goods or equipment? How important is that to our value add? Should we even be in that part of the business? Can we even replace that? Is there a domestic solution that would get you out of that? What advice would you give business leaders looking forward to the next six months? Freeze for a second. Reevaluate some other best practices. Check in with your customers and find out how they’re doing because they may be struggling a bit, and that’s going to come back to you. I would definitely look at my supply chain, where I’m vulnerable both financially and [with] availability, because not having a product is always frustrating to your customers. I would be a bit more cautious on any project that’s got a lot of uncertainty inherent in it. It might just slow down a little bit. I want to protect my balance sheet. I want to protect my current employees. I hate to say this, but you might not hire that extra employee yet. Say to your employees, ‘We’re just being a bit more cautious. I know everyone’s stressed. We appreciate it. This is temporary. We’re not trying to kill you.’ It is time to laser focus in this period of uncertainty. Some of that uncertainty will turn into risk. Some of it will turn into opportunity. The weirdest part is that you may actually become a better business.

Four of the five major tech companies represented at President Trump’s inauguration have seen their share prices decline in 2025, including Tesla, which has taken a 30% hit If, after seeing a who’s who of Silicon Valley executives at President Trump’s inauguration in January, you believed it was going to be the Year of Big Tech, you’d be wrong — at least so far. Instead, four of the five major tech companies represented at the inauguration — Amazon, Apple, Tesla and Alphabet, Google’s parent company — have seen their share prices take a noticeable hit to start 2025. Only Meta, who was represented by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, has seen its share price climb this year. Here’s how those companies have performed on Wall Street since the start of the year, by mid-morning on Tuesday: — Meta: up 4.7% — Apple: down 1.9% — Amazon: down 9.6% — Alphabet: down 11.8% — Tesla: down 30% Tesla, as seen above, has been particularly hard-hit in 2025. CEO Elon Musk has been spearheading the Department of Government Efficiency for President Trump, as both are aiming to cut at least $1 trillion from the federal bureaucracy. Musk’s time spent away from his electric car company has upset some investors, who are calling for him to spend more time on Tesla and less time on DOGE. Reports of softening sales in China have not helped, either, although Tesla bulls are pointing to revamped models, the expansion of its self-driving technology and the launch of its $20,000 Optimus robots as reasons to be optimistic. From a macro standpoint, the market has taken a downturn recently, with many analysts saying the tariffs imposed by President Trump have been a key driver of the dip. The Nasdaq, Dow Jones and S&P 500 were all down about 2% on Tuesday, a day after the president said he would be imposing tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico. The Wall Street slide for the major tech companies stands out, after Musk, Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Alphabet chief Sundar Pichai and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos literally stood behind the president on Jan. 20 in Washington, D.C. Many Trump fans who attended the inauguration told TheWrap they were skeptical of Big Tech’s sudden embrace of Trump, aside from Musk, whom the crowd overwhelmingly seemed to like. Now, it will be worth watching to see if investors remain skeptical of the market, or if they are “buying the dip” on these Big Tech stocks.

Title: The Uncomfortable Truth Behind Tesla’s Falling Stock Prices

Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily. Elon Musk has become as much the face of Donald Trump’s presidency as Trump himself. Musk speaks at Cabinet meetings, sits down with Sean Hannity as Trump’s equal, and takes reporters’ questions from the Oval Office. He walks around like he owns the place, not wearing a suit—now a big deal, apparently!—and letting his son use him as a human jungle gym as he stands a few steps away from where Trump sits. Musk has garnered lots of attention for this power move. Some is positive. Most is not. Tesla, his biggest company, has become the subject of widespread boycotting calls by his and Trump’s opponents. There are frequent protests outside of Tesla showrooms. Barely a day passes without the viral egging of a Cybertruck. Tesla owners are getting international press attention for flipping their cars at a loss just to get rid of them. “I’m selling the Nazi mobile,” one dissatisfied driver says. The social internet might create an outsized impression of how common those acts of resistance are, but they still seem at least reflective of a shift. Public approval of Musk’s government obliteration really is low, and disapproval of Tesla itself is higher than ever. Meanwhile, Tesla’s stock price is declining rapidly. Musk’s largest company lost 24 percent of its value in February. It was the stock’s second worst month ever, and then it fell another 3 percent on Monday, the first trading day of March. What a coincidence it would be if none of that had anything to do with the ever-growing, controversial public persona of its very famous chief executive. Big left-of-center social media accounts are celebrating their work: “Congrats, everyone—the Elon boycott is working!” a Bluesky post from a mysterious account with 800,000 followers reads. How much of that is wishful thinking by liberals desperate for a win, and how much is the anti-Musk resistance already notching wins? We know from recent history that Musk’s intense focus on non-Tesla projects can be a drag on Tesla’s stock. We also know that the stock can go back up rapidly without Musk dialing back his obnoxiousness or giving up his other projects. We do not know how much of the electric car company’s recent tanking owes to opposition to Musk personally and how much stems from Tesla’s wider business challenges, or how much those two things have to do with each other. In other words: Claiming that Tesla boycotts have hurt Musk any worse than a bee sting is speculative cope—but it doesn’t have to stay that way. The job, as Kobe Bryant once said, is not finished. People don’t fill out a questionnaire every time they sell Tesla stock, so we don’t know exactly what causes its price to go down. The evidence is strong, though, that Tesla shares trade down when the spotlight shines extra brightly on Musk paying attention to other things. Tesla’s stock began struggling more or less concurrently with Musk launching his bid for Twitter in the spring of 2022. The stock had a very bad year even compared to other American stocks, and Musk’s selling of Tesla shares (and an aborted plan to use Tesla shares as collateral for his bank loans) aggravated the situation. Musk is always very famous and always known to have lots of balls in the air, but he’s not usually as famous as he is right now. To the extent that Americans are aware of what his “government efficiency” initiative is up to, the polling says they are skeptical of it and of Musk specifically. A team of Wedbush Securities analysts, who are bullish on Tesla overall, put it this way in a Feb. 24 note to clients: “The worry of the Street is that Musk dedicating so much time (even more than we expected) to DOGE takes away from his time at Tesla in such a crucial moment and year for the company.” The investment firm thinks Tesla will manage through its Musk-related branding problems and its stock will rebound, but it calls a spade a spade. Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency and Trump alliance “clearly could alienate some consumers to move away from the Tesla brand.” But there are problems with the idea that anti-Musk sentiment is driving Tesla into the ground. The stock had a miserable February but remains up nearly 40 percent over the past six months. Trump’s victory was a win for Tesla’s stock. The day after the election, investment research firm CFRA found that Tesla and Musk “are perhaps the biggest winners from the election result, and we believe Trump’s victory will help expedite regulatory approval of the company’s autonomous driving technology.” Any gains the boycotters have made so far have not outweighed the benefit to Tesla’s stock from having its CEO more or less running the American government. After all, this self-serving domination of our politics is the very genesis of the protests. There is also the distinct possibility that Tesla’s stock just goes up anyway even if Musk never changes his behavior and liberals never bought a Tesla or rode in one when ordering an Uber again. Musk’s obsession with Twitter dragged the stock for a while, but then the car company’s stock shot up to market-beating heights in 2023 and 2024. It’s not as if Musk quieted down or became a less controversial public figure the past two years. Quite the opposite. Tesla’s biggest problems at the end of 2022 were not just about Musk’s reputation, but headwinds in the electric car market and broader economy. The company addressed those worries to Wall Street’s satisfaction, at least for a time. There’s a fair case that this time will be different, though. Musk is now very popular with Republicans, which would be better for Tesla if Republicans bought electric vehicles. But they don’t, perhaps because conservative media and politicians have spent years denigrating EVs whenever possible. Meanwhile, Democrats do buy electric vehicles but, I think it’s safe to say, will increasingly look for EV vendors who are not Elon Musk. Again, that would be less of a problem for Tesla if Republican adoration of Musk converted to more GOP voter enthusiasm for electric cars. “Could Elon Musk move that troublesome GOP needle?” asked Republican political operative Mike Murphy in a February report accompanying a new poll on the issue. “With his hostility to EV consumer subsidies, and the unwelcome market competition for Tesla that it helps create, the early answer is probably not. Elon seems focused on other things now and helping break down GOP hostility to EVs appears to be low on his priority list.” Tesla has other challenges elsewhere. Sales have been bad lately in Europe, where Musk has also done a bunch of political meddling. Increased Chinese competition for EV market share in that country was likely the biggest problem for Tesla’s stock two years ago, and the company is still losing ground there. The company underperformed in new car deliveries in the fourth quarter of last year, before DOGE existed or Musk cosplayed as Benito Mussolini on a podium on Inauguration Day. Federal regulators launched their latest probe into Tesla self-driving technology in the last few days of the Biden administration. Does the federal government still regulate Tesla in any serious way? Maybe not, but other countries reserve their rights to do so, and every news story with the words “investigation” and “self-driving” is bad press. This blend of events leaves the anti-Musk, anti-Tesla forces in a place of opportunity. While it’s a stretch to say that protests and boycott calls were responsible for all of the stock’s drop in February, or even most of it, it’s implausible that they’ve had no effect on investor confidence in the company. Musk is the face of Tesla, and he has polarized himself against the people who are most likely to buy his company’s primary product. That may not hurt Musk in the long run. He could find more customers elsewhere, or he could persuade huge swaths of Republicans that they are saving America by purchasing his electric cars. Moreover, even if huge numbers of people dislike Musk, many of them may not shun Tesla as a result. The link between disdain and action may not form, in the same way that people who don’t like slaughterhouses still eat steak. A recent observation by New York City–based climate reporter Kendra Pierre-Louis on Bluesky has stuck with me: “I went to the tesla protest for a thing I’m working on and I talked to several onlookers - not protesters - and asked them what they knew about Elon and Doge and I’m telling you people don’t know.” Creating that link in a collective mass of minds requires relentless news coverage and reaching millions of people who do not consume a lot of political news. Right now, people are showing up at Tesla locations and shaming Tesla car owners in an effort to build that attention. It might not be enough, but it’s a more effective and satisfying plan to counter Musk than anything that has so far emerged from most Democrats with power.

Title: FTC hit by layoffs in consumer protection & antitrust offices

DOGE, run by Elon Musk, has been primarily responsible for carrying out this task. Now, for the first time, the FTC has laid off workers from sections such as consumer protection and antitrust. As reported by The Verge, “at least” a dozen probationary staffers at the Federal Trade Commission were laid off last week. The layoffs affected both the Bureau of Consumer Protection and the Bureau of Competition offices. Until now, the FTC had remained safe from government staff cuts. However, it seems that the measures have finally reached the organization. That said, the report mentions that they could not confirm that the layoffs are directly related to DOGE. Donald Trump authorized the creation of the Department of Government Efficiency after receiving Musk’s idea. Both believed that government organizations have way more employees than they actually need. So, DOGE is in charge of trying to solve that situation. Trump was convinced by the downsizing work Musk did at X (FKA Twitter). There have been recent layoffs at the FTC before, but these were not caused by DOGE either. The department affected at that time was the internal equal opportunity office. This was a result of the executive order signed by Donald Trump banning DEI programs in government organizations. Big tech companies, such as Google, Meta, and Amazon, have also followed this mandate. “DEI is over at the FTC,” said Republican Andrew Ferguson, FTC Chair, at the time. The National Treasury Employees are aware of the layoffs at the FTC. However, they do not know the real scope of the changes underway within the agency. Its website now includes a notice with the steps that the laid-off employees could take now. The Trump administration is also preparing a staff move at the FTC in Washington. They will now occupy the building formerly occupied by the dismantled USAID, Bloomberg reports. Copyright ©2025 Android Headlines. All Rights Reserved.

The Trump administration's long-promised tariffs took hold on Tuesday. U.S. stocks tumbled on Tuesday after the Trump administration’s long-promised tariffs took effect. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 670 points, or 1.5%; while the S&P 500 fell 1.2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq ticked down 0.3%. The policy taxes imports from Mexico, Canada and China -- the three largest trading partners of the United States -- meaning that it could raise prices for everything from gasoline to avocados to iPhones. Shares of retail giant Target fell 3% on Tuesday, following an earnings release from the company that cited "tariff uncertainty" as a potential impediment for the business. Walmart's stock price dipped about 2.5% on Tuesday, while Amazon shares inched down 0.6%. Shares of Best Buy plummeted more than 13%. The sharp drop came after Best Buy CEO told analysts that price increases are "highly likely" as a result of the tariffs. Higher costs for car production could also pose a challenge for U.S. automakers, many of which depend on a supply chain closely intertwined with Mexico and Canada. Shares of Ford tumbled nearly 3% on Tuesday, while General Motors dropped about 4.5%. Stellantis -- the parent company of Jeep and Chrysler -- saw shares decline more than 4%. Tesla, the electric carmaker led by Elon Musk, saw its stock price drop about 4.5%. The far-reaching losses extend a market slide that began on Monday afternoon when Trump affirmed plans to impose a fresh round of tariffs. Trump stuck to a March 4 start date for 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, as well as 10% tariff on Chinese goods -- which, as of Tuesday, rises to 20%, per an amended executive order. Tariffs of this magnitude would likely increase prices paid by U.S. shoppers, since importers typically pass along a share of the cost of those higher taxes to consumers, experts said. The duties also raise input costs for manufacturers that import raw materials. In addition to Tesla and Amazon, the tariffs appeared to impact some of the other so-called "Magnificent Seven," a group of large tech firms that helped drive stock market gains in recent years. Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, suffered a 2% drop in its stock price. Apple, which makes some of its products in China, fell nearly 1%. Shares of Microsoft defied the trend, however, remaining essentially unchanged on Tuesday. Chipmaker Nvidia, which relies on semiconductors from Taiwan but also imports some materials from Mexico, saw shares increase about 1.5%. Alphabet's stock price climbed about 2%.

Title: Bitcoin’s ‘KISS Of Death’? Arthur Hayes Warns Of Recession Before Surge
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-kiss-of-death-arthur-hayes-recession/
Time Published: 2025-03-04T14:00:05Z

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. In his latest blog post, titled “KISS of Death,” former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes outlines a provocative thesis on the trajectory of Bitcoin and broader financial markets under the renewed presidency of Donald Trump. Hayes—who has long held bullish views on crypto—argues that a convergence of fiscal and monetary policies could catapult Bitcoin’s price to as high as $1 million during the Trump 2.0 era, but only after a period of recession-driven turmoil. Hayes’s framework revolves around the “KISS” principle—Keep It Simple, Stupid—urging market participants to stay focused on the core driver of asset prices: liquidity. Rather than overreacting to sensational headlines, he contends that one should watch for shifts in the quantity and price of money (i.e., how much credit is created and at what interest rate). “One day, you buy and then quickly sell after digesting the next headline,” Hayes warns. “The market chops you in the process, and your stack quickly diminishes.” He recommends sticking to a simpler outlook: If the U.S. government prints significant amounts of money at lower rates, risk assets like Bitcoin can surge. A key premise of Hayes’s analysis is that President Trump, a “real estate showman” by background, will debt finance his “America First” agenda rather than embrace austerity. Hayes contrasts Trump with Andrew Mellon—Treasury Secretary under Herbert Hoover—who once allegedly declared: “Liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate farmers, liquidate real estate. It will purge the rottenness out of the system.” Hayes argues that such a stance would be political suicide for a president seeking to be viewed as the 21st-century Franklin D. Roosevelt rather than Hoover. As Hayes puts it, “Trump wants to be considered the greatest President ever” and is therefore inclined to loosen credit conditions rather than tighten them. Hayes highlights Trump’s unconventional maneuver to slash federal spending and potentially trigger a recession, thereby forcing the Federal Reserve to respond with rate cuts and fresh liquidity. The newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by high-profile entrepreneur Elon Musk, is portrayed as an aggressive effort to expose fraud and reduce waste in government programs. Hayes cites DOGE’s claims that Social Security payments may be going out to deceased individuals or unverified identities, supposedly costing hundreds of billions—or even a trillion—dollars a year. “Trump and DOGE are firing hundreds of thousands of government employees,” Hayes notes, referencing media reports citing elevated jobless claims in the Washington, D.C., area. By cutting federal budgets so drastically and so quickly, Trump could—in Hayes’s words—“cause a recession or convince the market that one is right around the corner.” Once signs of recession appear, Hayes predicts Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will have little choice but to cut rates, end quantitative tightening (QT), and potentially restart quantitative easing (QE) to avert a widespread financial crisis. Powell, whom Hayes dubs a “turncoat traitor” (a reference to the Fed’s past rate cut during Kamala Harris’s campaign), is nonetheless bound by the Fed’s mandate to maintain economic stability. Hayes points to $2.08 trillion in US corporate debt and $10 trillion in US Treasury debt that must roll over in 2025. If the economy slows, rolling that debt over at high interest rates becomes unfeasible. In that scenario, the Fed’s only salvation is fresh money creation and lower rates. Hayes calculates that a full Fed response—encompassing several policy shifts—could result in as much as $2.74 to $3.24 trillion in new liquidity: Dropping the Federal Funds Rate from 4.25% to 0% could be equivalent to roughly $1.7 trillion of money printing, according to Hayes’s estimates. Currently, the Fed conducts $60 billion per month in QT. If QT ends by April 2025, Hayes sees a $540 billion liquidity injection relative to prior expectations. Additional Treasury purchases by the Fed or US commercial banks (the latter aided by a relaxation of the Supplemental Leverage Ratio) might add another $500 billion to $1 trillion in dollar credit. He compares this to the $4 trillion in stimulus measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given that Bitcoin jumped roughly 24x from its 2020 lows to 2021 highs in response to that liquidity wave, Hayes says even a more conservative 10x multiple could be in play. “For those who ask how we get to $1 million in Bitcoin during the Trump presidency, this is how,” he proclaims, linking massive credit creation with a sharply higher BTC price. Despite his bullish long-term forecast, Hayes believes Bitcoin’s immediate outlook may be rocky. Hayes sees potential for Bitcoin to revisit the $70,000 to $80,000 range in the short-term—levels that are markedly above the prior cycle’s all-time high but still below the current market. “If Bitcoin leads the market on the downside, it will also do so on the upside,” Hayes writes, positing that BTC often bottoms out before traditional equities. He cites the significant run-up to $110,000 around mid-January (Trump’s inauguration timeline) followed by a pullback to $78,000 in late February. “Bitcoin is screaming that a liquidity crisis is nigh, even though the U.S. stock market indices are still near their all-time highs,” he notes. “I firmly believe we are still in a bull cycle, and as such, the bottom at worst will be the previous cycle’s all-time high of $70,000,” Hayes says, underscoring his conviction that any major dips are opportunities to accumulate rather than panic-sell. In Hayes’s view, the “Kiss of Death” is not about Bitcoin’s demise but about the outdated fiat system struggling to contain spiraling debt loads and political brinkmanship. He argues that the short-term chaos in traditional markets—triggered by DOGE-driven spending cuts and a hesitant Fed—will ultimately pave the way for a new round of monetary expansion. The bottom line? Hayes insists that staying focused on liquidity is the best strategy: “Let politicians do politician things, stay in your lane, and buy Bitcoin.” At press time, BTC traded at $83,725.

Title: Nvidia, Tesla, Target, Chipotle, and Super Micro Computer: Stocks to watch today

U.S. stocks fell on Tuesday as President Donald Trump’s newly imposed 25% tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico, and China prompted retaliatory measures from some of the affected countries. China imposed additional duties of up to 15% on certain U.S. products. Ottawa retaliated with 25% tariffs on $30 billion worth of U.S. goods starting Tuesday, rising to cover $125 billion of merchandise in 21 days. Canada’s provinces are taking their own actions, and irate citizens are boycotting U.S. products. As the day ended in New York, the Nasdaq Composite dipped by 0.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 670 points or 1.5%. The S&P 500, which had its worst day of the year on Monday, dropped 1.2%. Here are stocks to watch on Tuesday. Best Buy (BBY+0.14%) stock dropped after the electronics retailer reported fourth-quarter results that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations. However, CEO Corie Barry indicated that prices for U.S. consumers are likely to increase due to President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG-3.57%) shares declined due to concerns about the restaurant chain’s dependence on avocados, with 50% of its supply coming from Mexico. As tariffs on imports from Mexico take effect, investors are worried about the potential impact on the company. The company has said its diverse supply chain could help it withstand tariffs. Nvidia (NVDA+0.45% stock fell as concerns mounted over AI-related spending and the impact of new tariffs. The chip manufacturer seems to be cautious about limitations on the export of AI chips. Nvidia stock plunged Monday after Singapore said it’s investigating whether servers shipped to Malaysia containing chips barred from China ended up in the mainland. Super Micro Computer (SMCI-0.28%, a key player in AI hardware, also declined in the morning, mirroring Nvidia’s slump. Investors are uncertain about how Trump’s tariffs could shape the future of the AI industry. However, the stock recovered in the afternoon by gaining 10%. Shares of Target (TGT-0.16%) were down as it beat Wall Street’s earnings expectations. For the fourth quarter, the company reported revenue of $30.92 billion, about $2.41 earnings per share. But Target said it expects a “meaningful” decline in first-quarter profits compared to the same period last year. The cautious outlook stems from “ongoing consumer uncertainty,” weaker sales in February, and mounting concerns over the impact of tariffs. President Donald Trump’s new tariffs on imported goods from Canada, Mexico, and China — which together accounted for almost 42% of total imports in 2024 — went into effect early Tuesday. Tesla (TSLA-0.21% stock declined due to rising fears about tariffs among investors. It is likely that the new tariff will raise car prices. Moreover, a day after Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas designated Tesla stock as a “Top Pick” in the U.S. automotive sector and raised the price target, Bank of America reduced its price target for the stock from $490 to $380 while maintaining a Neutral rating.

Title: Ray-Ban and Meta just teased new limited-edition smart glasses – but they'll be in frustratingly short supply

Ray-Ban and Meta have another 3,600 pairs of clear specs on the way When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Meta has announced that new “limited-edition Ray-Ban Meta glasses” are set to land this month, with promo images suggesting they’ll be transparent just like the previous limited-edition design it launched – but expect them to be even harder to get your hands on. Beyond a look at the Ray-Ban logo on a clear-ish frame that shows off the hardware inside the smart specs, we know relatively little about the design. The previous clear frames used the Wayfarer frame type, but this new run could get the Skyler or Headliner design, which have more rounded lenses, although our money is on a bold new design like the frames A$AP Rocky – Ray-Ban’s new Creative Director – just unveiled at Milan Fashion Week – which would tally with the “straight from the runway” comment in Meta’s promotional material for the new limited-edition specs. We also don’t know if these specs will come with the same limited-edition black case as the previous edition, instead of the standard brown, though we hope they do. Adding to the list of unknown is that Meta has yet to reveal a price. Given that the previous limited model cost $429 – which is about $100 more than the standard translucent frames – we expect this new design will also be pricier than standard Ray-Ban smart glasses, and perhaps even pricier than the previous limited design. We say that because while Meta’s last limited run consisted of 7,500 pairs, this time it’s only making 3,600 – at least, that’s what '0001/3600' printed on the frames in the promo image on its website is suggesting. Given the even more limited supply, Meta may choose to bump the price up, so if you’re keen to pick up a pair for yourself you’ll want to act fast when they drop. There's no precise release date to mark on your calendars, though there is a 'Notify me' button on the website if you want to get an update when the glasses go live –just be prepared to go home empty handed. Scalpers are showing that they’re still in full force in 2025 by ruining limited drops for tech, and there’s a good chance they’ll strike again here. There may also be scammers around looking to take advantage of the hype if stock does run dry – so be careful buying glasses claiming to be the limited edition Ray-Bans from unofficial stores and resellers.

Title: USA Imposes New Tariffs On Canada, Mexico & China, Including On Comics
URL: https://bleedingcool.com/comics/usa-imposes-new-tariffs-on-canada-mexico-china-including-on-comics/
Time Published: 2025-03-04T11:24:09Z

Posted in: Comics, Comics Publishers, Current News, DC Comics, Fantagraphics, Marvel Comics, Vault | Tagged: canada, tariffs The USA imposes new tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, and yes, that includes the printing, distribution and selling of comic books. Since American President Donald Trump paused the threatened taxes and tariffs against American importers of Canadian and Mexican goods earlier in the year, and importers from China got away with just a 10% tariff, the fact that this was a delay rather than a cessation was an inconvenient truth that many tried to dismiss. Tariffs weren't mentioned much at the recent ComicsPRO retailer summit. Surely a deal could be done in time? But today, it is no longer impossible to ignore the fact that the USA imposed 25% tariffs across the board against Canada and Mexico and increased the China tariff to 20%. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau issued a retaliatory statement saying that "Canada will not let this unjustified decision go unanswered. Should American tariffs come into effect tonight, Canada will, effective 12:01 a.m. EST tomorrow, respond with 25 per cent tariffs against $155 billion of American goods – starting with tariffs on $30 billion worth of goods immediately and tariffs on the remaining $125 billion on American products in 21 days' time. Our tariffs will remain in place until the U.S. trade action is withdrawn, and should U.S. tariffs not cease, we are in active and ongoing discussions with provinces and territories to pursue several non-tariff measures. While we urge the U.S. administration to reconsider their tariffs, Canada remains firm in standing up for our economy, our jobs, our workers, and for a fair deal. Because of the tariffs imposed by the U.S., Americans will pay more for groceries, gas, cars, and potentially lose thousands of jobs. Tariffs will disrupt an incredibly successful trading relationship. They will violate the very trade agreement that was negotiated by President Trump in his last term." China has imposed a 15 per cent tariff on imported chicken, wheat, corn, and cotton, while a 10 per cent tariff will be imposed on sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, aquatic products, fruits, vegetables, and dairy products. According to the US Department of Agriculture, China accounted for 17 percent of American agricultural exports in 2023. Beijing also placed 25 American firms under export and investment restrictions on national security grounds. Most comic books read in America are printed in Canada, close to the paper mill logging forests, and most large collections are printed in China. In January, Gina Gagliano at the Comics Journal cited many publishers on the issues they are facing regarding taxes and tariffs at the border. Eric Reynolds, VP and Associate Publisher at Fantagraphics, said, "Even if we could find printers domestically who could do a lot of the higher-end, hardcover visual art books that we do, they would cost roughly twice as much or more as the same book would cost to print overseas, our options in terms of paper and printing/binding would be limited, and the quality would likely suffer as well… I read somewhere that there hasn't been a new paper mill built in the U.S. in something like 35 years and that the number of existing paper mills is a small fraction of U.S. printing's 20th-century heyday." Avi Ehrlich, the publisher of Silver Sprocket, said, "The decision to print overseas isn't just about cost (though they are cheaper), but really about quality and options. We haven't been able to find domestic printers able to offer the quality and options available from printers overseas, such as the high quality interesting paper stocks, binding options, and unique foils that make our books stand out. We used to print primarily in Canada and finally moved most of our printing overseas after a series of very frustrating quality issues and delays due to North American printers simply not having all of the resources available under one roof to efficiently and correctly make books with the quality we want to be producing." Josh O'Neill, publisher of Beehive Books, said, "I just know for our odd business, there's no manufacturing capacity to do books like these in America, and that capacity could not be easily rebuilt. It's less about labor costs than the machines and expertise just not existing to do high end book publishing. Printing overseas is often quicker than domestically, even with the long shipping times, because printing domestically often means one printer handling the covers, another handling a special cover effect, and a third printing the text block (inside pages), which introduces so many extra opportunities for mistakes and delays as the project is moved between different printers." Leyla Aker, Director of Publishing at Square Enix Manga and Books, said, "Aside from tariffs on finished books printed in other countries, the other area of concern would be tariffs on paper, which would have the potential to affect titles printed in the U.S. as well." And Damien Wassel, Publisher of Vault Comics, said "While this environment may benefit American printers, it will harm smaller American publishers disproportionately in relation to larger publishers. Print costs are extremely scale sensitive. Publishers who are producing work with larger print runs will still be able to find margin without making significant changes to their publishing operations or strategies. Smaller publishers simply will not have that luxury." When the plans were initially announced, Bleeding Cool looked at the likely impact on monthly superhero comics, and those issues haven't gone away. They are expected to have a greater impact on DC Comics than Marvel, as DC is more likely to print in Canada, though both have long-term printing contracts. We also looked at how Bad Idea Comics' recent Hank Howard Pizza Detective campaign could result in a two hundred thousand loss for the publisher due to the tariffs. Alien Books' Matias Timarchi told us that the tariffs were likely going to lead to an increase in the price of single-issue comic books by at least a dollar. and that this could be the end of the $4.99 comic book and that they had changed everything about their plans to relaunch the Valiant Universe. However, Bleeding Cool also got the scoop that Transcontinental Inc., the biggest comic book printer in North America, based across Canada, has made the move to cover the cost of tariffs on the comics they print for ninety days after the tariffs have been imposed. That effectively puts a three-month delay on the impact these taxes and tariffs are going to have on comic book publishers such as DC Comics, Marvel, Image and many much smaller companies while taking a massive whack in the process. It is not an exaggeration to say that Transcontinental may have just saved a number of comic publishers and comic book stores from going bust with one move. Now, obviously, not even a printer as big as Transcontinental Inc. can indefinitely subsidise the American comic book market. But three months may be enough to keep the plates spinning until a more permanent solution can be found—or at least a less temporary one. The US stock market fell significantly after – even during – the announcement. But not everyone sees the impact of tariffs so badly. Comic book retailer Regan Clem of Summit Comics & Games in Michigan has a different take from wider picture, citing stories from Reuters saying "Honda to produce next Civic in Indiana, not Mexico, due to US tariffs" and from the AP "Apple announces $500 billion investment in US amid tariff threats", stating "I don't think these stories are getting any attention. Bringing jobs to American workers is caring about the working class" and adding "I'm old enough to remember when Democrats were for tariffs and protecting American jobs." However, Eric Reynolds of Fantagraphics states, "I wish there was an infrastructure here that tariffs would kickstart, but there just isn't. It's not like there are paper mills and printing presses just waiting to have the lights turned back on. Even if the tariffs spurred a long-term investment in paper and printing, with new mills and presses being built, it would take years, and a lot of publishers may well go out of business before that bears fruit. It could be quite disastrous." Enjoyed this? Please share on social media!

Title: Vodafone and AST SpaceMobile Establish Joint Venture for European Satellite Mobile Services

SatCo aims to deliver seamless satellite-based mobile broadband services to mobile network operators (MNOs) across Europe, ensuring full geographic coverage. The new entity will exclusively distribute AST SpaceMobile's satellite capabilities through a comprehensive service offering that includes network management and operations, all managed from a European-based center leveraging Vodafone's engineering expertise. As part of its operations, SatCo will establish a network of ground stations to provide backhaul connectivity between MNOs and AST SpaceMobile's low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite network. This initiative is expected to bolster European digital sovereignty, as AST SpaceMobile's satellites function as remote radio heads while core network control remains with each respective MNO. Under Vodafone's co-ownership, SatCo will further enhance this sovereignty with its own backhaul capabilities and European-based leadership. "Vodafone's space-based mobile broadband will mean our customers can stay connected, wherever they are. Our new satellite company will be able to offer this pioneering technology to other European mobile operators through a turnkey service that combines Vodafone's leading network and engineering with AST SpaceMobile's 'antennas in the sky,'" said Margherita Della Valle, Vodafone Group CEO. Abel Avellan, Founder, Chairman, and CEO of AST SpaceMobile, added, "Together with Vodafone, we are poised to accelerate our commercialization plans across all of Europe, making true mobile broadband from space a reality." On January 27, 2025, Vodafone successfully conducted the world's first space-based mobile video call using its newly launched BlueBird satellites, demonstrating its commitment to providing uninterrupted mobile coverage for its 340 million customers across 15 countries, as well as its network partners operating in 45 additional markets. Vodafone plans to launch commercial space-based mobile broadband services across Europe in 2025 and 2026. AST SpaceMobile's unique satellite technology will enable direct mobile broadband connectivity to standard 4G and 5G smartphones without requiring software updates or specialized devices, seamlessly integrating with Vodafone's terrestrial networks. Satellite connectivity will serve as a crucial supplement to existing mobile and fixed infrastructure, ensuring continuous coverage in remote locations such as mountainous regions and offshore areas while also enhancing network resilience across Europe. In addition, Vodafone, AST SpaceMobile, and the University of Malaga have collaborated to establish a new space and terrestrial mobile broadband research and validation hub. Supported by the Spanish Space Agency, the facility will be based at Vodafone's Innovation Centre in Malaga and is set to commence operations by summer 2025. This hub will focus on developing integrated LEO satellite and terrestrial broadband solutions. Further expanding its European footprint, AST SpaceMobile has also inaugurated a 5,600-square-meter manufacturing and office facility in Barcelona, aimed at boosting production capacity and advancing the testing of its satellite and telecom technologies.

(Photo by Noushad Thekkayil/NurPhoto via Getty Images). Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock experienced a decline of over 3% on Monday, March 3, amid a broader Wall Street downturn. This sell-off was triggered by President Donald Trump’s tariff confirmation, which resulted in the Dow Jones falling 1.8% and the S&P 500 dropping 2.1%, marking its worst day of the year to date. Our take on market crash risk right now has more details on tariffs and its impact on the broader market. At its current levels of $205, AMZN stock looks attractive but volatile — making it a tricky pick to buy. We believe there is minimal cause for concern with AMZN stock, which makes it attractive but highly sensitive to adverse events as its current valuation is very high. We arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of AMZN stock with its operating performance over the recent years as well as its current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of Amazon.com along key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a very strong operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below. However, if you seek upside with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, AMZN stock looks expensive compared to the broader market. • Amazon.com has a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 4.0 vs. a figure of 3.1 for the S&P 500 • Additionally, the company's price-to-operating income (P/EBIT) ratio is 41.4 compared to 24.4 for S&P 500 • And, it has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 22.3 vs. the benchmark’s 24.4 Amazon.com’s Revenues have seen notable growth over recent years. • Amazon.com has seen its top line grow at an average rate of 14.3% over the last 3 years (vs. 9.8% for S&P 500) • Its revenues have grown 11.9% from $554 billion to $620 billion in the last 12 months (vs. change of 5.6% for S&P 500) • Also, its quarterly revenues grew 11.0% to $159 billion in the most recent quarter from $143 billion a year ago (vs. 7.2% change for S&P 500) Amazon.com’s profit margins are around the median level for companies in the Trefis coverage universe. • Amazon.com’s Operating Income over the last four quarters was $61 billion, which represents a moderate Operating Margin of 9.8% (vs. 12.6% for S&P 500) • Amazon.com’s Operating Cash Flow (OCF) over this period was $113 billion, pointing to a moderate OCF-to-Sales Ratio of 18.2% (vs. 14.4% for S&P 500) Amazon.com's balance sheet looks strong. • Amazon.com’s Debt figure was $135 billion at the end of the most recent quarter, while its market capitalization is $2.2 trillion (as of March 3, 2025). This implies a strong Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 5.4% (vs. 19.7% for S&P 500). [Note: A lower Debt-to-Equity Ratio is desirable] • Cash (including cash equivalents) makes up $101 billion of the $625 billion in Total Assets for Amazon.com. This yields a strong Cash-to-Assets Ratio of 15.1% (vs. 14.1% for S&P 500) AMZN stock has been more resilient than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. Worried about the impact of a market crash on AMZN stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. • AMZN stock fell 52.0% from a high of $170.40 on 3 January 2022 to $81.82 on 28 December 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500. • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by Feb. 2, 2024. • Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $242.06 on Feb. 4, 2025, and currently trades at around $205. • AMZN stock fell 22.7% from a high of $108.51 on 19 February 2020 to $83.83 on 12 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500. • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by April 14, 2020. • AMZN stock fell 65.3% from a high of $5.04 on Oct. 23, 2007, to $1.75 on 20 November 2008, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500. • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by Oct. 23, 2009.

As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

The Blue Ghost 1 lander's performance was bolstered by Rocket Lab's advanced software, which provides critical functions such as commanding, telemetry processing, autonomous sequencing, attitude determination, guidance, navigation, control, and fault protection. These capabilities ensured mission success across all operational phases, from launch to lunar touchdown. Rocket Lab's Mission Operations Center in Littleton, Colorado, operated as a remote and backup control hub for Firefly's primary operations base in Texas. Throughout the mission, Rocket Lab's spacecraft operations team collaborated closely with Firefly's Blue Ghost operations team in both Colorado and Texas. Their responsibilities included orbit determination, maneuver planning, command generation, and continuous monitoring of the lander's guidance, navigation, and control systems to ensure a smooth journey and landing. In addition to software support, Rocket Lab contributed three high-efficiency solar power assemblies, mounted on the lander's sides and top deck. These systems provided a total of 400 W of power, sustaining operations for the mission's 1,470-hour duration. "Congratulations to the Firefly team for the successful landing of the Blue Ghost 1 mission, a remarkable accomplishment achieved by few," said Kyle Andringa, Rocket Lab's Senior Director Space Systems Software.

(NYSE:TIXT), Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), and ModivCare, Inc. (NASDAQ: MODV). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. TELUS International (Cda) Inc. (NYSE:TIXT) Class Period: February 16, 2023 - August 1, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: March 31, 2025 The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants allegedly failed to disclose to investors: (1) the Company’s AI Data Solutions offerings required the cannibalization of its higher-margin offerings; (2) that Telus International’s declining profitability was tied to the Company’s drive to develop AI capabilities; (3) that Telus International’s shift toward AI put greater pressure on the Company’s margins than previously disclosed; and (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. For more information on the TELUS International class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/TIXT Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) Class Period: November 2, 2022 - December 19, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: March 25, 2025 The Complaint alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Novo Nordisk’s projected successful outcome of Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1,” while avoiding discussions centered around dosage tolerability; (2) Novo Nordisk’s repeated optimistic claims that CagriSema would achieve at least 25% weight loss in the REDEFINE-1 study fell short of reality; and (3) the utilization of the “flexible protocol” limited the study’s ability to effectively provide weight loss data on the dosage tested, suggesting either that tolerability was significantly worse than anticipated, resulting in patients titrating down their dosages to avoid complications, or that the patient selection process was rushed, leading to the onboarding of patients that did not desire to even achieve the 25% weight loss Novo Nordisk sought to demonstrate. For more information on the Novo Nordisk class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/NVO Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) Class Period: September 28, 2023 - December 18, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: March 10, 2025 The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants allegedly made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) demand for Micron's products in consumer markets, especially the Company's NAND products, had significantly deteriorated; (ii) accordingly, Defendants had overstated the extent to which demand for Micron's products had recovered, particularly in consumer markets and for its NAND products, and/or had overstated the sustainability of demand for such products, as well as the normalization of inventory for such products; and (iii) as a result, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. For more information on the Micron class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/MU ModivCare, Inc. (NASDAQ: MODV) Class Period: November 3, 2022 - September 15, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: March 31, 2025 The Class Action alleges that, during the Class Period, Defendants made misleading statements and omissions regarding the ability of its contracts to stabilize cash flow. As the alleged truth about ModivCare's business reached the market, the price of ModivCare's stock suffered significant declines, harming investors. For example, on September 16, 2024, before market hours, ModivCare filed a press release on a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission, titled "Modivcare Provides Financial Update." Therein, the Company revised its 2024 Adjusted EBITDA guidance range from $185-$195 million to $170-$180 million, "primarily due to NEMT segment pricing accommodations made to strategically retain and expand key customer relationships." On this news, the Company's stock price fell $1.40 or nearly 10%, from $14.12 per share on September 15, 2024, to close at $12.72 per share on September 16, 2024, on unusually high trading volume.

Title: Liquid Promises, Illiquid Reality: Navigating the New Frontier of ETFs

Time Published: 2025-03-04T00:36:11Z

In the investment world, there’s an old saying: “There’s no such thing as a free lunch.” Yet the latest crop of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offering both daily liquidity and exposure to illiquid assets might seem to promise just that—a financial equivalent of eating decadent cheesecake without gaining an ounce. Alternately: we keep waiting for The Wizard to save us. The investment industry has traditionally maintained strict guardrails between liquid public markets and illiquid private investments. This separation wasn’t arbitrary—it reflected a fundamental reality that illiquid investments, by their very nature, cannot be quickly converted to cash without significant price concessions. Regulations limiting illiquid investments in publicly traded funds weren’t designed to deprive “regular” investors of opportunities, but rather to protect them from risks they might not fully comprehend or be equipped to handle. We’ve been here before. History provides sobering lessons. In some cases, arrogance, overconfidence, and groupthink led to stunning levels of concentration in portfolios. The Fairholme Fund today has 74% of its portfolio in a single company, St. Joe. Bruce Berkowitz was Morningstar manager of the decade for 2000-10 but they dropped coverage of the fund in 2021, giving it a score of 100+ on their risk gauge, and note that its category rank has been either in the top 1% or bottom 1% of its peer group for seven of the past eight years. The Sequoia Fund not only sunk 36% of its portfolio in a single sketchy stock, Valeant Pharmaceuticals, but its public statements began parroting the Valeant CEO’s. We reported “the dark version of the Sequoia narrative” in 2016: Goldfarb, abetted by an analyst, became obsessed about Valeant and crushed any internal dissent. Mr. Poppe, nominally Mr. Goldfarb’s peer, wouldn’t or couldn’t stop the disaster. “All the directors had repeatedly expressed concern” over the size of the Valeant stake and the decision to double down on it. Mr. Poppe dismissed their concerns: “recent events frustrated them.” The subsequent resignations by 40% of the board, with another apparently threatening to go, were inconsequential annoyances. Sequoia, rather snippily, noted that board members don’t control the portfolio, the managers do. Foot firmly on the gas, they turned the bus toward the cliff. More recently our colleague Devesh Shah reported that Texas Public Land Corporation comprised 47% of the total holdings of Horizon Kinetics, advisor to the various Kinetics Funds. (Morningstar subsequently picked up on the story albeit without acknowledging Devesh’s work.) As of 3/1/25, Kinetics Paradigm has 66% of its portfolio in TPL and its sibling Kinetics Small Cap Opportunities sits at 53%. Both have perfectly splendid total returns coupled with Morningstar risk scores of 100+. Freakishly Morningstar has endorsed both, awarding them a Bronze analyst rating. The most spectacular blow-ups have resulted from the confidence that star managers can magically turn illiquid investments into liquid ones. Consider Firsthand Technology Value Fund (SVVC), which offered public investors access to pre-IPO tech companies. What seemed revolutionary quickly turned problematic as the fund frequently traded at substantial discounts to its net asset value (NAV)—sometimes exceeding 30%. Why? Because investors couldn’t be certain of the true value of its holdings, creating a persistent trust deficit. The fund posted annualized losses of 75% over the past three years and 60% over the past five. It now trades at $0.06/share and can’t even manage to liquidate. If you’re interested in the cautionary tale of the giant that tumbled, read “The Rise and Fall of Firsthand Technology Value Fund” (March 2025). More dramatically, the Third Avenue Focused Credit Fund‘s collapse in 2015 demonstrates how quickly illiquidity can transform from theoretical to catastrophic. In 2016, we described it this way: …offered the impossible: it would invest in illiquid securities but provide investors with daily liquidity. That worked fine as long as the market was rising and no one actually wanted their money back, but when the tide began to go out and investors wanted their money, the poop hit the propeller. When redemptions accelerated, the fund couldn’t sell its junk bonds fast enough and ultimately had to bar investors from withdrawing their money—the ultimate liquidity failure. The fund froze redemptions and placed the fund in a locked trust. Investors exploded, and lawsuits followed, as did a $14.25 million payment from two Third Avenue executives. It took investors three years to receive, drip by drop, 84% of their investment back. Third Avenue was gutted. Despite these cautionary tales, a new generation of funds is testing the boundaries: Franklin Global Allocation Fund has ventured into business development companies, a relatively modest step into less-liquid territory. Effective on February 5, 2025, the fund gained the option of investing in business development companies, “BDCs are a less common type of closed-end fund [which] typically invest in small, developing, financially troubled, private companies or other companies that may have value that can be realized over time, often with managerial assistance.” At around the same time, its management team turned over, leading Morningstar to place its status as “under review.” The fund has seen continuous outflows essentially every single month for a decade with annual returns in the 5-7% range. Adding the ability to goose returns with a new asset class makes business sense; adding illiquid assets and a new team is grounds for caution. SPDR SSGA Apollo IG Public & Private Credit ETF pushes further by investing in private credit markets. Described as “ground-breaking” by Morningstar, the ETF will give investors exposure to illiquid private credit in a liquid vehicle. Up to 35% of the portfolio can be illiquid debt. The plan is for the fund to buy private credit from Apollo with the promise the Apollo will also promise to help them cover their … uhh, exposure. Morningstar’s Brian Moriarty explains: The ETF plans to overcome those concerns through a contractual agreement with Apollo, which will supply private-credit assets for the fund to buy and provide it with bids, or prices, on those same assets. Apollo has further agreed to purchase those investments from the fund up to an undefined daily limit. In other words, Apollo is selling these instruments to the fund and promising to buy them back at the request of State Street. (“A Groundbreaking New ETF Arrives,” Morningstar.com, 2/27/25). Pretty much no one but the adviser is sanguine about these promises. Mr. Moriarty frets “If redemptions are greater than Apollo’s daily limit and the ETF has few public securities, there are many more questions that the filing doesn’t answer… the filing makes it clear that ‘assets that were deemed liquid by the Adviser may become illiquid’ if Apollo is unable to provide a bid or unable to purchase those assets.” One day later the SEC belatedly located its Big Boy Pants and told the adviser to file an amended plan. In a letter to the firms, the Securities and Exchange Commission noted that the fund had “significant remaining outstanding issues” around its liquidity, name, and ability to comply with valuation rules. That’s in part because the SEC accepted a filing with key information blacked-out, or redacted. “We have concerns,” associate director Brent Fields announced. (Tania Mitra, “After launch, SEC raises concerns about State Street and Apollo’s private credit ETF,” Citywire, 2/28/25). ERShares Private-Public Crossover (XOVR) makes perhaps the boldest move by including private equity investments like SpaceX and it’s drawn the attention of two really smart, very different people, Jason Zweig and Jeff Ptak. Both start with the same observation: XOVR’s claim to fame is that it owns a chunk of Elon Musk’s company, SpaceX and it markets that fact relentlessly. The biggest question, though, is “How big a chunk do they own?” The honest answer to which is “sheet, I dunno” because SpaceX is privately traded and its price is anybody’s (and sometimes everybody’s) guess. The Wall Street Journal’s Jason Zweig launched on the fund in January, doing what Mr. Z. does best: he gets to the point quickly, clearly, and with great style. He reports on the possible current worth of one share of SpaceX: private firms variously put it at $115, $182, $185, $207, or $209. Which is accurate? As Mr. Z. puts it “who knows?” Equally troubling is what happens if the bubble starts to deflate: “in a market crash, XOVR would have to sell its most liquid holdings, such as Alphabet, Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Oracle, to meet redemptions if investors panicked. That might leave remaining shareholders owning little but SpaceX—which isn’t readily tradable.” The fund advisor fumbled about every query placed to it, leaving The Z to conclude, “If the investment industry wants to sell private assets to the public, it had better do better than this—a lot better.” (You Can Own Elon Musk’s SpaceX. But at What Price? WSJ.com, 1/24/25) Similarly, Morningstar’s Jeff Ptak did what he does best in his analysis of the fund, “How to Manage an ETF … Right Into a Corner” (2/25/25). The short version: Mr. P. analyzes more data, more carefully, and more extensively, than the firm’s own auditors might have. He notes that “Capital Impact Advisors, added private equity to its mandate last year and has heavily promoted it as ‘the first crossover ETF’ to invest in private equity in the months since.” The marketing worked (“Around 80% of the new money that’s flowed into the ETF since November has arrived after Dec. 10, 2024, when Capital Impact Advisors marked the SpaceX position up from $135 to $185 per share. It’s remained at that valuation ever since.”) The problem, he notes, is that this money could head for the exits just as quickly as it rushed in. In hopes of preventing that, the managers might double down on illiquid positions or might face a huge burden in liquidating a partially illiquid portfolio. It’s a good piece of analysis, and quite detailed. Each represents a different position on the liquidity-illiquidity spectrum, with potentially different risk profiles. As Mr. Moriarty modestly observes, “This is a groundbreaking proposal that could open the door for a multitude of copycat vehicles… It’s a wide new ETF world out there.” The core issue isn’t just illiquidity itself but the misalignment between asset liquidity and fund structure. When a fund promises daily redemptions while holding assets that might take weeks, months, or years to sell at reasonable prices, it creates a structural vulnerability. This disconnect is like promising instant sobriety after a night of drinking—it violates fundamental realities. During market stress, this mismatch becomes particularly dangerous as funds may be forced to sell their most liquid holdings first, leaving remaining investors with an increasingly illiquid portfolio. These new ETFs aren’t offering the impossible—they’re offering a trade-off. The appropriate metaphor isn’t “alcohol without hangovers” but rather “alcohol with a hangover cure that might work.” The cure isn’t guaranteed, especially if too many people need it at once. Smart investors understand that innovative financial products don’t eliminate fundamental trade-offs—they merely repackage them in ways that might obscure the underlying risks. The promise of private market returns with public market liquidity should be approached not with excitement but with heightened scrutiny.

Title: They warn about Netflix email scam; It looks real but it’s AI

Time Published: 2025-03-03T23:58:22Z

Users of Netflix have been warned to be alert to a “sinister” email scam powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) that looks almost indistinguishable from the real one. This highlights how scams on social media and the internet have reached alarming levels in recent years, and one of the most effective methods for criminals is the misuse of well-known brand names. Recognized companies such as Amazon, Mercado Libre, Adidas, and BBVA have become bait to lure unsuspecting consumers, who often fall for fake offers, nonexistent contests, or fraudulent banking alerts. A report from the Mexican Cybersecurity Association revealed that, during 2024, reports of digital fraud grew by 38 percent compared to the previous year. Of these, 60 percent involved the unauthorized use of recognized brands. According to the National Commission for the Protection and Defense of Users of Financial Services (Condusef), digital fraud resulted in losses of more than 12 billion pesos in 2024 alone in Mexico. Scams involving the names of major global brands continue to emerge on the internet. Now, one involving Netflix is being reported, which seems “real” because it uses Artificial Intelligence. “Your account is on hold,” the notice says. “Update your payment details. We are having some issues with your current billing information. We will try again, but in the meantime, you may want to update your payment details,” reads the message. It also includes a red button that looks official and says “Update account now.” According to many people, this correspondence is almost identical to a legitimate Netflix message, from the branding to the colors and even the links to the official help page of the platform. When the user clicks on the red button, they are redirected to a convincing Netflix login page, where they will be asked for their username, password, personal address, and Netflix card details. If entered, the user has basically provided the cybercriminals with everything they need to steal their money. While these malicious messaging campaigns have existed since the early days of email, “AI technology has now allowed criminal gangs to generate phishing campaigns at great speed and to more email addresses than ever before,” warned Jake Moore, Global Cybersecurity Advisor for cybersecurity firm ESET. He also added that “cybercriminals have been exploiting AI to target large amounts of email addresses and can easily create login pages that look authentic to trick users into revealing personal information or account credentials.” “However, like traditional phishing attacks, these scams often try to create a sense of urgency, prompting recipients to act quickly without verifying the true origin of the sender or even thinking at all,” he said. Fortunately, there are some telltale signs that an email is a digital wolf in sheep’s clothing. In this case, the email originated from an iCloud email domain, while official Netflix emails always come from an address ending in netflix.com. Netflix also clarified on its site that it will never request bank account details, credit card numbers, or passwords via text message or email. The best way to verify the authenticity of an email is by logging into your official account. With this, we see how these scams continue to grow, prompting major brands to take steps to combat this issue. Companies like BBVA and Amazon have strengthened their awareness campaigns, warning their customers about the risks of interacting with unknown links and unverified profiles. Additionally, platforms like Meta have implemented stricter verification mechanisms for business accounts. The rise of scams on social media and the internet using major brand names serves as a reminder of the importance of vigilance and critical thinking when browsing online. While businesses and authorities strengthen their protection strategies, individual prevention remains the best defense against these frauds. When does Red Lobster’s Lobsterfest end?

Title: The Weakening Economy Needs Rate Relief
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/03/03/the-weakening-economy-needs-rate-relief/
Time Published: 2025-03-03T22:52:28Z

ByRobert Barone ByRobert Barone , Contributor. Equity markets were down for the week (again). But it could have been much worse, as the closing results were much improved from Friday’s lows at about 1 p.m. Eastern Time. The S&P 500, for example, finished the day with a +2% gain as markets rallied into the close.[1] As shown in the table, 2025 has been mixed with the S&P 500 and the DJIA positive while the tech heavy Nasdaq and the small-cap Russell 2000 are negative for the year. Equity Market Uncertainty is clearly the order of the day (Trump vs. Zelenskyy, DOGE’s actions to terminate thousands of federal jobs, the imposition of tariffs beginning March 5). It has now appeared to have permeated and soured investor views. The volatility the markets just experienced oftentimes marks a turn in investor attitudes. According to Rosenberg Research, only 29 other times over the last 9000-plus trading sessions have we seen the intraday volatility that occurred on Friday (February 28).[1] The other occasions occurred in 2022, 2020, 2018, 2008, 2002, 2001, 2000, 1999, and 1998. Some of these years were years of Recession. Magnificent 7 Despite showing strong sales and profits (+80%) and guiding higher, Nvidia’s stock still got pummeled, down -7% for the week and about the same year-to-date.[1] It isn’t every day that a tech titan comes in with such good numbers and its share price tanks. A look at the Mag 7 in total shows lower prices across the board for the week and for six out of the seven on a year-to-date basis (Meta being the exception). Could it be that the markets see a slowing economy? Or has the market just run too far? So far in 2025, all the housing data have tanked. Pending Home Sales Most analysts blame these downtrends on high interest rates. But, as shown in the chart below, mortgage rates have been at or near 7% since late 2022; so, something else must be at play. Perhaps the slowdown in the general economy is the culprit. 30 Year Mortgage Rate The weakening economy, high mortgage rates, and the perception by consumers that inflation will continue to be an issue, has taken its toll. The chart shows that consumers still see many hurdles to overcome in the home buying process. Buying Conditions for Houses Initial Claims for Unemployment Insurance rose +22,000 in the week ended February 22 to 242,000 from 220,000 the prior week.[1] Continuing Claims, at 2,234,000 are nearly +101,000 higher than a year ago.[2] Due to the DOGE purges in D.C., these numbers will certainly rise sharply over the next few months. Depending on how rapidly the economy slows, we expect the U3 unemployment rate to rise to somewhere between 4.5% and 5.0% over the next six months. Inflation is a process. It isn’t “high prices.” Those “high prices” are the result of inflation. One cause of inflation that economists and the folks who run the Fed worry about is something called the “wage-price” spiral. Simply put, this is where rising wages cause businesses to raise prices which in turn leads to demands for higher wages. Wage Growth & The Quits Rate The chart shows the year/year wage and salary growth rate (blue line) and a smoothed version of the JOLTS “Quits Rate.” Note the strong relationship. When the Quits Rate falls, so does the rate of wage growth. That seems logical. The Quits Rate falls when employers cut back on hiring and jobs become harder to find. The Conference Board’s latest Consumer Confidence Survey complements this chart, showing a rise in the consumer view that jobs are now harder to get than they were just a few months ago. Also in that Survey, the view that there will be fewer jobs over the next six months hit a 12-year high. Generally, we find such views in a slowing economy. Hence, our view that inflation will be at or below the Fed’s target by mid-year. The University of Michigan’s most recent Consumer Sentiment Survey hit its lowest level since November 2023. Inflation expectations over the next 12 months spiked to 3.5% in December.[1] This is the highest level for this indicator since April 1995. No doubt the tariff threats from the Trump administration played a key role. Just for clarity, the tariffs will have an initial impact on inflation, but economists believe that it is a one-time adjustment and doesn’t feed the inflation process. This is a problem the Fed is going to have to deal with and it is likely why markets don’t see any rate decreases for several months. Policy uncertainty has had a large impact on the equity markets. “Tariffs On,” “Tariffs Off.” Which will it be? March 5 appears to be the destiny date. If the tariffs are actually imposed, expect more equity market volatility as that will be another hurdle for the economy. There is no doubt that the U.S. economy is slowing. This appears to be a worldwide phenomenon as the economies of China and those in Europe are slowing, too. In the U.S., we’ve recently seen a decline in Retail Sales, and we know that it isn’t a one-off because Walmart gave very soft guidance. Housing is the poster child for the economic slowdown. The latest housing data screams Recession. And the latest consumer confidence surveys have all turned negative. High interest rates are killing the housing sector. New and Existing Home Sales continue to slow. Because inflation expectations are stuck at levels higher than the Fed’s target rates, the prospect of much needed interest rate relief still appears to be several months away. Our view is that the Fed is already behind the curve, and if they wait until the inflation indexes actually hit their 2% goal before granting rate relief, the economy will already be in Recession. Remember, interest rates impact the economy with long and variable lags. This Fed’s mindset: “No rate relief until the inflation numbers yield.” But if it waits much longer, it will be too late. In fact, it may have already waited too long. (Joshua Barone and Eugene Hoover contributed to this blog.)

Title: Chips Act funding could be at risk as Trump cuts federal workers

The Trump administration’s large-scale layoffs of federal workers could affect the rollout of former President Joe Biden’s efforts to bring advanced chipmaking back to the U.S. The Chips Program Office, which oversees the implementation of the Biden administration’s CHIPS and Science Act, is set to lose two-fifths of its workforce, Bloomberg reported, citing unidentified people. About 20 employees have left after accepting deferred resignations, according to Bloomberg, and about 40 probationary workers are bracing for layoffs on Monday. The Department of Commerce did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Quartz. The terminations won’t have a big effect on employees negotiating contracts with companies receiving funding, one person told Bloomberg. These employees are responsible for tracking progress on contractual benchmarks. Leaders in the Chips Program Office met Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to discourage him from laying off those employees, Bloomberg reported. Other Chips Act funding projects may be at risk due to federal cuts, including $500 million in funding for smaller companies involved in the semiconductor supply chain. Lutnick has asked the office’s employees how it’s making funding decisions, and how the government could get money back that has been awarded, according to Bloomberg. He’s also interested in limiting how companies who have received Chips Act funding can conduct business in China, the news service said. Employees are looking at ways to amend applications for funding and contract language that could meet the Trump administration’s demands, Bloomberg said. Meanwhile, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM-0.72%) (TSMC), a recipient of Chips Act funding, announced it’s planning to invest at least $100 billion to build out chip plants in the U.S. over the next four years. Most of the investment will be focused in Arizona where TSMC is already building a chipmaking hub, President Donald Trump told reporters on Monday. He added that the plan includes building five cutting-edge chip fabrication facilities in Arizona that will create thousands of jobs.

Title: 6 Vanguard Index Funds To Buy Now
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/best-vanguard-index-funds-buy-now/
Time Published: 2025-03-03T21:33:34Z

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock , Contributor. Whether you're building a new&nbsp;ETF portfolio or enhancing an existing one, Vanguard index funds ... [+] are worth a look. Experienced and novice investors love Vanguard index funds. In October 2024, Morningstar estimated Vanguard had a leading 29% market share in U.S. assets under management. Let's explore what makes this fund family so popular and meet six Vanguard funds performing well against their peers. Many investors choose Vanguard index funds for their low expense ratios and attractive market exposures. The Vanguard name is also well-regarded as the original index fund manager—the company launched the first index fund in 1976. A fund's expense ratio quantifies how much shareholders pay for the fund's administrative costs. Fund expenses dilute returns, so a lower ratio is better. Index funds normally have low expense ratios because they are cheaper to operate than actively managed funds. Vanguard is proudly a low-cost provider of this already cost-efficient investment product. In February 2025, the company lowered expense ratios across 87 funds. Vanguard estimates the reduction will save investors $350 million in 2025. One strategy to identify the best and cheapest Vanguard index funds is to screen on expense ratios and Morningstar Ratings. The Morningstar Rating is a comparative measure of a fund’s risk-adjusted returns. A five-star rating, the highest possible, indicates a fund has historically performed well against its peers. Note that Morningstar re-rates funds monthly, and ratings do not guarantee future performance. See Morningstar Ratings 101 for more information. As of late February 2025, nine Vanguard funds had five-star ratings. Those nine funds were ordered from lowest expense ratio to highest. The top six were selected for inclusion. The table below includes six Vanguard funds with five-star Morningstar Ratings and expense ratios below 0.10%. Ratings are from Morningstar and fund metrics are from Vanguard.com. For more fund investing ideas, see best ETFs for 2025 and income investing ETFs. Vanguard's S&P 500 ETF invests in every S&P 500 company. The fund's goal is to replicate the performance of the S&P 500 index, commonly used as a benchmark for the entire stock market. VOO’s predecessor was Vanguard's First Index Investment Trust, launched in 1976. Today, VOO is the world's largest ETF with $1.4 trillion in net assets. VOO has the elements of a solid core holding: The 0.03% expense ratio is cost-efficient, and the portfolio provides exposure to an appealing segment. The S&P 500 includes the largest, most successful companies on U.S. stock exchanges. The index can be volatile but has historically delivered a long-term annualized return of 7% net of inflation. Vanguard's mega-cap fund tracks the CRSP US Mega Cap Index. The index includes 195 of the largest U.S. companies by market capitalization. Historically, large companies were often more stable and predictable than their smaller counterparts. For that reason, many conservative equity investors favored mega-cap and blue-chip stocks. That trend has changed. Today, technology companies dominate market-cap-weighted indexes. For example, AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA)—a stock known for its volatility—is the third largest company in the S&P 500 and the CRSP US Mega Cap Index. Still, the MGC portfolio offers an interesting collection of stocks. The holdings include growth players like Nvidia and Microsoft (MSFT), alongside value plays like Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM). You get these same top stocks in an S&P 500 fund but with less concentration. Head-to-head, the mega-cap index outperforms the S&P 500 slightly, albeit with more volatility. The Vanguard Mega Cap Value ETF replicates the CRSP US Mega Cap Value Index. The index includes the largest value stocks, covering about 70% of U.S. market capitalization. There are 136 index constituents. The value focus of MGV should appeal to bargain-hunting, risk-averse equity investors. You won’t find too many fast-moving tech stocks in this portfolio. The fund favors financials, health care and industrials. The technology sector is represented but by less prominent stocks such as Broadcom (AVGO), IBM (IBM) and Qualcomm (QCOM). Relative to VOO, MGV has produced slightly lower returns. The fund does deliver a reasonable yield of 2.06%, so it might be a candidate for those who favor dividend ETFs. Vanguard's VONG fund invests in Russell 1000 Growth stocks. This index currently includes 395 Russell 1000 stocks with higher price-to-book ratios, higher two-year earnings forecasts and higher five-year sales-per-share growth. VONG provides nice return potential by focusing on stocks with growth characteristics. The earnings growth rate for this portfolio is 24.9%. The same metric for VOO is 18.9%. This fund has outperformed the others on this list, with a five-year average annual return of 18.82%. High concentrations of Apple (AAPL), Microsoft, Nvidia and Amazon (AMZN) have driven much of that growth. One trade-off for the appreciation potential is lower cash returns. VONG's 30-day SEC yield is 0.48%. Vanguard's health care fund invests in about 400 large, mid and small cap companies that provide medical products, services or technology. The benchmark index is the MSCI US IMI Health Care 25/50. According to a Deloitte survey in December 2024, health care industry leaders are mostly optimistic about the year ahead. Nearly 70% of survey respondents expect a 2025 revenue increase and 71% expect a boost in profits. VHT is a good position for capitalizing on higher health care profits. Like all funds on this list, VHT has performed well against peers. It also has a low expense ratio of 0.09% and pays a moderate SEC 30-day yield of 1.38%. The portfolio includes Zepbound-maker Eli Lilly (LLY), diversified health care company UnitedHealth (UNH) and biopharma Abbvie (ABBV). Vanguard's technology ETF holds large, mid and small tech stocks, including hardware and software providers and semiconductor companies. The benchmark index is MSCI US IMI Info Technology 25/50. AI has fueled a surge in tech stocks over the last two years. Many experts believe the trend will continue. According to The Wall Street Journal, AI spending is projected to grow at a compound annual rate of 29% between 2024 and 2028. VGT provides broad exposure to the technology sector, from Nvidia and other big names to exciting mid-caps like Astera Labs (ALAB). Note that the fund is market-cap-weighted, so the mega caps will drive the overall performance. That could be good or bad, depending on your outlook and risk tolerance. Bottom Line Whether you're building a new ETF portfolio or enhancing an existing one, Vanguard index funds are worth a look. They have low fees and cover popular market segments, broad to niche. You can double-down on growth, find value bargains or tweak your sector exposure. It’s no wonder Vanguard is the most popular fund family in the U.S.

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock , Contributor. Whether you're building a new&nbsp;ETF portfolio or enhancing an existing one, Vanguard index funds ... [+] are worth a look. Experienced and novice investors love Vanguard index funds. In October 2024, Morningstar estimated Vanguard had a leading 29% market share in U.S. assets under management. Let's explore what makes this fund family so popular and meet six Vanguard funds performing well against their peers. Many investors choose Vanguard index funds for their low expense ratios and attractive market exposures. The Vanguard name is also well-regarded as the original index fund manager—the company launched the first index fund in 1976. A fund's expense ratio quantifies how much shareholders pay for the fund's administrative costs. Fund expenses dilute returns, so a lower ratio is better. Index funds normally have low expense ratios because they are cheaper to operate than actively managed funds. Vanguard is proudly a low-cost provider of this already cost-efficient investment product. In February 2025, the company lowered expense ratios across 87 funds. Vanguard estimates the reduction will save investors $350 million in 2025. One strategy to identify the best and cheapest Vanguard index funds is to screen on expense ratios and Morningstar Ratings. The Morningstar Rating is a comparative measure of a fund’s risk-adjusted returns. A five-star rating, the highest possible, indicates a fund has historically performed well against its peers. Note that Morningstar re-rates funds monthly, and ratings do not guarantee future performance. See Morningstar Ratings 101 for more information. As of late February 2025, nine Vanguard funds had five-star ratings. Those nine funds were ordered from lowest expense ratio to highest. The top six were selected for inclusion. The table below includes six Vanguard funds with five-star Morningstar Ratings and expense ratios below 0.10%. Ratings are from Morningstar and fund metrics are from Vanguard.com. For more fund investing ideas, see best ETFs for 2025 and income investing ETFs. Vanguard's S&P 500 ETF invests in every S&P 500 company. The fund's goal is to replicate the performance of the S&P 500 index, commonly used as a benchmark for the entire stock market. VOO’s predecessor was Vanguard's First Index Investment Trust, launched in 1976. Today, VOO is the world's largest ETF with $1.4 trillion in net assets. VOO has the elements of a solid core holding: The 0.03% expense ratio is cost-efficient, and the portfolio provides exposure to an appealing segment. The S&P 500 includes the largest, most successful companies on U.S. stock exchanges. The index can be volatile but has historically delivered a long-term annualized return of 7% net of inflation. Vanguard's mega-cap fund tracks the CRSP US Mega Cap Index. The index includes 195 of the largest U.S. companies by market capitalization. Historically, large companies were often more stable and predictable than their smaller counterparts. For that reason, many conservative equity investors favored mega-cap and blue-chip stocks. That trend has changed. Today, technology companies dominate market-cap-weighted indexes. For example, AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA)—a stock known for its volatility—is the third largest company in the S&P 500 and the CRSP US Mega Cap Index. Still, the MGC portfolio offers an interesting collection of stocks. The holdings include growth players like Nvidia and Microsoft (MSFT), alongside value plays like Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).

It’s no secret that Kara Swisher has been trying to figure out how to take the Washington Post off Jeff Bezos’s hands, even though it’s not for sale and the billionaire seems unlikely to part with it any time soon. In the latest episode of On With Kara Swisher, she details why she’s on this “quixotic mission”; laments the Post’s recent struggles, including Bezos’s latest editorial meddling; and shares some conversations she’s had with trusted advisers about her plan, the Post’s legacy and troubles, and why the paper should and must be saved. Below is her opening pitch. Journalist Kara Swisher brings the news and newsmakers to you twice a week, on Mondays and Thursdays. Kara Swisher: I’m not peacocking … I’m not trying to shame Jeff, either. It’s neither a troll, nor a tale of business derring-do, though I certainly have the ability to raise the money needed. And I have a plan I think would help get the Post back on its feet. But here’s the simple truth: This is a love story. So let me begin by telling you it, and I’ll keep it brief. I got my job at the Washington Post by calling the Metro editor and yelling about a story I had seen in the paper. I was covering the story from my college newspaper, which was at Georgetown University, and the Post did a terrible job of it. And I was angry because I loved the Washington Post, and I was disappointed that they did such a bad job. I got the Metro editor on the phone on my first try, and he invited me down to the Washington Post, which at the time was on 15th Street. So I jumped on the M2 bus and rode it down to the Post. And I walked into the Post newsroom for the very first time, and it was love at first sight. I told the editor my problems that I had with what they had done and how angry I was. And he told me I was obnoxious. Well, I was, but he had let me down, and I said I could do a better job. Right then and there, he hired me as stringer for the Washington Post. And I wrote innumerable stories about the college I was going to. So many, that it got me into the graduate school of journalism at Columbia. I got my first job in journalism by being irritating, so why should I stop now? Back to my career there, I later went on to work in the mail room, as night copy aide, as a news aide, an intern for “Style Plus,” a fill-in for the business section, which morphed into a reporting job including covering retail workplace issues, and ultimately being the first reporter to cover the nascent digital-services business in D.C. in the form of a small company in Vienna, Virginia, called AOL, America Online. It was there I met many people who are now the richest and most powerful in the world. For the most part, they were scrappy entrepreneurs with only a germ of an idea, a difficult road, but lots of aggressive drive. That included Jeff Bezos, who I met in Seattle when I went to check out his start-up called Amazon in the 1990s. As I described him in my memoir, Burn Book, up in Seattle, a short and energetic man was lousy at hiding his wanting ambitions, masking them behind a genuinely infectious, maniacal laugh, a curiously baby-fat face, and an anodyne presentation of pleated khakis, sensible shoes, and a blue oxford shirt. Still, from the start, I had no doubt that Jeff Bezos would eat my face off if that’s what he needed to do to get ahead. Feral, in fact, was the first word that jumped into my head when I met Bezos in the mid-1990s. He brought me to an industrial area near the airport, and I watched as he skittered around the warehouse like a frenetic mongoose. We talked a lot in those days, largely because he needed me to shine a light on his efforts at a very dicey time for Amazon. First when I was at the Post and then at The Wall Street Journal, where I went in 1997 as its first reporter specifically covering the internet. After a lot of ups and downs, Amazon soared on that mongoose energy. Fast forward to 2013 when he suddenly, and a surprise to me, bought the Post from the Graham family for $250 million. By then, it was struggling to deal with the digital age, and I was hopeful that Jeff’s innovative spirit and piles of money would save the paper. Even before Bezos came on the scene, I had been warning former Post owner Don Graham that print newspapers were done for. Despite worries about the tech takeover of media, I hoped Jeff would fully embrace online journalism while holding true to the journalistic standards and ethics of the legacy paper. So I wrote an open letter to Bezos on my media start-up, AllThingsD, and offered some advice: “Don’t treat the Post like some precious thing that cannot be touched or changed. While you certainly should respect its vaunted traditions and hue to ethical standards, that does not mean it gets to stay as it is. That’s the big danger here, that you start acting like the steward of history rather than using the fantastic Washington Post brand to make some new history.” And for the first decade of owning the company, he was a very good owner, trying all manner of updating tech and supporting the newsroom. It was not the glory days of Ben Bradlee and Kay Graham, but it was a solid effort, even if the paper always seemed to lag behind the New York Times. Mostly, he kept his mitts off, which was the right thing to do. He even quietly endured endless attacks from President Donald Trump in his first administration. Again, it was the right thing to do, and he was public about that commitment. Here’s what he said to Axel Springer’s CEO, Mathias Döpfner, about his role at the Post back in 2018. Jeff Bezos: As the owner of the Post, I know at times the Post is going to write stories that are going to make very powerful people very unhappy. Mathias Döpfner: Are you upset if they’re writing critical stories about Amazon, which they do? Bezos: No, no, I’m not upset at all. When I first bought the Post — Döpfner: Would you ever interfere? Bezos: Never. Döpfner: No? Bezos: Never. I would be humiliated to interfere. I would be so embarrassed I would turn bright red. And it is nothing to do with … I don’t even get so far … I just don’t want to. For me, it would feel icky. It would feel gross. It would be one of those things, when I’m 80 years old, I would be so unhappy with myself if I interfered. Why would I? Döpfner: Yeah. Bezos: I want that paper to be independent. He went on to say that telling the newsroom what to do would be like taking controls from the pilots of a plane. But when the Trump circus left town and the inexorable decline of the traditional-media business accelerated, losses mounted, and Jeff started to make one bad move after another. In 2023, after bringing in former Microsoft executive Patty Stonesifer, who was well liked at the Post despite having to preside over layoffs and buyouts, Bezos then shows Will Lewis to take over as the new CEO. Lewis had tried to be a media entrepreneur, emphasis on tried, and had been a former CEO of Dow Jones and publisher of The Wall Street Journal, and before that, a senior executive at Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp back in the days of the U.K. phone-hacking scandal. And one of the first things he did after taking his job at the Post, after trashing the reporters for not wanting to change, which was entirely untrue and obnoxious, in not the good way, was apparently trying to kill a story about his own alleged involvement in that scandal. And when Lewis ousted then–executive editor Sally Buzbee, the first woman to serve in that role, newsroom morale plummeted. Then last October, Bezos decided the Post would end a decadeslong practice and pulled the newsroom’s planned endorsement of Vice-President Kamala Harris. That Bezos himself made the decision, not Lewis, is according to the Post’s own reporting. While he certainly was within his rights to do so, the timing was curious and there was fallout. Three hundred thousand Post readers canceled their digital subscriptions in response. No surprise, a growing number of editors and reporters started leaving as newsroom morale plummeted once again. That included my wife, former opinion editor Amanda Katz. And at the dawn of Trump 2.0, there have been other examples of the Post seeming to obey in advance. In January, Pulitzer Prize–winning cartoonist Ann Telnaes resigned after she said opinion editor David Shipley rejected her cartoon depicting Bezos and other tech billionaires bending the knee before Trump. Last month, the Post pulled an ad deal that called on Trump to fire Elon Musk. And just in case that wasn’t enough, Bezos and many other tech billionaires paid a million dollars plus to yuck it up onstage with Trump during the inauguration. Jeff looked like a prop and a stooge. Finally, last week, Bezos announced that the Post opinion section would be refocused to only publish pieces that are “in support and defense of personal liberties and free markets,” which in libertarian billionaire nincompoop speak roughly translates to “Personal liberties means doing whatever the fuck I want. Free markets means doing whatever the fuck I want.” Now, I love capitalism too, but what that means in practice is incomprehensible and really just dumb. That move essentially forced the resignation of the opinion editor, David Shipley, who declined, as Bezos noted, not to say “hell yes.” “Hell no” was the right response. That was a far cry from that 2018 interview: Bezos: I would be humiliated to interfere. I would be so embarrassed I would turn bright red. And it is nothing to do with … I don’t even get so far … I just don’t want to. For me, it would feel icky. It would feel gross. I don’t know if Bezos is now so comfortable with all this interference that he’s gotten over the ick factor, but the rest of us haven’t. As far as I’m concerned, he has killed the Post’s legacy of justice, fairness, commitment to the First Amendment, accountability, and epic badassery created by Ben Bradlee and Kay Graham. Here’s former Post reporter Martha Sherrill: We were always asking more, and we’re pretending we didn’t know things that we maybe thought we knew. But at the same time, you had to kind of have the balls to put the story together. The problem is that Bezos isn’t just any owner. He’s one of the top tech titans in the world, and his real business interests are in Amazon and Blue Origin and not the Post. Now, the biggest competitor to Blue Origin, Elon Musk, is working directly with Trump running DOGE, and I think Jeff wants some of that sweet, sweet government money. Owning an independent media company that is reporting on a presidency and administration that could make or break him, even if he was not such an embarrassing cheerleader, has become a clear conflict of interest. I don’t want to buy the Washington Post to put it on a nostalgia shelf like some precious tchotchke. Even though the Post reportedly lost $100 million last year and about $77 million a year before, I believe there’s an opportunity here. This post has been updated. It originally said that Jeff Bezos hired former Post editor Marty Baron. Baron started as Executive Editor in January 2013, and Bezos completed his purchase of the company that October. The transcript has also been edited for length and clarity. The rest of the episode is a wide-ranging discussion of the Washington Post’s past, present, and future among Kara and former Post writer Sally Quinn, media legend Tina Brown, reporter and critic Oliver Darcy, former Post national editor Cameron Barr, and others. Listen to it here.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company is investing billions of dollars to boost chip manufacturing in the U.S. The Taiwanese chipmaker plans to invest at least $100 billion in building out plants in the U.S. over the next four years, the Trump administration announced on Monday. Most of the investment will be focused in Arizona where TSMC (TSM-0.72%) is already building a chipmaking hub, President Donald Trump said during a briefing. He added that the plan includes building five cutting-edge chip fabrication facilities in Arizona that will create thousands of high-paying jobs. “The most powerful AI chips in the world will be made right here in America,” Trump said. “It will be a big percentage of the chips made by this company.” The announcement brings TSMC’s total U.S. investment to $165 billion. “This will create hundreds of billions of dollars in economic activity and boost America’s dominance in artificial intelligence and beyond,” Trump said. “Semiconductors are the backbone of the 21st century economy and, really, without the semiconductors there is no economy.” Trump said the U.S. “must be able to build the chips and semiconductors that we need right here in American factories with American skill and American labor.” “We are going to produce many AI chips,” TSMC chief executive C.C. Wei said during the announcement. “We are going to produce many tools to support the AI progress and to support the smartphone progress.” In October, Bloomberg reported that the chipmaker’s chip production yields — or the number of functional chips it can produce per manufacturing process — are about four percentage points higher at its Phoenix, Arizona site than those of comparable fabs in Taiwan. The company’s first major U.S. hub includes two chipmaking facilities expected to begin production this year and in 2028. Meanwhile, TSMC was awarded up to $6.6 billion in direct funding under the Biden administration’s CHIPS and Science Act in November. Some of the funding — which will go toward its Phoenix hub — will be used to build a third fab, the Biden administration said, adding that it will put the U.S. on track to produce 20% of the world’s advanced chips by 2030. In September, independent journalist Tim Culpan reported that TSMC is manufacturing A16 chips for Apple — one of its major customers — at Phase 1 of its Fab 21 in Phoenix. Production volume of the A16, which was launched in the iPhone 14 Pro in 2022, “will ramp up considerably” after the second stage of TSMC’s Phase 1 fab is finished, Taiwan-based Culpan said, adding that TSMC’s U.S. site on track to reach its target in the first half of next year.

Title: Dow tumbles 800 points as Trump confirms tariffs on Mexico and Canada will start Tuesday | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: US stocks slid Monday as investors braced for President Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico to go into effect by the midnight deadline. The Dow tumbled 650 points, or 1.48%, to close at 43,191. The Dow fell almost 900 points in afternoon trading before pulling back slightly. The broader S&P 500 fell 1.76% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 2.64%. The S&P 500 posted its biggest one-day decline of the year. The Nasdaq is down about 6.5% since since Trump took office on January 20. “Tomorrow, tariffs — 25% on Canada and 25% on Mexico,” Trump said during a press conference at the White House. “And that’ll start. … What they have to do is build their car plants, frankly, and other things in the United States, in which case they have no tariffs.” Trump said the two trading partners had “no room” left to negotiate to avoid the levies and that he was using tariffs to “punish” countries that, as he put it, were taking from the US economy without giving enough in return. “They’re all set. They go into effect tomorrow,” he said. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Ottawa would immediately respond with tariffs on $30 billion of US goods if the Trump administration’s measures go into effect. “Canada will not let this unjustified decision go unanswered,” he said in a statement. Trump also signed an executive order on Monday raising tariffs on imports from China to 20%, up from 10%. Trump said the tariffs, aimed at bringing China to the table on curtailing fentanyl entering the United States, will be raised because Beijing has not done enough to stem the flow of illegal drugs. The VIX, Wall Street’s fear gauge, surged to its highest point this year after Trump’s comments. “Due to the uncertainty surrounding the tariffs, the stock market has erased the gains from the ‘Trump bump’ following the presidential election and the expected upward pressure on prices is giving investors pause,” said Gustavo Flores-Macias, a professor of government and public policy at Cornell University. “For investors, 2025 can still be a positive year for stocks, but it may take all year to realize gains. And they may be modest,” said Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group. “I’m still a bull,” Bolvin said. The import taxes Trump imposed are significant — the largest in US-China history. The initial tariffs, which went into effect February 4, set in motion tariffs on $1.4 trillion of imported goods. That’s more than triple the $380 billion worth of foreign goods that were hit with tariffs during Trump’s first term, according to estimates from the Tax Foundation. A spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Commerce said Tuesday the country was “strongly dissatisfied” and “firmly opposed” the additional tariff. “(China) will take countermeasures to firmly safeguard its own rights and interests,” the spokesperson added in a statement. Before he became president, Trump pledged a 60% tariff on all Chinese goods, so the tariff level could rise still. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said at the press conference about tariffs on Canada and Mexico that global companies can avoid tariffs if they invest into production in the United States, like TSMC, the Taiwanese chipmaker at the White House on Monday to announce a $100 billion US investment. Related article Trump’s tariff chaos threatens an economy already flashing yellow lights Trump’s tariffs will raise prices of imported goods, which could boost demand for goods produced in the US, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs. But they also noted that tariffs will have negative effects on some American businesses. “Tariff increases will also raise production costs for some domestic producers and will likely prompt foreign retaliation against some US exports, both of which could hurt domestic production,” they wrote in a note. US stocks are “likely to be volatile” until Trump’s policies point toward being more growth-focused, said Jason Draho, head of asset allocation for the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a note Monday. Draho said he does expect future growth and maintains a “positive medium-term outlook.” The stock market began to slide Monday morning to begin the new month, as investors digested the latest manufacturing survey from the Institute for Supply Management. The survey showed economic activity in the manufacturing industry remained in expansion territory, yet slowed last month. Tariff fears dominated write-in responses to the survey. Markets slid Monday afternoon after Trump posted on Truth Social that he plans to implement tariffs on “external product[s],” potentially including agricultural products. Trump’s post referred to his plan for reciprocal tariffs, set to take place on April 2, according to a person familiar, though it was not immediately clear how these tariffs would be implemented. “To the Great Farmers of the United States: Get ready to start making a lot of agricultural product to be sold INSIDE of the United States. Tariffs will go on external product on April 2nd. Have fun!” Trump said in the post.

The stocks dragging markets lower on Monday included Nvidia (NVDA), which fell 8.7%. The yield on the 10-year Treasury slid to 4.16%, signaling concerns about uncertainty and future economic growth. Bitcoin traded around $85,600 on Monday afternoon, down 8.6% in the past day and largely erasing gains made after Trump on Sunday announced a strategic crypto reserve that would include bitcoin. Meanwhile, shares in defense companies in Europe soared to record highs on Monday as European leaders consider the need to re-arm amid less US support for Ukraine. WTI crude, the US oil benchmark, fell about 2% to its lowest price since December after OPEC+ announced it would begin producing more oil in April.

Sunday's Trump bump in crypto has mostly vanished nearly as quickly as it appeared. In mid-afternoon U.S. action, bitcoin (BTC) is changing hands at $86,700, barely above its level prior to President Trump taking to social media Sunday to tout his plans for coming U.S. crypto reserve. Ether is now actually beneath its pre-Trump level and at 0.025, the ETH/BTC ratio has touched a new five-year low. Other tokens touted by Trump as part of the coming crypto reserve — Solana's (SOL), Ripple's (XRP) and Cardano's (ADA) — have given up sizable amounts of their Sunday gains, though remain somewhat higher than prior to the president's posting. “Crypto vols are still relatively elevated with both majors still reflecting a Put Skew till end-March,” crypto trading firm QCP Capital wrote to their investors. “The VIX is also elevated, signaling broader market unease in risk assets overall, particularly after the recent tariff escalations from the U.S. administration.” Crypto stocks have given up large chunks are early gains on Monday, with a number of them — Core Scientific (CORZ) and Bitdeer (BTDR) among them — now sporting sizable losses on the session. Medical equipment maker Semler Scientific (SMLR) — perhaps better-known for its bitcoin treasury strategy — is off 7.3% today after a DOJ investigation for possible violations of a federal anti-fraud law related to its marketing of a product known as QuantaFlo, reported Stat News. The broader stock market is also in the red, with the Nasdaq shedding 1.1% and S&P 500 0.8% ahead of Trump's promised tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China. Chipmaking giant Nvidia (NVDA) is down 6.5% on news that Singapore has charged three men in a U.S. export controls breach case. “Concerns over U.S. growth, and impending tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada — set to take effect tomorrow — will be in focus, driving equities and rates,” said Jake Ostrovskis, OTC Trader at crypto market maker Wintermute. Tom writes about markets, bitcoin mining and crypto adoption in Latin America. He has a bachelor's degree in English literature from McGill University, and can usually be found in Costa Rica.

Nvidia (NVDA+0.67%), Super Micro Computer (SMCI-0.43%), and Dell (DELL-2.92%) shares plunged Monday after Singapore said it’s investigating whether servers shipped to Malaysia containing chips barred from China ended up in the mainland. Police in the city-state arrested several people for their alleged roles in procuring and shipping Nvidia chips in violation of American sanctions, Bloomberg reports. The U.S. has been investigating whether Chinese AI startup DeepSeek had circumvented curbs that way, it said earlier. Singapore is seeking further information from Malaysia and the U.S. to determine the final destination of the Dell and Super Micro Computer servers, Law Minister K. Shanmugam told reporters on Monday. The purchasers had misled suppliers about the ultimate destination of the equipment, he said. The investigation risks increasing U.S. scrutiny of equipment exports by the American companies, a potential drag on sales growth. The news also comes amid investor caution ahead of the scheduled implementation of higher U.S. tariffs on goods from China, Mexico and Canada. Nvidia stock closed down 8.7% on Monday. Super Micro shares fell 13%, and Dell slipped 7%. Intel (INTC-1.52%) stock closed down 4.2%, giving giving up a gain earlier in the day driven by a report that its faltering chip manufacturing business could get a boost from its rivals. Nvidia and Broadcom (AVGO+7.14%) are testing chip manufacturing with Intel on its most advanced 18A process for cutting-edge chips, such as those for AI, Reuters reports. Broadcom, due to report earnings on Thursday, dropped more than 6%. The U.S.-traded shares of top chip foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. (TSM-0.60%) (TSMC) fell 4.2%.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, March 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo Nordisk” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) and reminds investors of the March 25, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that the true state of Novo’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” On December 20, 2024, during pre-market hours, Novo announced headline results for its REDEFINE-1 trial, which determined CagriSema had achieved a weight loss average of only 22.7% after 68 weeks. The Company attributed this diminished result, in part, on the previously undisclosed “flexible” nature of the protocol. This flexibility resulted in less than 60% of patients apparently completing the dose escalation period and thus being treated with “2.4 mg cagrilintide and 2.4 mg semaglutide once-weekly,” the maximum dosage of CagriSema contemplated by the trial, during the 52-week maintenance period in the manner outlined by the published protocol for the REDEFINE-1 study. Investors and analysts reacted immediately to Novo’s revelation. The price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $103.44 per share on December 19, 2024, Novo’s stock price fell to $85.00 per share on December 20, 2024, a decline of about 17.83% in the span of just a single day. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Novo Nordisk’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Two of the biggest standalone VR headsets are about to do battle When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. We're living in the age of standalone, mixed reality headsets, and with lots of brands getting in on the fun it's getting more and more important to be armed with the knowledge of which one is right for you. Unless you have thousands to splash out on one, there are two rivals duking it out for the top spot, the Pico 4 Ultra, and the Meta Quest 3. Squaring off for this Saturday night blockbuster fight are two headsets that can offer a lot of versatility. Whether you just want one of the best VR headsets for immersive gaming, you want spatial computing power, or you want a fun new way to enjoy some you-time without distractions, the Pico 4 Ultra and Meta Quest 3 are great products for you to consider. Although the Meta Quest 3 is much more commonly known, you shouldn't count the underdog out early. The Pico 4 isn't available in US markets, so that does take it out of contention for a lot of readers. Still, if you're anywhere else in the world, the Pico 4 Ultra is an extremely formidable opponent for Meta's Quest 3, and may even top it in certain aspects. There's a multi-round battle ahead of us, so grab your popcorn and get ready for a classic. Zuck's Meta Quest 3 is off to a raring start, as we all suspected. The Pico 4 Ultra just hasn't turned up in this opening round. Since the Quest 3 is available at so many retailers in the US and UK, it's the clear winner here. The Pico 4 Ultra is available in the UK though, and although I've seen it dip out of stock just once since its release, I'd say it's probably the harder of the two headsets to come across. As it continues to age, the Quest 3 is likely to get more discounts, bundles, and deals too. Let's not forget that the Meta Quest 3 comes in a few different variations too. The Pico 4 Ultra has one 256GB SKU, whereas the Quest 3 has its 512GB model, the 3S 128GB model, and the 3S 256GB model as well. The Quest 3 did have a more affordable 128GB version, but that's since been discontinued now that the 3S headsets are here. Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more Winner: Meta Quest 3 This is the round where things get interesting. After a near knockout in that first round, Pico 4 Ultra seems to have woken up, and we've got a real fight on our hands. On paper, the Quest 3 and Pico 4 Ultra have very similar specs. They both share the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processor, which in fighting terms is equivalent to having the same coach. In short, you're going to get very similar experiences with both of these devices, and there isn't much that separates them. Pico 4 Ultra Meta Quest 3 Processor Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen2 Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen2 Resolution 2160 x 2160 per eye 2064 x 2208 per eye Refresh rate 90Hz Variable - 72Hz, 90Hz, 120Hz Field of View 105 degrees 110 degrees Sensors iTOF Depth sensor, Two MR cameras RGB cameras, 4 IR cameras Lenses Pancake Pancake Display 2 x LCD 2 x LCD Storage 256GB 512GB Cameras 2 x 32MB cameras 2x RGB 18PPD cameras Audio Integrated speakers Integrated 3D spatial audio speakers RAM 12GB LPDDR5 8GB Weight 580g 515g Eye Tracking None None Battery 5700mAh (2-4 hours depending on use) Up to 2.2 hours average Connectivity Wi-Fi 7, USB-C WiFi 6E, USB-C As you can see, it's a very close match-up to call between these two headsets. The tale of the tape has a lot of back and forth and a lot of things that are virtually the same, or cancel one another out. The Pico 4 Ultra has strengths in its Wi-Fi 7 support which means it'll be faster to install games and content. It also has 12GB of RAM up from 8GB in the Quest 3, which arguably futureproofs it more for more demanding VR games that have larger levels. RAM is really important in terms of VR computing power, so that's a huge win to have. The Pico 4 also does a great job of its crystal clear cameras and room tracking thanks to a depth sensor the Quest 3 doesn't have. The Quest 3 has more versatility when it comes to refresh rate, since depending on the application and what feels right for you, you can vary the frame rate of the headset from 72Hz to 90Hz, or even 120Hz. 110 degrees of horizontal field of view feels like a cheap win over the Pico 4 Ultra's 105, but it is a slight disparity. Storage also sits in the Quest 3's corner, although I'd argue this is less of a win in VR, since applications and games take up such a small amount of space compared to flat-screen games. Whatever Meta's been doing with audio has paid off though, and a big win for the Quest 3 comes in its quality of sound. While weight technically goes in Meta's favor too, I'd argue it's one of the specs that's virtually identical, for reasons I'll come onto. This is a tough round to call, but I think the wins that Pico 4 Ultra has in terms of its spec sheet are more significant strikes than the ones the Quest 3 can land. It's more about futureproofing in this arena, and the 12GB of RAM and increased Wi-Fi speed do make a big difference. Winner: Pico 4 Ultra (but not by much) If there's one disparity on the spec table that makes no sense, it's that the Meta Quest 3 weighs less than the Pico 4 Ultra. That's because the Pico 4 Ultra is designed to sit so comfortably on your face, and the way it distributes its weight across your head deserves a lot of credit. Longer sessions fly by while wearing this device, and that's down to some excellent design. A lot of that comes down to the fact that Pico's headstrap is much more substantial than Meta's. It reminds me of the one used for the Meta Quest Pro, and it feels like better value for money than the very simple material strap you get with the Quest 3. On the other hand, the best Meta Quest accessories do allow you to personalize your device to suit the comfort and weight distribution you'd like, so it's not a total walkover in this round. I'd argue this is a nice parry, but not an ideal counter since accessories demand more money on top of the headset. Winner: Pico 4 Ultra This one is another complicated round, and it's a bit of a shame, really. The Meta Quest 3 launched in October of 2023 and its 512GB SKU landed a lofty price tag of $649 / £619. The Pico 4 Ultra then launched just under a year later, and with a 256GB storage capacity that fit between the Quest 3's two models in price while touting some beefier specs. It launched to the tune of £529 in the UK, coming in comfortably under the Quest 3's larger 512 variant and making an excellent name for itself in the process. As an underdog, it really felt as though this was going to be a necessary move to win favor among VR shoppers who knew Meta's Quest brand well. Unfortunately, it wasn't long before things turned sour for Pico. The Quest 3S devices launched at $299 / £299 for 128GB, and $349 / £349 for 256GB. The Quest 3 128GB model was discontinued, and the 512GB Quest 3 received a price drop down to $499 / £469. It feels like a low blow has been struck to the underdog Pico 4 Ultra while the referee wasn't looking, and the Quest 3 has a smug look on its face as it walks back to the corner. Winner: Meta Quest 3 One of the biggest slights I hear against the Pico headsets is that they don't have access to the number of games that the Quest 3 has, and while that is true, it really isn't as bad as you think. A lot of the VR heavy hitters are still available on both headsets and if this is really a concern for you, maybe check to see if your favorite games are exclusive to one or the other before purchasing. You may find like I did, that the list the Pico 4 Ultra misses out on isn't actually that long. Both have access to Steam Link and can be hooked up to a gaming PC, so if you plan to tether to a beefier machine that can access SteamVR's library of games, both will do you just fine. Meta's Horizon OS does tend to be the first one to be thought of, however, so who knows what the future may hold as it likely continues to become the larger platform. Winner: Meta Quest 3 This one is slightly subjective, but from testing both headsets extensively and going through the process of reviewing them, I'd argue the Pico 4 Ultra is the better gaming device. It's a comfier headset that again, thanks to that weight distribution, extra RAM, and better depth sensing, makes immersive gaming experiences so much richer. There are fewer technical stutters that remind you you're running a standalone device through its paces, controllers track a bit more consistently, and in all honesty, I noticed more visual detail in Pico 4 Ultra games. At the same time, the visual fidelity on both headsets is virtually identical since their lenses, resolutions, displays, and FOVs are so close to one another. Meta Quest 3 has better passthrough quality since, for some reason, you can clearly read content on other screens better, but either will give you great passthrough quality. I'd say one of the big difference makers in this department is the controllers, which on the Pico 4 Ultra, are just that little bit better. They're marginally longer than the Quest 3 and have a few extra buttons, and it's amazing the difference this makes in games like Blade and Sorcery. Then again, the Quest 3 has some really polished hand-tracking features these days, if that's your thing. I think the motion trackers that come with Pico's device do add a lot more potential for immersive gaming experiences though. Winner: Pico 4 Ultra It's been an exhausting fight for the ages. Both combatants have come away bloody, beaten up, and bruised, and while neither has scored a decisive victory, there can only be one champion. I think the Pico 4 Ultra is, in a lot of ways, a better headset than the Quest 3. It feels a lot more tilted toward power users and those who want a futureproofed device that'll be able to run demanding VR games without compromise for years to come. It feels designed to counter some of the worst parts of the Quest 3. It's comfortable without the need for extra accessories, and its controllers aren't so small they lose tracking capability. Its software offering isn't as limited as some make it seem, and there's a lot of potential to use it in versatile ways, like any mixed-reality device today. It is hugely limited by its reluctance to enter the US market, however, and it's a shame we probably won't see a direct fight on the shelves between such close rivals. The Quest 3, thanks to its accessibly priced Quest 3S models, does a lot to bring VR technology into the mainstream limelight. In this day and age, it's the affordable, versatile, and genuinely capable VR device to own. In other words, the Quest 3 wins, but only because it had a home advantage.

One of my earliest memories is playing SuperMario64 and wondering why the controller I held had three grips, but I only had two hands.

Title: Intel could get a boost from Nvidia and Broadcom

Intel’s (INTC-1.49%) faltering chip manufacturing business could get a boost from its rivals. Nvidia (NVDA+0.45%) and Broadcom (AVGO+7.53%) are testing chip manufacturing with the chip pioneer on its most advanced 18A process for cutting-edge chips, such as those for artificial intelligence, Reuters reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. The tests are being carried out as the two chip designers decide on manufacturing contracts with Intel that could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, according to Reuters — a move that could be a turnaround for Intel’s declining business. Intel’s shares were up by 3.2% during Monday morning trading, and are up by 22% so far this year. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD+0.17%) reportedly also is interested in using Intel for manufacturing, but it is not confirmed if the company is testing chips. An Intel spokesperson told Reuters that it sees “strong interest and engagement on Intel 18A across our ecosystem.” Neither Intel, Broadcom, nor AMD immediately responded to requests for comment. Nvidia declined to comment. In September, Reuters reported that Intel’s tests with Broadcom on its 18A process had failed, after Broadcom’s engineers determined it could not be used for high-volume chip production. The current tests with Nvidia and Broadcom are focused on the viability of Intel’s 18A manufacturing process and are not using finished chip designs, Reuters reported, adding that the tests could take months. In February 2024, Microsoft (MSFT-1.50%) announced that it was tapping Intel’s 18A manufacturing process for a future chip designed in-house. Former Intel chief executive Pat Gelsinger had started Intel’s contract manufacturing business in 2021, but it has not yet secured a major chip designer partner. Intel previously pushed back the 18A process to 2026, but is now delaying it by another six months, Reuters reported, citing supplier documents and unnamed people familiar with the matter. The delay has to do with qualifying intellectual property for the manufacturing process, according to Reuters. Intel told Reuters that it plans to “begin ramping production in the second half of this year, delivering on the commitments we have made to our customers.” Meanwhile, Intel has become an acquisition target for its competitors. Last month, the Wall Street Journal reported that Intel could see its business split in two by separate potential deals with Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM-0.72%). Broadcom is reportedly looking into Intel’s chip design and marketing unit, while TSMC is interested in its chip manufacturing plants.

Former Intel chief executive Pat Gelsinger had started Intel’s contract manufacturing business in 2021, but it has not yet secured a major chip designer partner. Intel previously pushed back the 18A process to 2026, but is now delaying it by another six months, Reuters reported, citing supplier documents and unnamed people familiar with the matter. The delay has to do with qualifying intellectual property for the manufacturing process, according to Reuters. Intel told Reuters that it plans to “begin ramping production in the second half of this year, delivering on the commitments we have made to our customers.” Meanwhile, Intel has become an acquisition target for its competitors. Last month, the Wall Street Journal reported that Intel could see its business split in two by separate potential deals with Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM-0.72%). Broadcom is reportedly looking into Intel’s chip design and marketing unit, while TSMC is interested in its chip manufacturing plants.

Texas-based AST SpaceMobile is laying the groundwork to deliver satellite-to-phone services across Europe amid growing competition with SpaceX’s cellular Starlink system. British carrier Vodafone, a major investor in AST, is working with the company to establish a "jointly owned European satellite service business" designed to serve mobile carriers in Europe. The joint venture, dubbed SatCo, promises to supply “100% geographic coverage in every part of Europe” to both consumers and businesses through their local mobile carriers, the companies said in the announcement. They're also emphasizing that “SatCo’s solution will fully support European digital sovereignty,” giving countries control over the data that flows through AST’s emerging satellite network. AST is preparing to operate dozens of so-called “BlueBird” satellites that can act as cell towers in space. But in Europe, SatCo is going to build the ground stations and network backhaul to feed and route the data to the BlueBird satellites. “Together with Vodafone, we are poised to accelerate our commercialization plans across all of Europe, making true mobile broadband from space a reality,” says AST CEO Abel Avellan. The European Union has been trying to develop its own satellite internet systems without relying on SpaceX’s Starlink, which has also been expanding into mobile connectivity. Separately, the EU is investing $11 billion to create a satellite internet service called IRIS² to supply high-speed broadband to governments, businesses, and consumers. In contrast, the Vodafone and AST deal is focused on mobile phones, enabling European carriers to deliver a satellite service to handsets, without any hardware modifications. Last month, Vodafone demoed the technology by using the BlueBird satellites to power a video call from a remote region in Wales that lacked traditional cell coverage. AST is also partnering with AT&T and Verizon to deliver the same capabilities to users in the US, giving consumers a way to receive connectivity in cellular dead zones. The big question is when AST can commercially launch the service. The Texas-based company has only sent five BlueBird satellites into orbit when it needs at least 45 to 60 to provide continuous coverage to users on the ground. Still, Vodafone expects the satellites to deliver the space-based mobile broadband across Europe “during 2025 and 2026.” Meanwhile, SpaceX is already operating close to 500 cellular Starlink satellites in orbit, which have begun powering SMS messaging to T-Mobile phones as part of a beta program. T-Mobile plans on officially kicking off the service in July by selling access to both its own subscribers and to customers on other carriers, including AT&T and Verizon. The cellular Starlink service will also arrive for carriers in Canada, New Zealand, and Australia. But in Europe, SpaceX seems to have only reached deals with a local carrier in Ukraine and another carrier in Switzerland. I've been working as a journalist for over 15 years—I got my start as a schools and cities reporter in Kansas City and joined PCMag in 2017. I've been following SpaceX's Starlink network for several years, writing 500+ stories on availability and feature launches, but also the regulatory battles over the expansion of satellite constellations, fights between rival providers, and the effort to expand into satellite-based mobile service.

Title: What 5 charts say about the pandemic’s impact, 5 years later

Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The industry may be far from the dramatic day-to-day struggles of 2020, but it hasn’t yet escaped the long tail the global health crisis left in its wake. The pandemic may have hit retail five years ago, but its impacts came in wave after relentless wave for months after that. Immediate, dramatic effects — including widespread staff furloughs and the temporary closure of entire store footprints — gave way to longer-term challenges as supply chain chaos swept the industry. Government-funded stimulus payments, handed out to ease consumers’ pain, boosted spending, but left long-tail impacts that are still hurting retailers today. A lot of stimulus money ended up in the retail sector, which meant the industry “really ballooned” during the pandemic, according to Coresight Research’s head of global research, John Mercer. “One point we've made repeatedly is that consumers, we think, still haven't ceded what they've spent,” Mercer said, referring to the increased levels of spending shoppers adopted during that time. “But then, of course, the long-term effects of that stimulus is fueling inflation, which then obviously is challenging for consumers.” The rise of inflation also coincided with the depletion of many shoppers’ pandemic-era savings. The result? Shoppers pulled back on discretionary purchases, particularly in those categories that they overspent on while stuck inside. That’s led to the past two years of declines and stagnation in categories like home, which in turn has fueled bankruptcies, even years after COVID stopped being a regular word on the public’s lips. “We're certainly closer to the end, and there's a couple of data points that you can look to that would support that idea,” Declan Gargan, retail director at S&P Global Ratings, told Retail Dive. One of those is the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index, which measures shopper spend on goods versus services. According to that data, the pandemic-era shift towards physical goods, which has remained elevated for several years, has swung back almost entirely to its pre-pandemic share of shoppers’ wallets. “Exiting 2024, it's pretty close,” Gargan said. Mercer believes there’s still a ways to go before discretionary spending normalizes, especially because services like travel were gaining more and more share annually before the pandemic hit. A recent report from real estate firm JLL also expects service-based tenants will account for more retail leases in the coming years, in what it says is an acceleration of a decade-long shift. That suggests the long-tail trends from COVID might still be with us a while longer. “If that balance swings back to how it was before the pandemic, there's still that potential for a multiyear trend to continue in terms of services gaining at the expense of goods,” Mercer said. Still, many of the strongest impacts from the pandemic are finally starting to show up in the rear-view mirror. Here’s a closer look at some of the long-tail impacts from the global health emergency, and what they say about how the industry has recovered. The threat of e-commerce replacing physical retail circulated for years prior to the moment the pandemic forced the issue. Amazon and the rise of e-commerce made regular appearances in bankruptcy documents, with retailers declaring themselves incapable of adjusting fast enough to the shifts in consumer shopping behavior. Then 2020 happened and retailers had to adapt — or risk losing out on sales of any kind. Improving websites and services like buy online, pick up in store became critical investments across the industry as cautious consumers avoided stores even after the initial pandemic scare was over. Unlike other areas of retail that boomed in 2020, though, e-commerce growth has yet to stagnate. According to Gargan, U.S. retail e-commerce sales as a percentage of total retail sales (excluding automotive) had reached roughly 22% as of Q4 last year. That’s compared to roughly 15% in the fourth quarter of 2019. Looking at the U.S. Commerce Department’s monthly numbers, e-commerce sales in December 2024 were more than $60 billion higher than they were five years previously, a 66% gain in that time period. “We think really it's going to be the larger retailers that benefit — the ones that have the resources, that have been making investments in capital spending, strengthening their digital capabilities,” Gargan said. “They're going to take that growing share and that's a trend that we expect to continue. But that might have been accelerated in terms of consumers adopting online shopping, because they were essentially forced to in the early days.” The idea that stores will be replaced by e-commerce is still nowhere near the truth, but Mercer noted that there is more of an emphasis on where physical retail can prove its worth. The way Coresight Research views it, stores should provide convenience, collection services (as in the picking up of orders), discount offerings or be a destination for shoppers. “There are places where stores can fill in those gaps around e-commerce and digital if they focus on some of those,” Mercer said. Even so, the growth curve of e-commerce may be tapering off soon. A report from FTI Consulting last year suggested the channel was “maturing” and that it would plateau around 35% in the next decade. That still leaves about 12 percentage points of share for e-commerce to take in the coming years, per FTI’s estimate, and new entrants are also making the space more competitive. “Shein and Temu, collectively worldwide, generated sales of over $100 billion last year,” Mercer said. “Now a minority of that is in the U.S., so that's not all coming from U.S. retailers, but a chunk of it is coming from the U.S. — and those are coming predominantly from legacy retailers.” In fact, Mercer said the impact of these competitive challenges on retailers is an “underrecognized story” in the industry, perhaps sidelined given widespread policy changes and consumer sentiment concerns. All of those macro issues are leading to more pressure on legacy retailers, and heavy predictions for store closings in 2025. Numerically, 2020 was a lighter year for store closures than 2019. And 2025 could be worse than both. Partially, that’s because Coresight Research’s store count numbers are based on permanent closures and openings, which leaves out the rash of temporary store closures that swept the world in 2020. But it’s also because 2020, though bad for many retailers, also led fairly swiftly to an influx of stimulus money for shoppers, which meant more spending — and fewer closures. As a result, both 2021 and 2022 saw significantly lower store closings across the industry, with 2022 marking the lowest number since 2012, Mercer said. “And then it kind of got worse from there,” Mercer said. Store closures in 2023, for example, were the worst since 2020 — until last year surpassed them. “So these things, I think, tend to come in waves.” Openings, on the other hand, have stayed incredibly consistent over the years. That may be because the same types of retailers reliably open stores year after year, including dollar stores, grocery stores and off-price retailers. When it comes to closures, though, pandemic-era stimulus money kicked off a boom in consumer spending, which then contracted due to inflation and other pressures. Now we’re seeing the impacts of that subdued spending in an aggressive store closure prediction for 2025. Coresight Research’s expectation — that 15,000 locations could shutter this year — would equate to a 55% increase over 2020’s count, and would more than double last year’s total. But there’s reason for it. Party City ended 2024 by outlining plans to shutter its entire 700-plus store footprint, Joann’s recent announcement adds another 800-plus locations to the count and Big Lots and Macy’s are also pursuing hundreds of closures this year. “They're already piling up,” Mercer said. In addition to the lingering effects of the pandemic, a weak housing market and the overflow impacts of bankruptcies from last year, there are also increasing competitive pressures from the likes of Temu, Shein and TikTok Shop. “In some cases, retailers need to slim down their estates — and I think we see that particularly for legacy sectors like department stores and drugstores,” Mercer said. For others, like those in bankruptcy, it’s often more about reducing their cost base. But the pandemic-era pressures causing bankruptcies in some sectors may finally be easing, which could spell lighter store closure numbers in future years. For the home space, the pandemic was a fairy tale turned horror story when the enormous sales gains fueled by stay-at-home orders largely dissipated, leaving retailers reeling from the sudden (and sustained) dropoff in revenue. That category wasn’t the only one hit by shopping behavior changes — electronics and outdoors purchases also boomed in the early days of the pandemic before facing a pullback as consumers moved on from their COVID-era needs. “The pandemic — it's still impacting how consumers shop, where they're shopping and what categories they're shopping for,” Gargan said. “If you think about it, today, the areas in retail that are the most pressured tend to be kind of the specialty retailers — the ones that are focusing on more discretionary-type merchandise — and particularly those that are largely focused on home-related categories.” S&P Global Ratings isn’t expecting a significant uplift in spending across retail this year, but the categories that have been hit the hardest may finally be reaching “trough levels,” Gargan noted. Wayfair leadership said as much in the retailer’s latest earnings call, with CEO Niraj Shah commenting that the e-commerce company believes it’s reached “the bottom of this downcycle” in the home market. Best Buy announced falling electronics sales would reach the end of that cycle in 2023 — and indeed, monthly sales in the sector in 2024 were largely flat or up compared to the year prior — but not at Best Buy, which continued to see sales declines. And crafts and outdoor retailers, which are counted under the same category by the Commerce Department, continue to struggle through lackluster sales trends as well. Those pressures have led to two Joann bankruptcies in roughly a year, layoffs at the likes of REI and Patagonia, and even pullback from Dick’s Sporting Goods on its outdoors ambitions. “To really see an inflection or catalyst that would support sales growth, there's got to be some macro factors that change — and that's principally lower interest rates, bringing mortgage rates down, starting to see improving housing turnover,” Gargan said of the home space. Spaces like electronics could also start to benefit from the product renewal cycle, according to Mercer, as shoppers look to replace the laptops or TVs they bought five years ago. “We've possibly reached, or gone past, the kind of dip in stuff — ‘Oh, well, I bought it during the pandemic. I don't need it anymore,’” Mercer said. “Because five years on, things change. Things wear out. You move house — whatever.” Until sales trends fully recover from the peaks and valleys brought on by COVID, distressed retailers will still be citing the pandemic as a major driver in bankruptcy filings — and according to Gargan, many of them have reason to. “It really wasn't a precipitous dropoff, a one-year period,” Gargan said of the pandemic. “It was really kind of these incremental effects.” There was the pull forward in demand, then the supply chain disruptions, then inflation and higher interest rates. “I think those are all — you can kind of tie that back to the pandemic to some degree,” Gargan said. “And so in that regard, I think it is a fair characterization.” 2020 itself was still an enormous year for bankruptcy filings, as many retailers stopped being able to afford rent without any foot traffic to their stores, but the same trends that kept store closures at bay in 2021 and 2022 played out in bankruptcy filings. Now, faced with the reversal of those behaviors, things have ticked up again. Of the five traditional retailers that defaulted in some fashion last year, the “vast majority” cited the pandemic as a contributing cause, Gargan said of S&P Global Ratings’ data. Four of those five defaults were Chapter 11 filings, he added, which suggests lenders are less willing to negotiate with struggling retailers outside of bankruptcy court. S&P Global Ratings marked 34 bankruptcies in the consumer discretionary and retail markets overall last year. Joann is an interesting example. The retailer closed no stores during its first bankruptcy and is now liquidating its entire 800-plus footprint during its second one after a group including the retailer’s lenders won a bankruptcy auction for the company. “The relationship with their vendors, I think, was impaired beyond their expectations,” Gargan said, noting that suppliers started tightening terms prior to Joann’s first bankruptcy. “I think those issues persisted longer than Joann expected. I think they expected them to be resolved once they exited Chapter 11 the first go around.” With pandemic-driven bankruptcies and closures in 2020 also came meaningful job loss — and surges in hiring as stores reopened and shoppers returned. Layoffs in 2020 more than doubled from 2019, while hiring was up 33%. But ever since then, hiring (and, for the most part, layoffs) have been much more muted. In fact, hiring declined for three consecutive years after 2020 — and in 2024, hiring totals were nearly 40% lower than they were in 2019. Layoffs, after hitting a high of about 185,000 in 2020, were extraordinarily low for two years before popping back up to 2019 levels in 2023. Last year, layoffs were down almost 50%, though still significantly higher than retail’s stimulus-fueled years. “Whether your category is performing better than others, issuers are all facing the same elevated inflationary costs on their business — and so they're looking for ways to offset that,” Gargan said, noting that tariffs and freight rates pose uncertainties for retailers this year. Workforce reductions, like store closures, is one of the ways retailers can trim costs. In a Challenger, Gray & Christmas report earlier this year, the outplacement firm noted that retail jobs have “fundamentally changed” and require different skills than they did in the 2010s. In an email to Retail Dive, Senior Vice President Andy Challenger acknowledged the impact of the pandemic on retailers, but hinted that other forces are now at play. “The pandemic seemed to have permanently shifted how retailers staff and operate, but we've entered a new era where economic uncertainty and falling consumer confidence are driving decision-making,” Challenger said.

Don't miss out on this fantastic deal! Grab yours today! Is this better then the anker737? Dunno, I'd rather just stick to my 90W charging on Xiaomi phone at the moment. There will always be a use case for power banks, but have to wonder if their utility will be diminished now that we're entering the age of silicon carbide batteries for devices I heard new battery tech is using nuclear? https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/nuclear-battery-betavolt-… At this point you'd need thousands of these to have even a chance to run a phone. Their output power is in the pico watt range. I assume you mean Silicon carbide lithium-ion batteries ? I'm not sure how they will diminish the need for on th go charging. This Xiaomi Power Bank 25000 P03MI offers advantages over the Anker 737, including higher total output power (212W vs 140W) and faster charging speeds (up to 120W). Fomo! grab it now:) we offer 7-day change of mind on our amazon shop Does it function like a UPS similar to the Xiaomi ZMI No.20? yes, it does Apparently the 120W maximum USB-A output requires a Xiaomi 6A Type-C fast charging cable. Is such a cable included in this package? This package include a USB-C to USB-C cable with E-marker, rated at 100W capacity. The 120W output would require a compatible Xiaomi phone and the cable came with the phone. @Mostly Melbourne: Aw. Last question - is the 100W USB A to C cable that came with the ZMI No. 20 compatible with the USB A output of this power bank? Would definitely buy if it is! @anonym: Yes, the 100W USB A to C cable that came with the ZMI No. 20 should be compatible with the USB A output of the Xiaomi Hyper Power Bank (212W, 25000mAh). This power bank also supports USB A output (up to 20V6A) using Xiaomi's charging protocol. @Mostly Melbourne: My first impressions: The Xiaomi P03MI is a much improved version of its earliest iteration, the Xiaomi ZMI No.20 QB826G power bank. It has fixed pretty much all of the major flaws the QB826G had, including: Of course, the P03MI is not absolutely perfect either. My biggest complaint is that a proprietary 100W or 120W rated USB A to C cable is required to achieve a full 100W to 120W output from the USB A port, but unlike the QB826G, such a cable is not included when you purchase the P03MI. Without a proprietary Xiaomi USB A to C cable available, you will not be able to utilise the P03MI power bank to its fullest potential, and the improvements it made over the QB826G becomes rather… superfluous. In which case, I would consider the older but still very good QB826G to be the more practical and cost effective choice. Fyi, Just checked these sell for 364 chinese yuan (approx. $80 aud) on Pinduoduo app in HK. (similar to Temu). Free shipping? I think local shipping limited to HK. I had the app installed while traveling there. Bargain at aud80 ! Let me check temu now The product is an item that was previously returned, not in its original packaging, and it does not come with a one-year warranty or a seven-day no-reason return guarantee. Additionally, you need to consider the shipping cost from Hong Kong to Australia. *Slow shipping, its pretty much restricted to; A - Sea Freight B - Designated Courier Aircraft (ie. DHL) which can carry these sorts of batteries Isn't 1 year warranty default? Or are you extending it by 1 more year so it's 2yrs total? Australia customer law is above the manufacturer warranties. There is no default. You make you sell you decide all the features. I can sell something and give 1 hour warranty and free onlyfans account and one carrot cake, but I still have to follow Australian law when someone come in later with broken thing i dunno, what's that onlyfans account you mentioned? I know people will interested on that word only haha @CyberMurning: tell me more about the cake To clarify, Australian Consumer Law isn’t “above” manufacturer warranties. It is unavoidable if you are an Australian “consumer” (there are criteria, but typically, anyone who is not a business) purchasing an item from anyone conducting business in Australia. This includes manufacturers and suppliers. Relevantly, there are a set of “consumer guarantees” (and warranties) which are usually more protective than most business’ typical warranties. Some businesses (example Apple) try to account for this in their standard warranty. Example, most places in the world, Apple products come with a one year warranty. In Australia, it is one extra year by standard (two years). Some other countries have better consumer protections laws and get an even better protection through their local laws. For example, if my 2.5 year old $3,000 MacBook Pro has a serious fault, like a series of dead pixels, or a seriously degraded battery (not normal wear and tear, but perhaps down to 50% max capacity), that would be considered a serious fault and a product that costs that much shouldn’t fail within 2.5 years. Big businesses like Apple (or a supplier like JB Hi-Fi) will typically honour this and replace the item no questions asked (although they could also opt to repair or reimburse). Other businesses have the same obligations but sometimes it is like drawing water from stone. The guarantee is proportionate to the price paid. Maybe can’t expect a $400 laptop to last 3.5 years. It’s all a grey area and difficult to enforce. Definitely worthwhile being across the consumer warranties and protections, remedies etc. try looking up a brochure or leaflet on ACL or ask ChatGPT some questions, or flick through the legislation. I know but they clearly state above "Hurry! This introductory price and extended warranty are limited to the first batch, and it's first-come, first-served!" but they don't mention how long they extended it. So i was just wanting clarification on that. Thank you for your reminder. We have corrected the original text. "Warranty year" refers to one year, and we apologize for the previous incorrect statement. So based on the calculation below (thanks, ChatGPT), can i assume this is safe to be brought along for overseas travel since it's below the 100Wh travel rule? The Xiaomi Power Bank 25000 P03MI has: • Capacity: 25,000mAh • Voltage: Typically 3.63V (common for lithium-ion cells) (25000 \times 3.63) \div 1000 = 90.8Wh Or you can just click the Xiaomi website link provided by op and it'll tell you: *Suitable for air travel: This product contains five 5,000mAh battery cells with a rated capacity of 14,000mAh (5V/6A) and a battery power of 90.8Wh. According to the International Aviation Standard, power banks with less than 100Wh power are permitted on airplanes. Yes, that's correct, 90.8Wh, and it has clear labeling to ensure you can pass through security when you board the plane Just bought the Zmi hmmm… should I have waited? The ZMI QB826G is a product validated by thousands of buyers in the market. The Xiaomi product has some functional updates and different dimensions compared to the QB826G, which is why we are offering a significant discount to promote it in the market.

Title: The Dean of Student Housing: Why Core Spaces’ Dan Goldberg Invests in Niche Markets
URL: http://commercialobserver.com/2025/03/student-housing-core-spaces-dan-goldberg-invests-niche-markets/
Time Published: 2025-03-03T11:30:20Z
Full Content:
© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Dan Goldberg has charted an unlikely path to become top of his class in the student housing market. A neuroscience major at Brown University, Goldberg fell into a career on Wall Street by accident after teaching tennis to hedge fund legend Marc Lasry, who gave him an internship at Avenue Capital. From there, Goldberg spent 14 years in high finance, splitting his time between Goldman Sachs (GS) and Blackstone (BX), where he acquired $1 billion student housing portfolios and oversaw U.S. core-plus real estate investing. Now Goldberg serves as president of Chicago-based Core Spaces, a vertically integrated real estate investment firm and property manager that specializes in student housing and build-to-rent communities. Core Spaces has a portfolio of more than 45,000 student housing beds and 3,000 single-family, build-to-rent homes, with a business plan committed to innovation and outside-the-box thinking. Goldberg sat down with Commercial Observer to discuss his investment strategy. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity. Commercial Observer: You’ve been involved in student housing for almost 20 years. How did you train yourself to understand this asset class especially at a time when it was not well-known? Dan Goldberg: Well, it’s actually quite intuitive in some ways. In college, I lived in a dilapidated row house with my best friends, and the idea that there could be an option that was turnkey, that was safe, that you didn’t have to go get your utilities lined up or go find furniture on Craigslist, and had a great location seemed to be an obvious thing. Even in those early days there was a lot of fragmentation in the student housing space, and even to someone who at the time was six years out of college, it was painfully evident that it was ripe for disruption if you could build something in a great location or was just purposely built, turnkey. I do think as a value investor that there’s opacity in the space. There’s a lot of local and specific knowledge. These are buildings designed for students that are institutionally run with operating partners that have developed, through their years, very specific knowledge about what makes a good location. If you just look at a map and say, “Oh, this is on campus,” you and I both kind of know that if it’s next to the football stadium at Brown University, that’s actually a mile and a half away from anything you want to be close to, as a student. And so I saw a real value-investing opportunity to work with operating partners that had legitimate informational advances through their experience on the sites. And so kind of collectively that was my pitch, and we went from there. How did you choose the territories or colleges that you felt were ripe for disruption? Walk me through that strategy. I’ve probably been to 65 different college campuses over the last decade, which is part of the job. What we focus on at Core is big flagship public universities, typically ones that are growing. When there’s new supply that’s added, it’s typically a small percentage of the overall enrollment growth, and enrollment is, obviously, demand, so you don’t just have to take people out of that shadowy, fragmented inventory. And, in my view, the value of public education continues to be a steal, especially versus smaller private colleges, which also informs our decision to invest in those schools. For example, the University of Maryland, if you’re [enrolled] in-state or even if you’re out-of-state, it has a great value proposition, you get an incredible education. I don’t think that’s going anywhere, and I think that’s gonna be a staple for years to come, whereas some of these schools that are, you know, maybe top 50 or 100 private schools that cost $70,000 a year, I think there’s more of a threat over time to the value of that education versus the public. And so we generally focus on those types of universities. What is Core Space’s prime investment strategy or ethos? When I was at Goldman, my thesis was those types of [big, public university] markets, but also the best locations. And there were a couple of groups that would build high-rise properties at what we call the bull’s eye — which is equidistant, or walking distance, from the main quad, the main retailer, and the frat houses or social life. If you can find the bull’s eye it’s usually right next to the school bookstore, it’s a great location. So that was the thesis that I had. Core was actually around for almost a decade before I got there, and I met the company founder Marc Lifshin at University of Wisconsin in Madison, which is where one of their first large flagship projects was, and I was immediately inspired. I walked into Core’s asset and there was a music room, there was a volleyball court that turned into an ice skating rink, there was a rooftop infinity pool, and they built these penthouse units that were just a different level of design. And I remember walking around with Marc and saying “This is the nicest asset in the country I’ve ever seen, and I’ve been looking at student housing for years,” And he said, “Well, why don’t you come in a week from now. We screwed up on so many different things, let me tell you about all the lessons we learned. We’re an open book about that.” And so, what brought me to Core, and is still in our DNA, is a culture of relentless innovation and self-criticism, where we wanna push the envelope on design, on the user experience, and we wanna be open and honest about how we can continue to get better. And the student housing demographic and the profile of the renter is constantly changing. So it’s a lot of fun if you’re up for that kind of challenge because you’re always chasing and losing your target as the tenant preferences change. Not every college student has parents that can afford rents for an asset with an ice skating rink. Are these amenities a trend or the future of student housing? We’ve developed a barbell strategy over time, where we have luxury penthouse units, but on the other side of the spectrum, 30 percent to 40 percent of our projects are what are called price sets. At large public universities, there are certain tenants that are pricing sensitive, and some want a penthouse suite. That’s a cool thing to sell, and you’re gonna have people that fill in at that end of the barbell. But some of our projects now are 2,000 beds. We’re obsessed with really well-designed, efficient units that have a price point that’s somewhat commensurate with living on campus, or living a couple of miles away with a little bit more space and less amenities. So how do you differ yourself from the competition? We’re probably more well known for pushing the envelope and innovating a bit more. Let me give you some examples. Our units are more efficient than something our competitors might design, they’re proprietary designs that really haven’t been seen before. You’ve got Murphy beds that come down from the walls, and we’ve taken some bets that other competitors haven’t. We lease those beds in two months. But conventional wisdom in student housing is that you need bed-bath parity, so every bedroom has to have a bathroom. And we like to challenge ourselves and say, “You know what? Some students, especially in the Florida projects, just want a price point.” And so we ask ourselves: How do we create a great living experience that doesn’t necessarily have all of the same things that our competitors feel like are necessary? We are also obsessed with the user experience and also marketing to our students. For example, when we at leased up Knoxville, we partnered with Barstool Sports and [Hall of Fame NFL quarterback] Peyton Manning. And so, we hosted an event bringing Peyton Manning, who’s an alumni of University of Tennessee, together with this really popular podcast on Barstool Sports, and we did kind of a roommate challenge that Peyton and the Barstool team mediated, and it was a huge success. And so other student housing companies aren’t doing that. We own a lot of beds at Clemson University, and in November, we hosted a concert with a top 10 country music singer named Lee Brice in our parking lot. I don’t think any student housing company hosted a full-blown concert before. And then there’s our social media handles. We have a big brand presence in Instagram and one of our videos just hit 12 million views — I don’t understand it at all, but that’s half of all college students in the country, and those type of things differentiate Core in the market. Where do you guys source your capital from, and what do your investment partnerships look like? Most real estate transactions in the operator and developer space are one-off deals, with 60 to 65 percent leverage, where the capital is 5 to 20 percent of the equity, and you find a one-off joint venture partner to be the rest of the equity in the capital stack. And that’s what we’ve done for a long time. We have 17 different institutional capital partners—limited partners right now— in our various joint ventures. But one thing that differentiates us is we started raising closed-end funds, so that’s discretionary development capital. They’re very large discretionary investment funds, and as a company, we’ve invested a lot in fundraising and distribution channels. We have institutional sales fundraisers that have come from Wall Street to help develop more relationships with traditional funds investors, as we see that pocket of capital being a real differentiator for us. You’re also involved in the build-to-rent space. What’s the investment strategy behind those assets? The build-to-rent space feels a lot like cottage-style student housing products, and it feels ripe for disruption right now, where what’s out there doesn’t really suit the needs of people who actually want to have a feeling of a true community. I think there’s 17 million renters of noninstitutional homes right now. Our approach is the anti-”Truman Show” approach, where it feels a little bit like a movie set when you walk around some of these communities of single-family homes. And we want to try to bring our culture of really creating something that’s bespoke and that speaks to the community, but is not just a one-size-fits-all model. We want to create vibrant communities that feel like a very differentiated type of community, and so that’s the approach that we’re taking to a space that we think is ripe for disruption. It costs more to do that. How do you guys justify being different and making the single-family or the build-to-rent home a little more unique? I think some people think that build-to-rent is just for people that have no other options. We call that a rent-by-necessity demographic. But we believe that it’s not just people that can’t afford a house. If you build the right products and the right community, some people want flexibility and convenience, too. And so we are making a bet that some of our demographics, where we’re anywhere from 150 to 400 homes in our communities, where you could have some people that could afford to live in a home, but want the flexibility of a house with zero maintenance hassles. And then there are other homes that are designed really efficiently that have a much lower price point, and everywhere in between. So that’s the way that we’re able to do it. It’s slightly larger projects, which bring down our cost basis, in a belief that some of those units with a barbell strategy are not just renters by need. Do you think most Americans want to be renters of homes rather than owners who can tap into the equity of the homeownership world? For some people, yes. And I think there’s been a traditional wisdom within America that your biggest investment is equity in your house. But it’s a big liquid investment, and there are some people, especially in this Uber generation, where there’s changing preferences, that may want to have the majority of their investments in more liquid assets, like the stock market, and have the ability to move instead of just staying in a job, in the same place, where they have to be in the same house and be stuck in their property, potentially in an economic downturn. Some want to have that flexibility. And I think we believe that it’s not everyone, these are not like absolutes, but there’s a proportion of people, probably a subset of people, that would trade out of the idea of locking in on an investment and having that flexibility. But it’s a big addressable market. And so to us, it’s about being obsessed with the way that we design our spaces. For example, a lot of our competitors, especially the homebuilders, have large dining rooms. We don’t think that a lot of our renting demographic, which is generally aging millennials, are going to want a big formal dining room anymore. And we’re happy to make that bet that we can keep a price point lower on a more efficient home that has an open kitchen floor. These are basic things that we do that are a little different than a lot of competitors. What’s the best investment advice you’ve received in your career in real estate? A partner of mine at Goldman Sachs gave me advice that who you’re investing with probably matters the most. Great management teams are worth their weight in gold. And now that I’m over on the operating side, I can see that the culture, the grit, the collaboration, and the integrity of the teams is what usually differentiates investment success from investment failure.

Activate your online access Shaina Potts’s Judicial Territory examines how the American legal system created an economic environment that subordinated the entire world to domestic business interests. A woman passes by posters that read “Enough Vultures—Argentine united in a national cause” in Buenos Aires, 2014. Consider the following two stories involving legal disputes between American companies and foreign governments. In 1919, the ocean steamer The Pesaro sailed from Genoa, Italy, for New York City. Built in Germany for a German shipper and formerly named the SS Moltke, the steamer had been seized by the Italian government in 1915 after Italy entered World War I. On board for its departure to America four years later were 75 cases of artificial silk owned by a company incorporated and based in the United States called the Berizzi Brothers. When The Pesaro arrived in New York after two weeks at sea, however, the Berizzi Brothers cried foul: Only 74 cases of silk were delivered. One had been lost or damaged in transit. Eighty-two years later, a dispute on an altogether larger scale began. In 2001, with Argentina’s economy mired in recession, the country defaulted on around $93 billion of government debt, in what was then the largest sovereign debt default in history. Though a portion of that debt was owed to foreign governments, the default primarily involved private bondholders such as institutional investors. Most of these creditors would eventually agree to restructure the debt for cents on the dollar (thus booking losses), but a minority of the debt holders refused to accept this “haircut.” Like the Berizzi Brothers eight decades earlier, these holdouts, too, were based in the United States, namely a group of Wall Street “vulture funds” that had invested in the debt at distressed prices. Beyond the fact that both cases pitted American firms against foreign governments, what links these stories is that the firms in question sought legal redress for their grievances. Not only that, but they sought this redress specifically in American courts, and thus by appeal to US law. The Berizzi Brothers sued for $250 in damages; the vulture-fund owners of the Argentinian debt sued for full face value plus interest. The Berizzi Brothers’ case ended up in the US Supreme Court, and in 1926 the company lost, which is to say that the Italian government won. The Pesaro was owned and operated by Italy, and it was well established under US law that foreign governments (and their oceangoing vessels) were immune from suit in domestic courts. Yes, the Italian government was engaged in this case in a commercial activity, but it was so engaged, the court ruled, in a public rather than private capacity and with a public purpose. But the Argentine government would not prove so fortunate, twice finding itself on the receiving end of negative legal judgments in its battle with the vulture funds. The first was when the US courts decided in 2012 in favor of the creditor holdouts, ruling that the full bond value was indeed due. The second followed Argentina’s subsequent decision—highly unusual among sovereign debtors in recent decades—to stand firm and continue to not pay up. While the US courts could not directly make Argentina pay, they could and did make life extremely uncomfortable, issuing rulings from 2012 to 2014 that indirectly forced the Argentine government’s hand by prohibiting it from making payments to other creditors unless it paid the holdouts first, and by prohibiting anyone anywhere in the world except Argentina from helping the country make such payments. This pair of legal battles prompts a number of questions: What role does the law play in the arbitration of economic disputes? How does the direct involvement of sovereign states in such disputes affect that legal function? And what difference does it make when legal and economic disputes involving governments spill across national borders? These concerns have once again moved to the fore, with an explicitly protectionist and imperially minded president having taken the reins of power in America. The transition from The Pesaro and silk to Argentinian bonds and American vulture funds is an essential backdrop against which to answer these questions. In the course of eight decades, US courts seemingly made a decisive turn against foreign governments, stacking the deck in favor of American companies and becoming, in the process, a handmaiden to American empire. The two stories with which we began effectively bookend the account of transnational commercial law that Shaina Potts, a geography professor at UCLA, provides in her new book, Judicial Territory. Potts’s study is capacious, offering insights on everything from financialization and hegemony to international trade and globalization. But at the core of the book is the history of how we got from US courts being willing to rule in favor of foreign governments and against American firms in the 1920s to the opposite outcome in the 21st century. In a nutshell, that history is a chronicle of expanding US judicial authority over the economic decisions and activities of foreign governments, and in particular their relationships with private—usually American—companies. Governments that had previously been treated as sovereign and immune, such as the Italian government in its ownership and operation of The Pesaro, are no longer accorded such deference by US courts. Foreign states and their commercial dealings had not formerly been beyond the reach of US power altogether: The United States’ executive branch had rarely granted them immunity, especially when American interests were involved. What changed was that the US judiciary started to treat foreign governments exactly like private corporations, robbing them of any special legal status. This, as Potts describes it, was an epochal shift. The change began in earnest in the 1950s and ’60s, and it was initially centered on what came to be termed “the Third World” and on developments in various postcolonial countries. Independence for such countries was frequently followed—albeit sometimes not until decades later—by the nationalization of foreign-owned assets and by the establishment in their stead of state-owned enterprises. Bolivia, for instance, nationalized its tin mines; Turkey nationalized its railways, ports, and utilities; Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal; and countries ranging from Iran to Mexico nationalized their oil industries. Such nationalizations, which were integral to the plans of developing countries for a New International Economic Order, had long been regarded as beyond the purview of US law. But after World War II, a shift gradually occurred, and American courts increasingly came to treat the nationalization of US assets as unlawful expropriation. The nationalizations in Cuba on the heels of its revolution—Castro famously nationalized all American-owned sugar companies in 1960—were a particular flash point and are given special attention by Potts. The path from The Pesaro to Wall Street vulture funds, and the markedly different legal treatment accorded to the latter, were enabled by transformations—halting, uneven, and in certain respects still ongoing—in two main legal doctrines that had historically insulated foreign governments from US courts. The first concerned foreign sovereign immunity rules: Who and what were immune from lawsuits? In the 1950s, both the who and the what began to be understood by US jurists in more restrictive ways, with the result that the commercial acts of foreign states—such as Italy’s conveyance of silks to America—lost their former immunity (through the so-called “commercial exception”). The second key doctrine was “act of state.” This international legal principle asserts that acts carried out by sovereign states in their own territories—such as nationalizations—cannot be challenged by other countries’ courts. Historically, US courts fully respected this doctrine, but by the 1960s they’d started to chip away at it. In particular, commercial acts came to be excluded, just as they were from foreign sovereign immunity rules. Increasingly, it didn’t matter to US courts who a business operator or asset owner was: The activities and possessions of all economic actors (be they public or private) were no longer protected by the rules of sovereign immunity and acts of state. The expansion of US judicial authority that resulted from the parallel transformations of these two doctrines has been as audacious as it has been largely unnoticed outside of narrow legal circles. It has also been multidimensional: While the juridical encroachment on foreign sovereignty has perhaps been most notable in cases of financial contracts (with creditor rights typically being privileged, as with Argentina’s debt), the phenomena newly falling within the ambit of US law are far more extensive. Anything that conceivably could be subjected to the transnational application of US domestic commercial laws has been. This includes, for example, cigars: A landmark case was Alfred Dunhill of London, Inc. v. Republic of Cuba (1976), in which the US Supreme Court ruled against the Cuban government, which had nationalized the cigar industry and subsequently refused to return the money mistakenly paid to it for pre-nationalization cigar shipments by importers in the United States. All that has been required to bring foreign governments to heel, Potts shows, is to successfully argue that the relationships or activities in dispute are “merely economic” (that is, private and commercial) rather than public and political, which is an argument that US courts have been increasingly happy to accept. Meanwhile, alongside this expansion of what is litigable in the United States, more striking still has been the expansion of who can be sued and where the relevant activities or assets are located. Today, no sovereign government can operate without the risk of falling afoul of US laws and being held so accountable, and this is true wherever in the world they happen to be operating. Indeed, while making foreign governments subject to US laws for what they do in America is one thing, making them subject to these laws for what they do elsewhere, including in their own countries, is something else entirely. Yet that is precisely what has come to pass. In 1990, the Nigerian government found itself embroiled in a US court case involving a contract it had awarded for the construction of a military hospital in Nigeria. Why? One American firm had accused another of having secured the contract through the bribery of Nigerian officials. The US Supreme Court decided that it did have the power to adjudicate the bribery accusation, thus reminding foreign governments the world over that they cannot deal with American firms, even at home, without considering how US courts will judge those dealings. (President Trump has recently weighed in on the appropriate course of judgment, telling US jurists to stop ruling against such bribery: “It’s going to mean a lot more business for America,” he said.) As Potts insists, it is surely a sea change of profound political significance that, over the course of several decades in the post–World War II era, the US legal system has “helped make the whole world part of US economic space.” The transformations discussed in Judicial Territory are, as Potts admits, familiar ones to certain legal experts and well documented by legal historians. The particular importance and value of her new account lies in refusing the idea—implicit if not always explicit in the bulk of the existing literature—that this is merely a technocratic history, consisting merely of technical juridical tweaks. This process was not technocratic whatsoever, but partisan and nationalistic—thoroughly political from start to finish. To begin with, the timing of the commencement of this shift in legal treatment—in the 1950s—was anything but happenstance. It coincided both with an upsurge in the socialist and postcolonial nations pursuing economic development models that prioritized domestic populations and industries rather than multinational (increasingly, US) capital, and with the diminishing potential for powerful Western countries to strangle those upstart development models in ways they had in the past. The American courts’ growing subordination of the international arena into merely another jurisdiction of US domestic law is part and parcel, then, of a longer and larger historical policy of containment. Hence, the history that Potts narrates refuses technicist readings every step of the way. Behind the expansion of US judicial reach in the second half of the 20th century was the desire and determination of US government and corporate actors to tame statist national economic models overseas and to nip in the bud any developments remotely inimical to the interests of US capital. Much of the richness of Potts’s account is found in its careful identification of the primary nonjudicial actors (the private companies, investors, and policymakers with intimate connections to both constituencies) that animated and motivated these historical juridical transformations. The value and importance of Judicial Territory also lies in Potts’s assessment of the consequences and indeed intrinsic nature of the massive expansion of US judicial authority. One of the most enduring puzzles of the postcolonial age has been the question of why previously colonized countries so frequently failed to flourish once the colonizers were sent packing and formal sovereign status had been achieved. Potts does not exactly situate her study as an answer to that question, but an answer—one adding to and complementing a range of existing answers—is nonetheless what she indubitably provides. Postcolonial nations have widely failed to thrive, Potts effectively argues, because in reality they remained part of a de facto empire, although in this case an American as opposed to a British, German, or Spanish one; and this has served to undermine their nominal sovereignty. In fact, the refreshing thing about Potts’s book is that she makes no bones about it: Imperialism is clearly what we are dealing with here. But it is a different type of imperialism, one where exogenous judicial authority increasingly stands in for military or executive authority. Her book is a call to treat the United States as an imperial power precisely (although not exclusively) because of this extension across international space of US legal authority and, correspondingly, of the interests of US capital. Potts writes of the latter-day American empire evincing a “judicial modality”—of foreign sovereign nations and their peoples being subordinated to America by law rather than by colonial occupation or military force. What is perhaps most insidious about the “imperial modality”—another striking Potts framing—of US judicial power is the extent to which it was designed to quietly snuff out “postcolonialism.” The expansion of US judicial territory after World War II, Potts writes, “enabled the United States to continue exercising substantial authority over the decisions of foreign governments in an age of avowed anti-imperialism and formal sovereign equality.” More than that, the turn to law was a mechanism of the active disavowal of empire. “The recoding of many foreign policy issues as merely legal,” Potts notes at one point, “has been an especially potent way for the United States to obscure its own imperial operations.” Or, as she puts it elsewhere, the trick has been “to cloak the pursuit of US geopolitical and geoeconomic goals (always entangled to a large degree with private corporate interests) in the guise of the ‘rule of law.’” For that, of course, is the thing about law: its self-professed impartiality and, well, judiciousness. A modern-day empire rooted in law, of all things? The very idea seems counterintuitive, absurd even. Yet that is what Judicial Territory presents us with: empire camouflaged by the veneer of fairness that the law furnishes. If, as Carl von Clausewitz famously argued, war is merely the continuation of politics by other means, then, for Potts, law—at least the transnational application of domestic American commercial law—represents the continuation of empire by other means. Just as Indigenous populations worldwide resisted the imposition of foreign occupation and rule that was European colonialism, so too have national governments worldwide—to varying extents and with varying degrees of determination—resisted and challenged the postwar expansion of US judicial authority. Potts recounts many such examples of confrontation. The Cuban government has long been a particular irritant for the United States in this respect, repeatedly and robustly arguing against the overreach of American judicial authority. But Potts is also clear-eyed about the fact that, for the most part, these challenges have ultimately been in vain: “Once judicial decisions are made,” she observes, “most foreign governments do obey them most of the time.” But why? After all, as Potts notes, “transnational law is not backed directly by the enforcement power of the police the way domestic law is.” Her answer emphasizes the chilling impact of the economic blackballing that routinely comes with not conforming: “Foreign governments simply cannot afford to be locked out of US markets or legal services.” Elie Mystal Jeet Heer Eoin Higgins Dave Zirin The case of Argentina’s defaulted debt and the vulture-fund holdouts appeared, at least, to represent something of a counterpoint to this tendency. When the US courts initially ruled in 2012 that the country did have to pay the vulture funds in full, Argentina continued to refuse to do so. It held firm. But that was not the end of the matter. As mentioned, the courts proceeded over the next two years to ratchet up the pressure further—effectively blocking Argentina from paying its other bondholders unless it first paid the holdouts in full—and in the end, the government buckled: In 2016, it settled with the vulture funds to the tune of more than $10 billion. Why? Argentina had essentially been excluded from the international capital markets while making its stand, compounding its domestic economic strife. Settling with the holdouts enabled Argentina to restore its credibility in the markets, issue new debt, and take measures to stabilize its economy. In the end, Argentina had no real choice, besides isolationism, other than to settle. Settling was structurally required of it, given the country’s dependent positioning in the circuits of international finance. Economists call this structural bind “international financial subordination,” by which they mean that fundamental inequality in the global financial system structurally subordinates less powerful states and constrains their financial autonomy. What Potts has brought to light with Judicial Territory is the crucial role of the law in fashioning and enforcing such subordination—that is, in demanding and securing the obedience of sovereign states. And the vulture funds? They made out like the bandits. According to data published by the courts in conjunction with the 2016 settlement, the funds each earned returns on investment of between 300 and 1,000 percent. But in its own analysis of the numbers, The Wall Street Journal found that one fund, Florida’s Elliott Investment Management, had actually achieved a return of up to 1,400 percent. Elliott was very much the public face of the vulture funds in the lengthy battle with Argentina, receiving endless brickbats for its leading role in facing down the Latin American sovereign. Indeed, the normalization of the term “vulture” to refer to Elliott and the other investment funds involved in the litigation plainly indexed the way they were widely viewed: as operating somehow beyond the acceptable pale. “Elliott is the ugly face of America,” one critic, capturing the mood, exclaimed in 2018. But to suggest that an investment fund such as Elliott is an aberration from contemporary American capitalism is to miss the point entirely. Insofar as it trades on the rule of law that the United States propagates and exercises globally, Elliott is American capitalism’s globalizing arm, its vanguard rather than black sheep. Argentina’s government was demonstrating an “inexhaustible disregard for the rule of law,” Paul Singer, Elliott’s founder and president, opined in a letter to his clients at the height of the dispute. In 2014, a banker who’d done business with the firm was asked by a journalist what made Elliott so successful. “They have deep respect for the rule of law and they expect others to share it,” the banker said. But what would happen if Singer and his colleagues ever sensed that others did not share this “respect”? “I think you know the answer,” the banker replied. Donald Trump’s cruel and chaotic second term is just getting started. In his first month back in office, Trump and his lackey Elon Musk (or is it the other way around?) have proven that nothing is safe from sacrifice at the altar of unchecked power and riches.

Title: AI Briefing: Ad verification’s duarchy touts AI to Wall Street amid expansion plans

Join us at the Digiday Publishing Summit from March 24-26 in Vail DoubleVerify and Integral Ad Science have spent years as rivals focused on brand safety and verification, tasked with protecting the world’s biggest brands from showing up in problematic places. However, as recent reports show, things can slip through the cracks. Now, they’re moving beyond the open web, using AI offerings — some built internally and some acquired — to compete for new types of advertisers in new ad arenas. Both companies, which reported earnings late last week, showed off their road map for winning over mid-market advertisers across new channels like social media, CTV, and retail media. They’re also moving beyond the thorny issue of brand safety to try and prove themselves in yet another tricky area: performance and measurement. On a call with analysts, DoubleVerify CEO Mark Zagorski described 2025 as a “transition year” following what he acknowledged was a disappointing quarter. He said DoubleVerify is still in the investment phase of building out new tools across social, sell-side tools, outcomes and attribution. One part of the plan is the newly announced $85 million deal to buy Rockerbox to help build out new capabilities around performance attribution and optimization. Rockerbox, which DoubleVerify estimates will contribute around $8 million in revenue this year, will also help unlock a new segment of mid-market, direct-response advertisers to widen its addressable market. Zagorski emphasized the deal fits into DoubleVerify’s broader strategy of transforming its business from a static verification exercise into something more holistic. “You have to innovate, or you will die,” Zagorski said. “So we think there’s an opportunity for us to continue to invest in growth.” Some ad tech experts say buying Rockerbox makes strategic sense and will help compete in curated media buying and measurement. Others wonder if it might compromise the third-party verifier’s neutrality but say it might also give DoubleVerify more incentive to improve media quality. The acquisition could help with DoubleVerify’s push to attract small-to-medium businesses (SMBs) and expand beyond brand safety into performance validation. Karsten Weide, an analyst at W Media Research, said it could also give DoubleVerify a performance edge against competitors like IAS and Human — and against Adjust and AppsFlyer, which don’t have media quality expertise. “The opportunities this acquisition presents are substantial,” Weide wrote in a post about the deal. “First, it broadens DV’s [sic] total addressable market by targeting small to mid-sized performance companies, a segment historically underserved by its enterprise-focused offerings.” Industry analysts are split on the deal’s financial logic. Weide said the $85 million price tag is steep, especially if Rockerbox is only expected to generate only $8 million in revenue this year. However, Gartner analyst Andrew Frank said $85 million is a “pretty small deal in the overall scheme of things.” He’s interested in Rockerbox’s use of synthetic data — a growing trend in AI adoption — to model missing exposures and infer ads that may have contributed to a sale. “It’s going to plug more and more holes in the targeting and measurement foundation, which has been a growing problem for a lot of advertisers as well as the publishers who are trying to convince them that the ads are worth it,” Frank said. On Integral Ad Science’s earnings call with analysts, CEO Lisa Utzschneider said there’s a lot of room to go after mid-market advertisers. She defined the category as companies that generate between $200,000 and $1 million in revenue for IAS. “We are investing both in the front end in investing in more sellers, more support, more technical support,” Utzschneider said. “And on the back end, performance really matters to the mid-market advertisers. So pouring fuel on our performance products, investing in automation and self-serve.” DoubleVerify and IAS have expanded efforts across social media offering more measurement and activation within walled gardens like Meta and TikTok. Last month, both announced new content-level avoidance integrations for Facebook and Instagram Feeds and Reels. Like its rival, IAS is working to bring its AI offerings into walled gardens. Last month, it announced content blocklist optimization tools across Meta’s platforms. Earlier this year, IAS debuted a new deal with Reddit to let advertisers integrate AI tools from IAS to measure brand safety and suitability campaigns. So far, DoubleVerify only measures 5% of all U.S. social impressions, but it’s already become a $110 million business, Zagorski said. DoubleVerify also sees both Rockerbox and Scibids playing roles in social media by combining Rockerbox’s performance data and Scibids’ AI optimization. DoubleVerify plans to use its Universal Content Intelligence AI platform to help advertisers avoid unsuitable content and optimize performance. It has also expanded its brand safety tools across TikTok and YouTube. One analyst asked if Meta’s plans to pull back from fact-checking might give IAS an inroad. Utzschneider said it’s too soon to tell but also noted the topic came up a lot during CES in meetings with advertisers. “I will say our role in the digital ecosystem, our role in providing a best-in-class multimedia classification in all of the major live feeds of social platforms, is a tailwind for our business,” she said. “The brands were very clear during CES….They’re leaning into us to help navigate with them the environment that we’re operating in right now, and that’s a big reason why we continue to invest deeply in our tech.” DoubleVerify and IAS have both been under increased pressure to improve their brand safety efforts following the recent Adalytics report and subsequent letters from Congress expressing concerns about everything from URL reporting to more transparency into how its AI systems operate. Adalytics wasn’t mentioned on either earnings call, but some of the questions analysts asked seemed to have it in mind. One analyst asked about DV’s plans to expand URL-level reporting. Zagorski noted it’s more about making features more broadly available than offering anything new and added that it’s “more of a transparency initiative than an actual revenue or growth driver.” “It kind of shows our commitment to driving greater transparency in the ecosystem to giving our advertisers comfort and confidence in where and how they’re buying,” Zagorski said. “…We look at it as part of our responsibility in driving trust in the ecosystem.” Whether advertisers will continue to trust DoubleVerify and IAS with their spend is something Wall Street will have to wait until next quarter to find out. Nothing is decided yet, but if Coca-Cola does opt for a change then Publicis Groupe is the frontrunner to handle its media dollars in North America, which is reportedly worth close to $1 billion. The ad tech giant’s path back into shareholders’ favor could put pressure on its ties with media agencies. The Parisian holding company has invested more than $1.5 billion in acquisitions over the past six months.

Title: Tech Insider: A cheap home EV charger that’s made in NZ, AWS’s local financials revealed

Full Content:
Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Evnex founder and CEO Ed Harvey outside his firm's Christchurch headquarters and manufacturing plant. Photo / Chris Keall Christchurch’s Evnex releases a home EV charger for the cost-of-living-crisis era. Amazon’s cloud division, AWS, reveals its latest NZ financials. Alexa gets AI smarts. DOGE “cuts” hit Wellington man Peter Griffin. Evnex’s brag line has always been that it’s the maker of the world’s slimmest home EV chargers. Now it’s also a contender for those feeling the cost-of-living pinch, its founder Ed Harvey says. The Christchurch firm’s new E2 Core smart charger is on a $999 launch special, putting it in play in the crowded sub-$1000 bracket. (Installation can double the price, depending on where your switchboard is located and other factors. The same games for all brands, so remember to factor this if you’re shopping around for a home charger.) The E2 Core is a 7-watt model, meaning you can add around 50km of range for every hour your EV (electric vehicle) is plugged in (the exact amount will vary by make and model; most EVs are supported). There’s an app and Wi-Fi support, and the ability to automatically delay charging until off-peak rates kick in. Harvey says the emphasis is on building a system that will appeal to the second wave of EV buyers, who’re often less technical than the early adopters. An E2 Plus model ($1299) adds frills, including support for Tesla features. Higher up the Evnex food chain, the E7 ($2065) offers 11W charging for around 75km of range per hour or 22W for about 120km of range for every hour your EV is plugged in. Harvey founded Evnex in Christchurch in 2014, after he converted his 1997 Honda Accord to electric power as a university project. The company is now New Zealand’s biggest manufacturer of EV chargers and software, and has recently expanded into Australia in 2023. He says Evnex has sold 8000 chargers over its lifetime and is set to double that amount over the next 18 months. Manufacturing will stay in Christchurch, and Evnex will stick to incorporating recycled materials and using printed circuit boards made by another Christchurch company, GPC Electronics. Harvey is loyal to the city. And he adds, candidly, that his firm just doesn’t have the scale to make it worth retooling for a Chinese plant. Regardless, “It only takes 20 minutes to assemble one of our chargers,” he says. “That’s pretty efficient.” Beyond Made in NZ and environmental appeal, Evnex is a charging partner for several new-vehicle brands including Polstar, Volkswagen, Volvo, Skoda, Cupra, Subaru and LDV in New Zealand. So for example Polestar (sold by Giltrap Group) pushes the Evnex chargers on its website and offers its buyers special pricing. Harvey spoke to the Herald from Sydney, where he’s now spending a lot of his time. There are five reasons. Despite some trimming, Australia still offers incentives for buying an EV (which vary by state). And there are no road user charges for EV owners (Victoria tried, but had its effort struck down by the state’s High Court, which ruled it unconstitutional). Australian private equity firm Adamantem took a 33% stake in Evnex (and half its board seats) through its $350m Environmental Opportunities Fund (the price was undisclosed; earlier Harvey told the Herald he was looking for around $10m). That made it the largest single shareholder in Evnex ahead of Harvey, and earlier backers Movac and Sir Stephen Tindall’s K1W1 – who supported a $3m seed round in 2021 – which both hold small stakes. If Adamantem’s name sounds familiar, it’s the firm that last year had a tilt at The Warehouse Group. It has investments in a range of businesses in New Zealand and Australia, including the sausage and bacon business Hellers, where it took control for $213m in 2018. It also owns EdgeZero (low-voltage grid monitoring) and electrical products maker Legend Corp. Harvey says that in Australia, this is even more so the case, with drivers now getting paid to charge in the middle of the day due to too much solar energy being generated. Australia has much higher home solar uptake, making it more fertile ground for Evnex’s more expensive solar-supporting X series. The Lucky Country is being bombed with new Chinese brands as Biden-era US tariffs – now being expanded by Trump II – push stock Dowunder (a phenomenon we’re also seeing, to a slightly lesser degree, on this side of the ditch). And lastly and definitely not leastly: “Cost of living is still an issue in Australia, but the economy is doing comparatively better than New Zealand. People probably aren’t tightening their belts quite as much,” Harvey says. The National-led Government has pledged to expand the current public charger network to 10,000 points by 2030, although details are still fuzzy. Would Harvey like to see some of that funding go to smart home chargers? He keeps his answer broad strokes. “We’d like to see some more incentives for EVs in New Zealand. We think the current Government is under-doing it a bit,” Harvey says. He would also like to see regulatory changes for the likes of pre-wiring for chargers in new apartment blocks (retrofits can be very expensive) and to make it easier – or simply possible – for kerbside solutions for townhouse dwellers and others without garages. “The less oil we require, the more we end up supporting our own state-owned electricity generators,” Harvey adds. “So I think it will be really great to see the National Party consider a little bit more about their policy because we import roughly $3 billion worth of fuel a year. And the more electric vehicles we have, the less reliant we are on that.” Amazon Web Services New Zealand made a net profit of $23.3m on net sales that rose 11% to $425.7m for the 12 months to December 31, 2024, according to accounts filed with the Companies Office on Friday. In 2023, AWS NZ made a net loss of $2.8m on net sales of $384.6m. The firm – 100% owned by its US parent Amazon.com Inc – made a $4.9m provision for income tax for 2024 vs $1.8m in 2023. Cash and equivalents increased to $105.7m from $57.0m. Payroll costs fell to $7.1m from $7.4m in 2023. Amazon bought land for its supermassive new Auckland data centre – construction has just kicked off at Westgate – via a separate vehicle created for the project, AWS Data Services, which has yet to file public accounts. In revenue terms, AWS is easily the global market leader in cloud services. Earlier this month, Amazon said AWS’ global revenue increased 19% to $28.79 billion in the fourth quarter as it continued to ride the AI boom. “Virtually every application that we know of today is going to be reinvented with AI inside of it,” Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy said. The local operation’s results were also informed by changes in inhouse expenses, with costs incurred from related party transactions swinging in AWS NZ’s favour. AWS declined an interview over its financials, in keeping with the usual approach from its Big Tech peers. Notes with AWS’s accounts note that New Zealand passed legislation last year to support the OECD’s Base Erosion and Profit-Shifting (BEPS) initiative. Specificiallly, BEPS’ “Pillar Two” - that is, a global minimum corporate tax of 15%. The legislation came into effect on January 1. The returning President Donald Trump has pledged to dismantle Pillar Two - and even signed an executive order asking Federal agencies to “explore” retaliatory measures. Regardless, tax experts told the Herald that New Zealand would get little-to-no extra revenue from Pillar Two, given any top-up tax paid to reach the 15% minimum will be paid in a Big Tech firm’s home country. Amazon has previewed a conversational AI, dubbed Alexa+, for its Echo line of smart displays and screens and Fire TV - which spans from Amazon’s own gadgets to a new alliance with Panasonic to power its latest smart TVs. Head of devices Panos Panay fired off commands with natural phrasing: “Alexa, what’s that song that Bradley Cooper sings and it’s like a duet?” A speaker began playing “Shallow.” He followed up with: “Alexa, can you jump to the scene in the movie?” A nearby Fire TV opened the film “A Star Is Born,” right to the climactic scene. New Alexa Routines infer what you mean without an explicit request, like adjusting the temperature on your smart thermostat when you say you’re cold, or dimming the lights when you say it’s too bright, Panay said. You could already chat with Alexa, but now it looks smoother and easier. Notably, Panay’s demos were all live. Amazon says the new features will work with its own services plus those from the likes of GrubHub, OpenTable, Ticketmaster, Yelp, TripAdvisor, Whole Foods Market (the supermarket chain owned by Amazon), Uber, Spotify, Apple Music, Pandora, Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, Max and smart home devices from companies like Philips Hue in the US - where Alexa+ will launch from March at US$19.99 per month, or free for subscribers to the US$14.99 per month Amazon Prime (which in the US is a more all-embracing service that includes deliveries). The no-extra cost touch will be appreciated by those annoyed by the approach taken by rivals (read: Tech Insider: Google follows Microsoft in raising prices as it bundles AI). Amazon plans to expand Alexa+ beyond the US but there’s no timeline at this point. The firm says it will supply more details on the local experience and pricing closer to its NZ launch. The launch was a bit delayed. Amazon was initially shaping up for an upgrade in late 2023, during the first wave of LLM hype around ChatGPT. But it still has breathing space. Apple has yet to add Apple Intelligence to its HomePods, while Google’s Gemini is still only available to a subset of its smart speaker users under a preview programme launched in December. The Elon Musk-driven Department of Government Efficiency has been lauded by some for employing a tech industry-style “move fast and break things” model. But according to a New York Times audit, its errors are piling up. DOGE has claimed US$65b in savings but has only itemised US$10b - and with that US10b there have been a number of gross exaggerations. In one case, DOGE listed a contract worth US$8 million as actually being worth US$8 billion. In another, it mistakenly counted the same US$655 million contract three times. In a third, it claimed it had saved $149 million by canceling a contract for three administrative assistants at the National Institutes of Health worth about $1.4 million. And then there’s a slew of contracts “cancelled” that actually expired years ago. For example, “While George W. Bush was president, the US Coast Guard signed a contract to get administrative help from a company in Northern Virginia. It paid $144,000, and the contract was completed by June 30, 2005,” the Times says. “Twenty years passed. Presidents came and went. “Last week, Elon Musk’s restructuring team, called the Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE, said it had just canceled the long-dead Coast Guard contract — and in doing so, saved U.S. taxpayers $53.7 million. There have been local examples, too. Wellington-based tech commentator Peter Griffin posted: “I got the following email from the US State Department over the weekend informing me that a grant a NZ charity I’m involved in was given by the State Department is being terminated.” Griffin added, “But the grant ended years ago and the money is already spent. I’d say a lot of cancelled programmes and funding is actually tidying up an out-of-date database. Chris Keall is an Auckland-based member of the Herald’s business team.

How the sun rose on the Silicon Valley How the sun rose on the Silicon Valley IN 1948 THERE WERE seven thousand people in Grinnell, Iowa, including more than one who didn’t dare take a drink in his own house without pulling the shades down first. It was against the law to sell liquor in Grinnell, but it was perfectly legal to drink it at home. So it wasn’t that. It wasn’t even that someone might look in through the window and disapprove. God knew Grinnell had more than its share of White Ribbon teetotalers, but by 1948 alcohol was hardly the mark of Cain it had once been. No, those timid souls with their fingers through the shade loops inside the white frame houses on Main Street and Park Street were thinking of something else altogether. They happened to live on land originally owned by the Congregational minister who had founded the town in 1854, Josiah Grinnell. Josiah Grinnell had sold off lots with covenants, in perpetuity, stating that anyone who allowed alcohol to be drunk on his property forfeited ownership. In perpetuity! In perpetuity was forever, and 1948 was not even a hundred years later. In 1948 there were people walking around Grinnell who had known Josiah Grinnell personally. They were getting old; Grinnell had died in 1891; but they were still walking around. So... why take a chance! The plain truth was, Grinnell had Middle West written all over it. It was squarely in the middle of Iowa’s Midland corn belt, where people on the farms said “crawdad” instead of crayfish and “barn lot” instead of barnyard. Grinnell had been one of many Protestant religious communities established in the mid-nineteenth century after Iowa became a state and settlers from the East headed for the farmlands. The streets were lineal with white clapboard houses and elm trees, like a New England village. And today, in 1948, the hard-scrubbed Octagon Soap smell of nineteenth-century Protestantism still permeated the houses and Main Street as well. That was no small part of what people in the East thought of when they heard the term “Middle West.” For thirty years writers such as Sherwood Anderson, Sinclair Lewis, and Carl Van Vechten had been prompting the most delicious sniggers with their portraits of the churchy, narrow-minded Middle West. The Iowa painter Grant Wood was thinking of farms like the ones around Grinnell when he did his famous painting American Gothic. Easterners recognized the grim, juiceless couple in Wood’s picture right away. There were John Calvin’s and John Knox’s rectitude reigning in the sticks. In the fall of 1948 Harry Truman picked out Grinnell as one of the stops on his whistle-stop campaign tour, one of the hamlets where he could reach out to the little people, the average Americans of the heartland, the people untouched by the sophisticated opinion-makers of New York and Washington. Speaking from the rear platform of his railroad car, Truman said he would never forget Grinnell, because it was Grinnell College, the little Congregational academy over on Park Street, that had given him his first honorary degree. The President’s fond recollection didn’t cut much ice, as it turned out. The town had voted Republican in every presidential election since the first time Abraham Lincoln ran, in 1860, and wasn’t about to change for Harry Truman. On the face of it, there you had Grinnell, Iowa, in 1948: a piece of mid-nineteenth-century American history frozen solid in the middle of the twentieth. It was one of the last towns in America that people back east would have figured to become the starting point of a bolt into the future that would create the very substructure, the electronic grid, of life in the year 2000 and beyond. On the other hand, it wouldn’t have surprised Josiah Grinnell in the slightest. IT WAS IN THE SUMMER of 1948 that Grant Gale, a forty-five-year-old physics professor at Grinnell College, ran across an item in the newspaper concerning a former classmate of his at the University of Wisconsin named John Bardeen. Bardeen’s father had been dean of medicine at Wisconsin, and Gale’s wife Harriet’s father had been dean of the engineering school, and so Bardeen and Harriet had grown up as fellow faculty brats, as the phrase went. Both Gale and Bardeen had majored in electrical engineering. Eventually Bardeen had taught physics at the University of Minnesota and had then left the academic world to work for Bell Laboratories, the telephone company’s main research center, in Murray Hill, New Jersey. And now, according to the item, Bardeen and another engineer at Bell, Walter Brattain, had invented a novel little device they called a transistor. It was only an item, however; the invention of the transistor in 1948 did not create headlines. The transistor apparently performed the same function as the vacuum tube, which was an essential component of telephone relay systems and radios. Like the vacuum tube, the transistor could isolate a specific electrical signal, such as a radio wave, and amplify it. But the transistor did not require glass tubing, a vacuum, a plate, or a cathode. It was nothing more than two minute gold wires leading to a piece of processed germanium less than a sixteenth of an inch long, shaped like a tiny brick. Germanium, an element found in coal, was an insulator, not a conductor. But if the germanium was contaminated with impurities, it became a “semiconductor.” A vacuum tube was also a semiconductor; the vacuum itself, like the germanium, was an insulator. But as every owner of a portable radio knew, vacuum tubes drew a lot of current, required a warm-up interval before they would work, and then got very hot. A transistor eliminated all these problems and, on top of that, was about fifty times smaller than a vacuum tube. So far, however, it was impossible to mass-produce transistors, partly because the gold wires had to be made by hand and attached by hand two thousandths of an inch apart. But that was the telephone company’s problem. Grant Gale wasn’t interested in any present or future applications of the transistor in terms of products. He hoped the transistor might offer a way to study the flow of electrons through a solid (the germanium), a subject physicists had speculated about for decades. He thought it would be terrific to get some transistors for his physics department at Grinnell. So he wrote to Bardeen at Bell Laboratories. Just to make sure his request didn’t get lost in the shuffle, he also wrote to the president of Bell Laboratories, Oliver Buckley. Buckley was from Sloane, Iowa, and happened to be a Grinnell graduate. So by the fall of 1948 Gale had obtained two of the first transistors ever made, and he presented the first academic instruction in solid-state electronics available anywhere in the world, for the benefit of the eighteen students majoring in physics at Grinnell College. One of Grant Gale’s senior physics majors was a local boy named Robert Noyce, whom Gale had known for years. Bob and his brothers, Donald, Gaylord, and Ralph, lived just down Park Street and used to rake leaves, mow the lawn, baby-sit, and do other chores for the Gales. Lately Grant Gale had done more than his share of agonizing over Bob Noyce. Like his brothers, Bob was a bright student, but he had just been thrown out of school for a semester, and it had taken every bit of credit Gale had in the local favor bank, not only with other faculty members but also with the sheriff, to keep the boy from being expelled for good and stigmatized with a felony conviction. Bob Noyce’s father, Ralph Sr., was a Congregational minister. Not only that, both of his grandfathers were Congregational ministers. But that hadn’t helped at all. In an odd way, after the thing happened, the boy’s clerical lineage had boomeranged on him. People were going around saying, “Well, what do you expect from a preacher’s son?” It was as if people in Grinnell unconsciously agreed with Sherwood Anderson that underneath the righteousness the midwestern Protestant preachers urged upon them, and which they themselves professed to uphold, lived demons of weakness, perversion, and hypocrisy that would break loose sooner or later. No one denied that the Noyce boys were polite and proper in all outward appearances. They were all members of the Boy Scouts. They went to Sunday School and the main Sunday service at the First Congregational Church and were active in the church youth groups. They were pumped full of Congregationalism until it was spilling over. Their father, although a minister, was not the minister of the First Congregational Church. He was the associate superintendent of the Iowa Conference of Congregational Churches, whose headquarters were at the college. The original purpose of the college had been to provide a good academic Congregational education, and many of the graduates became teachers. The Conference was a coordinating council rather than a governing body, since a prime tenet of the Congregational Church, embedded in its name, was that each congregation was autonomous. Congregationalists rejected the very idea of a church hierarchy. A Congregational minister was not supposed to be a father or even a shepherd but, rather, a teacher. Each member of the congregation was supposed to internalize the moral precepts of the church and be his own priest dealing directly with God. So the job of secretary of the Iowa Conference of Congregational Churches was anything but a position of power. It didn’t pay much either. The Noyces didn’t own their own house. They lived in a two-story white clapboard house that was owned by the church at Park Street and Tenth Avenue, at the college. Not having your own house didn’t carry the social onus in Grinnell that it did in the East. There was no upper crust in Grinnell. There were no top people who kept the social score in such matters. Congregationalists rejected the idea of a social hierarchy as fiercely as they did the idea of a religious hierarchy. The Congregationalists, like the Presbyterians, Methodists, Baptists, and United Brethren, were Dissenting Protestants. They were direct offshoots of the Separatists, who had split off from the Church of England in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and settled New England. At bottom, their doctrine of the autonomous congregation was derived from their hatred of the British system of class and status, with its endless gradations, topped off by the Court and the aristocracy. Even as late as 1948 the typical small town of the Middle West, like Grinnell, had nothing approaching a country club set. There were subtle differences in status in Grinnell, as in any other place, and it was better to be rich than poor, but there were only two obvious social ranks: those who were devout, educated, and hardworking, and those who weren’t. Genteel poverty did not doom one socially in Grinnell. Ostentation did. The Noyce boys worked at odd jobs to earn their pocket money. That was socially correct as well as useful. To have devoted the same time to taking tennis lessons or riding lessons would have been a gaffe in Grinnell. Donald, the oldest of the four boys, had done brilliantly at the college and had just received his Ph.D. in chemistry at Columbia University and was about to join the faculty of the University of California at Berkeley. Gaylord, the second oldest, was teaching school in Turkey. Bob, who was a year younger than Gaylord, had done so well in science at Grinnell High School that Grant Gale had invited him to take the freshman physics course at the college during his high school senior year. He became one of Gale’s star students and most tireless laboratory workers from that time on. Despite his apparent passion for the scientific grind, Bob Noyce turned out to be that much-vaunted creature, the well-rounded student. He was a trim, muscular boy, five feet eight, with thick dark brown hair, a strong jawline, and a long, broad nose that gave him a rugged appearance. He was the star diver on the college swimming team and won the Midwest Conference championship in 1947. He sang in choral groups, played the oboe, and was an actor with the college dramatic society. He also acted in a radio drama workshop at the college, along with his friend Peter Hackes and some others who were interested in broadcasting, and was the leading man in a soap opera that was broadcast over station WOI in Ames, Iowa. Perhaps Bob Noyce was a bit too well rounded for local tastes. There were people who still remembered the business with the box kite back in 1941, when he was thirteen. It had been harmless, but it could have been a disaster. Bob had come across some plans for the building of a box kite, a kite that could carry a person aloft, in the magazine Popular Science. So he and Gaylord made a frame of cross-braced pine and covered it with a bolt of muslin. They tried to get the thing up by running across a field and towing it with a rope, but that didn’t work terribly well. Then they hauled it up on the roof of a barn, and Bob sat in the seat and Gaylord ran across the roof, pulling the kite, and Bob was lucky he didn’t break his neck when he and the rig hit the ground. So then they tied it to the rear bumper of a neighbor’s car. With the neighbor at the wheel, Bob rode the kite and managed to get about twelve feet off the ground and glide for thirty seconds or so and come down without wrecking himself or any citizen’s house or livestock. Livestock ... yes. Livestock was a major capital asset in Grinnell, and livestock was at the heart of what happened in 1948. In May a group of Bob Noyce’s friends in one of the dormitory houses at Grinnell decided to have a luau, and he was in on the planning. The Second World War had popularized the exotic ways of the South Pacific, so that in 1948 the luau was an up-to-the-minute social innovation. The centerpiece of a luau was a whole roasted suckling pig with an apple or a pineapple in its mouth. Bob Noyce, being strong and quick, was one of the two boys assigned to procure the pig. That night they sneaked onto a farm just outside of Grinnell and wrestled a twenty-five-pound suckling out of the pigpen and arrived back at the luau to great applause. Within a few hours the pig was crackling hot and had an apple in its mouth and looked good enough for seconds and thirds, which everybody helped himself to, and there was more applause. The next morning came the moral hangover. The two boys decided to go see the farmer, confess, and pay for the pig. They didn’t quite understand how a college luau, starring his pig, would score on the laugh meter with a farmer in midland Iowa. In the state of Iowa, where the vast majority of people depended upon agriculture for a livelihood and upon Protestant morality for their standards, not even stealing a watermelon worth thirty-five cents was likely to be written off as a boyish prank. Stealing a pig was larceny. The farmer got the sheriff and insisted on bringing criminal charges. There was only so much that Ralph Noyce, the preacher with the preacher’s son, could do. Grant Gale, on the other hand, was the calm, well-respected third party. He had two difficult tasks: to keep Bob out of jail and out of court and to keep the college administration from expelling him. There was never any hope at all of a mere slap on the wrist. The compromise Grant Gale helped work out—a one-semester suspension—was the best deal Bob could have hoped for realistically. The Night of the Luau Pig was quite a little scandal on the Grinnell Richter scale. So Gale was all the more impressed by the way Bob Noyce took it. The local deathray glowers never broke his confidence. All the Noyce boys had a profound and, to tell the truth, baffling confidence. Bob had a certain way of listening and staring. He would lower his head slightly and look up with a gaze that seemed to be about one hundred amperes. While he looked at you he never blinked and never swallowed. He absorbed everything you said and then answered very levelly in a soft baritone voice and often with a smile that showed off his terrific set of teeth. The stare, the voice, the smile—it was all a bit like the movie persona of the most famous of all Grinnell College’s alumni, Gary Cooper. With his strong face, his athlete’s build, and the Gary Cooper manner, Bob Noyce projected what psychologists call the halo effect. People with the halo effect seem to know exactly what they’re doing and, moreover, make you want to admire them for it. They make you see the halos over their heads. Years later people would naturally wonder where Bob Noyce got his confidence. Many came to the conclusion it was as much from his mother, Harriett Norton Noyce, as from his father. She was a latter-day version of the sort of strong-willed, intelligent, New England–style woman who had made such a difference during Iowa’s pioneer days a hundred years before. His mother and father, with the help of Rowland Cross, who taught mathematics at Grinnell, arranged for Bob to take a job in the actuarial department of Equitable Life in New York City for the summer. He stayed on at the job during the fall semester, then came back to Grinnell at Christmas and rejoined the senior class in January as the second semester began. Gale was impressed by the aplomb with which the prodigal returned. In his first three years Bob had accumulated so many extra credits, it would take him only this final semester to graduate. He resumed college life, including the extracurricular activities, without skipping a beat. But more than that, Gale was gratified by the way Bob became involved with the new experimental device that was absorbing so much of Gale’s own time: the transistor. Bob was not the only physics major interested in the transistor, but he was the one who seemed most curious about where this novel mechanism might lead. He went off to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in Cambridge, in the fall to begin his graduate work. When he brought up the subject of the transistor at MIT, even to faculty members, people just looked at him. Even those who had heard of it regarded it merely as a novelty fabricated by the telephone company. There was no course work involving transistors or the theory of solid-state electronics. His dissertation was a “Photoelectric Study of Surface States on Insulators,” which was at best merely background for solid-state electronics. In this area MIT was far behind Grinnell College. For a good four years Grant Gale remained one of the few people Bob Noyce could compare notes with in this new field. Well, it had been a close one! What if Grant Gale hadn’t gone to school with John Bardeen, and what if Oliver Buckley hadn’t been a Grinnell alumnus? And what if Gale hadn’t bothered to get in touch with the two of them after he read the little squib about the transistor in the newspaper? What if he hadn’t gone to bat for Bob Noyce after the Night of the Luau Pig and the boy had been thrown out of college and that had been that? After all, if Bob hadn’t been able to finish at Grinnell, he probably never would have been introduced to the transistor. He certainly wouldn’t have come across it at MIT in 1948. Given what Bob Noyce did over the next twenty years, one couldn’t help but wonder about the fortuitous chain of events. Fortuitous ... well! How Josiah Grinnell, up on the plains of Heaven, must have laughed over that! GRANT GALE WAS the first important physicist in Bob Noyce’s career. The second was William Shockley. After their ambitions had collided one last time, and they had parted company, Noyce had concluded that he and Shockley were two very different people. But in many ways they were alike. For a start, they both had an amateur’s hambone love of being onstage. At MIT Noyce had sung in choral groups. Early in the summer of 1953, after he had received his Ph.D., he went over to Tufts College to sing and act in a program of musicals presented by the college. The costume director was a girl named Elizabeth Bottomley, from Barrington, Rhode Island, who had just graduated from Tufts, majoring in English. They both enjoyed dramatics. Singing, acting, and skiing had become the pastimes Noyce enjoyed most. He had become almost as expert at skiing as he had been at diving. Noyce and Betty, as he called her, were married that fall. In 1953 the MIT faculty was just beginning to understand the implications of the transistor. But electronics firms were already eager to have graduate electrical engineers who could do research and development in the new field. Noyce was offered jobs by Bell Laboratories, IBM, RCA, and Philco. He went to work for Philco, in Philadelphia, because Philco was starting from near zero in semiconductor research and chances for rapid advancement seemed good. But Noyce was well aware that the most important work was still being done at Bell Laboratories, thanks in no small part to William Shockley. Shockley had devised the first theoretical framework for research into solid-state semiconductors as far back as 1939 and was in charge of the Bell Labs team that included John Bardeen and Walter Brattain. Shockley had also originated the “junction transistor,” which turned the transistor from an exotic laboratory instrument into a workable item. By 1955 Shockley had left Bell and returned to Palo Alto, California, where he had grown up near Stanford University, to form his own company, Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory, with start-up money provided by Arnold Beckman of Beckman Instruments. Shockley opened up shop in a glorified shed on South San Antonio Road in Mountain View, which was just south of Palo Alto. The building was made of concrete blocks with the rafters showing. Aside from clerical and maintenance personnel, practically all the employees were electrical engineers with doctorates. In a field this experimental there was nobody else worth hiring. Shockley began talking about “my Ph.D. production line.” Meanwhile, Noyce was not finding Philco the golden opportunity he thought it would be. Philco wanted good enough transistors to stay in the game with GE and RCA, but it was not interested in putting money into the sort of avant-garde research Noyce had in mind. In 1956 he resigned from Philco and moved from Pennsylvania to California to join Shockley. The way he went about it was a classic example of the Noyce brand of confidence. By now he and his wife, Betty, had two children: Bill, who was two, and Penny, who was six months old. After a couple of telephone conversations with Shockley, Noyce put himself and Betty on a night flight from Philadelphia to San Francisco. They arrived in Palo Alto at six a.m. By noon Noyce had signed a contract to buy a house. That afternoon he went to Mountain View to see Shockley and ask for a job, projected the halo, and got it. The first months on Shockley’s Ph.D. production line were exhilarating. It wasn’t really a production line at all. Everything at this stage was research. Every day a dozen young Ph.D.s came to the shed at eight in the morning and began heating germanium and silicon, another common element, in kilns to temperatures ranging from 1,472 to 2,552 degrees Fahrenheit. They wore white lab coats, goggles, and work gloves. When they opened the kiln doors weird streaks of orange and white light went across their faces, and they put in the germanium or the silicon, along with specks of aluminum, phosphorus, boron, and arsenic. Contaminating the germanium or silicon with the aluminum, phosphorus, boron, and arsenic was called doping. Then they lowered a small mechanical column into the goo so that crystals formed on the bottom of the column, and they pulled the crystal out and tried get a grip on it with tweezers, and put it under microscopes and cut it with diamond cutters, among other things, into minute slices, wafers, chips—there were no names in electronics for these tiny forms. The kilns cooked and bubbled away, doors opened, the pale apricot light streaked over the goggles, the tweezers and diamond cutters flashed, the white coats flapped, the Ph.D.s squinted through their microscopes, and Shockley moved between the tables conducting the arcane symphony. In pensive moments Shockley looked very much the scholar, with his roundish face, his roundish eyeglasses, and his receding hairline—but Shockley was not a man locked in the pensive mode. He was an enthusiast, a raconteur, and a showman. At the outset his very personality was enough to keep everyone swept up in the great adventure. When he lectured, as he often did at colleges and before professional groups, he would walk up to the lectern and thank the master of ceremonies and say that the only more flattering introduction he had ever received was one he gave himself one night when the emcee didn’t show up, whereupon—bango—a bouquet of red roses would pop up in his hand. Or he would walk up to the lectern and say that tonight he was getting into a hot subject, whereupon he would open up a book and—whumpf!—a puff of smoke would rise up out of the pages. Shockley was famous for his homely but shrewd examples. One day a student confessed to being puzzled by the concept of amplification, which was one of the prime functions of the transistor. Shockley told him: “If you take a bale of hay and tie it to the tail of a mule and then strike a match and set the bale of hay on fire, and if you then compare the energy expended shortly thereafter by the mule with the energy expended by yourself in the striking of the match, you will understand the concept of amplification.” On November 1, 1956, Shockley arrived at the shed on South San Antonio Road beaming. Early that morning he had received a telephone call informing him that he had won the Nobel Prize for physics for the invention of the transistor; or, rather, that he was co-winner, along with John Bardeen and Walter Brattain. Shockley closed up shop and took everybody to a restaurant called Dinah’s Shack over on El Camino Real, the road to San Francisco that had become Palo Alto’s commercial strip. He treated his Ph.D. production line and all the other employees to a champagne breakfast. It seemed that Shockley’s father was a mining engineer who spent years out on remote durango terrains, in Nevada, Manchuria—all over the world. Shockley’s mother was like Noyce’s. She was an intelligent woman with a commanding will. The Shockleys were Unitarians, the Unitarian Church being an offshoot of the Congregational. Shockley Sr. was twenty years older than Shockley’s mother and died when Shockley was seventeen. Shockley’s mother was determined that her son would someday “set the world on fire,” as she once put it. And now he had done it. Shockley lifted a glass of champagne in Dinah’s Shack, and it was as if it were a toast back across a lot of hard-wrought durango grit Octagon Soap sagebrush Dissenting Protestant years to his father’s memory and his mother’s determination. That had been a great day at Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory. There weren’t many more. Shockley was magnetic, he was a genius, and he was a great research director—the best, in fact. His forte was breaking a problem down to first principles. With a few words and a few lines on a piece of paper he aimed any experiment in the right direction. When it came to comprehending the young engineers on his Ph.D. production line, however, he was not so terrific. It never seemed to occur to Shockley that his twelve highly educated elves just might happen to view themselves the same way he had always viewed himself: which is to say, as young geniuses capable of the sort of inventions Nobel Prizes were given for. One day Noyce came to Shockley with some new results he had found in the laboratory. Shockley picked up the telephone and called some former colleagues at Bell Labs to see if they sounded right. Shockley never even realized that Noyce had gone away from his desk seething. Then there was the business of the new management techniques. Now that he was an entrepreneur, Shockley came up with some new ways to run a company. Each one seemed to irritate the elves more than the one before. For a start, Shockley published their salaries. He posted them on a bulletin board. That way there would be no secrets. Then he started having the employees rate one another on a regular basis. These were so-called peer ratings, a device sometimes used in the military and seldom appreciated even there. Everybody regarded peer ratings as nothing more than popularity contests. But the real turning point was the lie detector. Shockley was convinced that someone in the shed was sabotaging the project. The work was running into inexplicable delays, but the money was running out on schedule. So he insisted that one employee roll up his sleeve and bare his chest and let the electrodes be attached and submit to a polygraph examination. No saboteur was ever found. There were also some technical differences of opinion. Shockley was interested in developing a so-called four-layer diode. Noyce and two of his fellow elves, Gordon Moore and Jean Hoerni, favored transistors. But at bottom it was dissatisfaction with the boss and the lure of entrepreneurship that led to what happened next. In the summer of 1957 Moore, Hoerni, and five other engineers—but not Noyce—got together and arrived at what became one of the primary business concepts of the young semiconductor industry. In this business, it dawned on them, capital assets in the traditional sense of plant, equipment, and raw materials counted for next to nothing. The only plant you needed was a shed big enough for the worktables. The only equipment you needed was some kilns, goggles, microscopes, tweezers, and diamond cutters. The materials, silicon and germanium, came from dirt and coal. Brainpower was the entire franchise. If the seven of them thought they could do the job better than Shockley, there was nothing to keep them from starting their own company. On that day was born the concept that would make the semiconductor business as wild as show business: defection capital. The seven defectors went to the Wall Street firm of Hayden Stone in search of start-up money. It was at this point that they realized they had to have someone serve as administrator. So they turned to Noyce, who was still with Shockley. None of them, including Noyce, had any administrative experience, but they all thought of Noyce as soon as the question came up. They didn’t know exactly what they were looking for ... but Noyce was the one with the halo. He agreed to join them. He would continue to wear a white lab coat and goggles and do research. But he would also be the coordinator. Of the eight of them, he would be the one man who kept track, on a regular basis, of all sides of the operation. He was twenty-nine years old. Arthur Rock of Hayden Stone approached twenty-two firms before he finally hooked the defectors up with the Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corporation of New York. Fairchild was owned by Sherman Fairchild, a bachelor bon vivant who lived in a futuristic town house on East Sixty-fifth Street in Manhattan. The house was in two sections connected by ramps. The ramps were fifty feet long in some cases, enclosed in glass so that you could go up and down the ramps in all weather and gaze upon the marble courtyard below. The place looked like something from out of the Crystal Palace of Ming in Flash Gordon. The ramps were for his Aunt May, who lived with him and was confined to a wheelchair and had even more Fairchild money than he did. The chief executive officer of Fairchild was John Carter, who had just come from the Corning Glass Company. He had been the youngest vice-president in the history of that old-line, family-owned firm. He was thirty-six. Fairchild Camera and Instrument gave the defectors the money to start up the new company, Fairchild Semiconductor, with the understanding that Fairchild Camera and Instrument would have the right to buy Fairchild Semiconductor for $3 million at any time within the next eight years. Shockley took the defections very hard. He seemed as much hurt as angered, and he was certainly angry enough. A friend of Shockley’s said to Noyce’s wife, Betty: “You must have known about this for quite some time. How on earth could you not tell me?” That was a baffling remark, unless one regarded Shockley as the father of the transistor and the defectors as the children he had taken beneath his mantle of greatness. If so, one had a point. Years later, if anyone had drawn up a family tree for the semiconductor industry, practically every important branch would have led straight from Shockley’s shed on South San Antonio Road. On the other hand, Noyce had been introduced to the transistor not by Shockley but by John Bardeen, via Grant Gale, and not in California but back in his own hometown, Grinnell, Iowa. For that matter, Josiah Grinnell had been a defector in his day, too, and there was no record that he had ever lost a night’s sleep over it. NOYCE, GORDON MOORE, Jean Hoerni, and the other five defectors set up Fairchild Semiconductor in a two-story warehouse building some speculator had built out of tilt-up concrete slabs on Charleston Avenue in Mountain View, about twelve blocks from Shockley’s operation. Mountain View was in the northern end of the Santa Clara Valley. In the business world the valley was known mainly for its apricot, pear, and plum orchards. From the work bays of the light-industry sheds that the speculators were beginning to build in the valley you could look out and see the raggedy little apricot trees they had never bothered to bulldoze after they bought the land from the farmers. A few well-known electronics firms were already in the valley: General Electric and IBM, as well as a company that had started up locally, Hewlett-Packard. Stanford University was encouraging engineering concerns to locate near Palo Alto and use the university’s research facilities. The man who ran the program was a friend of Shockley’s, Frederick E. Terman, whose father had originated the first scientific measurement of human intelligence, the Stanford-Binet IQ test. IBM had a facility in the valley that was devoted specifically to research rather than production. Both IBM and Hewlett-Packard were trying to develop a highly esoteric and colossally expensive new device, the electronic computer. Shockley had been the first entrepreneur to come to the area to make semiconductors. After the defections his operation never got off the ground. Here in the Santa Clara Valley, that left the field to Noyce and the others at Fairchild. Fairchild’s start-up couldn’t have come at a better time. By 1957 there was sufficient demand from manufacturers who merely wanted transistors instead of vacuum tubes, for use in radios and other machines, to justify the new operation. But it was also in 1957 that the Soviet Union launched Sputnik I. In the electronics industry the ensuing space race had the effect of coupling two new inventions—the transistor and the computer—and magnifying the importance of both. The first American electronic computer, known as ENIAC, had been developed by the Army during the Second World War, chiefly as a means of computing artillery and bomb trajectories. The machine was a monster. It was one hundred feet long and ten feet high and required eighteen thousand vacuum tubes. The tubes generated so much heat, the temperature in the room sometimes reached 120 degrees. What the government needed was small computers that could be installed in rockets to provide automatic onboard guidance. Substituting transistors for vacuum tubes was an obvious way to cut down on the size. After Sputnik I the glamorous words in the semiconductor business were computers and miniaturization. Other than Shockley Semiconductor, Fairchild was the only semiconductor company in the Santa Clara Valley, but Texas Instruments had entered the field in Dallas, as had Motorola in Phoenix and Transitron and Raytheon in the Boston area, where a new electronics industry was starting up as MIT finally began to comprehend the new technology. These firms were all racing to refine the production of transistors to the point where they might command the market. So far refinement had not been anybody’s long suit. No tourist dropping by Fairchild, Texas Instruments, Motorola, or Transitron would have had the faintest notion he was looking in on the leading edge of the most advanced of all industries, electronics. The work bays, where the transistors were produced, looked like slightly sunnier versions of the garment sweatshops of San Francisco’s Chinatown. Here were rows of women hunched over worktables, squinting through microscopes, doing the most tedious and frustrating sort of manual labor, cutting layers of silicon apart with diamond cutters, picking little rectangles of them up with tweezers, trying to attach wires to them, dropping them, rummaging around on the floor to find them again, swearing, muttering, climbing back up to their chairs, rubbing their eyes, squinting back through the microscopes, and driving themselves crazy some more. Depending on how well the silicon or germanium had been cooked and doped, anywhere from 50 to 90 percent of the transistors would turn out to be defective even after all that, and sometimes the good ones would be the ones that fell on the floor and got ruined. Even for a machine as simple as a radio the individual transistors had to be wired together, by hand, until you ended up with a little panel that looked like a road map of West Virginia. As for a computer—the wires inside a computer were sheer spaghetti. Noyce had figured out a solution. But fabricating it was another matter. There was something primitive about cutting individual transistors out of sheets of silicon and then wiring them back together in various series. Why not put them all on a single piece of silicon without wires? The problem was that you would also have to carve, etch, coat, and otherwise fabricate the silicon to perform all the accompanying electrical functions as well, the functions ordinarily performed by insulators, rectifiers, resistors, and capacitors. You would have to create an entire electrical system, an entire circuit, on a little wafer or chip. Noyce realized that he was not the only engineer thinking along these lines, but he had never even heard of Jack Kilby. Kilby was a thirty-six-year-old engineer working for Texas Instruments in Dallas. In January 1959 Noyce made his first detailed notes about a complete solid-state circuit. A month later Texas Instruments announced that Jack Kilby had invented one. Kilby’s integrated circuit, as the invention was called, was made of germanium. Six months later Noyce created a similar integrated circuit made of silicon and using a novel insulating process developed by Jean Hoerni. Noyce’s silicon device turned out to be more efficient and more practical to produce than Kilby’s and set the standard for the industry. So Noyce became known as the co-inventor of the integrated circuit. Nevertheless, Kilby had unquestionably been first. There was an ironic echo of Shockley here. Strictly speaking, Bardeen and Brattain, not Shockley, had invented the transistor, but Shockley wasn’t bashful about being known as the co-inventor. And now, eleven years later, Noyce wasn’t turning bashful, either. Noyce knew exactly what he possessed in this integrated circuit, or microchip, as the press would call it. Noyce knew that he had discovered the road to El Dorado. El Dorado was the vast, still-virgin terrain of electricity. Electricity was already so familiar a part of everyday life, only a few research engineers understood just how young and unexplored the terrain actually was. It had been only eighty years since Edison invented the light bulb in 1879. It had been less than fifty years since Lee De Forest, an inventor from Council Bluffs, Iowa, had invented the vacuum tube. The vacuum tube was based on the light bulb, but the vacuum tube opened up fields the light bulb did not even suggest: long-distance radio and telephone communication. Over the past ten years, since Bardeen and Brattain invented it in 1948, the transistor had become the modern replacement for the vacuum tube. And now came Kilby’s and Noyce’s integrated circuit. The integrated circuit was based on the transistor, but the integrated circuit opened up fields the transistor did not even suggest. The integrated circuit made it possible to create miniature computers, to put all the functions of the mighty ENIAC on a panel the size of a playing card. Thereby the integrated circuit opened up every field of engineering imaginable, from voyages to the moon to robots, and many fields that had never been imagined, such as electronic guidance counseling. It opened up so many fields that no one could even come up with a single name to include them all. “The second industrial revolution,” “the age of the computer,” “the microchip universe,” “the electronic grid”—none of them, not even the handy neologism “high tech,” could encompass all the implications. The importance of the integrated circuit was certainly not lost on John Carter and Fairchild Camera back in New York. In 1959 they exercised their option to buy Fairchild Semiconductor for $3 million. The next day Noyce, Moore, Hoerni, and the other five former Shockley elves woke up rich, or richer than they had ever dreamed of being. Each received $250,000 worth of Fairchild stock. Josiah Grinnell grew livid on the subject of alcohol. But he had nothing against money. He would have approved. NOYCE DIDN’T KNOW what to make of his new wealth. He was thirty-one years old. For the past four years, ever since he had gone to work for Shockley, the semiconductor business had not seemed like a business at all but an esoteric game in which young electrical engineers competed for attaboys and the occasional round of applause after delivering a paper before the IEEE, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. It was a game supercharged by the fact that it was being played in the real world, to use a term that annoyed scientists in the universities. Someone—Arnold Beckman, Sherman Fairchild, whoever—was betting real money, and other bands of young elves, at Texas Instruments, RCA, Bell, were out there competing with you by the real world’s rules, which required that you be practical as well as brilliant. Noyce started working for Fairchild Semiconductor in 1957 for twelve thousand dollars a year. When it came to money, he had assumed that he, like his father, would always be on somebody’s payroll. Now, in 1959, when he talked to his father, he told him: “The money doesn’t seem real. It’s just a way of keeping score.” Noyce took his family to visit his parents fairly often. He and Betty now had three children, Bill, Penny, and Polly, who was a year old. When they visited the folks, they went off to church on Sunday with the folks, as if it were all very much a part of their lives. In fact, Noyce had started drifting away from Congregationalism and the whole matter of churchgoing after he entered MIT. It was not a question of rejecting it. He never rejected anything about his upbringing in Grinnell. It was just that he was heading off somewhere else, down a different road. In that respect Noyce was like a great many bright young men and women from Dissenting Protestant families in the Middle West after the Second World War. They had been raised as Baptists, Methodists, Congregationalists, Presbyterians, United Brethren, whatever. They had been led through the church door and prodded toward religion, but it had never come alive for them. Sundays made their skulls feel like dried-out husks. So they slowly walked away from the church and silently, without so much as a growl of rebellion, congratulated themselves on their independence of mind and headed into another way of life. Only decades later, in most cases, would they discover how, absentmindedly, inexplicably, they had brought the old ways along for the journey nonetheless. It was as if ... through some extraordinary mistake ... they had been sewn into the linings of their coats! Now that he had some money, Bob Noyce bought a bigger house. His and Betty’s fourth child, Margaret, was born in 1960, and they wanted each child to have a bedroom. But the thought of moving into any of the “best” neighborhoods in the Palo Alto area never even crossed his mind. The best neighborhoods were to be found in Atherton, in Burlingame, which was known as very social; or in the swell old sections of Palo Alto, near Stanford University. Instead, Noyce bought a California version of a French country house in Los Altos, a white stucco house with a steeply pitched roof. It was scenic up there in the hills, and cooler in the summer than it was down in the flatlands near the bay. The house had plenty of room, and he and Betty would be living a great deal better than most couples their age, but Los Altos had no social cachet and the house was not going to make House & Garden come banging on the door. No one could accuse them of being ostentatious. John Carter appointed Noyce general manager of the entire division, Fairchild Semiconductor, which was suddenly one of the hottest new outfits in the business world. NASA chose Noyce’s integrated circuits for the first computers that astronauts would use on board their spacecraft (in the Gemini program). After that, orders poured in. In ten years Fairchild sales rose from a few thousand dollars a year to $130 million, and the number of employees rose from the original band of elves to twelve thousand. As the general manager, Noyce now had to deal with a matter Shockley had dealt with clumsily and prematurely, namely, new management techniques for this new industry. One day John Carter came to Mountain View for a close look at Noyce’s semiconductor operation. Carter’s office in Syosset, Long Island, arranged for a limousine and chauffeur to be at his disposal while he was in California. So Carter arrived at the tilt-up concrete building in Mountain View in the back of a black Cadillac limousine with a driver in the front wearing the complete chauffeur’s uniform—the black suit, the white shirt, the black necktie, and the black visored cap. That in itself was enough to turn heads at Fairchild Semiconductor. Nobody had ever seen a limousine and a chauffeur out there before. But that wasn’t what fixed the day in everybody’s memory. It was the fact that the driver stayed out there for almost eight hours, doing nothing. He stayed out there in his uniform, with his visored hat on, in the front seat of the limousine, all day, doing nothing but waiting for a man who was somewhere inside. John Carter was inside having a terrific chief executive officer’s time for himself. He took a tour of the plant, he held conferences, he looked at figures, he nodded with satisfaction, he beamed his urbane Fifty-seventh Street Biggie CEO charm. And the driver sat out there all day engaged in the task of supporting a visored cap with his head. People started leaving their workbenches and going to the front windows just to take a look at this phenomenon. It seemed that bizarre. Here was a serf who did nothing all day but wait outside a door in order to be at the service of the haunches of his master instantly, whenever those haunches and the paunch and the jowls might decide to reappear. It wasn’t merely that this little peek at the New York–style corporate high life was unusual out here in the brown hills of the Santa Clara Valley. It was that it seemed terribly wrong. A certain instinct Noyce had about this new industry and the people who worked in it began to take on the outlines of a concept. Corporations in the East adopted a feudal approach to organization, without even being aware of it. There were kings and lords, and there were vassals, soldiers, yeomen, and serfs, with layers of protocol and perquisites, such as the car and driver, to symbolize superiority and establish the boundary lines. Back east the CEOs had offices with carved paneling, fake fireplaces, escritoires, bergères, leather-bound books, and dressing rooms, like a suite in a baronial manor house. Fairchild Semiconductor needed a strict operating structure, particularly in this period of rapid growth, but it did not need a social structure. In fact, nothing could be worse. Noyce realized how much he detested the eastern corporate system of class and status with its endless gradations, topped off by the CEOs and vice-presidents who conducted their daily lives as if they were a corporate court and aristocracy. He rejected the idea of a social hierarchy at Fairchild. Not only would there be no limousines and chauffeurs, there would not even be any reserved parking places. Work began at eight a.m. for one and all, and it would be first come, first served, in the parking lot, for Noyce, Gordon Moore, Jean Hoerni, and everybody else. “If you come late,” Noyce liked to say, “you just have to park in the back forty.” And there would be no baronial office suites. The glorified warehouse on Charleston Road was divided into work bays and a couple of rows of cramped office cubicles. The cubicles were never improved. The decor remained Glorified Warehouse, and the doors were always open. Half the time Noyce, the chief administrator, was out in the laboratory anyway, wearing his white lab coat. Noyce came to work in a coat and tie, but soon the jacket and the tie were off, and that was fine for any other man in the place too. There were no rules of dress at all, except for some unwritten ones. Dress should be modest, modest in the social as well as the moral sense. At Fairchild there were no hard-worsted double-breasted pinstripe suits and shepherd’s-check neckties. Sharp, elegant, fashionable, or alluring dress was a social blunder. Shabbiness was not a sin. Ostentation was. During the start-up phase at Fairchild Semiconductor there had been no sense of bosses and employees. There had been only a common sense of struggle out on a frontier. Everyone had internalized the goals of the venture. They didn’t need exhortations from superiors. Besides, everyone had been so young! Noyce, the administrator or chief coordinator or whatever he should be called, had been just about the oldest person on the premises, and he had been barely thirty. And now, in the early 1960s, thanks to his athletic build and his dark brown hair with the Campus Kid hairline, he still looked very young. As Fairchild expanded, Noyce didn’t even bother trying to find “experienced management personnel.” Out here in California, in the semiconductor industry, they didn’t exist. Instead, he recruited engineers right out of the colleges and graduate schools and gave them major responsibilities right off the bat. There was no “staff,” no “top management” other than the eight partners themselves. Major decisions were not bucked up a chain of command. Noyce held weekly meetings of people from all parts of the operation, and whatever had to be worked out was worked out right there in the room. Noyce wanted them all to keep internalizing the company’s goals and to provide their own motivations, just as they had during the start-up phase. If they did that, they would have the capacity to make their own decisions. The young engineers who came to work for Fairchild could scarcely believe how much responsibility was suddenly thrust upon them. Some twenty-four-year-old just out of graduate school would find himself in charge of a major project with no one looking over his shoulder. A problem would come up, and he couldn’t stand it, and he would go to Noyce and hyperventilate and ask him what to do. And Noyce would lower his head, turn on his 100-ampere eyes, listen, and say: “Look, here are your guidelines. You’ve got to consider A, you’ve got to consider B, and you’ve got to consider C.” Then he would turn on the Gary Cooper smile: “But if you think I’m going to make your decision for you, you’re mistaken. Hey ... it’s your ass.” Back east, in the conventional corporation, any functionary wishing to make an unusually large purchase had to have the approval of a superior or two or three superiors or even a committee, a procedure that ate up days, weeks, in paperwork. Noyce turned that around. At Fairchild any engineer, even a weenie just out of Cal Tech, could make any purchase he wanted, no matter how enormous, unless someone else objected strongly enough to try to stop it. Noyce called this the Short Circuit Paper Route. There was only one piece of paper involved, the piece of paper the engineer handed somebody in the purchasing department. The spirit of the start-up phase! My God! Who could forget the exhilarations of the past few years! To be young and free out here on the silicon frontier! Noyce was determined to maintain that spirit during the expansion phase. And for the time being, at least, here in the early 1960s the notion of a permanent start-up operation didn’t seem too farfetched. Fairchild was unable to coast on the tremendous advantage Noyce’s invention of the integrated circuit had provided. Competitors were setting up shop in the Santa Clara Valley like gold rushers. And where did they come from? Why, from Fairchild itself! And how could that be? Nothing to it ... Defection capital! Defectors (or redefectors) from Fairchild started up more than fifty companies, all making or supplying microchips. Raytheon Semiconductor, Signetics, General Microelectronics, Intersil, Advanced Micro Devices, Qualidyne—off they spun, each with a sillier pseudotech engineerologism for a name than the one before. Defectors! What a merry game that was. Jean Hoerni and three of the other original eight defectors from Shockley defected from Fairchild to form what would soon become known as Teledyne Semiconductors, and that was only round one. After all, why not make all the money for yourself! The urge to use defection capital was so irresistible that the word defection, with its note of betrayal, withered away. Defectors were merely the Fairchildren, as Adam Smith dubbed them. Occasionally defectors from other companies, such as the men from Texas Instruments and Westinghouse who started Siliconix, moved into the Santa Clara Valley to join the free-for-all. But it was the Fairchildren who turned the Santa Clara Valley into the Silicon Valley. Acre by acre the fruit trees were uprooted, and two-story Silicon Modern office buildings and factories went up. The state of California built a new freeway past the area, Route 280. Children heard the phrase “Silicon Valley” so often, they grew up thinking it was the name on the map. Everywhere the Fairchild émigrés went, they took the Noyce approach with them. It wasn’t enough to start up a company; you had to start up a community, a community in which there were no social distinctions, and it was first come, first served, in the parking lot, and everyone was supposed to internalize the common goals. The atmosphere of the new companies was so democratic, it startled businessmen from the East. Some fifty-five-year-old biggie with his jowls swelling up smoothly from out of his F. R. Tripler modified-spread white collar and silk jacquard-print necktie would call up from GE or RCA and say, “This is Harold B. Thatchwaite,” and the twenty-three-year-old secretary on the other end of the line, out in the Silicon Valley, would say in one of those sunny blond pale-blue-eyed California voices: “Just a minute, Hal, Jack will be right with you.” And once he got to California and met this Jack for the first time, there he would be, the CEO himself, all of thirty-three years old, wearing no jacket, no necktie, just a checked shirt, khaki pants, and a pair of moccasins with welted seams the size of jumper cables. Naturally the first sounds out of this Jack’s mouth would be: “Hi, Hal.” It was the 1960s, and people in the East were hearing a lot about California surfers, California bikers, hot rodders, car customizers, California hippies, and political protesters, and the picture they got was of young people in jeans and T-shirts who were casual, spontaneous, impulsive, emotional, sensual, undisciplined, and obnoxiously proud of it. So these semiconductor outfits in the Silicon Valley with their CEOs dressed like camp counselors struck them as the business versions of the same thing. They couldn’t have been more wrong. The new breed of the Silicon Valley lived for work. They were disciplined to the point of back spasms. They worked long hours and kept working on weekends. They became absorbed in their companies the way men once had in the palmy days of the automobile industry. In the Silicon Valley a young engineer would go to work at eight in the morning, work right through lunch, leave the plant at six-thirty or seven, drive home, play with the baby for half an hour, have dinner with his wife, get in bed with her, give her a quick toss, then get up and leave her there in the dark and work at his desk for two or three hours on “a coupla things I had to bring home with me.” Or else he would leave the plant and decide, well, maybe he would drop in at the Wagon Wheel for a drink before he went home. Every year there was some place, the Wagon Wheel, Chez Yvonne, Rickey’s, the Roundhouse, where members of this esoteric fraternity, the young men and women of the semiconductor industry, would head after work to have a drink and gossip and brag and trade war stories about phase jitters, phantom circuits, bubble memories, pulse trains, bounceless contacts, burst modes, leapfrog tests, p-n junctions, sleeping-sickness modes, slow-death episodes, RAMs, NAKs, MOSes, PCMs, PROMs, PROM blowers, PROM burners, PROM blasters, and teramagnitudes, meaning multiples of a million millions. So then he wouldn’t get home until nine, and the baby was asleep, and dinner was cold, and the wife was frosted off, and he would stand there and cup his hands as if making an imaginary snowball and try to explain to her ... while his mind trailed off to other matters, LSIs, VLSIs, alpha flux, de-rezzing, forward biases, parasitic signals, and that tera-sexy little cookie from Signetics he had met at the Wagon Wheel, who understood such things. It was not a great way of life for marriages. By the late 1960s the toll of divorces seemed to those in the business to be as great as that of NASA’s boomtowns, Cocoa Beach, Florida, and Clear Lake, Texas, where other young engineers were giving themselves over to a new technology as if it were a religious mission. The second time around they tended to “intra-marry.” They married women who worked for Silicon Valley companies and who could comprehend and even learn to live with their twenty-four-hour obsessions. In the Silicon Valley an engineer was under pressure to reinvent the integrated circuit every six months. In 1959 Noyce’s invention had made it possible to put an entire electrical circuit on a chip of silicon the size of a fingernail. By 1964 you had to know how to put ten circuits on a chip that size just to enter the game, and the stakes kept rising. Six years later the figure was one thousand circuits on a single chip; six years after that it would be thirty-two thousand—and everyone was talking about how the real breakthrough would be sixty-four thousand. Noyce himself led the race; by 1968 he had a dozen new integrated-circuit and transistor patents. And what amazing things such miniaturization made possible! In December 1968 NASA sent the first manned flight to the moon, Apollo 8. Three astronauts, Frank Borman, James Lovell, and William Anders, flew into earth orbit, then fired a rocket at precisely the right moment in order to break free of the earth’s gravitational field and fly through the minute “window” in space that would put them on course to the moon rather than into orbit around the sun, from which there could be no return. They flew to the moon, went into orbit around it, saw the dark side, which no one had ever seen, not even with a telescope, then fired a rocket at precisely the right moment in order to break free of the moon’s gravitational pull and go into the proper trajectory for their return to earth. None of it would have been possible without onboard computers. People were beginning to talk about all that the space program was doing for the computer sciences. Noyce knew it was the other way around. Only the existence of a miniature computer two feet long, one foot wide, and six inches thick—exactly three thousand times smaller than the old ENIAC and far faster and more reliable—made the flight of Apollo 8 possible. And there would have been no miniature computer without the integrated circuits invented by Noyce and Kilby and refined by Noyce and the young semiconductor zealots of the Silicon Valley, the new breed who were building the road El Dorado. Noyce used to go into a slow burn that year, 1968, when the newspapers, the magazines, and the television networks got on the subject of the youth. The youth was a favorite topic in 1968. Riots broke out on the campuses as the antiwar movement reached its peak following North Vietnam’s Tet offensive. Black youths rioted in the cities. The Yippies, supposedly a coalition of hippies and campus activists, managed to sabotage the Democratic National Convention by setting off some highly televised street riots. The press seemed to enjoy presenting these youths as the avant-garde who were sweeping aside the politics and morals of the past and shaping America’s future. The French writer Jean-Francois Revel toured American campuses and called the radical youth homo novus, “the New Man,” as if they were the latest, most advanced product of human evolution itself, after the manner of the superchildren in Arthur C. Clarke’s Childhood’s End. Homo novus? As Noyce saw it, these so-called radical youth movements were shot through with a yearning for a preindustrial Arcadia. They wanted, or thought they wanted, to return to the earth and live on organic vegetables and play folk songs from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. They were antitechnology. They looked upon science as an instrument monopolized by the military-industrial complex. They used this phrase, “the military-industrial complex,” all the time. If industry or the military underwrote scientific research in the universities—and they underwrote a great deal of it—then that research was evil. The universities were to be pure and above exploitation, except, of course, by ideologues of the Left. The homo novus had set up a chain of logic that went as follows: since science equals the military-industrial complex, and the military-industrial complex equals capitalism, and capitalism equals fascism, therefore science equals fascism. And therefore, these much-vaunted radical youths, these shapers of the future, attacked the forward positions of American technology, including the space program and the very idea of the computer. And therefore these creators of the future were what? They were Luddites. They wanted to destroy the new machines. They were the reactionaries of the new age. They were an avant-garde to the rear. They wanted to call off the future. They were stillborn, ossified, prematurely senile. If you wanted to talk about the creators of the future—well, here they were! Here in the Silicon Valley! Just before Apollo 8 circled the moon, Bob Noyce turned forty-one. By age forty-one he had become such a good skier, people were urging him to enter competitions. He had taken up hang gliding and scuba diving. When his daughter Penny was almost fourteen, he asked her what she wanted for her birthday, and she said she wanted to drop from an airplane by parachute. Noyce managed to convince her to settle for glider lessons instead. Then, because it made him restless to just stand around an airfield and watch her soar up above, he took flying lessons, bought an airplane, and began flying the family up through the mountain passes to Aspen, Colorado, for skiing weekends. He had the same lean, powerful build as he had had twenty years before, when he was on the swimming team at Grinnell College. He had the same thick dark brown hair and the same hairline. It looked as if every hair in his head were nailed in. He looked as if he could walk out the door any time he wanted to and win another Midwest Conference diving championship. And he was one of the oldest CEOs in the semiconductor business! He was the Edison of the bunch! He was the father of the Silicon Valley! The rest of the hotshots were younger. It was a business dominated by people in their twenties and thirties. In the Silicon Valley there was a phenomenon known as burnout. After five or ten years of obsessive racing for the semiconductor high stakes, five or ten years of lab work; work lunches, workaholic drinks at the Wagon Wheel, and work-battering of the wife and children, an engineer would reach his middle thirties and wake up one day—and he was finished. The game was over. It was called burnout, suggesting mental and physical exhaustion brought about by overwork. But Noyce was convinced it was something else entirely. It was ... age, or age and status. In the semiconductor business, research engineering was like pitching in baseball; it was 60 percent of the game. Semiconductor research was one of those highly mathematical sciences, such as microbiology, in which, for reasons one could only guess at, the great flashes, the critical moments of inspiration, came mainly to those who were young, often to men in their twenties. The thirty-five-year-old burnouts weren’t suffering from exhaustion, as Noyce saw it. They were being overwhelmed, outperformed, by the younger talent coming up behind them. It wasn’t the central nervous system that was collapsing, it was the ego. Now here you saw youth in the vanguard, on the leading edge! Here you saw the youths who were, in fact, shaping the future! Here you saw, if you insisted on the term, the homo novus! But why insist? For they were also of the same stripe as Josiah Grinnell, who had founded Grinnell, Iowa, at the age of thirty-three. IT WAS IN 1968 that Noyce pulled off the redefection of all redefections. Fairchild Semiconductors had generated tremendous profits for the parent company back east. It now appeared to Noyce that John Carter and Sherman Fairchild had been diverting too much of that money into new start-up ventures, outside the semiconductor field. As a matter of fact, Noyce disliked many things “back east.” He disliked the periodic trips to New York, for which he dressed in gray suits, white shirts, and neckties and reported to the royal corporate court and wasted days trying to bring them up to date on what was happening in California. Fairchild was rather enlightened, for an eastern corporation, but the truth was, there was no one back east who understood how to run a corporation in the United States in the second half of the twentieth century. Back east they had never progressed beyond the year 1940. Consequently, they were still hobbled by all of the primitive stupidities of bureaucratism and labor-management battles. They didn’t have the foggiest comprehension of the Silicon Valley idea of a corporate community. The brightest young businessmen in the East were trained—most notably at the Harvard Business School—to be little Machiavellian princes. Greed and strategy were all that mattered. They were trained for failure. Noyce and Gordon Moore, two of the three original eight Shockley elves still at Fairchild, decided to form their own company. They went to Arthur Rock, who had helped provide the start-up money for Fairchild Semiconductors when he was at Hayden Stone. Now Rock had his own venture capital operation. Noyce took great pleasure in going through none of the steps in corporate formation that the business schools talked about. He and Moore didn’t even write up a proposal. They merely told Rock what they wanted to do and put up $500,000 of their own money, $250,000 each. That seemed to impress Rock more than anything they could possibly have written down, and he rounded up $2.5 million of the start-up money. A few months later another $300,000 came, this time from Grinnell College. Noyce had been on the college’s board of trustees since 1962, and a board member had asked him to give the college a chance to invest, should the day come when he started his own company. So Grinnell College became one of the gamblers betting on Noyce and Intel—the pseudotech engineerologism Noyce and Moore dreamed up as the corporate name. Josiah Grinnell would have loved it. The defection of Noyce and Moore from Fairchild was an earthquake even within an industry jaded by the very subject of defections. In the Silicon Valley everybody had looked upon Fairchild as Noyce’s company. He was the magnet that held the place together. With Noyce gone, it was obvious that the entire work force would be up for grabs. As one wag put it, “People were practically driving trucks over to Fairchild Semiconductor and loading up with employees.” Fairchild responded by pulling off one of the grossest raids in corporate history. One day the troops who were left at Fairchild looked across their partitions and saw a platoon of young men with terrific suntans moving into the executive office cubicles. They would always remember what terrific suntans they had. They were C. Lester Hogan, chief executive officer of the Motorola semiconductor division in Phoenix, and his top echelon of engineers and administrators. Or, rather, C. Lester Hogan of Motorola until yesterday. Fairchild had hired the whole bunch away from Motorola and installed them in place of Noyce & Co. like a matched set. There was plenty of sunshine in the Santa Clara Valley, but nobody here had suntans like this bunch from Phoenix. Fairchild had lured the leader of the young sun-gods out of the Arizona desert in the most direct way imaginable. He had offered him an absolute fortune in money and stock. Hogan received so much, the crowd at the Wagon Wheel said, that henceforth wealth in the Silicon Valley would be measured in units called hogans.* Noyce and Moore, meanwhile, started up Intel in a tilt-up concrete building that Jean Hoerni and his group had built, but no longer used, in Santa Clara, which was near Mountain View. Once again there was an echo of Shockley. They opened up shop with a dozen bright young electrical engineers, plus a few clerical and maintenance people, and bet everything on research and product development. Noyce and Moore, like Shockley, put on the white coats and worked at the laboratory tables. They would not be competing with Fairchild or anyone else in the already established semiconductor markets. They had decided to move into the most backward of computer technology, which was data storage, or “memory.” A computer’s memory was stored in ceramic ringlets known as cores. Each ringlet contained one “bit” of information, a “yes” or a “no,” in the logic of the binary system of mathematics that computers employ. Within two years Noyce and Moore had developed the 1103 memory chip, a chip of silicon and polysilicon the size of two letters in a line of type. Each chip contained four thousand transistors, did the work of a thousand ceramic ringlets, and did it faster. The production line still consisted of rows of women sitting at tables as in the old shed-and-rafter days, but the work bays now looked like something from out of an inter-galactic adventure movie. The women engraved the circuits on the silicon photographically, wearing antiseptic Mars Voyage suits, headgear, and gloves because a single speck of dust could ruin one of the miniature circuits. The circuits were so small that “miniature” no longer sounded small enough. The new word was “microminiature.” Everything now took place in an air-conditioned ice cube of vinyl tiles, stainless steel, fluorescent lighting, and backlit plastic. The 1103 memory chip opened up such a lucrative field that other companies, including Fairchild, fought desperately just to occupy the number-two position, filling the orders Intel couldn’t take care of. At the end of Intel’s first year in business, which had been devoted almost exclusively to research, sales totaled less than three thousand dollars and the work force numbered forty-two. In 1972, thanks largely to the 1103 chip, sales were $23.4 million and the work force numbered 1,002. In the next year sales almost tripled, to $66 million, and the work force increased two and a half times, to 2,528. So Noyce had the chance to run a new company from start-up to full production precisely the way he thought Shockley should have run his in Palo Alto back in the late 1950s. From the beginning Noyce gave all the engineers and most of the office workers stock options. He had learned at Fairchild that in a business so dependent upon research, stock options were a more powerful incentive than profit sharing. People sharing profits naturally wanted to concentrate on products that were already profitable rather than plunge into avant-garde research that would not pay off in the short run even if it were successful. But people with stock options lived for research breakthroughs. The news would send a semiconductor company’s stock up immediately, regardless of profits. Noyce’s idea was that every employee should feel that he could go as far and as fast in this industry as his talent would take him. He didn’t want any employee to look at the structure of Intel and see a complex set of hurdles. It went without saying that there would be no social hierarchy at Intel, no executive suites, no pinstripe set, no reserved parking places, or other symbols of the hierarchy. But Noyce wanted to go further. He had never liked the business of the office cubicles at Fairchild. As miserable as they were, the mere possession of one symbolized superior rank. At Intel executives would not be walled off in offices. Everybody would be in one big room. There would be nothing but low partitions to separate Noyce or anyone else from the lowliest stock boys trundling in the accordion printout paper. The whole place became like a shed. When they first moved into the building, Noyce worked at an old, scratched, secondhand metal desk. As the company expanded, Noyce kept the same desk, and new stenographers, just hired, were given desks that were not only newer but bigger and better than his. Everybody noticed the old beat-up desk, since there was nothing to keep anybody from looking at every inch of Noyce’s office space. Noyce enjoyed this subversion of the eastern corporate protocol of small metal desks for underlings and large wooden desks for overlords. At Intel, Noyce decided to eliminate the notion of levels of management altogether. He and Moore ran the show; that much was clear. But below them there were only the strategic business segments, as they called them. They were comparable to the major departments in an orthodox corporation, but they had far more autonomy. Each was run like a separate corporation. Middle managers at Intel had more responsibility than most vice-presidents back east. They were also much younger and got lower-back pain and migraines earlier. At Intel, if the marketing division had to make a major decision that would affect the engineering division, the problem was not routed up a hierarchy to a layer of executives who oversaw both departments. Instead, “councils,” made up of people already working on the line in the divisions that were affected, would meet and work it out themselves. The councils moved horizontally, from problem to problem. They had no vested power. They were not governing bodies but coordinating councils. Noyce was a great believer in meetings. The people in each department or work unit were encouraged to convene meetings whenever the spirit moved them. There were rooms set aside for meetings at Intel, and they were available on a first come, first served basis, just like the parking spaces. Often meetings were held at lunchtime. That was not a policy; it was merely an example set by Noyce. There were no executive lunches at Intel. Back east, in New York, executives treated lunch as a daily feast of the nobility, a sumptuous celebration of their eminence, in the Lucullan expense-account restaurants of Manhattan. The restaurants in the East and West Fifties of Manhattan were like something from out of a dream. They recruited chefs from all over Europe and the Orient. Pasta primavera, saucisson, sorrel mousse, homard cardinal, terrine de légumes Montesquiou, paillard de pigeon, medallions of beef Chinese Gordon, veal Valdostana, Verbena roast turkey with Hayman sweet potatoes flown in from the eastern shore of Virginia, raspberry soufflé, baked Alaska, zabaglione, pear torte, crème brulée—and the wines! and the brandies! and the port! the Sambuca! the cigars! and the decor!—walls with lacquered woodwork and winking mirrors and sconces with little pleated peach-colored shades, all of it designed by the very same decorators who walked duchesses to parties for Halston on Eaton Square!—and captains and maître d’s who made a fuss over you in movie French in front of your clients and friends and fellow overlords!—it was Mount Olympus in mid-Manhattan every day from twelve-thirty to three p.m., and you emerged into the pearl-gray light of the city with such ambrosia pumping through your veins that even the clotted streets with the garbagemen backing up their grinder trucks and yelling, “’Mon back, ’mon back, ’mon back, ’mon back,” as if talking Urban Chippewa—even this became part of the bliss of one’s eminence in the corporate world! There were many chief executive officers who kept their headquarters in New York long after the last rational reason for doing so had vanished ... because of the ineffable experience of being a CEO and having lunch five days a week in Manhattan! At Intel lunch had a different look to it. You could tell when it was noon at Intel, because at noon men in white aprons arrived at the front entrance gasping from the weight of the trays they were carrying. The trays were loaded down with deli sandwiches and waxed cups full of drinks with clear plastic tops, with globules of Sprite or Diet Shasta sliding around the tops on the inside. That was your lunch. You ate some sandwiches made of roast beef or chicken sliced into translucent rectangles by a machine in a processing plant and then reassembled on the bread in layers that gave off dank whiffs of hormones and chemicals, and you washed it down with Sprite or Diet Shasta, and you sat amid the particle-board partitions and metal desktops, and you kept your mind on your committee meeting. That was what Noyce did, and that was what everybody else did. If Noyce called a meeting, then he set the agenda. But after that, everybody was an equal. If you were a young engineer and you had an idea you wanted to get across, you were supposed to speak up and challenge Noyce or anybody else who didn’t get it right away. This was a little bit of heaven. You were face to face with the inventor, or the co-inventor, of the very road to El Dorado, and he was only forty-one years old, and he was listening to you. He had his head down and his eyes beamed up at you, and he was absorbing it all. He wasn’t a boss. He was Gary Cooper! He was here to help you be self-reliant and do as much as you could on your own. This wasn’t a corporation ... it was a congregation. By the same token, there were sermons and homilies. At Intel everyone—Noyce included—was expected to attend sessions on “the Intel Culture.” At these sessions the principles by which the company was run were spelled out and discussed. Some of the discussions had to do specifically with matters of marketing or production. Others had to do with the broadest philosophical principles of Intel and were explained via the Socratic method at management seminars by Intel’s number-three man, Andrew Grove. Grove would say, “How would you sum up the Intel approach?” Many hands would go up, and Grove would choose one, and the eager communicant would say: “At Intel you don’t wait for someone else to do it. You take the ball yourself and you run with it.” And Grove would say, “Wrong. At Intel you take the ball yourself and you let the air out and you fold the ball up and put it in your pocket. Then you take another ball and run with it and when you’ve crossed the goal you take the second ball out of your pocket and reinflate it and score twelve points instead of six.” Grove was the most colorful person at Intel. He was a thin man in his mid-thirties with tight black curls all over his head. The curls ran down into a pair of muttonchops that seemed to run together like goulash with his moustache. Every day he wore either a turtleneck jersey or an open shirt with an ornamental chain twinkling on his chest. He struck outsiders as the epitome of a style of the early 1970s known as California Groovy. In fact, Grove was the epitome of the religious principle that the greater the freedom—for example, the freedom to dress as you pleased—the greater the obligation to exercise discipline. Grove’s own groovy outfits were neat and clean. The truth was, he was a bit of a bear on the subject of neatness and cleanliness. He held what he called “Mr. Clean inspections,” showing up in various work areas wearing his muttonchops and handlebar moustache and his Harry Belafonte cane cutter’s shirt and the gleaming chainwork, inspecting offices for books stacked too high, papers strewn over desktops, everything short of running a white glove over the shelves, as if this were some California Groovy Communal version of Parris Island, while the chain twinkled in his chest hairs. Grove was also the inspiration for such items as the performance ratings and the Late List. Each employee received a report card periodically with a grade based on certain presumably objective standards. The grades were superior, exceeds requirements, meets requirements, marginally meets requirements, and does not meet requirements. This was the equivalent of A, B, C, D, and F in school. Noyce was all for it. “If you’re ambitious and hardworking,” he would say, “you want to be told how you’re doing.” In Noyce’s view, most of the young hotshots who were coming to work for Intel had never had the benefit of honest grades in their lives. In the late 1960s and early 1970s college faculties had been under pressure to give all students passing marks so they wouldn’t have to go off to Vietnam, and they had caved in, until the entire grading system was meaningless. At Intel they would learn what measuring up meant. The Late List was also like something from a strict school. Everyone was expected at work at eight a.m. A record was kept of how many employees arrived after 8:10 a.m. If 7 percent or more were late for three months, then everybody in the section had to start signing in. There was no inevitable penalty for being late, however. It was up to each department head to make of the Late List what he saw fit. If he knew a man was working overtime every night on a certain project then his presence on the Late List would probably be regarded as nothing more than that, a line on a piece of paper. At bottom—and this was part of the Intel Culture—Noyce and Grove knew that penalties were very nearly useless. Things like report cards and Late Lists worked only if they stimulated self-discipline. The worst form of discipline at Intel was to be called on the Antron II carpet before Noyce himself. Noyce insisted on ethical behavior in all dealings within the company and between companies. That was the word people used to describe his approach, ethical; that and moral. Noyce was known as a very aggressive businessman, but he stopped short of cutting throats—and he never talked about revenge. He would not tolerate peccadilloes such as little personal I’ll-reimburse-it-on-Monday dips into the petty cash. Noyce’s Strong Silent stare, his Gary Cooper approach, could be mortifying as well as inspiring. When he was angry, his baritone voice never rose. He seemed like a powerful creature that only through the greatest self-control was refraining from an attack. He somehow created the impression that if pushed one more inch, he would fight. As a consequence he seldom had to. No one ever trifled with Bob Noyce. Noyce managed to create an ethical universe within an inherently amoral setting: the American business corporation in the second half of the twentieth century. At Intel there was good and there was evil, and there was freedom and there was discipline, and to an extraordinary degree employees internalized these matters, as if members of Cromwell’s army. As the work force grew at Intel, and the profits soared, labor unions, chiefly the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, the Teamsters, and the Stationary Engineers Union, made several attempts to organize Intel. Noyce made known, albeit quietly, that he regarded unionization as a death threat to Intel, and to the semiconductor industry generally. Labor-management battles were part of the ancient terrain of the East. If Intel were divided into workers and bosses, with the implication that each side had to squeeze its money out of the hides of the other, the enterprise would be finished. Motivation would no longer be internal; it would be objectified in the deadly form of work rules and grievance procedures. The one time it came down to a vote, the union lost by the considerable margin of four to one. Intel’s employees agreed with Noyce. Unions were part of the dead hand of the past.... Noyce and Intel were on the road to El Dorado. By the early 1970s Noyce and Moore’s 1103 memory chip had given this brand-new company an entire corner of the semiconductor market. But that was only the start. Now a thirty-two-year-old Intel engineer named Ted Hoff came up with an invention as important as Noyce’s integrated circuit had been a decade earlier: the microprocessor. The microprocessor was known as “the computer on a chip,” because it put all the arithmetic and logic functions of a computer on a chip the size of the head of a tack. The possibilities for creating and using small computers now surpassed most people’s imagining, even within the industry. One of the more obvious possibilities was placing a small computer in the steering and braking mechanisms of a car that would take over for the driver in case of a skid or excessive speed on a curve. In Ted Hoff, Noyce was looking at proof enough of his hypothesis that out here on the electrical frontier the great flashes came to the young. Hoff was about the same age Noyce had been when he invented his integrated circuit. The glory was now Hoff’s. But Noyce took Hoff’s triumph as proof of a second hypothesis. If you created the right type of corporate community, the right type of autonomous congregation, genius would flower. Certainly the corporate numbers were flowering. The news of the microprocessor, on top of the success of the 1103 memory chip, nearly trebled the value of Intel stock from 1971 to 1973. Noyce’s own holdings were worth $18.5 million. He was in roughly the same position as Josiah Grinnell a hundred years before, when Grinnell brought Rock Island Railroad into Iowa. NOYCE CONTINUED TO live in the house in Los Altos hills that he had bought in 1960. He was not reluctant to spend his money; he was merely reluctant to show it. He spent a fortune on landscaping, but you could do that and the world would be none the wiser. Gradually the house disappeared from view behind an enormous wall of trees, tropical bushes, and cockatoo flowers. Noyce had a pond created on the back lawn, a waterscape elaborate enough to put on a bus tour, but nobody other than guests ever saw it. The lawn stretched on for several acres and had a tennis court, a swimming pool, and more walls of boughs and hot-pastel blossoms, and the world saw none of that, either. Noyce drove a Porsche roadster, and he didn’t mind letting it out for a romp. Back east, when men made a great deal of money, they tended to put a higher and higher value on their own hides. Noyce, on the other hand, seemed to enjoy finding new ways to hang his out over the edge. He took up paragliding over the ski slopes at Aspen on a Rogolla wing. He built a Quicksilver hang glider and flew it off cliffs until a friend of his, a champion at the sport, fractured his pelvis and a leg flying a Quicksilver. He also took up scuba diving, and now he had his Porsche. The high-performance foreign sports car became one of the signatures of the successful Silicon Valley entrepreneur. The sports car was perfect. Its richness consisted of something small, dense, and hidden: the engineering beneath the body shell. Not only that, the very luxury of a sports car was the experience of driving it yourself. A sports car didn’t even suggest a life with servants. Porsches and Ferraris became the favorites. By 1975 the Ferrari agency in Los Gatos was the second biggest Ferrari agency on the West Coast. Noyce also bought a 1947 Republic Seabee amphibious airplane, so that he could take the family for weekends on the lakes in northern California. He now had two aircraft, but he flew the ships himself. Noyce was among the richest individuals on the San Francisco Peninsula, as well as the most important figure in the Silicon Valley, but his name seldom appeared in the San Francisco newspapers. When it did, it was in the business section, not on the society page. That, too, became the pattern for the new rich of the Silicon Valley. San Francisco was barely forty-five minutes up the Bayshore Freeway from Los Altos, but psychologically San Francisco was an entire continent away. It was a city whose luminaries kept looking back east, to New York, to see if they were doing things correctly. In 1974 Noyce wound up in a situation that to some seemed an all-too-typical Mid-life in the Silicon Valley story. He and Betty, his wife of twenty-one years, were divorced, and the following year he “intra-married.” Noyce, who was forty-seven, married Intel’s personnel director, Ann Bowers, who was thirty-seven. The divorce was mentioned in the San Francisco Chronicle, but not as a social note. It was a major business story. Under California law, Betty received half the family’s assets. When word got out that she was going to sell off $6 million of her Intel stock in the interest of diversifying her fortune, it threw the entire market in Intel stock into a temporary spin. Betty left California and went to live in a village on the coast of Maine. Noyce kept the house in Los Altos. By this time, the mid-1970s, the Silicon Valley had become the late-twentieth-century-California version of a new city, and Noyce and other entrepreneurs began to indulge in some introspection. For ten years, thanks to racial hostilities and the leftist politics of the antiwar movement, the national press had dwelled on the subject of ethnic backgrounds. This in itself tended to make the engineers and entrepreneurs of the Silicon Valley conscious of how similar most of them were. Most of the major figures, like Noyce himself, had grown up and gone to college in small towns in the Middle West and the West. John Bardeen had grown up in and gone to college in Madison, Wisconsin. Walter Brattain had grown up in and gone to college in Washington. Shockley grew up in Palo Alto at a time when it was a small college town and went to the California Institute of Technology. Jack Kilby was born in Jefferson City, Missouri, and went to college at the University of Illinois. William Hewlett was born in Ann Arbor and went to school at Stanford. David Packard grew up in Pueblo, Colorado, and went to Stanford. Oliver Buckley grew up in Sloane, Iowa, and went to college at Grinnell. Lee De Forest came from Council Bluffs, Iowa (and went to Yale). And Thomas Edison grew up in Port Huron, Michigan, and didn’t go to college at all. Some of them, such as Noyce and Shockley, had gone east to graduate school at MIT, since it was the most prestigious engineering school in the United States. But MIT had proved to be a backwater ... the sticks ... when it came to the most advanced form of engineering, solid-state electronics. Grinnell College, with its one thousand students, had been years ahead of MIT. The picture had been the same on the other great frontier of technology in the second half of the twentieth century, namely, the space program. The engineers who fulfilled one of man’s most ancient dreams, that of traveling to the moon, came from the same background, the small towns of the Midwest and the West. After the triumph of Apollo 11, when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first mortals to walk on the moon, NASA’s administrator, Tom Paine, happened to remark in conversation: “This was the triumph of the squares.” A reporter overheard him—and did the press ever have a time with that! But Paine had come up with a penetrating insight. As it says in the Book of Matthew, the last shall be first. It was engineers from the supposedly backward and narrow-minded boondocks who had provided not only the genius but also the passion and the daring that won the space race and carried out John F. Kennedy’s exhortation, back in 1961, to put a man on the moon “before this decade is out.” The passion and the daring of these engineers was as remarkable as their talent. Time after time they had to shake off the meddling hands of timid souls from back east. The contribution of MIT to Project Mercury was minus one. The minus one was Jerome Wiesner of the MIT electronic research lab, who was brought in by Kennedy as a special adviser to straighten out the space program when it seemed to be faltering early in 1961. Wiesner kept flinching when he saw what NASA’s boondockers were preparing to do. He tried to persuade Kennedy to forfeit the manned space race to the Soviets and concentrate instead on unmanned scientific missions. The boondockers of Project Mercury, starting with the project’s director, Bob Gilruth, an aeronautical engineer from Nashwauk, Minnesota, dodged Wiesner for months, like moonshiners evading a roadblock, until they got astronaut Alan Shepard launched on the first Mercury mission. Who had time to waste on players as behind the times as Jerome Wiesner and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ... out here on technology’s leading edge? Just why was it that small-town boys from the Middle West dominated the engineering frontiers? Noyce concluded it was because in a small town you became a technician, a tinker, an engineer, and an inventor, by necessity. “In a small town,” Noyce liked to say, “when something breaks down, you don’t wait around for a new part, because it’s not coming. You make it yourself.” Yet in Grinnell necessity had been the least of the mothers of invention. There had been something else about Grinnell, something people Noyce’s age could feel but couldn’t name. It had to do with the fact that Grinnell had once been a religious community; not merely a town with a church but a town that was inseparable from the church. In Josiah Grinnell’s day most of the townspeople were devout Congregationalists, and the rest were smart enough to act as if they were. Anyone in Grinnell who aspired to the status of feed-store clerk or better joined the First Congregational Church. By the end of the Second World War educated people in Grinnell, and in all the Grinnells of the Middle West, had begun to drop this side of their history into a lake of amnesia. They gave in to the modem urge to be urbane. They themselves began to enjoy sniggering over Sherwood Anderson’s Winesburg, Ohio, Sinclair Lewis’s Main Street, and Grant Wood’s American Gothic. Once the amnesia set in, all they remembered from the old days were the austere moral codes, which in some cases still hung on. Josiah Grinnell’s real estate covenants prohibiting drinking, for example.... Just imagine! How absurd it was to see these unburied bones of something that had once been strong and alive. That something was Dissenting Protestantism itself. Oh, it had once been quite strong and very much alive! The passion—the exhilaration!—of those early days was what no one could any longer recall. To be a believing Protestant in a town such as Grinnell in the middle of the nineteenth century was to experience a spiritual ecstasy greater than any that the readers of Main Street or the viewers of American Gothic were likely to know in their lifetimes. Josiah Grinnell had gone to Iowa in 1854 to create nothing less than a City of Light. He was a New Englander who had given up on the East. He had founded the first Congregational church in Washington, D.C., and then defected from it when the congregation, mostly southerners, objected to his antislavery views. He went to New York and met the famous editor of the New York Herald, Horace Greeley. It was while talking to Josiah Grinnell, who was then thirty-two and wondering what to do with his life, that Greeley uttered the words for which he would be remembered forever after: “Go west, young man, go west.” So Grinnell went to Iowa, and he and three friends bought up five thousand acres of land in order to start up a Congregational community the way he thought it should be done. A City of Light! The first thing he organized was the congregation. The second was the college. Oxford and Cambridge had started banning Dissenting Protestants in the seventeenth century; Dissenters founded their own schools and colleges. Grinnell became a champion of “free schools,” and it was largely thanks to him that Iowa had one of the first and best public-school systems in the west. To this day Iowa has the highest literacy rate of any state. In the 1940s a bright youngster whose parents were not rich—such as Bob Noyce or his brother Donald—was far more likely to receive a superior education in Iowa than in Massachusetts. And if he was extremely bright, if he seemed to have the quality known as genius, he was infinitely more likely to go into engineering in Iowa, or Illinois or Wisconsin, than anywhere in the East. Back east engineering was an unfashionable field. The East looked to Europe in matters of intellectual fashion, and in Europe the ancient aristocratic bias against manual labor lived on. Engineering was looked upon as nothing more than manual labor raised to the level of a science. There was “pure” science and there was engineering, which was merely practical. Back east engineers ranked, socially, below lawyers; doctors; Army colonels; Navy captains; English, history, biology, chemistry, and physics professors; and business executives. This piece of European snobbery had never reached Grinnell, Iowa, however. Neither had the corollary piece of snobbery that said a scientist was lowering himself by going into commerce. Dissenting Protestants looked upon themselves as secular saints, men and women of God who did God’s work not as penurious monks and nuns but as successful workers in the everyday world. To be rich and successful was even better, and just as righteous. One of Josiah Grinnell’s main projects was to bring the Rock Island Railroad into Iowa. Many in his congregation became successful farmers of the gloriously fertile soil around Grinnell. But there was no sense of rich and poor. All the congregation opened up the virgin land in a common struggle out on the frontier. They had given up the comforts of the East ... in order to create a City of Light in the name of the Lord. Every sacrifice, every privation, every denial of the pleasures of the flesh, brought them closer to that state of bliss in which the light of God shines forth from the apex of the soul. What were the momentary comforts and aristocratic poses of the East ... compared to this? Where would the fleshpots back east be on that day when the heavens opened up and a light fell ’round about them and a voice from on high said: “Why mockest thou me?” The light! The light! Who, if he had ever known that glorious light, if he had ever let his soul burst forth into that light, could ever mock these, my very seed, with a Main Street or an American Gothic! There, in Grinnell, reigned the passion that enabled men and women to settle the West in the nineteenth century against the most astonishing odds and in the face of overbearing hardships. By the standards of St. Francis of Assisi or St. Jerome, who possessed nothing beyond the cloak of righteousness, Josiah Grinnell was a very secular saint, indeed. And Robert Noyce’s life was a great deal more secular than Josiah Grinnell’s. Noyce had wandered away from the church itself. He smoked. He took a drink when he felt like it. He had gotten a divorce. Nevertheless, when Noyce went west, he brought Grinnell with him ... unaccountably sewn into the lining of his coat! In the last stage of his career Josiah Grinnell had turned from the building of his community to broader matters affecting Iowa and the Middle West. In 1863 he became one of midland Iowa’s representatives in Congress. Likewise, in 1974 Noyce turned over the actual running of Intel to Gordon Moore and Andrew Grove and kicked himself upstairs to become chairman of the board. His major role became that of spokesman for the Silicon Valley and the electronic frontier itself. He became chairman of the Semiconductor Industry Association. He led the industry’s campaign to deal with the mounting competition from Japan. He was awarded the National Medal of Science in a White House ceremony in 1980. He was appointed to the University of California Board of Regents in 1982 and inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in February 1983. By now Intel’s sales had grown from $64 million in 1973 to almost a billion a year. Noyce’s own fortune was incalculable. (Grinnell College’s $300,000 investment had multiplied in value more than thirty times, despite some sell-offs, almost doubling the college’s endowment.) Noyce was hardly a famous man in the usual sense, however. He was practically unknown to the general public. But among those who followed the semiconductor industry he was a legend. He was certainly famous back east on Wall Street. When a reporter asked James Magid of the underwriting firm of L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin about Noyce, he said: “Noyce is a national treasure.” Oh yes! What a treasure, indeed, was the moral capital of the nineteenth century! Noyce happened to grow up in a family in which the long-forgotten light of Dissenting Protestantism still burned brightly. The light!—the light at the apex of every human soul! Ironically, it was that long-forgotten light ... from out of the churchy, blue-nosed sticks ... that led the world into the twenty-first century, across the electronic grid and into space. Surely the moral capital of the nineteenth century is by now all but completely spent. Robert Noyce turns fifty-six this month, and his is the last generation to have grown up in families where the light existed in anything approaching a pure state. And yet out in the Silicon Valley some sort of light shines still. People who run even the newest companies in the Valley repeat Noycisms with conviction and with relish. The young CEOs all say: “Datadyne is not a corporation, it’s a culture,” or “Cybernetek is not a corporation, it’s a society,” or “Honey Bear’s assets”—the latest vogue is for down-home nontech names—“Honey Bear’s assets aren’t hardware, they’re the software of the three thousand souls who work here.” They talk about the soul and spiritual vision as if it were the most natural subject in the world for a well-run company to be concerned about. On June 8, 1983, one of the Valley’s new firms, Eagle Computer, Inc., sold its stock to the public for the first time. Investors went for it like the answer to a dream. At the close of trading on the stock market, the company’s forty-year-old CEO, Dennis Barnhart, was suddenly worth nine million dollars. Four and a half hours later he and a pal took his Ferrari out for a little romp, hung their hides out over the edge, lost control on a curve in Los Gatos, and went through a guardrail, and Barnhart was killed. Naturally, that night people in the business could talk of very little else. One of the best-known CEOs in the Valley said, “It’s the dark side of the Force.” He said it without a trace of irony, and his friends nodded in contemplation. They knew exactly what Force he meant. *Dirk Hanson, The New Alchemists (Boston: Little, Brown, 1982).

Welcome back to our Sunday edition, where we round up some of our top stories and take you inside our newsroom. Jade Bonacolta landed five promotions at LinkedIn in less than seven years. The secret to her success? A 3-step "pre-read" email she sent her manager before each one-on-one meeting. On the agenda today: But first: A trip to San Francisco. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Business Insider's app here. I spent much of the past week in San Francisco, where I met many of my West Coast-based colleagues for the first time. What a talented team! It was especially exciting to see them in action. On Tuesday night, a bunch of us were out for drinks around the waterfront — but two people were missing. It turned out they were working on a big scoop: Mira Murati, OpenAI's former chief technology officer, was aiming to raise a $1 billion funding round at about a $9 billion valuation for her new startup, Thinking Machines Lab. "A $9 billion valuation is unusually high for a startup less than a year old, but investors have been eager to back AI startups, especially those founded by former OpenAI employees," wrote Ben Bergman and Julia Hornstein, who broke the story. It certainly got the attention of Elon Musk, who replied to an X user who wondered "How the heck is it valued at $9 billion?" That wasn't the only tech scoop we had this past week. Hugh Langley wrote about Google employees tracking the company's layoffs in a Google Doc. Meanwhile, Eugene Kim revealed Amazon is cracking down on job seekers who use AI in the interview process, which you can read more about below. We also spent some time meeting with VCs and founders. Steve Russolillo, our Chief News Editor, and I had breakfast with Sarah Guo, a Goldman Sachs and Greylock alum who started her own AI-focused VC fund, Conviction, a few years ago. Click here for a Q&A on her views on spotting AI opportunities, making it in tech, and more. The pace of change and the capital at stake in tech right now are mindblowing. Our crackerjack staff is committed to chronicling the boom and what it means for people trying to make it during this wild time. As always, please let me know what you think, at eic@businessinsider.com. At JPMorgan, Monday marks the the beginning of the end of hybrid work. It could also be the start of a standoff between some of the bank's tech workers and CEO Jamie Dimon. Following Dimon's harsh words about remote work, BI spoke with a handful of recruiters and JPMorgan employees about what's to come. While 70% of the bank's employees are back in the office five days a week, tech workers are among those still working a few days from home. Some employees told BI they are considering putting out feelers elsewhere. Others — including Nicolas Welch, who sparked Dimon's infamous town hall comments — want to stick around, under certain conditions. Is RTO a dealbreaker? For years, advanced degrees were a safety net people believed they could rely on when the job market got tough. More recently, the opposite is ringing true. The shift to remote work, skills-based hiring, and AI have altered the white-collar landscape. People with advanced degrees now face longer job searches than their less-educated peers. Some highly educated candidates are even hiding their credentials to try and increase their employment chances. Unemployment by degrees. Goldman Sachs' Dallas office has existed for decades, but it's now experiencing a massive growth spurt. What was once a back-office hub for real estate and private wealth is now the bank's second-largest US office, behind New York. Dallas' lower cost of living and open-door culture are just two of the highlights of working there, employees told BI. A suite for every Mavericks game and free entry to the Nasher Sculpture Center don't hurt, either. Wall Street heads west. Also read: When it comes to AI, Amazon is all for it — except during its job interviews. The retail giant is cracking down on job seekers using AI tools in interviews. Candidates could be disqualified from the hiring process if caught doing so, according to recent Amazon guidelines that BI obtained. The trend is sparking a debate across Silicon Valley. Some companies are open to allowing these apps in job interviews because they're already used at work. A double standard. This week's quote: "I saw it come down. I knew immediately this was really bad — this was one of those moments where things change." — A supervisor who witnessed a freelance crew member get injured on the set of MrBeast's "Beast Games" game show. More of this week's top reads: Can America's kids read? It'll be harder to know after Trump's education cuts, researchers say.

Title: Pluralistic: With Great Power Came No Responsibility (26 Feb 2025) – Pluralistic: Daily links from Cory Doctorow

Pluralistic: Daily links from Cory Doctorow No trackers, no ads. Black type, white background. Privacy policy: we don't collect or retain any data at all ever period. Last night, I traveled to Toronto to deliver the annual Ursula Franklin Lecture at the University of Toronto's Innis College: The lecture was called "With Great Power Came No Responsibility: How Enshittification Conquered the 21st Century and How We Can Overthrow It." It's the latest major speech in my series of talks on the subject, which started with last year's McLuhan Lecture in Berlin: https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/30/go-nuts-meine-kerle/#ich-bin-ein-bratapfel And continued with a summer Defcon keynote: https://pluralistic.net/2024/08/17/hack-the-planet/#how-about-a-nice-game-of-chess This speech specifically addresses the unique opportunities for disenshittification created by Trump's rapid unscheduled midair disassembly of the international free trade system. The US used trade deals to force nearly every country in the world to adopt the IP laws that make enshittification possible, and maybe even inevitable. As Trump burns these trade deals to the ground, the rest of the world has an unprecedented opportunity to retaliate against American bullying by getting rid of these laws and producing the tools, devices and services that can protect every tech user (including Americans) from being ripped off by US Big Tech companies. I'm so grateful for the chance to give this talk. I was hosted for the day by the Centre for Culture and Technology, which was founded by Marshall McLuhan, and is housed in the coach house he used for his office. The talk itself took place in Innis College, named for Harold Innis, who is definitely the thinking person's Marshall McLuhan. What's more, I was mentored by Innis's daughter, Anne Innis Dagg, a radical, brilliant feminist biologist who pretty much invented the field of giraffology: https://pluralistic.net/2020/02/19/pluralist-19-feb-2020/#annedagg But with all respect due to Anne and her dad, Ursula Franklin is the thinking person's Harold Innis. A brilliant scientist, activist and communicator who dedicated her life to the idea that the most important fact about a technology wasn't what it did, but who it did it for and who it did it to. Getting to work out of McLuhan's office to present a talk in Innis's theater that was named after Franklin? Swoon! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_Franklin Here's the text of the talk, lightly edited: I know tonight’s talk is supposed to be about decaying tech platforms, but I want to start by talking about nurses. A January 2025 report from Groundwork Collective documents how increasingly nurses in the USA are hired through gig apps – "Uber for nurses” – so nurses never know from one day to the next whether they're going to work, or how much they'll get paid. There's something high-tech going on here with those nurses' wages. These nursing apps – a cartel of three companies, Shiftkey, Shiftmed and Carerev – can play all kinds of games with labor pricing. Before Shiftkey offers a nurse a shift, it purchases that worker's credit history from a data-broker. Specifically, it pays to find out how much credit-card debt the nurse is carrying, and whether it is overdue. The more desperate the nurse's financial straits are, the lower the wage on offer. Because the more desperate you are, the less it'll take to get get you to come and do the gruntwork of caring for the sick, the elderly, and the dying. Now, there are lots of things going on here, and they're all terrible. What's more, they are emblematic of “enshittification,” the word I coined to describe the decay of online platforms. When I first started writing about this, I focused on the external symptomology of enshittification, a three stage process: First, the platform is good to its end users, while finding a way to lock them in. Like Google, which minimized ads and maximized spending on engineering for search results, even as they bought their way to dominance, bribing every service or product with a search box to make it a Google search box. So no matter what browser you used, what mobile OS you used, what carrier you had, you would always be searching on Google by default. This got so batshit that by the early 2020s, Google was spending enough money to buy a whole-ass Twitter, every year or two, just to make sure that no one ever tried a search engine that wasn't Google. That's stage one: be good to end users, lock in end users. Stage two is when the platform starts to abuse end users to tempt in and enrich business customers. For Google, that’s advertisers and web publishers. An ever-larger fraction of a Google results page is given over to ads, which are marked with ever-subtler, ever smaller, ever grayer labels. Google uses its commercial surveillance data to target ads to us. So that's stage two: things get worse for end users and get better for business customers. But those business customers also get locked into the platform, dependent on those customers. Once businesses are getting as little as 10% of their revenue from Google, leaving Google becomes an existential risk. We talk a lot about Google's "monopoly" power, which is derived from its dominance as a seller. But Google is also a monopsony, a powerful buyer. So now you have Google acting as a monopolist to its users (stage one), and a monoposonist for its business customers (stage two) and here comes stage three: where Google claws back all the value in the platform, save a homeopathic residue calculated to keep end users locked in, and business customers locked to those end users. Google becomes enshittified. In 2019, Google had a turning point. Search had grown as much as it possibly could. More than 90% of us used Google for search, and we searched for everything. Any thought or idle question that crossed our minds, we typed into Google. How could Google grow? There were no more users left to switch to Google. We weren't going to search for more things. What could Google do? Well, thanks to internal memos published during last year's monopoly trial against Google, we know what they did. They made search worse. They reduced the system's accuracy it so you had to search twice or more to get to the answer, thus doubling the number of queries, and doubling the number of ads. Meanwhile, Google entered into a secret, illegal collusive arrangement with Facebook, codenamed Jedi Blue, to rig the ad market, fixing prices so advertisers paid more and publishers got less. And that's how we get to the enshittified Google of today, where every query serves back a blob of AI slop, over five paid results tagged with the word AD in 8-point, 10% grey on white type, which is, in turn, over ten spammy links from SEO shovelware sites filled with more AI slop. And yet, we still keep using Google, because we're locked into it. That's enshittification, from the outside. A company that's good to end users, while locking them in. Then it makes things worse for end users, to make things better for business customers, while locking them in. Then it takes all the value for itself and turns into a giant pile of shit. Enshittification, a tragedy in three acts. I started off focused on the outward signs of enshittification, but I think it's time we start thinking about what's going in inside the companies to make enshittification possible. What is the technical mechanism for enshittification? I call it twiddling. Digital businesses have infinite flexibility, bequeathed to them by the marvellously flexible digital computers they run on. That means that firms can twiddle the knobs that control the fundamental aspects of their business. Every time you interact with a firm, everything is different: prices, costs, search rankings, recommendations. Which takes me back to our nurses. This scam, where you look up the nurse's debt load and titer down the wage you offer based on it in realtime? That's twiddling. It's something you can only do with a computer. The bosses who are doing this aren't more evil than bosses of yore, they just have better tools. Note that these aren't even tech bosses. These are health-care bosses, who happen to have tech. Digitalization – weaving networked computers through a firm or a sector – enables this kind of twiddling that allows firms to shift value around, from end users to business customers, from business customers back to end users, and eventually, inevitably, to themselves. And digitalization is coming to every sector – like nursing. Which means enshittification is coming to every sector – like nursing. The legal scholar Veena Dubal coined a term to describe the twiddling that suppresses the wages of debt-burdened nurses. It's called "Algorithmic Wage Discrimination," and it follows the gig economy. The gig economy is a major locus of enshittification, and it’s the largest tear in the membrane separating the virtual world from the real world. Gig work, where your shitty boss is a shitty app, and you aren't even allowed to call yourself an employee. Uber invented this trick. Drivers who are picky about the jobs the app puts in front of them start to get higher wage offers. But if they yield to temptation and take some of those higher-waged option, then the wage starts to go down again, in random intervals, by small increments, designed to be below the threshold for human perception. Not so much boiling the frog as poaching it, until the Uber driver has gone into debt to buy a new car, and given up the side hustles that let them be picky about the rides they accepted. Then their wage goes down, and down, and down. Twiddling is a crude trick done quickly. Any task that's simple but time consuming is a prime candidate for automation, and this kind of wage-theft would be unbearably tedious, labor-intensive and expensive to perform manually. No 19th century warehouse full of guys with green eyeshades slaving over ledgers could do this. You need digitalization. Twiddling nurses' hourly wages is a perfect example of the role digitization pays in enshittification. Because this kind of thing isn't just bad for nurses – it's bad for patients, too. Do we really think that paying nurses based on how desperate they are, at a rate calculated to increase that desperation, and thus decrease the wage they are likely to work for, is going to result in nurses delivering the best care? Do you want to your catheter inserted by a nurse on food stamps, who drove an Uber until midnight the night before, and skipped breakfast this morning in order to make rent? This is why it’s so foolish to say "If you're not paying for the product, you're the product." “If you’re not paying for the product” ascribes a mystical power to advertising-driven services: the power to bypass our critical faculties by surveilling us, and data-mining the resulting dossiers to locate our mental bind-spots, and weaponize them to get us to buy anything an advertiser is selling. In this formulation, we are complicit in our own exploitation. By choosing to use "free" services, we invite our own exploitation by surveillance capitalists who have perfected a mind-control ray powered by the surveillance data we're voluntarily handing over by choosing ad-driven services. The moral is that if we only went back to paying for things, instead of unrealistically demanding that everything be free, we would restore capitalism to its functional, non-surveillant state, and companies would start treating us better, because we'd be the customers, not the products. That's why the surveillance capitalism hypothesis elevates companies like Apple as virtuous alternatives. Because Apple charges us money, rather than attention, it can focus on giving us better service, rather than exploiting us. There's a superficially plausible logic to this. After all, in 2022, Apple updated its iOS operating system, which runs on iPhones and other mobile devices, introducing a tick box that allowed you to opt out of third-party surveillance, most notably Facebook’s. 96% of Apple customers ticked that box. The other 4% were, presumably drunk, or Facebook employees, or Facebook employees who were drunk. Which makes sense, because if I worked for Facebook, I'd be drunk all the time. So on the face of it, it seems like Apple isn't treating its customers like "the product." But simultaneously with this privacy measure, Apple was secretly turning on its own surveillance system for iPhone owners, which would spy on them in exactly the way Facebook had, for exactly the same purpose: to target ads to you based on the places you'd been, the things you'd searched for, the communications you'd had, the links you'd clicked. Apple didn't ask its customers for permission to spy on them. It didn't let opt out of this spying. It didn’t even tell them about it, and when it was caught, Apple lied about it. It goes without saying that the $1000 Apple distraction rectangle in your pocket is something you paid for. The fact that you've paid for it doesn't stop Apple from treating you as the product. Apple treats its business customers – app vendors – like the product, screwing them out of 30 cents on every dollar they bring in, with mandatory payment processing fees that are 1,000% higher than the already extortionate industry norm. Apple treats its end users – people who shell out a grand for a phone – like the product, spying on them to help target ads to them. Apple treats everyone like the product. This is what's going on with our gig-app nurses: the nurses are the product. The patients are the product. The hospitals are the product. In enshittification, "the product" is anyone who can be productized. Fair and dignified treatment is not something you get as a customer loyalty perk, in exchange for parting with your money, rather than your attention. How do you get fair and dignified treatment? Well, I'm gonna get to that, but let's stay with our nurses for a while first. The nurses are the product, and they're being twiddled, because they've been conscripted into the tech industry, via the digitalization of their own industry. It's tempting to blame digitalization for this. But tech companies were not born enshittified. They spent years – decades – making pleasing products. If you're old enough to remember the launch of Google, you'll recall that, at the outset, Google was magic. You could Ask Jeeves questions for a million years, you could load up Altavista with ten trillion boolean search operators meant to screen out low-grade results, and never come up with answers as crisp, as useful, as helpful, as the ones you'd get from a few vaguely descriptive words in a Google search-bar. There's a reason we all switched to Google. Why so many of us bought iPhones. Why we joined our friends on Facebook. All of these services were born digital. They could have enshittified at any time. But they didn't – until they did. And they did it all at once. If you were a nurse, and every patient that staggered into the ER had the same dreadful symptoms, you'd call the public health department and report a suspected outbreak of a new and dangerous epidemic. Ursula Franklin held that technology's outcomes were not preordained. They are the result of deliberate choices. I like that very much, it's a very science fictional way of thinking about technology. Good science fiction isn't merely about what the technology does, but who it does it for, and who it does it to. Those social factors are far more important than the mere technical specifications of a gadget. They're the difference between a system that warns you when you're about to drift out of your lane, and a system that tells your insurer that you nearly drifted out of your lane, so they can add $10 to your monthly premium. They’re the difference between a spell checker that lets you know you've made a typo, and bossware that lets your manager use the number of typos you made this quarter so he can deny your bonus. They’re the difference between an app that remembers where you parked your car, and an app that uses the location of your car as a criterion for including you in a reverse warrant for the identities of everyone in the vicinity of an anti-government protest. I believe that enshittification is caused by changes not to technology, but to the policy environment. These are changes to the rules of the game, undertaken in living memory, by named parties, who were warned at the time about the likely outcomes of their actions, who are today very rich and respected, and face no consequences or accountability for their role in ushering in the enshittocene. They venture out into polite society without ever once wondering if someone is sizing them up for a pitchfork. In other words: I think we created a crimogenic environment, a perfect breeding pool for the most pathogenic practices in our society, that have therefore multiplied, dominating decision-making in our firms and states, leading to a vast enshittening of everything. And I think there's good news there, because if enshittification isn't the result of a new kind of evil person, or the great forces of history bearing down on the moment to turn everything to shit, but rather the result of specific policy choices, then we can reverse those policies, make better ones and emerge from the enshittocene, consigning the enshitternet to the scrapheap of history, a mere transitional state between the old, good internet, and a new, good internet. I'm not going to talk about AI today, because oh my god is AI a boring, overhyped subject. But I will use a metaphor about AI, about the limited liability company, which is a kind of immortal, artificial colony organism in which human beings serve as a kind of gut flora. My colleague Charlie Stross calls corporations "slow AI.” So you've got these slow AIs whose guts are teeming with people, and the AI's imperative, the paperclip it wants to maximize, is profit. To maximize profits, you charge as much as you can, you pay your workers and suppliers as little as you can, you spend as little as possible on safety and quality. Every dollar you don't spend on suppliers, workers, quality or safety is a dollar that can go to executives and shareholders. So there's a simple model of the corporation that could maximize its profits by charging infinity dollars, while paying nothing to its workers or suppliers, and ignoring quality and safety. But that corporation wouldn't make any money, for the obvious reasons that none of us would buy what it was selling, and no one would work for it or supply it with goods. These constraints act as disciplining forces that tamp down the AI's impulse to charge infinity and pay nothing. In tech, we have four of these constraints, anti-enshittificatory sources of discipline that make products and services better, pay workers more, and keep executives’ and shareholders' wealth from growing at the expense of customers, suppliers and labor. The first of these constraints is markets. All other things being equal, a business that charges more and delivers less will lose customers to firms that are more generous about sharing value with workers, customers and suppliers. This is the bedrock of capitalist theory, and it's the ideological basis for competition law, what our American cousins call "antitrust law." The first antitrust law was 1890's Sherman Act, whose sponsor, Senator John Sherman, stumped for it from the senate floor, saying: If we will not endure a King as a political power we should not endure a King over the production, transportation, and sale of the necessaries of life. If we would not submit to an emperor we should not submit to an autocrat of trade with power to prevent competition and to fix the price of any commodity. Senator Sherman was reflecting the outrage of the anitmonopolist movement of the day, when proprietors of monopolistic firms assumed the role of dictators, with the power to decide who would work, who would starve, what could be sold, and what it cost. Lacking competitors, they were too big to fail, too big to jail, and too big to care. As Lily Tomlin used to put it in her spoof AT&T ads on SNL: "We don't care. We don't have to. We're the phone company.” So what happened to the disciplining force of competition? We killed it. Starting 40-some years ago, the Reagaonomic views of the Chicago School economists transformed antitrust. They threw out John Sherman's idea that we need to keep companies competitive to prevent the emergence of "autocrats of trade,"and installed the idea that monopolies are efficient. In other words, if Google has a 90% search market share, which it does, then we must infer that Google is the best search engine ever, and the best search engine possible. The only reason a better search engine hasn't stepped in is that Google is so skilled, so efficient, that there is no conceivable way to improve upon it. We can tell that Google is the best because it has a monopoly, and we can tell that the monopoly is good because Google is the best. So 40 years ago, the US – and its major trading partners – adopted an explicitly pro-monopoly competition policy. Now, you'll be glad to hear that this isn't what happened to Canada. The US Trade Rep didn't come here and force us to neuter our competition laws. But don't get smug! The reason that didn't happen is that it didn't have to. Because Canada had no competition law to speak of, and never has. In its entire history, the Competition Bureau has challenged three mergers, and it has halted precisely zero mergers, which is how we've ended up with a country that is beholden to the most mediocre plutocrats imaginable like the Irvings, the Westons, the Stronachs, the McCains and the Rogerses. The only reason these chinless wonders were able to conquer this country is that the Americans had been crushing their monopolists before they could conquer the US and move on to us. But 40 years ago, the rest of the world adopted the Chicago School's pro-monopoly "consumer welfare standard,” and we got…monopolies. Monopolies in pharma, beer, glass bottles, vitamin C, athletic shoes, microchips, cars, mattresses, eyeglasses, and, of course, professional wrestling. Remember: these are specific policies adopted in living memory, by named individuals, who were warned, and got rich, and never faced consequences. The economists who conceived of these policies are still around today, polishing their fake Nobel prizes, teaching at elite schools, making millions consulting for blue-chip firms. When we confront them with the wreckage their policies created, they protest their innocence, maintaining – with a straight face – that there's no way to affirmatively connect pro-monopoly policies with the rise of monopolies. It's like we used to put down rat poison and we didn't have a rat problem. Then these guys made us stop, and now rats are chewing our faces off, and they're making wide innocent eyes, saying, "How can you be sure that our anti-rat-poison policies are connected to global rat conquest? Maybe this is simply the Time of the Rat! Maybe sunspots caused rats to become more fecund than at any time in history! And if they bought the rat poison factories and shut them all down, well, so what of it? Shutting down rat poison factories after you've decided to stop putting down rat poison is an economically rational, Pareto-optimal decision." Markets don't discipline tech companies because they don't compete with rivals, they buy them. That's a quote, from Mark Zuckerberg: “It is better to buy than to compete.” Which is why Mark Zuckerberg bought Instagram for a billion dollars, even though it only had 12 employees and 25m users. As he wrote in a spectacularly ill-advised middle-of-the-night email to his CFO, he had to buy Instagram, because Facebook users were leaving Facebook for Instagram. By buying Instagram, Zuck ensured that anyone who left Facebook – the platform – would still be a prisoner of Facebook – the company. Despite the fact that Zuckerberg put this confession in writing, the Obama administration let him go ahead with the merger, because every government, of every political stripe, for 40 years, adopted the posture that monopolies were efficient. Now, think about our twiddled, immiserated nurses. Hospitals are among the most consolidated sectors in the US. First, we deregulated pharma mergers, and the pharma companies gobbled each other up at the rate of naughts, and they jacked up the price of drugs. So hospitals also merged to monopoly, a defensive maneuver that let a single hospital chain corner the majority of a region or city and say to the pharma companies, "either you make your products cheaper, or you can't sell them to any of our hospitals." Of course, once this mission was accomplished, the hospitals started screwing the insurers, who staged their own incestuous orgy, buying and merging until most Americans have just three or two insurance options. This let the insurers fight back against the hospitals, but left patients and health care workers defenseless against the consolidated power of hospitals, pharma companies, pharmacy benefit managers, group purchasing organizations, and other health industry cartels, duopolies and monopolies. Which is why nurses end up signing on to work for hospitals that use these ghastly apps. Remember, there's just three of these apps, replacing dozens of staffing agencies that once competed for nurses' labor. Meanwhile, on the patient side, competition has never exercised discipline. No one ever shopped around for a cheaper ambulance or a better ER while they were having a heart attack. The price that people are willing to pay to not die is “everything they have.” So you have this sector that has no business being a commercial enterprise in the first place, losing what little discipline they faced from competition, paving the way for enshittification. But I said there are four forces that discipline companies. The second one of these forces is regulation, discipline imposed by states. It’s a mistake to see market discipline and state discipline as two isolated realms. They are intimately connected. Because competition is a necessary condition for effective regulation. Let me put this in terms that even the most ideological libertarians can understand. Say you think there should be precisely one regulation that governments should enforce: honoring contracts. For the government to serve as referee in that game, it must have the power to compel the players to honor their contracts. Which means that the smallest government you can have is determined by the largest corporation you're willing to permit. So even if you're the kind of Musk-addled libertarian who can no longer open your copy of Atlas Shrugged because the pages are all stuck together, who pines for markets for human kidneys, and demands the right to sell yourself into slavery, you should still want a robust antitrust regime, so that these contracts can be enforced. When a sector cartelizes, when it collapses into oligarchy, when the internet turns into "five giant websites, each filled with screenshots of the other four," then it captures its regulators. After all, a sector with 100 competing companies is a rabble, at each others' throats. They can't agree on anything, especially how they're going to lobby. While a sector of five companies – or four – or three – or two – or one – is a cartel, a racket, a conspiracy in waiting. A sector that has been boiled down to a mere handful of firms can agree on a common lobbying position. What's more, they are so insulated from "wasteful competition" that they are aslosh in cash that they can mobilize to make their regulatory preferences into regulations. In other words, they can capture their regulators. “Regulatory capture" may sound abstract and complicated, so let me put it in concrete terms. In the UK, the antitrust regulator is called the Competition and Markets Authority, run – until recently – by Marcus Bokkerink. The CMA has been one of the world's most effective investigators and regulators of Big Tech fuckery. Last month, UK PM Keir Starmer fired Bokkerink and replaced him with Doug Gurr, the former head of Amazon UK. Hey, Starmer, the henhouse is on the line, they want their fox back. But back to our nurses: there are plenty of examples of regulatory capture lurking in that example, but I'm going to pick the most egregious one, the fact that there are data brokers who will sell you information about the credit card debts of random Americans. This is because the US Congress hasn't passed a new consumer privacy law since 1988, when Ronald Reagan signed a law called the Video Privacy Protection Act that bans video store clerks from telling newspapers which VHS cassettes you took home. The fact that Congress hasn't updated Americans' privacy protections since Die Hard was in theaters isn't a coincidence or an oversight. It is the expensively purchased inaction of a heavily concentrated – and thus wildly profitable – privacy-invasion industry that has monetized the abuse of human rights at unimaginable scale. The coalition in favor of keeping privacy law frozen since the season finale of St Elsewhere keeps growing, because there is an unbounded set of ways to transform the systematic invasion of our human rights into cash. There's a direct line from this phenomenon to nurses whose paychecks go down when they can't pay their credit-card bills. So competition is dead, regulation is dead, and companies aren't disciplined by markets or by states. But there are four forces that discipline firms, contributing to an inhospitable environment for the reproduction of sociopathic. enshittifying monsters. So let's talk about those other two forces. The first is interoperability, the principle of two or more things working together. Like, you can put anyone's shoelaces in your shoes, anyone's gas in your gas tank, and anyone's lightbulbs in your light-socket. In the non-digital world, interop takes a lot of work, you have to agree on the direction, pitch, diameter, voltage, amperage and wattage for that light socket, or someone's gonna get their hand blown off. But in the digital world, interop is built in, because there's only one kind of computer we know how to make, the Turing-complete, universal, von Neumann machine, a computing machine capable of executing every valid program. Which means that for any enshittifying program, there's a counterenshittificatory program waiting to be run. When HP writes a program to ensure that its printers reject third-party ink, someone else can write a program to disable that checking. For gig workers, antienshittificatory apps can do yeoman duty. For example, Indonesian gig drivers formed co-ops, that commission hackers to write modifications for their dispatch apps. For example, the taxi app won't book a driver to pick someone up at a train station, unless they're right outside, but when the big trains pull in that's a nightmare scene of total, lethal chaos. So drivers have an app that lets them spoof their GPS, which lets them park up around the corner, but have the app tell their bosses that they're right out front of the station. When a fare arrives, they can zip around and pick them up, without contributing to the stationside mishegas. In the USA, a company called Para shipped an app to help Doordash drivers get paid more. You see, Doordash drivers make most of their money on tips, and the Doordash driver app hides the tip amount until you accept a job, meaning you don't know whether you're accepting a job that pays $1.50 or $11.50 with tip, until you agree to take it. So Para made an app that extracted the tip amount and showed it to drivers before they clocked on. But Doordash shut it down, because in America, apps like Para are illegal. In 1998, Bill Clinton signed a law called the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, and section 1201 of the DMCA makes is a felony to "bypass an access control for a copyrighted work," with penalties of $500k and a 5-year prison sentence for a first offense. So just the act of reverse-engineering an app like the Doordash app is a potential felony, which is why companies are so desperately horny to get you to use their apps rather than their websites. The web is open, apps are closed. The majority of web users have installed an ad blocker (which is also a privacy blocker). But no one installs an ad blocker for an app, because it's a felony to distribute that tool, because you have to reverse-engineer the app to make it. An app is just a website wrapped in enough IP so that the company that made it can send you to prison if you dare to modify it so that it serves your interests rather than theirs. Around the world, we have enacted a thicket of laws, we call “IP laws,” that make it illegal to modify services, products, and devices, so that they serve your interests, rather than the interests of the shareholders. Like I said, these laws were enacted in living memory, by people who are among us, who were warned about the obvious, eminently foreseeable consequences of their reckless plans, who did it anyway. Back in 2010, two ministers from Stephen Harper's government decided to copy-paste America's Digital Millennium Copyright Act into Canadian law. They consulted on the proposal to make it illegal to reverse engineer and modify services, products and devices, and they got an earful! 6,138 Canadians sent in negative comments on the consultation. They warned that making it illegal to bypass digital locks would interfere with repair of devices as diverse as tractors, cars, and medical equipment, from ventilators to insulin pumps. These Canadians warned that laws banning tampering with digital locks would let American tech giants corner digital markets, forcing us to buy our apps and games from American app stores, that could cream off any commission they chose to levy. They warned that these laws were a gift to monopolists who wanted to jack up the price of ink; that these copyright laws, far from serving Canadian artists would lock us to American platforms. Because every time someone in our audience bought a book, a song, a game, a video, that was locked to an American app, it could never be unlocked. So if we, the creative workers of Canada, tried to migrate to a Canadian store, our audience couldn't come with us. They couldn't move their purchases from the US app to a Canadian one. 6,138 Canadians told them this, while just 54 respondents sided with Heritage Minister James Moore and Industry Minister Tony Clement. Then, James Moore gave a speech, at the International Chamber of Commerce meeting here in Toronto, where he said he would only be listening to the 54 cranks who supported his terrible ideas, on the grounds that the 6,138 people who disagreed with him were "babyish…radical extremists." So in 2012, we copied America's terrible digital locks law into the Canadian statute book, and now we live in James Moore and Tony Clement's world, where it is illegal to tamper with a digital lock. So if a company puts a digital lock on its product they can do anything behind that lock, and it's a crime to undo it. For example, if HP puts a digital lock on its printers that verifies that you're not using third party ink cartridges, or refilling an HP cartridge, it's a crime to bypass that lock and use third party ink. Which is how HP has gotten away with ratcheting the price of ink up, and up, and up. Printer ink is now the most expensive fluid that a civilian can purchase without a special permit. It's colored water that costs $10k/gallon, which means that you print out your grocery lists with liquid that costs more than the semen of a Kentucky Derby-winning stallion. That's the world we got from Clement and Moore, in living memory, after they were warned, and did it anyway. The world where farmers can't fix their tractors, where independent mechanics can't fix your car, where hospitals during the pandemic lockdowns couldn't service their failing ventilators, where every time a Canadian iPhone user buys an app from a Canadian software author, every dollar they spend takes a round trip through Apple HQ in Cupertino, California and comes back 30 cents lighter. Let me remind you this is the world where a nurse can't get a counter-app, a plug-in, for the “Uber for nurses” app they have to use to get work, that lets them coordinate with other nurses to refuse shifts until the wages on offer rise to a common level or to block surveillance of their movements and activity. Interoperability was a major disciplining force on tech firms. After all, if you make the ads on your website sufficiently obnoxious, some fraction of your users will install an ad-blocker, and you will never earn another penny from them. Because no one in the history of ad-blockers has ever uninstalled an ad-blocker. But once it's illegal to make an ad-blocker, there's no reason not to make the ads as disgusting, invasive, obnoxious as you can, to shift all the value from the end user to shareholders and executives. So we get monopolies and monopolies capture their regulators, and they can ignore the laws they don't like, and prevent laws that might interfere with their predatory conduct – like privacy laws – from being passed. They get new laws passed, laws that let them wield governmental power to prevent other companies from entering the market. So three of the four forces are neutralized: competition, regulation, and interoperability. That left just one disciplining force holding enshittification at bay: labor. Tech workers are a strange sort of workforce, because they have historically been very powerful, able to command high wages and respect, but they did it without joining unions. Union density in tech is abysmal, almost undetectable. Tech workers' power didn't come from solidarity, it came from scarcity. There weren't enough workers to fill the jobs going begging, and tech workers are unfathomnably productive. Even with the sky-high salaries tech workers commanded, every hour of labor they put in generated far more value for their employers. Faced with a tight labor market, and the ability to turn every hour of tech worker overtime into gold, tech bosses pulled out all the stops to motivate that workforce. They appealed to workers' sense of mission, convinced them they were holy warriors, ushering in a new digital age. Google promised them they would "organize the world's information and make it useful.” Facebook promised them they would “make the world more open and connected." There's a name for this tactic: the librarian Fobazi Ettarh calls it "vocational awe." That’s where an appeal to a sense of mission and pride is used to motivate workers to work for longer hours and worse pay. There are all kinds of professions that run on vocational awe: teaching, daycares and eldercare, and, of course, nursing. Techies are different from those other workers though, because they've historically been incredibly scarce, which meant that while bosses could motivate them to work on projects they believed in, for endless hours, the minute bosses ordered them to enshittify the projects they'd missed their mothers' funerals to ship on deadline these workers would tell their bosses to fuck off. If their bosses persisted in these demands, the techies would walk off the job, cross the street, and get a better job the same day. So for many years, tech workers were the fourth and final constraint, holding the line after the constraints of competition, regulation and interop slipped away. But then came the mass tech layoffs. 260,000 in 2023; 150,000 in 2024; tens of thousands this year, with Facebook planning a 5% headcount massacre while doubling its executive bonuses. Tech workers can't tell their bosses to go fuck themselves anymore, because there's ten other workers waiting to take their jobs. Now, I promised I wouldn't talk about AI, but I have to break that promise a little, just to point out that the reason tech bosses are so horny for AI Is because they think it'll let them fire tech workers and replace them with pliant chatbots who'll never tell them to fuck off. So that's where enshittification comes from: multiple changes to the environment. The fourfold collapse of competition, regulation, interoperability and worker power creates an enshittogenic environment, where the greediest, most sociopathic elements in the body corporate thrive at the expense of those elements that act as moderators of their enshittificatory impulses. We can try to cure these corporations. We can use antitrust law to break them up, fine them, force strictures upon them. But until we fix the environment, the contagion will spread to other firms. So let's talk about how we create a hostile environment for enshittifiers, so the population and importance of enshittifying agents in companies dwindles to 1990s levels. We won't get rid of these elements. So long as the profit motive is intact, there will be people whose pursuit of profit is pathological, unmoderated by shame or decency. But we can change the environment so that these don't dominate our lives. Let's talk about antitrust. After 40 years of antitrust decline, this decade has seen a massive, global resurgence of antitrust vigor, one that comes in both left- and right-wing flavors. Over the past four years, the Biden administration’s trustbusters at the Federal Trade Commission, Department of Justice and Consumer Finance Protection Bureau did more antitrust enforcement than all their predecessors for the past 40 years combined. There's certainly factions of the Trump administration that are hostile to this agenda but Trump's antitrust enforcers at the DoJ and FTC now say that they'll preserve and enforce Biden's new merger guidelines, which stop companies from buying each other up, and they've already filed suit to block a giant tech merger. Of course, last summer a judge found Google guilty of monopolization, and now they're facing a breakup, which explains why they've been so generous and friendly to the Trump administration. Meanwhile, in Canada, our toothless Competition Bureau's got fitted for a set of titanium dentures last June, when Bill C59 passed Parliament, granting sweeping new powers to our antitrust regulator. It's true that UK PM Keir Starmer just fired the head of the UK Competition and Markets Authority and replaced him with the ex-boss of Amazon UK boss.But the thing that makes that so tragic is that the UK CMA had been doing astonishingly great work under various conservative governments. In the EU, they've passed the Digital Markets Act and the Digital Services Act, and they're going after Big Tech with both barrels. Other countries around the world – Australia, Germany, France, Japan, South Korea and China (yes, China!) – have passed new antitrust laws, and launched major antitrust enforcement actions, often collaborating with each other. So you have the UK Competition and Markets Authority using its investigatory powers to research and publish a deep market study on Apple's abusive 30% app tax, and then the EU uses that report as a roadmap for fining Apple, and then banning Apple's payments monopoly under new regulations.Then South Korea and Japan trustbusters translate the EU's case and win nearly identical cases in their courts What about regulatory capture? Well, we're starting to see regulators get smarter about reining in Big Tech. For example, the EU's Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act were designed to bypass the national courts of EU member states, especially Ireland, the tax-haven where US tech companies pretend to have their EU headquarters. The thing about tax havens is that they always turn into crime havens, because if Apple can pretend to be Irish this week, it can pretend to be Maltese or Cypriot or Luxembourgeois next week. So Ireland has to let US Big Tech companies ignore EU privacy laws and other regulations, or it'll lose them to sleazier, more biddable competitor nations. So from now on, EU tech regulation is getting enforced in the EU's federal courts, not in national courts, treating the captured Irish courts as damage and routing around them. Canada needs to strengthen its own tech regulation enforcement, unwinding monopolistic mergers from the likes of Bell and Rogers, but most of all, Canada needs to pursue an interoperability agenda. Last year, Canada passed two very exciting bills: Bill C244, a national Right to Repair law; and Bill C294, an interoperability law. Nominally, both of these laws allow Canadians to fix everything from tractors to insulin pumps, and to modify the software in their devices from games consoles to printers, so they will work with third party app stores, consumables and add-ons. However, these bills are essentially useless, because these bills don’t permit Canadians to acquire tools to break digital locks. So you can modify your printer to accept third party ink, or interpret a car's diagnostic codes so any mechanic can fix it, but only if there isn't a digital lock stopping you from doing so, because giving someone a tool to break a digital lock remains illegal thanks to the law that James Moore and Tony Clement shoved down the nation's throat in 2012. And every single printer, smart speaker, car, tractor, appliance, medical implant and hospital medical device has a digital lock that stops you from fixing it, modifying it, or using third party parts, software, or consumables in it. Which means that these two landmark laws on repair and interop are useless. So why not get rid of the 2012 law that bans breaking digital locks? Because these laws are part of our trade agreement with the USA. This is a law needed to maintain tariff-free access to US markets. I don’t know if you've heard, but Donald Trump is going to impose a 25%, across-the-board tariff against Canadian exports. Trudeau's response is to impose retaliatory tariffs, which will make every American product that Canadians buy 25% more expensive. This is a very weird way to punish America! You know what would be better? Abolish the Canadian laws that protect US Big Tech companies from Canadian competition. Make it legal to reverse-engineer, jailbreak and modify American technology products and services. Don't ask Facebook to pay a link tax to Canadian newspapers, make it legal to jailbreak all of Meta's apps and block all the ads in them, so Mark Zuckerberg doesn't make a dime off of us. Make it legal for Canadian mechanics to jailbreak your Tesla and unlock every subscription feature, like autopilot and full access to your battery, for one price, forever. So you get more out of your car, and when you sell it, then next owner continues to enjoy those features, meaning they'll pay more for your used car. That's how you hurt Elon Musk: not by being performatively appalled at his Nazi salutes. That doesn't cost him a dime. He loves the attention. No! Strike at the rent-extracting, insanely high-margin aftermarket subscriptions he relies on for his Swastikar business. Kick that guy right in the dongle! Let Canadians stand up a Canadian app store for Apple devices, one that charges 3% to process transactions, not 30%. Then, every Canadian news outlet that sells subscriptions through an app, and every Canadian software author, musician and writer who sells through a mobile platform gets a 25% increase in revenues overnight, without signing up a single new customer. But we can sign up new customers, by selling jailbreaking software and access to Canadian app stores, for every mobile device and games console to everyone in the world, and by pitching every games publisher and app maker on selling in the Canadian app store to customers anywhere without paying a 30% vig to American big tech companies. We could sell every mechanic in the world a $100/month subscription to a universal diagnostic tool. Every farmer in the world could buy a kit that would let them fix their own John Deere tractors without paying a $200 callout charge for a Deere technician who inspects the repair the farmer is expected to perform. They'd beat a path to our door. Canada could become a tech export powerhouse, while making everything cheaper for Canadian tech users, while making everything more profitable for anyone who sells media or software in an online store. And – this is the best part – it’s a frontal assault on the largest, most profitable US companies, the companies that are single-handedly keeping the S&P 500 in the black, striking directly at their most profitable lines of business, taking the revenues from those ripoff scams from hundreds of billions to zero, overnight, globally. We don't have to stop at exporting reasonably priced pharmaceuticals to Americans! We could export the extremely lucrative tools of technological liberation to our American friends, too. That's how you win a trade-war. What about workers? Here we have good news and bad news. The good news is that public approval for unions is at a high mark last seen in the early 1970s, and more workers want to join a union than at any time in generations, and unions themselves are sitting on record-breaking cash reserves they could be using to organize those workers. But here's the bad news. The unions spent the Biden years, when they had the most favorable regulatory environment since the Carter administration, when public support for unions was at an all-time high, when more workers than ever wanted to join a union, when they had more money than ever to spend on unionizing those workers, doing fuck all. They allocated mere pittances to union organizing efforts with the result that we finished the Biden years with fewer unionized workers than we started them with. Then we got Trump, who illegally fired National Labor Relations Board member Gwynne Wilcox, leaving the NLRB without a quorum and thus unable to act on unfair labor practices or to certify union elections. This is terrible. But it’s not game over. Trump fired the referees, and he thinks that this means the game has ended. But here's the thing: firing the referee doesn't end the game, it just means we're throwing out the rules. Trump thinks that labor law creates unions, but he's wrong. Unions are why we have labor law. Long before unions were legal, we had unions, who fought goons and ginks and company finks in` pitched battles in the streets. That illegal solidarity resulted in the passage of labor law, which legalized unions. Labor law is passed because workers build power through solidarity. Law doesn't create that solidarity, it merely gives it a formal basis in law. Strip away that formal basis, and the worker power remains. Worker power is the answer to vocational awe. After all, it's good for you and your fellow workers to feel a sense of mission about your jobs. If you feel that sense of mission, if you feel the duty to protect your users, your patients, your patrons, your students, a union lets you fulfill that duty. We saw that in 2023 when Doug Ford promised to destroy the power of Ontario's public workers. Workers across the province rose up, promising a general strike, and Doug Ford folded like one of his cheap suits. Workers kicked the shit out of him, and we'll do it again. Promises made, promises kept. The unscheduled midair disassembly of American labor law means that workers can have each others' backs again. Tech workers need other workers' help, because tech workers aren't scarce anymore, not after a half-million layoffs. Which means tech bosses aren't afraid of them anymore. We know how tech bosses treat workers they aren't afraid of. Look at Jeff Bezos: the workers in his warehouses are injured on the job at 3 times the national rate, his delivery drivers have to pee in bottles, and they are monitored by AI cameras that snitch on them if their eyeballs aren't in the proscribed orientation or if their mouth is open too often while they drive, because policy forbids singing along to the radio. By contrast, Amazon coders get to show up for work with pink mohawks, facial piercings, and black t-shirts that say things their bosses don't understand. They get to pee whenever they want. Jeff Bezos isn't sentimental about tech workers, nor does he harbor a particularized hatred of warehouse workers and delivery drivers. He treats his workers as terribly as he can get away with. That means that the pee bottles are coming for the coders, too. It's not just Amazon, of course. Take Apple. Tim Cook was elevated to CEO in 2011. Apple's board chose him to succeed founder Steve Jobs because he is the guy who figured out how to shift Apple's production to contract manufacturers in China, without skimping on quality assurance, or suffering leaks of product specifications ahead of the company's legendary showy launches. Today, Apple's products are made in a gigantic Foxconn factory in Zhengzhou nicknamed "iPhone City.” Indeed, these devices arrive in shipping containers at the Port of Los Angeles in a state of pristine perfection, manufactured to the finest tolerances, and free of any PR leaks. To achieve this miraculous supply chain, all Tim Cook had to do was to make iPhone City a living hell, a place that is so horrific to work that they had to install suicide nets around the worker dorms to catch the plummeting bodies of workers who were so brutalized by Tim Cook's sweatshop that they attempted to take their own lives. Tim Cook is also not sentimentally attached to tech workers, nor is he hostile to Chinese assembly line workers. He just treats his workers as badly as he can get away with, and with mass layoffs in the tech sector he can treat his coders much, much worse How do tech workers get unions? Well, there are tech-specific organizations like Tech Solidarity and the Tech Workers Coalition. But tech workers will only get unions by having solidarity with other workers and receiving solidarity back from them. We all need to support every union. All workers need to have each other's backs. We are entering a period of omnishambolic polycrisis.The ominous rumble of climate change, authoritarianism, genocide, xenophobia and transphobia has turned into an avalanche. The perpetrators of these crimes against humanity have weaponized the internet, colonizing the 21st century's digital nervous system, using it to attack its host, threatening civilization itself. The enshitternet was purpose-built for this kind of apocalyptic co-option, organized around giant corporations who will trade a habitable planet and human rights for a three percent tax cut, who default us all into twiddle-friendly algorithmic feed, and block the interoperability that would let us escape their clutches with the backing of powerful governments whom they can call upon to "protect their IP rights." It didn't have to be this way. The enshitternet was not inevitable. It was the product of specific policy choices, made in living memory, by named individuals. No one came down off a mountain with two stone tablets, intoning Tony Clement, James Moore: Thou shalt make it a crime for Canadians to jailbreak their phones. Those guys chose enshittification, throwing away thousands of comments from Canadians who warned them what would come of it. We don't have to be eternal prisoners of the catastrophic policy blunders of mediocre Tory ministers. As the omnicrisis polyshambles unfolds around us, we have the means, motive and opportunity to craft Canadian policies that bolster our sovereignty, protect our rights, and help us to set every technology user, in every country (including the USA) free. The Trump presidency is an existential crisis but it also presents opportunities. When life gives you SARS, you make sarsaparilla. We once had an old, good internet, whose major defect was that it required too much technical expertise to use, so all our normie friends were excluded from that wondrous playground. Web 2.0's online services had greased slides that made it easy for anyone to get online, but escaping from those Web 2.0 walled gardens meant was like climbing out of a greased pit. A new, good internet is possible, and necessary. We can build it, with all the technological self-determination of the old, good internet, and the ease of use of Web 2.0. A place where we can find each other, coordinate and mobilize to resist and survive climate collapse, fascism, genocide and authoritarianism. We can build that new, good internet, and we must.

Title: The top wealth-creating stocks have put $21 trillion back into shareholders' pockets — and 3 are still cheap to buy

Past performance does not guarantee future success; it's a line frequently used for investing advice. That's because stocks are a moving target amid shifting fundamentals, business cycles, interest rates, and inflation. But that doesn't mean their historical strength can't be considered. If a company's stock has continued to rise, especially for over a decade, that sustained performance suggests it's doing something right. And it could be a good starting point to filter for good long-term investments or see if any common characteristics helped them succeed. Amy Arnott, a portfolio strategist at Morningstar, recently did just that by pulling a list of the top stocks that have created the most value for investors over the past decade. One common denominator among the vast majority of them is that they have wide economic moats, which means they are less likely to face competition in the next 20 years. This is especially important for companies spending mega dollars — like AI players — in hopes of reaping long-term benefits and wider market share. And to do that, they need a long runway with little competion to reap the returns of their capital expenditure for many years. She also found that stocks able to create a lot of value over long periods of time tend to continue performing well for many years, which reinforces the approach of Warren Buffett, who once quipped that the ideal holding period is forever. In this instance, Arnott measured value creation by looking at the biggest increases in market cap from 2015 through 2024, plus the value of dividends each company paid. The list she pulled includes 15 sector-neutral names. Unsurprisingly, Big Tech, and more specifically Nvidia, tops the list as the stock that has returned the most value to shareholders, with more than $3 trillion in value created. It is followed by Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Tesla, and Broadcom, all of which created more than $1 trillion in shareholder value. However, even if these names are well recognized, it doesn't mean it's a good time to buy shares. While there's a mixed bag of reasons a stock can fall out of favor, one of the central ones is simply that the share price already reflects the strength of the company. Nonetheless, three names stand out for being rated four stars out of five, which means Morningstar considers them moderately undervalued or trading at slight discounts to their analysts' fair-value estimates. Microsoft is one of the Big Tech players being pulled forward by its AI innovation, particularly its cloud computing platform Azure. While revenue growth is expected to slow for the giant, going from 15.7% in 2024 to 13.2% by 2026, the company's operating margin is expanding, from 44.6% in 2024 to 45.1% by 2026; it's a sign of continued profitability and efficient capital expenditure, a key gauge of successful expansion amid steep AI spending. Its fair value estimate, according to Morningstar, is $490 a share. As of Friday, it was trading near $391 a share, meaning it's still at a discount. Morningstar's senior analyst Dan Romanoff's conviction on the price target rides on expectations of growing profitability from its cloud computing platform Azure, its next-level offerings in Office 365 E5, and its Power Platform, which allows companies to develop websites and apps simply. Alphabet is another major player in the cloud computing space that's also spending big bucks on AI development. One hiccup the giant tech firm faces is capacity limits on its cloud platform, which has slowed revenue growth. However, Malik Ahmed Khan, an equity analyst at Morningstar, expects capacity to widen which will pick growth back up. Meanwhile, he points to other areas of Google's strength, including revenue growth from its AI-driven search engine and its YouTube business. Even as the search engine giant's revenue is expected to slow, its operating margin is expected to expand slightly from 32.1% in 2024 to 32.3% by 2025. The analyst increased the stock's fair value estimate from $220 to $237 after it beat fourth-quarter earnings expectations. UnitedHealth Group has had a bad few months. First, the shooting of its former CEO, Brian Thompson, in Midtown Manhattan sparked widespread backlash over the company's approach to insurance coverage. Last week, The Wall Street Journal reported the company was under investigation for potential Medicare billing fraud. Its stock price has been volatile as investors try to gauge what to make of all the news. Still, Morningstar's senior analyst Julie Utterback believes the stock is undervalued at a fair value of $590 a share. On Friday, it was trading near $467. Utterback's note highlights that in 2024, the firm made 47% of its operating profits from medical insurance, but only 15% came from Medicare. Therefore, the probe over Medicare shouldn't be cause for a steep sell off, suggesting investors are overreacting. Additionally, the investigation could have a wide range of outcomes. However, investors who decide to take on exposure in healthcare stocks should be prepared for volatility and keep their ears at the door as Republicans release changes to healthcare coverage. Still, Utterback writes that the stock's price is discounted enough to buffer policy uncertainty. Jump to

The W-2 mission carried a hypersonic re-entry capsule featuring a spectrometer from the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), a heatshield with a Thermal Protection System (TPS) developed with NASA's Ames Research Center, and an expanded bioreactor to enhance pharmaceutical manufacturing in orbit. This mission follows the W-1 mission, which, after an eight-month operation in orbit, marked the world's first space manufacturing venture conducted outside the International Space Station. Following the January 14 launch of W-2, Rocket Lab maintained control of the spacecraft for six weeks, overseeing essential mission functions for Varda's 120kg capsule, including power management, communications, propulsion, and attitude control. The Pioneer spacecraft, designed and built at Rocket Lab's Spacecraft Production Complex in Long Beach, California, integrates in-house developed technologies, including propulsion systems, star trackers, reaction wheels, solar panels, flight software, radios, composite structures, and separation systems. To guide the capsule's return to Earth, Rocket Lab executed a series of precision deorbit and re-entry maneuvers. The process began with a burn to reduce the orbit's perigee to 300km from an initial 500km circular orbit. A second burn raised the apogee to 900km, positioning the spacecraft for re-entry. The final burn released the capsule from approximately 470km altitude. The final phase of the mission, including parachute deployment, touchdown, and payload recovery, was managed by Varda, which will now analyze the results for future missions. "Rocket Lab's expertise has expanded from delivering payloads to space to successfully bringing them back to Earth," said Rocket Lab founder and CEO Sir Peter Beck. "Supporting Varda's ambitious in-orbit manufacturing mission with another successful re-entry highlights our ability to enable complex space missions that fully leverage the potential of space." Wendy Shimata, Vice President of Autonomous Systems at Varda, added, "Varda continues to lead in repeatable, reliable re-entry from orbit, and the success of the W-2 mission further cements our position. With additional re-entries planned, we look forward to advancing a robust orbital economy." The W-2 mission is the second of four Rocket Lab Pioneer spacecraft ordered by Varda to support orbital processing. The third spacecraft has been completed and shipped to Vandenberg Space Force Base for an upcoming launch.

To guide the capsule's return to Earth, Rocket Lab executed a series of precision deorbit and re-entry maneuvers. The process began with a burn to reduce the orbit's perigee to 300km from an initial 500km circular orbit. A second burn raised the apogee to 900km, positioning the spacecraft for re-entry. The final burn released the capsule from approximately 470km altitude. The final phase of the mission, including parachute deployment, touchdown, and payload recovery, was managed by Varda, which will now analyze the results for future missions. "Rocket Lab's expertise has expanded from delivering payloads to space to successfully bringing them back to Earth," said Rocket Lab founder and CEO Sir Peter Beck. "Supporting Varda's ambitious in-orbit manufacturing mission with another successful re-entry highlights our ability to enable complex space missions that fully leverage the potential of space." Wendy Shimata, Vice President of Autonomous Systems at Varda, added, "Varda continues to lead in repeatable, reliable re-entry from orbit, and the success of the W-2 mission further cements our position. With additional re-entries planned, we look forward to advancing a robust orbital economy." The W-2 mission is the second of four Rocket Lab Pioneer spacecraft ordered by Varda to support orbital processing. The third spacecraft has been completed and shipped to Vandenberg Space Force Base for an upcoming launch.

The steps in this guide have generated A$979,000 in salary, measured as the sum of the highest annual salaries friends and readers have reached after following along, where they were willing to attribute their success actions in here. If it works for you, email me so I can bump the number up. I currently run my business out of my own pocket. If I don't make sales, I lose savings, and it's as simple as that. I am all-in on creating work I love by force of arms, and I'd sooner leave the industry than be disrespected at a normal workplace again. The impetus to run that risk comes from two places. The first is that my tolerance for middle managers jerking themselves off at my expense is totally eroded, and I realized that I either had to do something about it or stop complaining. I'll happily go to an office if I think it will produce something I care about, but I will not do it because someone wants to impress a withered husk who thinks his sports car makes him attractive to young women. The second, and what this post is about, is that I am really good at getting jobs, and have friends with a very deep understanding of how the job market works. In Australia, when you apply for a job without permanent residency, you are filtered out of all applications immediately. It is the first question on all online application forms, and the reason is that companies do not want to deal with visa renewals and they have far too many candidates. This leads to a situation where any characteristic that is remotely inconvenient but not noticeably correlated with suitability for the business is grounds for rejection. It is not uncommon for immigrants to take months, sometimes over a year, to find their first job actually writing code. Despite being a non-white with no professional network in the country and an undesirable visa, I had my first paid programming engagement lined up before finalizing the move off my student visa. I had a full-time job on A$117K lined up for the same day my full work visa kicked in. I continued to dig up work whenever a contract was expiring, even landing a gig mid-COVID, and while most of these jobs left much to be desired, I believe this has more to do with the state of the industry in Australia than anything that I did. And I have only gotten better at this over the past two years, because while I despaired about the state of software in general, I never stopped thinking and experimenting about how to regain some control over how I'm treated. Almost everyone I spend time with now has walked away from a job without flinching. I've done it. I once caught up with a friend, and he said "Work is stupid, I'm going to Valencia for a year." I said, "W-what? Valencia? When? For a year?" "Yeah, a year. I'm going in two weeks." And then that glorious son of a bitch did it. Came home. Had a job waiting for him. Quit that job, got another job at more money. Quit that job, got one interstate because he felt like it at similar pay for half the work. All in a "weak" market. I get a lot of emails from people who despair about the state of the industry or who otherwise can't find jobs, and I always end up giving the same advice. I don't have the time to keep doing that. So in this post, I'm going to attempt to convince thousands of people that you should have much higher standards for what you tolerate, that you can build up the reserves to do your version of going to Valencia (this could just be staying home and playing with your kids for six months), and that it is immensely risky not to have this ability in your back pocket. Along the way, we will answer questions like "How long should a CV be?", "What should go on it?", and "When will this suffering end?" From Scott Smitelli's phenomenal The Ideal Candidate Will Be Punched In The Stomach: What was the plan here? Why did you leave a perfectly sustainable—if difficult and slightly unrewarding—job to do this crap? What even is this crap? You are, and let’s not mince words here, you are a thief. That’s the only way to make sense of this situation: You are stealing money from somebody, somehow. This is money you have not earned. There is no legitimate way that you should be receiving any form of compensation for simply absorbing abuse. These people, maybe the whole company but certainly the people in your immediate management chain, are irredeemably damaged to be using human beings that way. They will take, and take, and smile at you like they’re doing you some kind of favor, and maybe throw you a little perk from time to time to distract you from thinking about it too hard. But you? You can’t stop thinking. You can’t stop thinking. 4:44. You can’t stop thinking. If you're in this photo and don't like it, this blog post is for you. We have one end-goal. A career where you're paid well, are treated with real respect, and we will not settle for less. And I mean real respect, as in "we will not proceed on this major project without your professional blessing, and you can fire abusive clients", not "you can work from home two days a week if the boss is feeling generous". I had a brief email exchange with Erez Zukerman, the CEO of ZSA last year, and asked how their customer support is so good — it's the best customer support I've ever experienced and there's no close second. He replied: For support, the basic understanding is that support is the heart of the business. It is not an afterthought. Support is a senior position at ZSA, with judgment, power of review over features and website updates before anything is released (nothing major goes out without a green line from every member of support), the power to fire customers (!), real flexibility when it comes to the schedule, etc. There are also lots of ways to expand, like writing (Robin has been writing incredible blog posts and creating printables), recording (Tisha recorded Tisha Talks Switches which thousands of people enjoyed), and more. Anything short of that isn't real respect. Not a special parking spot. Not the ability to pick up your kids sometimes. Not a patronizing award on Teams. Most places fall short of this, and because we have all agreed to demand better for ourselves, we are going to consider all of these places as mildly abusive. A lot of office jobs seem like a slow death of the soul — better than the swift death of the body that careers like construction work offer, but that isn't a reason to stop striving. Shoddy work. Hour long stand-ups. The deadlines are somehow always urgent and must be delivered immediately, but are also always late and everyone knows they'll be late from day one. This is delightful at times — office scenes in improvised theater get funnier the straighter you play them — but many people eventually feel that something vital is missing from their work lives. I really enjoy David Whyte's The Three Marriages as an antidote to the tedious objection of "Work to live, don't live to work". It's a part of life, and while it isn't all of life, being bored and treated like a disposable cog for eight hours a day shouldn't be any part of your life. If you're happy to coast, adieu, catch you later. This a no judgement zone for the next five minutes. Here is a quick reality check. I have, by virtue of hundreds of people reaching out to me over this blog, seen the "I want to leave my bad job" story play out far more times than a typical person does in a lifetime. It always plays out in one of two ways. The first is that the person immediately and aggressively looks for new jobs. This usually goes well. If it does not go well, they can always find a new job again. When the job is pursued through "normal" mechanisms, such as cold Seek applications, these jobs almost never meet the standard I set above: great pay, great team, great interview process, and whatever office arrangement you prefer. But they've always been doing better along at least some of the four measures. The other story is much more typical, and it goes something like this: I'd love to leave, but there's something keeping me. One more year and I'll get a new title, and then I'll be so well-placed for a new job. I've heard the market is bad, so I should wait until it picks up again. I'll get a raise soon, then I'll negotiate for a new job. I'm scared of keeping up with mortgage repayments. I just need a year to finish up this project, it'll look great on my CV. My network is terrible, so I don't have the same options open to me. I think I can make a difference if I'm given a few more months. In two years, this second approach has never gone well. Never, ever, ever. Consider this real exchange, copied verbatim and redacted. May, 2024: Me: I'm a little bit concerned that the pathway above leads to delaying indefinitely (there's always going to be a risk of moving then getting laid off - so what risk level do you actually tolerate, and how is that balanced against [COMPANY] being run so badly that you can get laid off there too?) but you know your situation better than me. Reader: Well, the company was bought out and seems to be stabilizing. July, 2024: Reader: Got some fantastic news! Gonna get a raise at [COMPANY], 20%! It came as a surprise, apparently they think I earn too little so they're giving me a raise because of that. November, 2024: Reader: Wanted to let you know I got news, I'm gonna be fired next month. This happens so often that it's actually boring for me. I've had exchanges like the above often enough that I know the person is finished months before they do. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. They will either be let go, burn out and quit, or burn out and stay there as their health deteriorates. No one, at any level short of executive, has managed to have the impact that would be required for them to feel it was worth the cost. The thing that is missing, to my eyes, is some sense of confidence and self-respect. I hear lots of supposed barriers to getting a better job, but almost none of them are convincing, especially from people in the first world, so what I'm actually hearing about are psychological barriers. It takes a certain degree of confidence to know that you have worth, because a great deal of our society, whether by coincidence or design, causes people to feel like they're not desirable. If you don't have confidence, you feel trapped at the current situation, because what if you can't find something else? What if you're not good enough? This is a real risk, but guess what, life's risky! Two months ago, one of my high school classmates, one of the fittest people I know, died of an aneurysm at age 29. Think about it this way: enough people read this blog that if you are reading this sentence, you have just drawn a ticket in the "heart attack kills me by December" lottery. This isn't hypothetical, this will happen — someone reading this will die having spent a few hundred hours on spreadsheets this year, and perhaps even have time to think "I wish I had listened to Ludic, he is so smart and wise."1 And on self-respect, I will concede that you're getting the vestiges of my time spent in psychology, but why would anyone respect you if you let someone do Scrum at you for hours? No one respected me when I let people do Scrum at me, and that was my fault. "It what der street trolls make when dey is short o' cash an' ... what is it dey's short of, Brick?" The moving spoon paused. "Dey is short o' self-respec', Sergeant," he said, as one might who'd had the lesson shouted into his ear for twenty minutes. So where do we start off? Well, the first thing to do is bury the idea that you need this particular job, or that you are otherwise unworthy. And we're going to do that by getting really good at getting mediocre jobs, and we're almost always going to want to be doing day-rate contracts. We are going to do a lot of things that I do not endorse when going for a good job, like sending your CV anywhere, talking to recruiters, etc. Regular full-time jobs obtained through mass-market channels have dysfunctional social dynamics that are too complex to get into here. Patrick McKenzie writes: Many people think job searches go something like this: See ad for job on Monster.com Send in a resume. Get an interview. Get asked for salary requirements. Get offered your salary requirement plus 5%. Try to negotiate that offer, if you can bring yourself to. This is an effective strategy for job searching if you enjoy alternating bouts of being unemployed, being poorly compensated, and then treated like a disposable peon. Working jobs like the above comes at a real cost, even if you can get them at-will. I had an episode of intense burnout which resulted in a year of recovery, and I had to think very hard about how to not feel trapped in a bad situation again, even if the business fails. I do not want to attend hour-long stand-ups anymore. This section is about how to get the above jobs as effectively and painlessly as possible, but they will still not be great, and if you do them forever then I will be very disappointed in you. In any case, if one must engage with the market in this way to build confidence and a reputation, then day-rate contracts are amazing. I am heavily in favour of contracting. The day rate is much higher. You are forced to continue searching every few months, which means you are also forced to always be aware that you have options, and we will discuss how to minimize the pain of this. You will meet far more people because you will be at a new workplace every few months. Here in Australia, a weak contracting job will pay A$1K per day, which is approximately double what a permanent employee earns. I.e, for every six months of contracting, you can afford six months of unemployment, and you're still as well off as you were if you had been permanently employed over that period. Contracts are terminated more frequently, but you're also in a much better position because you've saved way more money per day worked, you've met tons more people, and your CV is always up-to-date. And you also knew it was going to expire in six months, so having it end three months early isn't a horrible shock to your planning. You are also excluded from the most mentally draining practices in a corporate environment, and afforded a higher status than regular employees. You will usually not be asked to attend pointless meetings, and instead be left free to execute on technical work, particularly if you indicate that you can manage scope independently. If someone does ask you to attend a pointless meeting, you can recite the Litany of a Thousands Dollars a Day in your head over and over as the project manager attempts to flay your mind. You know that delightful period after you've submitted a resignation and you're about to get out? That's the whole contract. A six month contract feels like handing in a resignation with six months of notice. When the CEO says "Can we put GenAI and blockchain in the product?", you can close your eyes, my God you are so happy, and whisper "Inshallah, I will not be on this train when it derails". None of these jobs will be great. This is not a good way to get jobs in the long-term. This is a boring, soulless way for someone that does not have any appreciable career capital or networking ability to generate adequate jobs on high pay. We only bother with this so that you know that if your business explodes, or the cool non-profit you find fires you, or if a new boss comes in and abuses you, you'll know deep down that you can walk right out that door and tell them to get fucked. I should note that the advice in this section was heavily contributed to by a friend who wishes to remain anonymous, but let us all send them silent thanks. Anyway, we take Sturgeon's Law very seriously on this blog. Ninety percent of everything is crap. It is with this understanding that we must proceed. There is a pathway to navigate that relies entirely on the broad understanding that: Let us begin with recruiters. Recruiters are an unfortunate reality of the industry. I still haven't worked out why they exist when a company can just post a job ad themselves, and their talent team has to filter out the candidates themselves anyway, but whatever. They're here, and I've learned enough about the world to accept that it's 50/50 on whether their existence is economically rational. In 2019, about a month into my first full-time programming job, I received a call from a recruiter. They were looking for someone with Airflow experience to work a contract with Coles, a massive Australian grocery chain. I had no idea what to really say to this, being inexperienced and hugely underconfident, so I just listened to his questions and answered them. Most of my answers were a sad: "Ah, no, sorry, I know what AWS is but I've never used it before at a real business. I know what Airflow is, but I've never..." Until finally we come across the fateful question: "And do you know Linux?" Why, yes, I do know Linux. At that stage of my career, it never even occurred to me to ponder what knowing Linux is. Do I even know my keyboard if I can't construct one from scratch? What does he mean know? How deranged would I have to be to say I know Python, without qualification, without being a core contributor? But none of that occurred to me, I just said yes. He is delighted, we get to chatting, and we quickly realize that we're both working our first jobs! He is a year younger, also nervous about his job, and is so happy to be talking to someone that just sounds like a normal person. He is soon comfortable enough to ask me a very vulnerable question: "So what is Linux?" I answer, and I've been doing nothing but teach psychologists-in-training statistics for a year, so the explanation is good. Each good explanation leads to another, until I'm fielding questions like: "What is Airflow? What is AWS?" We hang up, on good terms, and I stare at the wall for a long moment. There are people out there just like, calling around and functionally asking "Have you used FeebleGlorp for eight years?" with no internal model of what FeebleGlorp might be? That can't be right. Everyone at school told me that affairs would be very serious in the real world. Affairs are not very serious in the real world. Affairs have never been less serious. I told myself for a while that this must have been because he was so young, but no, they're actually almost all like this. I have only ever met two recruiters with intact brains2. To quote a reader with extensive HR experience who attempted to explain this dysfunction to me: While there are professionals that specialize in tech and with time develop enough depth to understand the discipline and move the needle in the right direction, for most recruiters it is not an economic advantage to do so; as the winds of the market are ever changing, recruiters are always the first ones to go into the chopping block when there are layoffs. Better to be a generalist recruiter and keep your job options open. I.e, the recruiters you are talking to probably go out of their way to avoid learning anything, because they may be recruiting in a different industry next month. This means a few things. I normally do not send CVs anywhere and decry them, but I've reversed my stance. They're a terrible way to get good jobs, but a heavily optimized CV will demolish most other candidates, who are about as unserious as the recruiters. So how do we optimize? Well, we're trying to get past recruiters. On your CV, quality indicators only matter if the recruiter can understand them, and as per the above they do not understand anything. At 12:34 PM today, while writing this blog post, I got a call from a recruiter and I asked them a question for blog material. "Hey, question about my CV, would it be better if I mentioned that I'm well-regarded by Linus Torvalds?" (This is not true, we don't know each other.) And they said, "Uh, I'd leave that out, these are very busy people and need technical credentials." Recruiters are only looking for one thing. They are looking for the number of years of experience that you say you have in buzzword, and possibly that you've worked somewhere like Google — but I've never seen a Googler compete for open-market contracts, so don't feel too disadvantaged. Years of experience with buzzword is the only thing that matters. Delete everything else. Link to your GitHub profile? Goodbye, none of these people are going to read that. I've been assured that the typical talent team spends five to ten seconds per CV. I am a passionate front-end developer with a drive for — no one cares, and if you reflect on how you felt even writing that sentence, of course no one cares. You didn't care. My CV used to say things like "deployed a deep learning project in collaboration with Google engineers" and it had sections like this: Some of the most talented people I know in Australia have told me that that this would qualify me for an instant interview on their teams, but this CV does not work because the person reading your CV will not care about the craft. If someone that does care reads it, it will be after four untalented people decided it was allowed to land on their desk, and at that point they're going to interview you anyway so your CV doesn't matter. The ideal CV starts with lines like this: Five (5) years expert skills in cloud database development and integration (Databricks, Snowflake) using ETL/ELT tools (dbt and Airbyte) and deploying cloud computing with AWS (EC2, RDS) and Azure (VM) cloud platforms The rest of the CV should be more lines like that, nothing else matters. A senior talent acquisition nerd at McKenzie told me that CVs should be one page, because it shows that the candidate is concise. Their counterpart at another agency said that you need three pages or you can barely get to know the candidate. Which of them is right? Both of them had no idea what they're talking about, because both of them are just eyeballing it, coming up with post-hoc rationalizations for their behavior that ignores the real hard question of why they specialize in hiring talent in fields that they cannot describe. I now trend towards a three page CV for no reason other than it looks like I must have more experience if it won't fit on one page, and it gives me more space to put buzzwords in. And when I say buzzwords, I mean you need the room to write things like "Amazon Web Services (AWS)" because some of the people reading the CVs do not know they are the same thing. Act on the principle of minimum charity, and accept that this version of your CV will never get you a great job. We know what we're optimizing for at this stage, and it isn't amazing colleagues, it is the ability to refill your coffers very quickly and with minimal pain. Okay, but which buzzwords do you pick? If you hop onto a job search platform, you are going to see many jobs that are essentially asking you to cosplay as a software engineer. For example, I have just hopped onto Seek and punched in "data engineer", my own subspecialty. This immediately yields this job from an international consultancy whose frontpage reads: GenAI is the most powerful force in business—and society—since the steam engine. As software and code generate more value than ever, every worker, business leader, student, and parent is now asking: Are we ready? Wow, that sure is something! I think speak on behalf of all of us when I say "please stop, you're hurting us". Also it looks like there isn't a single mention of AI on their website in 2022, so I'm really impressed that they've become experts in a novel technology just in time to cash in on over-excited executives. But what does the actual job listing entail? Proficient in Azure Data Factory, Databricks, SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), and SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS). And from this, by mental force, I can tell you everything you need to know about the job. My third eye is fully open, and the recruiting department's pathetic attempts to ward off my psychic intrusions are but tattered veils before a hurricane. They are almost certainly recruiting data engineers for a company with a very weak IT department, probably a government client, that is in the middle of a failing cloud migration. SSIS is the phylactery of a millennia old lich-king, a piece of software that runs out of SQL Server on old government data warehouses everywhere. The first time I had to fix an SSIS production outage, the senior engineer on my team told me to "untick all the boxes on that screen, then re-tick them all and click save", and that actually solved the problem. The entire point of a cloud migration is to stop using SSIS and use something better, but that would require you to be good at your job, so instead consultancies sell Azure Data Factory. Azure Data Factory is notable for having been forged in the hottest furnace in Hell. The last time I used it, I clicked "save" on a slow internet connection and it started to open and close random panels for five minutes before saving my work, which I can only assume means that the product has to open every component on the front-end to fetch data from the DOM to populate a POST request... which is, you know, is certainly one way that we could do things. Why use something so bad? It's because Azure Data Factory can be used to run SSIS packages! So now you're on the cloud, and have a new bad service running your old bad service, all without actually improving anything! And of course, they are both tools that do not require programming, so the consultancy can sell you a team of non-programmers for $2,000 per day. I've worked alongside one of these teams. They had one good developer who desperately tried to handle all of their work at once, and I shit you not, four "engineers" that spent eight hours a day copying-and-pasting secrets out of legacy SSIS packages into Azure Data Factory's secret manager for weeks on end. With a bit of experience, most job listings are simply an honor roll of dead IT projects. And because many executives hop onto the same bandwagons at the same times (but call it innovation), there seem to be specific patterns for the type of cog that companies are pursuing at any given moment. The friend who gave me most of the tips in here has an "Azure Data Engineer" CV, where he removes all mention of AWS work he has done so that government recruiters don't hurt their pretty little heads, and vice versa. Companies on Azure want Databricks because you can spin it up from the Azure UI, and companies on AWS similarly use Snowflake because of groupthink. Just smash those words onto the page. Every field can think of some variation of this. If you're a data scientist, it'll be a few common patterns to try cram LLMs into things. If you're a front-end developer, it's probably going to be a soup of React and its supporting technologies. Again, no one reading your CV until the final stage will know anything. Once, a recruiter had coffee with me, and they asked me why Git is such a popular programming language. I write my CV in Overleaf because I can make faster edits during the early phases of figuring out which patterns work, and fidgeting with layout is probably the most annoying part of any sort of CV-writing. This is a tough situation. What I did was looking up a few "easy" jobs, like data analyst, hop onto LinkedIn, navigate to that company's page, then navigate to someone that looks like they might be leading the relevant team. Do not message HR. They, as a rule, do not have human frailties like mercy and kindness while they are at work. Go straight to someone that actually cares if you are good at the job, and impress upon them that you are a real person, who either has a very cool life story about changing career pathways late in life, or who is an adorable graduate UwU. If you are super, super, super desperate, my company has an unpaid internship for graduates that really, really, really think that they just need a tiny bit of experience to get taken seriously. Once you're done scrubbing all signs of personality or competence out of your CV, leaving only eight (8) years of experience, what then? If you're going to be doing this all the time, how do we make it relatively painless? The first thing is to hop onto a bunch of job platforms and upload the CV. That's simple enough. This means that recruiters will start reaching out to you every week or so, and some of them will have jobs for you. 90% of them will fail to secure you an interview. I start the conversations with something like "In the interest of making sure we're making good use of time, what's the expected compensation for the job?". They'll say a number. If the number isn't high enough, thank them for their time and hang up. Don't waste your time. They will not present you to the candidate if you ask them to do any work beyond sending a CV and collecting a commission — from their perspective, you are cattle to be sold. If I was desperate, I would take the first job offered to me at any pay, then not slow my search down at all. Most contracts allow you to quit on very short notice, so use that against the employer instead of having it used against you for a change. The second thing is that you can start testing out the CV in the lowest-effort manner possible. The recommendation from my friend that has experimented the most is to grab a job platform's app on your phone, and to apply to maybe three or four jobs every morning. Don't bother with ones that ask you to make accounts on new job platforms, or write cover letters, or anything like that. Save a filter that removes anything you aren't willing to do, whether it's pay that's too low or a long commute. Err on the side of being picky, and do this every workday, even if you already have a contract. If the list of jobs becomes empty, then you must either relax your constraints or move to a new area. Sorry! If you get as far as a call with a human and are later rejected, ask them, especially recruiters, what employers want to see. They will tell you which buzzwords are good. If there is any conceivable way that you can claim to have experience in an important buzzword, write it down. This is incidentally how the strain of doing this is best managed — by not doing anything more arduous than reading a few jobs and clicking "apply", then not thinking about it until the next day. Don't apply to so many that it feels like even a bit of an ordeal. Do not let rejection affect you, most of the people involved in this process do not deserve your respect in this instance. I am sure they are lovely husbands and wives and sons and we don't care right now. It has taken up to two months before calls have started rolling in, and that is why I'd suggest doing this more-or-less constantly, even when settled into a contract role. You want to know if jobs have suddenly started to dry up, or if you need to make adjustments to your buzzword soup. A fair number of these jobs won't do any sort of diligence. The interview will be fine. Questions will sometimes be on the level of "Do you know Python?", a real question that a real director asked me before paying me hundreds of thousands of dollars. I've done a few more unpleasant interviews, detailed here, but at this point they don't bother me. If I found myself in another one of these situations, I would hang up mid-call. Eat your assertiveness vegetables, they'll put hair on your chest. Quit. You got this job, you'll get another job. Don't quit, duh. Listen man, I didn't design the industry, but I rolled brown skin and an Indian name at character creation. I'm just doing what I've gotta do. All those jobs will be mediocre, but you won't feel like any particular person has too much power over you. But still, the second job market is where you actually want to be. This is the promised land where people have functioning test suites, the executives know something about the work being undertaken, your colleagues are not Senior Void Gazers who have been so thoroughly beaten down by the industry that they dully repeat "it's a living and I have kids", and as a bonus you're probably paid about 50% more. It is so totally divorced from the first job market that people in it sometimes do not understand that the first job market exists. Famous Netflix-guy-turned-Twitch-streamer, the Primagen, has never even heard of PowerBI, what is probably the most popular analytics tool on the planet. These people are blessed. It is not accessible via Seek. It is accessible entirely through having well-placed friends and a reputation for being a cool person with a modicum of self-respect. You can't generate these by pulling the "apply for job" lever over and over. This way you don't have to pray that your friend's companies are hiring at any given moment, you'll just always know that you've got an interview every few weeks. Because getting in here isn't very predictable, this section is general advice in no particular order. If the company asks you to do Leetcode stuff, my opinion right now is that they're probably at least a bit serious, but I don't think a place that asks you to grovel before entry is a great place to be along non-technical dimensions. Erik Dietrich calls this type of interview "carnival cash", rewarding compliant employees and middle managers with the opportunity to terrorize their fellow humans instead of with money. I'm not that sure about this point. I'd probably be bad at a Leetcode interview, so I'm biased against them. Maybe they're correlated with high quality programming performance in some way that I don't understand. People often say "I don't have any connections" or "My network is terrible". This was a 0% judgement zone earlier. It is now a 0% sympathy zone. There is a phenomenon I refer to called "trying to try". It can be broadly summarized as any set of behaviors where someone has not seriously engaged their brain, does not really believe that they're doing anything with a serious chance of success, and are more-or-less just looking for reasons to say that they tried but failed. This happens in subtle places — for example, when training with beginner sabre fencers, you can stand perfectly immobile and they will very consistently hit your blade instead of you. They are so panicked and upset that their body is not trying to win, simply going through the motions of what fencing looks like. This manifests in all sorts of ways that I'll talk about one day, but it's so apparent in the job search. "I've applied for fifty jobs and no one responded". A good indicator that you're trying to try is that you are: Most people tell me they've applied for jobs and didn't get responses. Slightly savvier people tell me they've sent some cold emails out. Some people beyond that say they've started attending Meetups but had no luck. None of them have done anything remotely interesting or otherwise indicative of novel thought. I got my first programming job by emailing Josh Wiley from my psychology degree, a man who did not know me at all, but I had been in one lecture with him, and his wife was the only senior academic honest enough to tell me not to undertake a PhD. I still have the original email. We had a brief back-and-forth, and two weeks later one of his colleagues said "One of my PhD students is freaking out because they can't process some data in R", and that got me my first paid programming job, processing microsaccade data in sleep-deprived drivers. A few weeks later, I saw that a data analyst job was up for grabs at a nearby university. The smooth brained thing to do would have been to apply via Seek and get ignored. I instead went on LinkedIn, looked up the company, look up the word "lead" and cold messaged someone who seemed like they might have something to do with the job. This led me to Dave Coulter, who I still catch up every few months, and a job offer that let me skip straight to being a mid-level engineer. During the interview, when they asked "Have you programmed professionally?", I described the microsaccade project and they hired me. I didn't mention that it was about thirty hours of work in total, and they didn't ask. I actually lost the original position to someone with six more years of experience, who was offered the original data analyst role or a much more highly-paid contract. They wanted the stability, so they took the permanent role, leaving me with a massive pay bump for the contract role, and we both quit at the same time anyway. And they do not conceptualize it as losing tends of thousands of dollars, but they were functionally unemployed for months relative to what they could have earned. Score one for contracts. Those still ended up being mediocre jobs, but I just wanted to illustrate that there is a level of trying that looks more like "there is a gun to my head and I'm willing to do unorthodox things to survive", and the people that email me for jobs have never reached the unorthodox part of that. Presumably that people that do reach this point do not need to email me for jobs. I woke up this morning to an email from Dan Tentler from Phobos about safe ways to run Incus with NixOS images pre-loaded with Airflow and an overlay VPN to client sites. Dan learned about Phobos from a group of hackers in Oslo. I learned about overlay VPNs in December from the CTO of Hyprefire, Stefan Prandl, when asking for advice on network security. I have a discussion about something like this every day, even if it isn't in the tech space. Before that, at a relatively "decent" engineering company, the most complex discussion I had was trying to explain to someone that their Snowflake workload was crashing because they were trying to read 2M+ records into a hash map and that this takes a lot of memory. I have learned more in the last three months than I have in the previous three years, basically along every dimension of my profession. I'm trying to catch up for years of working with mediocre performers, and it's hard. It's definitely doable, and remember that I'm doing this while spending half my time on sales so you can do it faster than me, but there is a real cost to not working with really great people. I've studied hard over the past few years, but nothing comes close to just having awesome people around you. This matters because really good teams don't hire total scrubs that haven't taken control of their education. The first job market does not reward skill or personal development. The second one does actually require you to be good. The best offer I've received from a good company (A$185K) was obtained not through Seek, but by meeting my current co-founder Ash Lally during the preparation for a game of Twilight Imperium IV where I absolutely smoked everyone. The only other place that I've considered might be acceptable to settle down, much better than the offer I received through Ash, at was the result of getting coffee with a local reader, then eventually being invited to drinks with their team a few times. We mostly talked about split keyboards and Star Citizen. It has been a few months since I quit my last job, and I used to say all sorts of conciliatory things like "Sure, that engineer is terrible, but most of them are good!", but money talks. I only offered one of them a job with me. In retrospect, most of them had the potential to be good, but enough years in a typical corporate setting will ruin this. When I was 20, people were happy to hire me because I had potential. Now, potential is still important, but it's important that I've at least demonstrated that some of it is manifesting. Many engineers have pathologies that I think make them unsuitable for work on a healthy team, in the same way that some people need to do some self-work to enter a healthy relationship. For example, I know many people who feel guilty taking time off, so they'll burn themselves out without someone constantly getting them to slow down. I'm sympathetic, but a team as small as mine doesn't have time to walk someone through that level of self-harm and still deliver for clients reliably. We help each other through lots of little quirks we need to deprogram out of corporate contexts, but we need to be starting from a place of some progress. An example that Modal's Jonathon Belotti sent my way is that Modal's most high-performing team members will get a two week deadline, then confidently spend the entirety of the first week reading a book on the technology they're about to use. Most engineers I know, including myself a few years ago, would rather hack incompetently for two weeks. The essential reason for this is being too underconfident to act on our beliefs about how engineering should be done (or worse, not having those beliefs at all), and we'd rather fail in the approved, was-working-visibly fashion than risk looking unorthodox. "I programmed the whole two weeks and failed!" feels easier to justify than "I read a book for one of those weeks and failed!". But team members should be picked for their judgement, and if they are good for the team in proportion to the quality of that judgement and their willingness to exercise it in the face of orthodoxy. People are awful at asking for work. Here is how I advise people do it. If you don't have a good time, just leave it be. You're here to rekindle old relationships and meet interesting people, and maybe they can help you out. The moment you start asking people for help that you don't even want as friends is the moment that the entire endeavour becomes sleazy. I think of each person I know (in the context of job searching) as some sort of machine that randomly spits out jobs in a uniform distribution over a year. Let's say each person has a 5% chance of turning up a job every month, maybe more or less depending on the market. If you want an 80% chance at a job every month, you have to have enough people with you in mind that you're rolling the dice enough times to get that number. Many people tell me that they attended a few Meetups and had no results, even though that's what you're supposed to do. It's good that they tried, but most large Meetups seem to be populated by people who are ineffectually looking for jobs. Don't be ineffectual. Large Meetups were frustrating when I was a student because everyone interesting was swarmed by students trying desperately to look employable without being needy, and it is frustrating as a non-student because now I get swarmed. People go "Oh, I am a data scientist, I will go to the Data Science Meetup". That's better than not going out at all, but strictly inferior to going to a tiny Meetup with ten nerds that are deeply into Elixir or some other niche bit of technology. You will form real connections with the latter, and the fact that you know what Clojure is will be enough to make many people at such a place want to work with you. If you are in a city with a functioning tech industry and can't think of any interesting technology, then it's going to be really hard to justify why you deserve a spot on a good team, so maybe solve that problem first. If you're decent at writing and have opinions on something... write. It's amazing for meeting people. I have several readers that have sent me their writing, and without any intervention from me, about 30% of them hit the front-page of Hackernews on the strength of their material. There are surprisingly few people putting out good material on almost all topics, especially in the age of LLM slop. Reader Mira Welner wrote about something as generic as Git checkout and hit the front-page. Bernardo Stein, mentioned in various places on the blog as the guy that coaches me through my worst engineering impulses from my corporate career, has front-paged by writing about NixOS. Nat Bennett, who I've been getting advice from for months and am now hiring to coach my team, front-paged Hackernews writing about the notebook they keep at new jobs. Even Scott Smitelli, who I quoted earlier for having wrote this fantastic piece emailed it to me, and before I could finish reading it people were already recommending it to me through other channels. It's super easy to meet people through writing if you aren't afraid of pushing out your real opinions and indeed, you will see extremely stupid comments on all of the above writing, so you will need to be unafraid. Fine. Tell people that you, personally, are ChatGPT. Someone else may lose their job and think "I wish I hadn't listened to Ludic, he is so stupid and foolish", but I refuse to acknowledge them. ↩ The main one is Gary Donovan who I didn't even meet in the wild. I met a reader for coffee, and that reader worked with a really nice engineering company. That company said Gary is their favourite recruiter. The first time I called him, I said something about Lisp and it turned out he had a copy of The Little Schemer in front of him at that very second, and we later had a great talk about engineering culture in F1 over ramen. I am still reeling at the implications in neuroscience of a recruiter that can read — is it possible that some of them are sentient? ↩ Subscribe via RSS / via Email. Powered by mataroa.blog.
