17 people let go, including a senior combat designer Tomb Raider, Soul Reaver and Perfect Dark developers Crystal Dynamics are laying off 17 "talented team members" in order "to better align our current business needs and the studio's future success". According to a social media statement, they "did not take this decision lightly". Oh, and "this change does not alter our current project plans." It's not clear who exactly has lost their jobs, but going by this Xitter post, senior combat designer Mark Vernon is one of them. "Call me Mark S the way I just got severed, from employment," he writes. Best of luck finding your way to the black elevator hall, Mark V. (If you haven't watched Severance, I promise this reference is more hopeful than it sounds.) Crystal's current projects include a new Tomb Raider game, collaborations with Aspyr on various Tomb Raider and Legacy Of Kain remasters, and a collaboration with The Initiative on a reboot of Rare's Perfect Dark. The latter seems promising - reminiscent of Eidos Montreal's Deux Ex games in its blend of gadgetry and improvisation. "Cor, when was the last time a big new first-person game looked to have this kind of systemic flexibility," wrote Graham last year. "I'm partly just relieved to see a game trailer that looks like a game, and not a cutscene that looks years away from being playable. Although, notably, there was no release date at the end of this gameplay trailer, not even a year." Not much is known about the new Tomb Raider, which is being published by Amazon Games, and was announced prior to Crystal's acquisition by Embracer - the poster child for games industry layoffs since the lifting of Covid lockdown measures. Embracer announced plans last year to split themselves three ways in order to make more focussed use of the companies and brands scooped up during their earlier, feckless period of expansion. Right now, the Tomb Raider license is in the hands of one of these corporate spin-off entities, Middle-earth Enterprises. Hope everybody leaving Crystal Dynamics this week finds safe, rather than cold, harbour elsewhere. Yes, this is another Severance reference. I apologise if I'm being gauche.

Title: Solana Eyes $300 as Bullish Sentiment Reaches Historic Levels

Solana (SOL) is back in the spotlight as bullish momentum reaches unprecedented levels. Notably, despite struggling since its all-time high of $264 in November 2021, battling market-wide downturns and increased token supply, including the recent FTX estate’s $2 billion SOL unlock, optimism is resurging. According to on-chain analytics firm Santiment, institutional adoption and strategic integrations are fueling this renewed confidence. GameStop and BlackRock have launched yield-bearing tokenized treasury funds on Solana, driving massive social media engagement. “The combination of technological advantages, institutional interest, community support, and influencer engagement has created an almost unheard-of positive-to-negative sentiment ratio of 18:1,” Santiment noted Thursday, emphasizing the growing confidence among institutional and retail investors. While market analysts remain divided on Solana’s trajectory, some predict an explosive rally. Analysts from Sandman Research pointed out that SOL recently retested a key support level near $100 before rebounding 16% to $146, mirroring a pattern seen in 2021 that preceded a major altcoin surge. “Is Solana history repeating itself? SOL has been consolidating near previous all-time highs for most of the year. A key level retest triggered a bullish reaction, and if history follows its 2021 trajectory, we could be on the verge of another major altseason,” the analysts wrote. According to analysts, Solana could surge to a minimum target of just over $1,750 if it mirrors its 2021 bull run, with the potential for an even greater upside. Meanwhile, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes weighed in, recently suggesting Ethereum will hit $5,000 before Solana reaches $300. Although the pundit did not give timeframes, he has previously projected that Bitcoin could reach a market peak by late March 2025, suggesting that the SOL price could reach his target around that time, should BTC rally. Beyond technical, fundamental drivers are also boosting sentiment. Apart from its inclusion in the U.S. government’s proposed cryptocurrency reserve, institutional interest is surging, with Fidelity joining six other firms seeking SEC approval for a spot Solana ETF. If approved, Solana would be officially classified as a commodity alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum, significantly enhancing its regulatory standing. Additionally, Circle issued an additional 250 million USDC earlier this week on the Solana network, potentially increasing liquidity and network activity. Further validation came as Interactive Brokers, one of the largest global brokerage firms, announced expanded support for Solana, Cardano, XRP, and Dogecoin, broadening mainstream exposure. With institutional backing, expanding network adoption, and surging bullish sentiment, Solana’s resurgence is impossible to ignore. At press time, SOL was trading at $138.16, reflecting a 4.43% drop in the past 24 hours.

Title: Will Mastercard Stock Fall To $320 On Recession Concerns?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team Contributor. MA Stock Question: How would you respond if you owned Mastercard stock (NYSE: MA) and it dropped by 40% or more in the next few months? While this might sound dramatic, it's not unprecedented—and it could happen again. Mastercard stock has actually outperformed the broader market in 2025, gaining around 4% since January, whereas the S&P 500 has slipped by 2% during the same period. This strong showing was fueled by better-than-expected Q4 2024 results, driven by increased payment and cross-border volumes. That said, potential headwinds are looming. Overall market sentiment has turned cautious amid rising fears of a U.S. recession triggered by tariffs enacted by President Donald Trump. This could significantly affect Mastercard, given its reliance on consumer spending and international travel trends. Here’s the point: Mastercard stock could face substantial losses in a downturn. In 2020, MA stock dropped by roughly 41% in just a few quarters, and during the inflation-driven sell-off in 2022, it fell around 29%—performing slightly worse than the S&P 500. This raises a key question: Could the stock tumble to $320 in a similar scenario? Individual stocks typically exhibit greater volatility than diversified portfolios. If you're looking for growth with less risk, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has beaten the S&P 500 and delivered returns of over 91% since inception. President Donald Trump’s aggressive trade policies—including a 20% tariff on Chinese goods and 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico, along with tighter immigration rules—have sparked fears that inflation could make a comeback. These developments suggest that the U.S. economy may face serious challenges, even tipping into recession, as discussed in our analysis here on the macro picture. Earlier this month, the President didn’t dismiss the idea that these tariffs could prompt a recession. Given the rising uncertainty tied to these policies, the risks are worth watching. Add in global instability like the Ukraine–Russia conflict and ongoing trade disputes, and the economic outlook remains murky. Tariffs raise import costs, push prices higher, cut into consumer purchasing power, and reduce spending. These conditions could negatively affect Mastercard. If rising prices cause consumers to trim discretionary spending, Mastercard may see reduced transaction volumes. A potential recession—bringing job cuts and lower incomes—could worsen the decline in consumer payments. Additionally, companies managing tighter budgets might reduce spending, including on business travel and transactions. If travel slows due to global instability, Mastercard’s high-margin cross-border revenues—which have been growing rapidly—could take a hit, squeezing overall revenue and profitability. MA stock has held up slightly better than the S&P 500 during some past downturns. Concerned about what a market crash could mean for MA stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Mastercard Stock Go In A Market Crash? includes detailed performance analysis across previous market crashes. • MA stock declined 28.6% from a high of $396.75 on February 2, 2022 to $283.38 on October 12, 2022, compared to a 25.4% drop for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered by July 11, 2023 • As of March 2, 2025, it hit a high of $576.31 and is now trading around $550 • MA stock fell 41.0% from $344.56 on February 19, 2020 to $203.30 on March 23, 2020, while the S&P 500 declined 33.9% • The stock fully recovered by August 25, 2020 • MA stock plunged 62.8% from $32.00 on June 2, 2008 to $11.92 on January 20, 2009, compared to a 56.8% drop for the S&P 500 • The stock fully rebounded by August 3, 2011 At a current share price of around $545, Mastercard trades at nearly 34x projected 2025 earnings, which appears somewhat expensive. Although the company’s growth is solid, it isn’t exceptional—consensus estimates suggest annual revenue growth of about 11% for FY’25 and FY’26. Operating expenses have also been on the rise in recent years. On top of that, regulatory risks remain. The proposed Credit Card Competition Act, which aims to reduce merchant fees and increase competition in the payments sector, could challenge the market dominance of Mastercard and its main competitor Visa in the U.S. Considering the possible slowdown in growth and macroeconomic risks, ask yourself: will you continue to hold MA stock, or will you sell if it slides to $320 or below? Holding a stock in decline is always tough. Trefis, in collaboration with Empirical Asset Management—a Boston-based wealth advisory firm—has developed asset allocation strategies that posted gains during 2008-09 while the S&P fell over 40%. Empirical integrates the Trefis HQ Portfolio into its strategies to offer improved returns and reduced volatility versus the benchmark—a smoother investing experience, as seen in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Ethereum’s [ETH] short-term price targets – Is the $2,300 resistance too strong?

Key barriers stand before ETH’s price action on the charts. Ethereum [ETH] recently reclaimed its realized price at $2,040 on the charts, signaling renewed optimism across the market. This move indicated that Ethereum could be entering a recovery phase after its prolonged bear market. At press time, Ethereum was trading at $2,064.80, following a slight 0.10% decrease over the last 24 hours. Historically, when Ethereum crosses its realized price, it marks the beginning of a bullish trend. Therefore, this could be a crucial turning point for ETH. However, it still faces several hurdles that could slow down its momentum. At the time of writing, Ethereum’s MVRV ratio stood at approximately 1.02. MVRV ratios below 1 historically mean that a market bottom is near, while ratios above 2.4 indicate overvaluation. Ethereum’s press time position, therefore, signaled that while in a recovery phase, the altcoin was not yet overvalued. On the charts, Ethereum faces substantial resistance ahead at the $2,300-level. According to the MVRV Extreme Deviation Pricing Bands, this level marks a critical barrier that ETH must clear for a sustained bullish trend. ETH is also trading within a falling wedge channel near the upper boundary. Therefore, the price action around $2,300 will be pivotal in determining whether Ethereum’s recovery continues or stalls. Source: TradingView Whale activity continues to support the mid-term bullish case for ETH. Notably, BlackRock recently accumulated 1.25 million ETH worth around $2.5 billion – A sign of heightened institutional interest. However, on-chain metrics pointed to some mixed signals. Ethereum’s exchange reserves increased to 18.375 million ETH, up +0.18% in the last 24 hours. Rather than indicating demand, this uptick may suggest growing sell-side pressure as more ETH is being deposited into exchanges – Often a precursor to potential profit-taking. Meanwhile, user activity has remained strong, with 20,913 active addresses recorded – A +0.99% hike over the same period. This uptick in active wallets hinted at sustained network engagement, a positive sign for ETH’s fundamental health. On the contrary, Ethereum’s gas usage dropped sharply to 2.19 billion ETH – A steep decline from recent highs near 22 billion. This could reflect lower transaction volumes or fall in smart contract execution – Potentially signaling a short-term cooldown in network activity. Source: Santiment As predicted previously by AMBCrypto, Ethereum now faces a critical resistance zone between $2,200 and $2,250. Breaking above this zone could pave the way for a retest of the $2,400-level. However, if ETH struggles to maintain its momentum, it could face a pullback to the $2,000-support level. Therefore, market participants will need to watch for signs of either a breakthrough or a potential reversal. Ethereum has seen some strong signs of recovery, with positive MVRV ratios and growing institutional interest. However, the $2,300-resistance remains a significant hurdle. While ETH has the potential to break through this level, overcoming it will require sustained buying momentum and the clearing of key barriers. Given the prevailing market conditions, Ethereum is likely to face challenges in breaking this resistance in the short term.

Title: How the Irish ‘spice bag’ became worthy of inclusion in the Oxford English Dictionary
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/food/2025/03/27/how-the-irish-spice-bag-became-worthy-of-inclusion-in-the-oxford-english-dictionary/
Time Published: 2025-03-27T08:13:00Z
Full Content:
The addition of the spice bag to the most recent update of the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) signals official recognition at last for the fast food staple people in Ireland have been enjoying for nearly 20 years. The OED attributes the invention of the spice bag to a Chinese takeaway in Dublin’s Templeogue called the Sunflower around 2006. By 2010 the spice bag had become the first dish since the chicken fillet roll to grab us by our culinary cojones and inspire a movement that has since gone global. In 2021, Deliveroo took it upon themselves to launch a Change.org appeal to the Irish government to greenlight a national spice bag day. No doubt the request is still under serious consideration. This odd fusion dish, in all its paper wrapping glory, has by now eclipsed its fast-food origins to become a cultural phenomenon. It is unapologetically Irish, with a surprisingly international twist, part comfort food, part hangover cure, and part guilty pleasure. But how did this quirky concoction come to dominate our late-night cravings? For the uninitiated, a spice bag is a glorious mishmash of crispy shredded chicken (or chicken balls), chunky chips, stir-fried vegetables, and a generous shake of hot seasoning. This golden, greasy delight is often topped with red chillies for a fiery kick and usually comes with the obligatory curry sauce. No two spice bags are the same – every takeaway has its secret blend, as fiercely guarded as the recipe for Coca-Cola. While no one can pinpoint the exact date spice bags began to appear on menus, the consensus is that it was sometime between 2006 and 2010. In 2016, RTÉ reporter Liam Geraghty embarked on a quest to discover who invented Ireland’s most-ordered takeaway item, and his journey brought him to the Sunflower Chinese takeaway in Templeogue where it is said the spice bag was born when staff came up with a post-work fusion snack. Others argue that its roots may lie in Galway or Cork, but wherever it began, its spread was rapid. Combining the flavours of Chinese five-spice, chilli powder and paprika with the Irish obsession with fried potatoes was a stroke of genius. It’s a marriage of two culinary traditions in a way that’s both unexpected and utterly addictive. It is salty, spicy, crispy and carb-heavy – hitting almost every comfort food craving. The chicken is typically deep-fried, providing a satisfying crunch, while the chips soak up all the seasoning goodness. The vegetables (usually a mix of onions, peppers and maybe a rogue carrot or two) add sweetness and texture, balancing out the heat from the all-important chillies. And then there’s the seasoning – the spice mix is where the real magic happens. While recipes vary, most blends include a mix of Chinese five-spice (a fragrant combination of star anise, fennel, cloves, cinnamon and Szechuan peppercorns), garlic powder, chilli flakes and a touch of sugar. The result is a flavour bomb that provides excellent soakage and instant gratification. Spice bag expert and all-round takeaway virtuoso Chris Mellon of @DublinSocial says: “I noticed the popularity of the spice bag at the start of 2023 and decided to create a series visiting our top eight recommended takeaways. The eight videos posted to Dublin Social’s Instagram and TikTok channels gained over 22 million views. Mind-boggling for such a simple dish. We had people all over the world messaging us on how to recreate the dish at home and in restaurants. Some of the world’s biggest online chefs have even done their own version. “I cover every type of restaurant but the popularity of these videos had people screaming spice bag recommendations at me in the street. What makes a great spice bag? For me, it’s all about the chilli. This might be controversial but my favourite is actually served in a tray. Red Rice in Kimmage serves theirs with lashings of their chilli mix, and it has a proper kick.” For Dublin-based food and drinks writer Shamim de Brún, it took a little longer to find her way to worship at the altar of the spice bag. “When I came home after college everyone was talking about it like I should just know what it was, so I pretended I did, ‘cos I was insecure and 21. Then I had one for the first time after a night out – it was only a fiver with a drink, and I was like, ‘I get it now.’ I love it when there’s loads of onions and peppers, which I know they’ve been pulling back on. I am forever a dipper not a douser when it comes to sauce. I think an air-fried spice bag is better than the original. And champagne is the best drink to have with it.” San Sab Thai restaurant and takeaway in Drumcondra (with outlets also in Clontarf and Blackrock) is renowned for its award-winning spice bags. Owner Zoë Magliocco has had them on the menu since it opened its doors in 2017, and the Thai-style spice bag is still its biggest seller. But what makes the San Sab spice bag different? According to Magliocco, there are several factors. “We use fresh chicken fillets that are prepped and breaded in-house each day, as is the (plentiful) veg.” Magliocco goes on to explain that San Sab doesn’t use MSG in the spice bags, and the house blend of Thai spice results in a lighter, fresher dish. [ Spice bag with Champagne? The best wines to drink with tonight’s takeawayOpens in new window ] With a kitchen fully staffed by Thai chefs, how did they feel about the addition of spice bags to an authentic Thai menu? “They didn’t want to do it,” says Magliocco, “but, as a business, they understood that it was needed.” With the Drumcondra branch on the doorstep of DCU, the queue for spice bags starts before the doors open, and the demand for the dish shows no sign of waning. The spice bag is so beloved that it has inspired everything from memes to merchandise, a dedicated Facebook appreciation society and a podcast. It has made its way into high-end restaurants and home kitchens, with jars of spice bag seasoning now sitting in kitchen cupboards around the country. Chefs have put their own spin on the dish, serving deconstructed versions, or using premium ingredients such as free-range chicken and hand-cut chips, and there are vegan and vegetarian spice bags, featuring tofu or plant-based chicken substitutes. The adaptability of the spice bag is part of its charm. Feeding both the stomach and the soul, it’s undeniably a suboptimal nutritional choice, but it ticks many, many boxes. A symbol of Ireland’s constantly evolving food culture, it’s a testament to the creativity of takeaway chefs and the changing appetite of Irish people.

Title: XRPL surpasses 2.8 billion flawless transactions – Major institutions are taking notice!

Could XRP Legder be the next game-changer for institutional adoption? Ripple is in the news after it reportedly reached a settlement with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), following the agency’s unconditional withdrawal of its appeal last week. This development adds to the wave of positive momentum around XRP. Meanwhile, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) continues to strengthen blockchain innovation, having processed over 2.8 billion transactions without a single security failure. In fact, recent data from CryptoQuant indicated a resurgence in XRPL activity since 23 March – Reversing a prior decline observed since 19 March. Owing to the same, XRP was trading just below $2.40 on the charts, up by just over 1% in the last 24 hours. Source: CryptoQuant The recent surge in XRP activity came on the back of remarks from Jasmine Cooper, RippleX’s Head of Products. She stressed on XRPL’s efficiency as a key factor attracting institutional investors. With its speed and reliability, XRPL is also becoming a preferred choice for asset issuers and institutional players. OpenEden, for instance, has achieved significant milestones in tokenizing U.S Treasury bills on the platform, offering institutional investors access to on-chain financial instruments. Additionally, BlackRock, a global asset management giant, is actively exploring asset tokenization, further aligning with XRPL’s growing role in the evolving digital finance landscape. Remarking on the success of XRPL, Cooper, in a podcast with Tony Edward, noted, “SockGen, for example, that are interested in issuing stable coins on the XRP ledger to asset managers that are participating with some of the tokenization platforms. There’s been, you know, Aberdeen has issued certain money market funds through Archax, which is a tokenization provider on the XRP ledger. So, I think there’s a wide range from banks to asset managers that are starting to discover the value of tokenization and of XRPL in particular.” The exec went on to say, “So, RLUSD is doing well. Adoption has been rapid. You know, there’s support in a variety of different centralized exchanges. Market cap is rapidly growing. So I think we’re excited about it.” Cooper further shed light on XRPL’s expanding ecosystem. She stated that it is setting the stage for broader adoption, driven by advancements in DeFi and cross-border payments. Finally, she noted how the introduction of the Automated Market Maker (AMM) has enhanced on-chain trading and liquidity, reducing reliance on centralized exchanges. RippleX’s efforts to integrate an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) sidechain that aims to attract developers by enabling Ethereum-based smart contracts while leveraging XRPL’s efficiency is also gaining traction. That being said, the launch of RLUSD, Ripple’s new USD-backed stablecoin, has further strengthened the network’s utility. Particularly in cross-border transactions. Therefore, if RLUSD secures regulatory approval and gains institutional traction, XRPL’s adoption could accelerate, positioning it as a key player in blockchain finance.

Title: China tells state firms to halt deals with Li Ka-shing and his family: Report

Full Content:
East Asia Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing, chairman of CK Hutchison Holdings company, speaks during a press conference to announce the company's annual results in Hong Kong on Mar 16, 2018. (File photo: AP/Kin Cheung) China has instructed state-owned firms to pause new deals with businesses linked to Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing and his family after his plan to sell two ports in Panama to a BlackRock-led consortium, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday (Mar 27). CK Hutchison, the telecoms-to-retail conglomerate owned by Li, has been caught in China's crosshairs in the highly politicised deal with the United States firm. The Hong Kong-based company this month agreed to sell most of its global ports business, including assets near the strategically important Panama Canal, in a deal that would garner the firm more than US$19 billion in cash. The directive was issued to state-owned enterprises last week at the behest of senior officials, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Existing tie-ups are not affected. The report added that Chinese regulators are also reviewing what investments the family has in China and abroad in a bid to better understand the breadth of their business dealings. Shares of CK Hutchison Holdings rose 1.2 per cent by noon, down from a gain of as much as 3.6 per cent earlier in the day. Over the past two weeks, pro-Beijing Hong Kong newspaper Ta Kung Pao has published a series of commentaries criticising the deal for harming China's national interests and depicting it as a betrayal of China. China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office reposted some of the commentaries on its website, which fuelled speculation Beijing could take steps to try to scupper the sale. Chinese regulators, under the instructions of central leadership, have begun looking into the deal, a source has told Reuters, a sign of Beijing's discontent with CK Hutchison's divestment under perceived US pressure. US President Donald Trump has hailed the transaction after previously calling for the Panama Canal to be removed from what he deemed to be Chinese control.

Title: The Racial Content of Advertising
URL: https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2025/03/the_racial_content_of_advertising.html
Time Published: 2025-03-27T04:00:00Z
Full Content:
In an advertisement currently running on TV, a young white male kneels on his front lawn, trimming the grass one blade at a time with a nail clipper. Next door, a slightly older black male sits comfortably on his porch, scanning his automated payroll accounts with an air of confidence and superiority as he looks askance at his foolish neighbor. In another ad, a large, middle-aged black woman dances and sings her way through the supermarket aisles, waited upon entirely by whites. At one point, she stands still, looking doubtfully at a middle-aged white male who has taken a break from mopping the floors. In the end, she breezes out of the store, her cart filled by white employees overjoyed to serve her. In yet another ad, two young girls are selling something like Girl Scout cookies — one using a payment app and another relying on cash. The black girl who uses the app has sold her entire wagonload of goods before the other has sold much of anything. At the end, the black girl wheels her wagon off with a baseball glove and ball inside (indicating she is headed out to play), looking back with a knowing smile at her less clued-in white neighbor. These are just a few of the dozens of ads now airing that depict whites in a demeaning manner and blacks as their superiors in intelligence and ability. “Racial superiority” was once regarded as immoral if not criminal, but now it is out in the open, with blacks consistently depicted as more capable than whites. Nearly every medical doctor in the media is depicted as a black male, a throwback to Dr. Huxtable on the Cosby Show. Increasingly, investment advisers and plant managers are depicted as black, despite the fact that in real life, 4.7% of medical doctors are black, while 6.3% of plant managers and 1.9% of investment advisers are black. The advertising world’s depiction of blacks bears no relation to reality; it seems to be driven by sheer ideology. Some will see this discrepancy as excusable and chalk it up to a sort of cultural affirmative action. For decades, whites were depicted in dominant roles. Old movies often portray black women as maids and black men as porters, as in fact many were, but those blacks who were successful in business or the professions, and surely there were many, were rarely shown. So the argument is that now it’s time for whites to be underrepresented. The problem is that when whites were depicted in superior roles, that was a reflection of reality. In 1960, the vast majority of doctors, managers, and other professionals really were white, much more so than today. In 1960, 2.8% of physicians in the U.S. were black. The causes of this low number were complex, more so than pure racial exclusion, but undoubtedly were often the result of unfair practices. Today, the vast majority of professionals are still white, but whites are almost universally depicted as inferior. It is a strange anomaly and not without consequences. No one can object to seeing black actors depicted positively in television ads. But the problem is that today, blacks are almost always depicted as superior to whites, and the percentage of ads that feature blacks in leading roles — the chief of the boardroom, the manager of the office, the factory supervisor, the smart investor, the well-spoken, well-groomed leader paired with a clueless white — is not credible. One consequence is anger on the part of whites. Most reasonable people are willing to judge others of all races on the basis of merit, but the depiction of whites and blacks in today’s advertising does not reflect merit. Whites who have worked hard in school, earned postgraduate degrees, and devoted themselves to their jobs find themselves depicted as innately inferior to blacks. They know that this is not the case, but there is no way to escape the barrage of hateful depictions. This racial inequality must be confusing for blacks as well, for surely they realize how insincere and dishonest the ads are. The ads are a form of racial pandering, and they may represent a desperate effort on the part of corporations to cover their bases: Large investors such as BlackRock and Vanguard control billions of shares of stock, sometimes amounting to 20% or more of a company’s stock. Those investors have reportedly become “woke” to the point of insisting on more positive portrayals of minorities. For those who do not understand the role of index funds in pressuring corporations, the racial content of advertising must be mystifying. But for many, the ads appear as confirmation that blacks have automatically received priority over whites throughout the culture. Non-minority workers who have lived through the years since affirmative action was widely implemented, which is to say, nearly all white and Asian workers, have suffered a lack of opportunity. They have been passed over for promotions, paid less, or outright excluded from employment, while less qualified blacks have been hired and quickly promoted based on their race. Private companies, schools and universities, the media, and the government have played along with this racist program, refusing to acknowledge that it is unfair. Tens of millions of lives have been harmed, but again, few have spoken out because of the fear of being accused of racism. There is racism in our country, but most of it is now directed against whites and Asians. We are expected to sit still and watch what we know to be a lie because radicals in the media and elsewhere believe they are righting the wrongs of the past. One does not right past wrongs by imposing a national program of anti-white and anti-Asian education, employment, and promotion. One does not “change the culture” by airing hundreds of thousands of ads that people know to be false. Blacks on television dressed up in white coats are not really doctors, but neither are blacks who have been passed along through college and medical school based on their race. Now, under President Trump, this form of “shameful discrimination,” as the president has called it, is being eliminated. Federal agencies are closing down DIE programs, and private companies have begun to modify their DIE programs as well to re-introduce “merit.” In the case of J. P. Morgan Chase, DIE has been modified to DOI (diversity, opportunity, inclusion), a step in the right direction. One would hope that individuals of all races will soon experience opportunity based on their performance, not their skin color. As for those annoying ads, I mute the sound or switch to another network so I don’t have to listen to them. Racism, no matter what form it takes or for what purpose, is anathema to the spirit of our country. Only by eliminating racism entirely will we bring about fairness based on merit for all Americans.

BlackRock is looking to add more people to its digital asset team as the industry grows in popularity among Wall Street firms. Since the inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump, big names in finance have taken several steps to expand their presence in crypto. While BlackRock has long been a pioneer in the space, especially among traditional financial banks, the asset manager seems to have more in store. Four roles on BlackRock’s digital asset team were added to its website on Wednesday, including Director of Digital Assets, Director of Regulatory Affairs, Vice President for Digital Asset and ETF Legal Counsel and Associate for Digital Asset. According to the job description, three of the roles are based in New York and another one in Atlanta. The descriptions have otherwise been kept fairly broad and don’t give away any clues regarding what BlackRock might be looking to work on in the future. For the role of the legal counsel, the company is seeking somebody who can help with future crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) launches. BlackRock has so far issued two spot ETF products, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHE). Other issuers have applied to launch funds for several other crypto assets, including Solana (SOL), XRP, and Litecoin (LTC). BlackRock has not announced any plans to do the same. The asset manager is also strongly focused on tokenization, a sector in which it has quickly become a leading force. The firm’s tokenized money market fund, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), has drawn in $1.7 billion since its introduction in 2023, making it by far the largest tokenized fund on the market currently.

Title: Bitcoin: Are BTC miners holding for a bigger price jump?

Time Published: 2025-03-27T03:00:31Z

Bitcoin’s miner reserve stability, coupled with institutional interest, signals potential for price growth. Bitcoin [BTC]’s Miner Reserve has remained stable, with no significant selling activity recorded over the past 24 hours. This indicates that miners are holding onto their Bitcoin, signaling confidence in future price movements. Source: X The stability in miner behavior could suggest that miners are waiting for favorable market conditions to sell at higher prices. As a result, this steady behavior in the miner reserve is a key indicator to watch for potential shifts in market dynamics. At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $88,020.88, up 1.53% over the past 24 hours. BTC has recently broken out of a descending trendline and was bouncing off the demand zone. This suggests strong buying interest around these price levels, which could help push Bitcoin higher. The Bollinger Bands indicated that BTC was nearing the lower range of its bands, suggesting that consolidation is in play or a breakout might be imminent. Additionally, the RSI reading of 53.25 showed neutral market sentiment, signaling no overbought or oversold conditions at the moment. Source: TradingView Looking at Bitcoin’s In/Out of the Money chart, the majority of addresses holding BTC are in profit, with 78.28% of addresses “in the money.” This distribution is important because it signals strong support levels beneath the current price. Furthermore, it suggests that the market sentiment is generally bullish, as most holders are in profit. The absence of significant losses in BTC holdings could be a sign that the price has enough upward momentum to avoid a significant pullback. Source: Coinglass At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) stood at 0.501, showing that the market is in a profit zone. A positive NUPL reflects strong market sentiment, with most Bitcoin holders enjoying unrealized gains. Source: CryptoQuant Bitcoin’s whale activity has been noteworthy, highlighted by the recent transfer of 2,760 BTC. Institutional investors, such as BlackRock, are also accumulating substantial amounts of Bitcoin. Earlier this year, BlackRock purchased $42 million worth of BTC, reinforcing the prevailing bullish sentiment. Combined with whale movements, this institutional activity indicates that key players are preparing for potential future price surges. With stable miner reserves, a positive NUPL, and a breakout from a descending trendline, Bitcoin appears positioned for an upward move. Institutional accumulation, including BlackRock’s $42 million Bitcoin purchase, alongside notable whale activity, adds fuel to this potential rally. The coming days will be pivotal in determining whether BTC can sustain its momentum and solidify a stronger bullish trend.

Scheduling Note: There will be no newsletter March 27th. I may be in your inboxes Friday if we get the readout of the March Politburo meeting, and it is interesting. Summary of today’s top items: 1. Reporting Column for Heinous Acts of 'Taiwan Independence' Enforcers and Accomplices Persecuting Taiwan Compatriots - Chen Binhua, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, gave a fiery press conference today. He denounced, as usual, the DPP and Taiwan President Lai, and also announced a new “Reporting Column for Heinous Acts of 'Taiwan Independence' Enforcers and Accomplices Persecuting Taiwan Compatriots 台独’打手、帮凶迫害台湾同胞恶劣行径举报专栏”. You can submit reports to jubao@suremail.cn. 2. Reaction to latest US entity listings - The Ministry of Commerce spokesperson said the “U.S. move is intended to suppress and contain entities from other countries and deprive other countries of their rights to development. It will seriously damage the legitimate rights and interests of relevant entities and undermine the security and stability of global industrial and supply chains. This U.S. move is not conducive to creating an atmosphere for both parties to resolve issues through dialogue and cooperation”. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson said it is “typical hegemonic behavior, seriously violating international law and norms, damaging corporate rights and undermining global industrial and supply chain security”. 3. He Lifeng and USTR head talk - United States Trade Representative Jamieson Greer held an “ introductory” video meeting with Vice Premier He Lifeng. Both readouts make it sound pro-forma, but at least there is a channel for discussion, especially as we are just a week away from Trump’s tariff “liberation day”. 4. Trump dangles Tariff cuts for TikTok deal - In a press conference today he said “TikTok is very popular, very successful, very good. And we're gonna have a form of a deal. But if it's not finished, it's not a big deal; we'll just extend it. I have the right to have the deal and to extend it if I want. We have a lot of interest in TikTok. China is going to have to play a role in that, possibly, in the form of an approval maybe, and I think they'll do that. Maybe I'll give them a little reduction in tariffs or something to get it done.” 5. CK Hutchinson-BlackRock ports deal - According to Bloomberg the two sides expect to sign an agreement next week, even as Beijing-controlled Ta Kung Pao launched another broadside against the deal, and the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council and the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, both central government bodies, again reposted it. It is not at all clear what Beijing or Hong Kong can do to block the deal, but there is still time to find a way. 6. IShowSpeed livestreaming from China - IShowSpeed is a livestreamer with 37 million YouTube followers. He is livestreaming from China this week and he is loving it. The Global Times praised his visit, writing “amid recent "China Travel" fever, more foreign internet influencers are visiting China. Among them, American YouTube sensation Darren "IShowSpeed" is under the spotlight with his ongoing China travel. “What are the odds this IShowSpeed PRC tour is organic and not officially supported in some way? Even if it has no official backing, it is a huge soft power win for the PRC. And if the tour does have official support then the cadres involved deserve promotions. The PRC embassy in the US is a fan: Earlier today I published this week’s episode of Sharp China - Welcoming Foreign Enterprises; Ships are the New Chips; He Weidong and More PLA Rumors; Deep-Sea Cable Cutter. From the show notes: On today's show Andrew and Bill begin with the China Development Forum, including China's messaging to foreign investors, revisiting the Mintz raids as five detained employees are finally released, no updates on a Xi-Trump meeting, and news in the EV space. From there: The US plans to revive shipbuilding capacity, the likely disruption if the US adopts the USTR recommendations to counter Chinese dominance, Michael Froman writes that China has remade the international system, and a few more thoughts on the CK Hutchison deal. At the end: Rumors swirl around He Weidong and others in the PLA, what the noise might signal, and news of a deep-sea cable cutter is accompanied by a reminder that China constructs and protects deep sea cable like no other. You can listen to it here.

Title: Crystal Dynamics Lays Off 17 Team Members

In a post on X, Crystal Dynamics made the announcement that they have made the "difficult decision" to reduce the workforce by 17 team members. The studio is most well-known for the Tomb Raider, Legacy of Kain, and Gex series. Most recently, they have released the Tomb Raider remasters as well as Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 & 2 Remastered, with Perfect Dark and an untitled Tomb Raider game to be announced in the future. The full statement reads as follows below: This morning, Crystal Dynamics made the difficult decision to reduce our workforce by 17 talented team members. We did not make this decision lightly. Ultimately, this step was necessary to better align our current business needs and the studio's future success. It is not a reflection of the dedication or ability of those affected. We recognize how painful this outcome is for those impacted and we are supporting them with transition packages and opportunity outreach. Crystal Dynamics remains committed to pushing the boundaries of making great games. This change does not alter our current project plans. As said above, Crystal Dynamics is most recently known to be working on an untitled Tomb Raider game as well as a reboot of the Perfect Dark series, with Amazon Games and Xbox Game Studios publishing the titles, respectively. Perfect Dark was first announced at The Game Awards in 2020 and is set to be released on PC and Xbox Series X|S. It was originally being developed utilizing Unreal Engine 4, but instead, the developers are now using Unreal Engine 5 to increase efficiency. As The Initiative is also helping to develop the title, it was reported in October 2024 that Brian Horton had left the Insomniac Games studio to instead work as a Creative Director on Perfect Dark. The last round of layoffs for Crystal Dynamics took place in 2023 when nine employees were laid off across the marketing division specifically. This took place at a time where its parent company, Embracer Group, was making devastating layoffs across its many subsidiaries. Any layoff, no matter the number, is devastating to hear about, but compared to some of the others that have already taken place this year, Crystal Dynamics has only seen 27 layoffs in a total of three years, while some companies have experienced closures, multiple layoffs in a year, and worse. Already this year, there have been an estimated 1,493 employees laid off across a number of studios, ranging from well-off triple-A studios to indie studios finding their footing.

The news "does not alter our current project plans" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Crystal Dynamics, the storied studio that's co-developing Perfect Dark and remains at work on an as-yet-untitled Tomb Raider game, has announced another round of layoffs affecting 17 employees. "This morning, Crystal Dynamics made the difficult decision to reduce our workforce by 17 talented team members," the company says in a statement posted to social media. "We did not make this decision lightly. Ultimately, this step was necessary to better align our current business needs and the studio’s future success. It is not a reflection of the dedication or ability of those affected. We recognize how painful this outcome is for those impacted and we are supporting them with transition packages and opportunity outreach." The company adds that this news "does not alter our current project plans." In 2023, Crystal Dynamics announced that it was laying off nine employees in its brand and marketing division, and one from IT, which came while its parent company, Embracer Group, was making thousands of layoffs across its vast holdings. Crystal Dynamics had some input on the recent Tomb Raider remasters, but its last major release was Marvel's Avengers in 2020. Avengers was, of course, among the many games that Crystal Dynamics' then-owner Square Enix had found to be not "as successful as we would have liked," and the studio was acquired by Embracer Group in 2022. Now, under Embracer, Crystal Dynamics is co-developing Perfect Dark alongside The Initiative at Xbox, and working on an untitled Tomb Raider game that will be published by Amazon. Last year, Amazon's gaming boss said Crystal Dynamics was "fairly sheltered" from the wider chaos at Embracer, but while 27 layoffs over the course of three years pales in comparison to the worst mass firings we've seen the game industry, it seems that shelter only goes so far.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, March 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RKLB) and reminds investors of the April 28, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Rocket Lab’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Title: Apple might up its AI game with a $1 billion order of Nvidia servers, analyst says

Time Published: 2025-03-26T19:51:00Z

Apple (AAPL+1.32%) has traditionally not been a big player in artificial intelligence model training or server infrastructure. But that might change pretty soon. “Apple is officially in the large server cluster Gen AI game... and Super Micro Computer (SMCI-4.51%) & Dell (DELL+2.10%) are the key server partners,” Loop Capital Markets analyst Ananda Baruah said in an analyst note on Monday. Large server clusters are big groups of high-powered servers used to train and run complex AI models, like those used in generative AI. The tech giant is reportedly placing roughly $1 billion worth of orders of Nvidia’s (NVDA-1.18%) GB300 NVL72 server platform, including the company’s next-generation Blackwell Ultra chips, built by Super Micro and Dell. With each server costing around $3.7 million to $4 million, Baruah estimates that Apple is buying approximately 250 servers. Apple didn’t immediately respond to Quartz’s request for comment. Baruah expects Apple to use these servers to run or train generative AI large language models. The move could have stemmed from the intense backlash Apple received in response to its decision to delay a much-anticipated generative AI upgrade of its voice assistant Siri. Apple began working on integrating advanced AI technology into its products as part of its Apple Intelligence initiative, which the company introduced last June at its annual developer conference, WWDC. The tech giant first teased a so-called “LLM Siri” based on advanced large language models last year, in an effort to scale its generative AI capabilities and catch up to industry rivals like OpenAI and Amazon. Although an arrival date was never publicly set, LLM Siri was widely anticipated to come in an iOS 18.4 upgrade expected next month. Now, the AI-infused Siri will likely be unveiled next year. Apple pulled its previous ads featuring the capability. The decision to delay LLM Siri’s rollout faced intense investor and consumer backlash, and the company was hit with a federal lawsuit last week. The suit demands unspecified financial damages on behalf of those who purchased new products in anticipation of the generative AI upgrade. “Apple’s advertisements saturated the internet, television, and other airwaves to cultivate a clear and reasonable consumer expectation that these transformative features would be available upon the iPhone’s release,” the lawsuit said. Loop Capital analysts’ initial work suggests that the LLM Siri debacle could partly be due to Apple’s preference to use traditional AI and machine learning, rather than more advanced generative AI. But Apple’s alleged purchase of these servers could signal a shift in preference towards the latter, Baruah said.

As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025.

Title: Old Bitcoin Whale Transfers $250 Million Worth of Assets After 8 Years

Time Published: 2025-03-26T19:39:43Z

A dormant Bitcoin whale has resurfaced after eight years, transferring huge assets and leading the community to a frenzy. Over the years, ancient whales mostly become active after a major price uptick to maximize gains. These new fund movements can affect other whales, depending on the dominant market sentiment. Data from blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence shows the dormant whale transferred 3,000 BTC worth approximately $250 million. The whale’s stash grew from $3M in 2017 to the present levels. This transfer led to heated debates on the asset’s direction in the coming weeks. “$250M BITCOIN WHALE WAKES UP AFTER 8 YEARS. A Bitcoin Whale that has held BTC since late 2016 has just moved over $250M in BTC last night. His Bitcoin stack went from $3M in early 2017 to over $250M today – and he’s held Bitcoin on one address for over 8 years,” Arkham wrote on X. The move coincided with a 4.7% weekly uptick in Bitcoin’s price. For most holders, the whale might seek to sell assets following the recent price recovery. This month, Bitcoin and the wider crypto market have faced significant headwinds, plunging over 20%. This also sparked a similar reaction from other whales looking to secure previous gains. This year, the market has recorded an outflow of large holders, leading to a price drop from its all-time high above $108k to present levels. Traditionally, whale movements swing the market due to the size of their holdings. Present market forces also led to huge sales from Bitcoin miners plunging reserves. On the flipside, previous dormant whales have added to their holdings or repositioned assets. Recent activities around the leading crypto have triggered a 4% jump in the last seven days. After weeks of negative trading, bulls set their sights on a renewed surge past the $90k mark. According to Arkham, BlackRock accumulated over $100 million worth of Bitcoin without making a sale last week. Most institutional investors have also followed this trend. Furthermore, Michael Saylor’s Strategy bought 6,911 coins last week, surpassing 500,000 BTC in holdings. Most traders remain positive on the upward asset trajectory, citing recent developments from whales. The U.S. regulatory space marking a handful of pro-industry wins heightened bullish confidence in the market.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, March 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Merck & Co., Inc. (“Merck” or the “Company”) (NYSE: MRK) and reminds investors of the April 14, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that Merck’s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck’s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil’s growth in China. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Gardasil’s demand in China; notably, that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor, Zhifei. Such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Merck’s securities at artificially inflated prices. On February 4, 2025, before the market opened, Merck filed a current report on Form 8-K with the SEC. In the current report, Merck announced their fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 financial results, in which it stated that “GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 [s]ales [d]eclined 3% to $8.6 Billion.” In addition, the current report stated Merck’s “decision to temporarily pause shipments of GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 into China beginning February 2025 through at least mid-year.” On this news, Merck’s stock price fell $9.05 per share, or 9.1%, to close at $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Merck’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Title: Nvidia's business could take a hit from China's new rules — and the stock falls 6%

Shares of Nvidia (NVDA-1.18%) were down by around 6% during mid-day trading on Wednesday after a report that its business in China could be negatively impacted by new government rules. The stock traded around $113.48 as of 3:20 p.m. New York Time. China’s National Development and Reform Commission has asked firms in the country to use energy-efficient chips in new data centers and those that are being expanded, the Financial Times reported, citing documents reviewed by the publication. The H20 chip, which was developed by Nvidia to comply with U.S. export controls, reportedly does not meet the new requirements introduced by the economic planning agency. Nvidia executives are reportedly seeking a meeting with Zheng Shanjie, the chair of the commission, to discuss the rules. It has also reportedly adjusted the chip to meet the energy efficiency rules. People told the Financial Times that companies such as Alibaba (BABA+3.06%) and Tencent (TCEHY+2.68%) have been advised by the commission to not buy the less-powerful Nvidia processors. However, the people said that H20 sales are not currently being impacted, because the rules have yet to be strictly enforced. Meanwhile, Chinese tech giants have reportedly increased orders for the H20 chips after Chinese AI startup DeepSeek sent shockwaves through the industry with its R1 reasoning models in January. China and Hong Kong are the chipmaker’s fourth-largest market, representing about 13% of its annual revenue — or $17.1 billion — for fiscal 2025, according to Nvidia’s Form 10-K. “Our products provide superb energy efficiency and value in every market we serve,” Nvidia said in a statement to the Financial Times. “As technology moves rapidly, export control policy should be adjusted to allow U.S. firms to offer the most energy-efficient products possible, while still achieving the Administration’s national security goals.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: BlackRock Debuts Bitcoin ETF In Europe Following Blockbuster IBIT Success

Time Published: 2025-03-26T19:20:12Z

BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has launched a new Bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) in Europe following the wild success of its US-listed spot Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). Since its debut, the iShares Bitcoin Trust has accumulated nearly $51 billion in assets under management. The iShares Bitcoin ETP (IBIT) started trading on March 25 on Xetra, and Euronext Paris under the “IBIT” ticker and on Euronext Amsterdam under “BTCN”. “Each ETP security corresponds to a specific amount of Bitcoin,” a prospectus on the iShares website reads. The new Bitcoin product features a temporary waiver of 10 basis points, reducing its fee to 0.15% until the end of this year. This marks BlackRock’s first major step to expand its crypto ETP product range outside the United States after the success of the spot Bitcoin ETF. Manuela Sperandeo, BlackRock’s head of iShares Product for Europe and the Middle East, told Bloomberg: “[This launch] reflects what really could be seen as a tipping point in the industry — the combination of established demand from retail investors with more professionals now really getting into the fold.” America’s leading exchange, Coinbase, will custody the digital assets for BlackRock’s new product in cold storage. Meanwhile, the Bank of New York Mellon will serve as the fund’s administrator. IBIT is currently the biggest spot Bitcoin ETF, holding roughly $50.7 billion in net assets, accounting for about 2.73% of the top crypto’s total supply. When it was rolled out in January last year, it quickly garnered investor attention and began drawing in billions of dollars in investments. While there have been ETPs linked to cryptocurrencies already trading in Europe for several years, the local market is considerably smaller compared to the U.S. — $13.6 billion versus $105 billion assets under management. The largest crypto ETP in Europe is currently managed by CoinShares International Ltd, with $1.3 billion under management and a 0.25% fee. This makes BlackRock’s Europe ETP much cheaper while the waiver is in place.

The new Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reportedly has a crypto portfolio worth millions of dollars. According to a new report from Fortune, an ethics disclosure reveals that Paul Atkins – President Donald Trump’s nominee to be the next SEC Chair – holds about $6 million in crypto-related investments, including $1 million worth of equity in two crypto firms and $5 million in crypto investment funds. Atkins, who previously served as the SEC’s Chair between 2002 and 2008 under then-President George W. Bush, held a board seat on Securitize – a tokenization firm backed by asset management giant BlackRock – and owned between $250,000 and $500,000 worth of call options in the company, according to the report. He also held between $250,000 and $500,000 in equity in crypto bank Anchorage Digital and between $1 million and $5 million worth of staked crypto on Off the Chain Capital, an investment fund of which he is a limited partner. In the ethics agreement, Atkins agreed to divest his holdings after his confirmation, which is slated for Thursday. According to Bloomberg, Atkins and his spouse have a net worth of at least $327 million. Under the helm of its previous Chair, Gary Gensler, the SEC waged war on the digital assets industry by accusing several high-profile crypto firms, including Ripple Labs, Binance, Coinbase, and Consensys, of violating securities laws. Gensler also deemed many crypto assets, including smart contract platforms Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), as securities that fell under the agency’s regulatory jurisdiction.

Title: Looking for a job in a recession? Here's the advice this career coach gives her clients.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/career-coach-advice-job-hunting-potential-recession-labor-market-interview-2025-3
Time Published: 2025-03-26T18:38:10Z

Recession fears, DOGE cuts, broad layoffs — It's a tough time to be looking for a job. But it's definitely not impossible, and there are certain steps you can take to make sure your next job is more resilient to volatile economic conditions, according to career coach Marnie Lemonik. Big companies like Meta and Blackrock have announced plans to cut down their workforce numbers this year. Unemployment has ticked up slightly from 3.9% a year ago to 4.1% now. And while DOGE layoffs didn't lead to a spike in unemployment claims in February, they could start showing up in next month's data, according to Shruti Mishra, an economist at Bank of America. Uncertainty around DOGE and tariffs could also lead some employers to pause hiring, Mishra added. The choppy economic environment doesn't paint a rosy picture for those who are looking for a new job. However, it hasn't deterred some people — namely, Gen Z workers. In fact, the prevalence of layoffs might further incentivize some workers to start recruiting. "The sentiment that I'm hearing from clients is 'I don't really feel a lot of stability,' and so that loyalty to a company for any given amount of time or reason is just less relevant because no one feels like they're getting that loyalty from the employer side," Lemonik said. Here's the advice Lemonik gives her clients who are looking for jobs right now. Lemonik's clients are exercising more caution in today's job market than they did in previous years. Last year, it wasn't uncommon for Lemonik to see burnt-out clients quit their jobs with nothing lined up. "Even a year ago, I felt like I was working with more people that were like, 'I'm really burned out at my job, and if I don't have another job in 3 months, I think I'm still going to take a break,'" Lemonik said. Now, she's seeing more hesitation from her clients. "It's less so that people are gripping to the job that they have, but more so that they're not willing to take that risk of leaving without another job," Lemonik added. One of the most common questions Lemonik's clients ask her when they interview for jobs is how they can determine if the job is safe from layoffs. The biggest takeaway that Lemonik shared? You can't definitively predict if a job is "stable" or "safe." "I think we all have to have some stability within ourselves in the way that we build our own career paths and financial safety nets because you can't put your stability or safety in any employer. This is my honest take that I give people," Lemonik told BI. That's why it can be helpful to build up an emergency fund and evaluate your current budget to see where you can cut back on spending. Upskilling and investing in your career can also be ways to negotiate your salary at your next job and preserve job security in an economic downturn. Lemonik tells her clients to take advantage of the opportunity to do their due diligence on a job when hiring managers ask, "Do you have any questions for me?" "Could this be a department that's cut? Is this a smart type of role to be getting? Are these the first people out when there's no more budget left? These are the things people are trying to figure out," Lemonik said. Asking the interviewer certain questions at the end of the interview can give you insights into how insulated the role is from economic volatility. Lemonik recommends asking about the direction of the company, as well as situational questions about how the company has dealt with challenges in the past. She provided the following examples: These questions allow you to examine if the role you're interviewing for has long-term growth potential. They also highlight what to expect from company leadership. "I think anything you can do to explore how the leaders of the company operate when things are not as certain is a good indicator of how the company is going to react to potentially inevitable changes," Lemonik said.

Title: Fidelity confirms stablecoin testing but no plans to launch yet

The asset manager recently filed for a tokenized fund, following other traditional finance giants such as BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Fidelity is reportedly in advanced testing phases of its own stablecoin as part of its digital asset expansion, the Financial Times reported on March 26. However, a company spokesperson told Reuters that the firm does not have plans to launch the stablecoin in the near term. Earlier this month, a Fidelity unit filed to launch a tokenized money market fund. Under the proposal, investor shares would be recorded on the blockchain via conventional electronic recordkeeping systems, signaling the firm’s continued interest in exploring blockchain applications within existing financial products. Fidelity’s potential move comes amid a wave of institutional interest in stablecoins, driven by clearer regulatory signals and growing adoption in the US under President Donald Trump’s administration. The stablecoin sector currently commands a $231 billion market cap and processed $27.6 trillion in transfer volume last year, outpacing both Visa and Mastercard. Interest in stablecoins is rising rapidly since they offer fast, borderless, and cost-efficient settlement that outperforms traditional financial infrastructure. Institutions see stablecoins as a more efficient alternative to legacy systems. The surge in adoption comes as regulatory clarity begins to take shape, with bipartisan legislation in the US paving the way for compliant issuance. At the same time, stablecoins are gaining geopolitical relevance, as dollar-pegged tokens are viewed as a way to reinforce the US dollar’s dominance in a global economy facing competition from CBDCs and rival currencies. Beyond stablecoins, the broader trend of tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) continues to gain momentum. On March 25, the market for tokenized U.S. Treasuries surpassed $5 billion, with over half of that value managed by traditional finance heavyweights like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. Given Fidelity’s scale — managing $5.9 trillion in assets as the world’s third-largest asset manager — its growing interest in the space reflects a broader institutional shift. The regulatory environment for stablecoins is also rapidly evolving. On March 13, the Senate Banking Committee passed the bipartisan GENIUS Act in an 18-6 vote. Introduced by Senator Bill Hagerty, the legislation seeks to establish clear rules for the issuance and oversight of stablecoins in the US. One key provision would require U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins to maintain full 1:1 reserves in cash, insured bank deposits, or short-term Treasury bills. Bo Hines, Executive Director of the Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets Markets, stated on March 18 that a regulatory framework for stablecoins could be approved by Trump within two months.

Title: Is CoreWeave another WeWork? Blogger who caused Nvidia market capitalization to drop by $600 billion in a day thinks so

AI hyperscaler's IPO could raise $2.5 billion, but Jeffrey Emanuel says it's a turkey When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Towards the end of January 2025, Jeffrey Emanuel, Founder and CEO of Pastel Network, wrote an interesting and insightful essay about Nvidia. More specifically, he discussed what he saw as its overvaluation and the threat it faced from a small Chinese startup called DeepSeek. noting, “history shows that markets eventually find a way around artificial bottlenecks that generate super-normal profits,” and that, “Nvidia faces a much rockier path to maintaining its current growth trajectory and margins than its valuation implies.” That article, which went viral, helped cause the largest-ever single-day drop in the stock market, wiping $2 trillion off global markets and slashing Nvidia’s market capitalization by $600 billion. The latest target of Emanuel’s observations is Roseland, New Jersey-based CoreWeave, which offers cloud infrastructure optimized for Nvidia GPUs and is expected to go public in the coming weeks in what will be a closely watched IPO. In his takedown of the company, Emanuel described it as the “WeWork of AI,” referring to the infamous flexible office space startup that was once valued at $47 billion but overexpanded, mismanaged funds, and collapsed after a failed IPO. As Emanuel wrote two weeks ago, “If it [CoreWeave] really IPOs for $30b+ then it’s a much better short than NVDA ever was. They have absolutely no durable moat and will soon be structurally disadvantaged on the cost curve for inference for specific LLM models versus hyperscalers like AWS, which have their own proprietary silicon (because clearly CoreWeave doesn’t know the first thing about making custom silicon, and won’t anytime soon).” MarketWatch picked up on this and cautioned investors. The site wrote, “CoreWeave set an estimated price range of $47 to $55 a share for its initial public offering, and an offering size of 49 million shares. Based on the midpoint of the estimated range, CoreWeave’s IPO would raise $2.5 billion for the company. That would make its IPO the fourth since 2022 to raise at least $2.5 billion, after Lineage, Arm Holdings, and Kenvue, according to Renaissance Capital.” Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! “CoreWeave would have a market cap of about $25 billion based on the midpoint of the estimated pricing range,” the site added. While that’s far less than the $35 billion many market watchers have been predicting, Emanuel says, “that’s still at least $20b too high for this turkey!” Thanks to Steve Gelsi at @MarketWatch for helping me warn investors about the CoreWeave IPO. Luckily, they've already had to reduce the valuation by $10b from the initial price talk of $35b, but that's still at least $20b too high for this turkey! https://t.co/fnJorj87NkMarch 20, 2025 Wayne Williams is a freelancer writing news for TechRadar Pro.

March 26, 2025 14:07 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, March 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ: RKLB) between November 12, 2024 and February 25, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important April 28, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Rocket Lab securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Rocket Lab class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=36018 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 28, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Rocket Lab’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about Rocket Lab’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Rocket Lab class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=36018 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

With the Securities and Exchange Commission finally pulling the plug on a four-year court battle with Ripple, the chances of a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) being greenlighted in the U.S. have certainly increased. A top analyst has predicted that Wall Street giants BlackRock and Fidelity will soon enter the XRP ETF race. On Wednesday, Ripple agreed to pay a $50 million fine to end the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s years-long enforcement case concerning the XRP cryptocurrency. The SEC sued Ripple in late 2020, accusing it of raising $1.3 billion through an unregistered securities offering of XRP. As ZyCrypto reported, Ripple’s CLO, Stuart Alderoty, said that the company had meanwhile agreed to drop its cross-appeal of U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres’ ruling, which found that XRP is “not necessarily a security on its face,” especially within the context of programmatic sales to retail customers. Alderoty’s announcement follows Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s declaration that the SEC’s case has ended. He described it as a “long overdue surrender” on the financial regulator’s part last week. The SEC’s about-face was widely anticipated following Trump’s return to the White House. Since Acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda took over the commission’s reins, it has retreated from several lawsuits, including those against Robinhood, Coinbase, and OpenSea. The SEC’s retreat opens the door for mainstream institutional access to XRP, potentially transforming a once-embattled crypto into an approved financial product alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store, is now convinced that the regulator’s approval of spot XRP ETFs is only “a matter of time.” At least seven major investment firms, including Bitwise, 21Shares, Grayscale, WisdomTree, and Franklin Templeton, have filed for XRP-focused ETFs in anticipation of regulatory greenlight. But despite the growing XRP ETF filing craze, BlackRock — issuer of the largest spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) — has yet to submit a filing for an XRP-based product. But the top ETF analyst sees this changing soon. “And yes, I expect BlackRock, Fidelity, etc, to all be involved. XRP currently the 3rd largest non-stablecoin crypto asset by market cap. Largest ETF issuers aren’t going to ignore this,” Geraci added. XRP was valued at $2.40 as of press time after shedding 1.6% over the last 24 hours.

Title: Watch These UPS Price Levels After Stock Hits 5-Year Low

United Parcel Service (UPS) shares were gaining ground Wednesday after falling yesterday to their lowest level in nearly five years. Shares in the logistics firm have remained under pressure since disappointing investors in January with weaker-than-expected fourth quarter results, announcing at the time it was significantly reducing its volumes with e-commerce titan Amazon (AMZN). Sentiment surrounding the stock may have also taken a hit Tuesday after Bank of America trimmed its UPS price target, pointing out that weak volumes and tariff uncertainty could weigh on the company’s first-quarter earnings. UPS shares, which closed Tuesday at their lowest level since June 2020, have lost about a quarter of their value over the past 12 months amid weakening delivery demand and concerns of increasing competition with key rival FedEx (FDX). The stock was up about 1% at $111 on Wednesday afternoon. Below, we take a closer look at the UPS weekly chart and apply technical analysis to identify key price levels that investors may be watching out for. Since setting their record high in February 2022, UPS shares have traded within a falling wedge, a chart pattern that can signal a bullish reversal upon an upside breakout. However, in the short-term, the stock appears more likely to break down, with the price recently declining to the formation’s lower trendline on increasing volume. What’s more, the relative strength index (RSI) continues to move lower towards oversold levels, confirming the stock’s weakening price momentum. Let’s identify two key support levels on the UPS chart that may come into play amid the potential for further selling, while also pointing out important overhead areas to monitor during possible upswings. A decisive breakdown below the falling wedge pattern’s lower trendline could see the shares initially drop to around $101. This level would likely provide support near the prominent March 2018 swing low and Covid-era 2020 rebound high. Selling below this area could trigger a drop to lower support at the $90 level. Investors may seek to accumulate shares in this location close to a trendline that connects the December 2018 trough and a series of prices situated just above the Covid selloff low. During upswings in the stock, investors should monitor how the price reacts around the $125 area. This region on the chart may provide overhead resistance near a horizontal line that links multiple peaks and troughs on the chart extending all the way back to December 2017. Finally, a breakout above the falling wedge pattern’s upper trendline may see UPS shares climb to the $160 level. Investors who have purchased the stock at a lower price could look to lock in profits near a series of comparable price points on the chart from August 2020 to March last year.

Title: Banks' Spot Crypto Holdings Continue to Collapse as Firms Move to ETPs

Banks across the globe held a total of 341.5 billion euros ($368.3 billion) in crypto assets under custody in the second quarter of 2024 but spot crypto assets now make up less than 3% of banks' holdings — down significantly from a few years ago, data by standard setter Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) showed on Wednesday. BCBS, which focuses on setting measures to ensure the stability of banks, gathered voluntary and confidential submissions from 176 banks — of which 115 are internationally active — in June 2024. The data showed that just 29 banks contributed to the 341.5 billion euro figure, and the vast majority hold exchange-traded products tracking crypto over cryptocurrencies. Global watchdogs have been keeping a close eye on how interlinked the financial sector is with crypto following the collapse of crypto-friendly banks like Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Banks in 2023. The BCBS also recommended that banks' spot crypto exposure should not exceed 2% in December 2022. Banks appear to be following through on this; their exposure to spot crypto holdings fell 44% between 2021 to 2022. As of the June 2024 survey, banks held almost no spot crypto, at 2.46%, instead preferring exchange-traded products. About 92.5% of banks' holdings are now in these more regulated products tracking crypto prices, rather than crypto assets themselves, the BCBS survey showed.

Title: Mother Revamps Global Leadership Ahead of 30th Anniversary

We deliver! Get curated industry news straight to your inbox. Subscribe to Adweek newsletters. Mother has overhauled its global leadership team ahead of its 30th anniversary. Felix Richter, previously chief creative officer of Mother London, has been named global chief creative officer. Teri Miller takes on the dual roles of U.S. chief executive officer and global chief client officer. Katie Mackay-Sinclair, who was a partner at Mother London, assumes the role of global chief brand officer, and Chris Gallery, also a former partner at Mother London, has been appointed global chief strategy officer. The four will continue their existing responsibilities—Richter leading Mother London’s creative output, Miller overseeing U.S. operations, and Mackay-Sinclair and Gallery shaping strategy and brand vision—while joining global CEO Michael Wall and founder Robert Saville in leading Mother’s creative and strategic direction across offices in London, New York, Los Angeles, Berlin and Shanghai. “This is a world-class team, and they are proven and high-quality practitioners for Mother,” Wall said in a statement. Richter, who joined Mother London in 2022 as CCO and global creative partner after more than a decade at Droga5, has led the agency to major accolades, including ADWEEK’s International Agency of the Year in 2024. Under his leadership, the agency has produced acclaimed work for Uber, KFC, and IKEA. His new post marks the first time in Mother’s history that the agency has had a global creative lead. In the role, he will collaborate with the CCOs across Mother’s offices while continuing to oversee London’s creative output. Richter noted that the creation of a global CCO role formalizes a natural shift toward increased global collaboration across Mother’s offices in London, New York, Los Angeles, Berlin, and Shanghai over the past few years. “We are finding that our most exciting new business wins, and the most exciting work that comes out, are often the results of collaboration between offices of all different shapes and sizes,” Richter told ADWEEK. Miller, meanwhile, will take the helm on leading Mother’s expansion in North America after Mother U.S. CEO Peter Ravailhe announced his departure last week. Since joining in 2022 from 72andSunny, where she served as president, Miller has played a key role in securing major clients for Mother including Electronic Arts, General Motors, BlackRock and General Mills. Mackay-Sinclair and Gallery, both longtime strategists at Mother, will shape the agency’s global brand and strategic vision. Both have been instrumental in Mother London’s success, including leading work that earned a UK Effie Grand Prix for IKEA’s sustained success. The leadership restructuring comes as Mother continues to expand its client portfolio. Recent wins include General Motors adding Mother LA to its roster, Sonic retaining Mother as its lead creative agency, and Seventh Generation naming Mother New York its agency of record. The agency has also picked up assignments for Duolingo and General Mills. Mother US CEO Peter Ravailhe Leaves for Luxury Consultancy As independent agencies gain momentum as an alternative to holding companies, Mother sees an opportunity to double down on its positioning as a global independent. “It feels like the time is ours,” Mackay-Sinclair told ADWEEK. “When we look at the context of our industry, there are mergers, there’s collapsing of big, established creative brands.” In Mackay-Sinclair’s telling, it’s the agency’s longevity that sets it apart: “There might be a lot of indies out there, but you’re not really an indie unless you’ve been doing it for the long haul… We are lucky to be sitting here thinking, ‘What do the next 30 years of Mother look like?’” Audrey Kemp is a staff reporter for Adweek based in New York City.

Title: Solana Gets A $1.7 Billion Boost As BlackRock Expands Tokenized Funds

Financial management behemoth BlackRock has made another move in its approach to blockchain by starting a fund for big clients on the Solana network. Reports from Fortune say that this fund, called the USD Institutional Digital Fund (BUIDL), is now available on seven different blockchain platforms. BlackRock, which manages $11.6 trillion in assets, has been slowly entering the world of cryptocurrency and blockchain. Since its start in March 2024, BUIDL has already gathered $1.7 billion in assets. Experts believe the fund could reach $2 billion by April. Solana is attractive because it carries out transactions fast and charges low fees. This blockchain gives investors constant access to regular financial tools. Michael Sonnenshein, the COO of Securitize, says this way of doing things makes it easier and more convenient for funds like treasuries. The institutions are here. Today @Securitize launched the largest yield-bearing tokenized treasury fund ($1.7B), BUIDL, on Solana. BUIDL is issued by BlackRock — the world’s largest asset manager. More from Fortune:https://t.co/pFRrr341Kv — Solana (@solana) March 25, 2025 BlackRock brought its Bitcoin ETP to Europe on Tuesday. It announced that it would start on Xetra and in Euronext Paris and Amsterdam. Franklin Templeton also entered the blockchain scene by launching a money fund on Solana in February. This shows that more major financial groups are interested in using blockchain for investment products. In addition to running funds on blockchain, BlackRock has set up Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, Canada, and Europe. CEO Larry Fink believes blockchain will be important in future financial tools. The company appears to have shifted its focus to asset tokenization after the breakthrough. Moving traditional investment vehicles to the blockchain is the next big thing, Fink said. BUIDL is now a part of blockchain networks like Ethereum, Optimism, Aptos, Avalanche, Arbitrum, and Polygon. The fund, backed by cash and Treasury bills, offers big investors a new way to invest using regular financial methods. BlackRock’s effort to merge blockchain with everyday financial products is clear with $1.7 billion already invested, showing strong interest from investors in these new financial tools. Choosing Solana shows the growing confidence in this blockchain’s ability to manage many transactions fast and at a low cost. This makes it a suitable option for big financial firms seeking innovative investment methods.

Polymarket predicts high chances of XRP ETF approval amid Ripple's SEC settlement. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Optimism around a potential spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) is rising as Ripple edges closer to the end of its long-standing legal clash with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On March 26, Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store, sparked fresh discussion around the possibility of an XRP ETF. He suggested that regulatory approval might be closer than expected, especially with Ripple’s courtroom challenges nearing resolution. Geraci expressed confidence that once the path clears, heavyweight asset managers such as BlackRock and Fidelity could offer XRP-based investment products. BlackRock and Fidelity are the world’s leading asset management firms, managing more than $15 trillion in assets cumulatively. The two firms have significant exposure to the crypto industry, with their Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs dominating the market. Geraci’s optimism is rooted in XRP’s strong market presence. Currently, it ranks as the third-largest non-stablecoin crypto by market capitalization—a position likely to draw institutional interest. According to him: “XRP currently 3rd largest non-stablecoin crypto asset by market cap. Largest ETF issuers aren’t going to ignore this.” Market sentiment supports this outlook. Crypto bettors on the decentralized betting marketplace Polymarket have placed heavy bets on an XRP ETF approval, assigning it an 86% probability of getting SEC clearance by the end of 2025. The recent rise in confidence follows key developments in Ripple’s legal battle with the financial regulator. Last week, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced that the SEC had withdrawn its appeal, marking a turning point in the multi-year legal standoff. On March 25, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty confirmed that the company would pay a $50 million fine and drop its cross-appeal against the regulator. A key component of the proposed resolution includes lifting a court order that previously barred Ripple from selling XRP to institutional investors. However, this action still awaits SEC Commissioner approval and a green light from the court. Despite concerns over tighter regulatory oversight, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz clarified that the settlement does not alter the company’s core legal position. According to him, Ripple will continue operating under its current framework, with the lifting of the injunction being only one of several developments likely to take shape under the SEC’s new leadership.

Title: BlackRock BUIDL expands into Solana – Is this what SOL needs to beat ETH?

Time Published: 2025-03-26T16:00:21Z

Is BlackRock’s move to Solana a signal that Ethereum is losing ground? BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is strengthening its foothold in the crypto sector by expanding its blockchain-based money market fund to Solana [SOL]. In collaboration with its technology partner Securitize, BlackRock has introduced a new share class of the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Fund (BUIDL) on SOL’s network. This move comes a year after the fund’s initial launch and highlights BlackRock’s continued push into tokenized finance. By integrating BUIDL into Solana’s ecosystem, investors can now leverage the network’s low transaction costs and instant settlement capabilities. Remarking on the same, Carlos Domingo, Co-founder and CEO of Securitize, said, “As the market for RWAs and tokenized treasuries gains momentum, expanding BUIDL to Solana—a blockchain known for its speed, scalability, and cost efficiency—is a natural next step.” Adding to the fray was Lily Liu, President of the Solana Foundation, who noted, “Solana is uniquely positioned to drive the next wave of adoption for tokenized real-world assets due to the network’s speed, low costs and active developer ecosystem. Blackrock’s expansion of BUIDL on Solana offers users a network that balances innovation with the operational efficiency the industry demands.” BlackRock’s expansion of its BUIDL fund to Solana comes amid a significant increase in its Ethereum [ETH] holdings, which have surged to a record $1.145 billion. In fact, Kyle Samani, co-founder and managing partner of Multicoin Capital, recently reinforced his bullish outlook on SOL in an interview with Frank Chaparro. On the other hand, Samani also raised critical concerns about ETH’s roll-up-centric scaling approach, questioning its long-term viability. His remarks reflect the ongoing debate between Solana and Ethereum among industry leaders and who is going to outpace the other. That being said, Solana’s dominance over Ethereum remains evident across key metrics such as DEX trading volume, user activity, and transaction fees. While its fee advantage briefly narrowed in February, Solana has consistently maintained a multi-million-dollar lead since early January. Seeing this, analysts at Delphi Digital predict that this trend could extend into 2025, positioning SOL as the top Layer 1 blockchain. Additionally, on the price front, SOL continues to outperform, recently rising 3.83% to $144.51, while ETH saw a modest 0.87% increase to $2,069.30. Therefore, with strong momentum and sustained growth, Solana’s competitive edge over Ethereum appears poised to strengthen further.

Title: ‘Critically Important’: Iran Allegedly Used China as Golden Ticket to Quietly Operate in Panama Canal

DAILY CALLER NEWS FOUNDATION—China’s growing foothold over the Panama Canal isn’t just fueling its own commercial interests, it also appears to be helping America’s adversaries engage side-step sanctions, court documents obtained by the Daily Caller News Foundation show. China has expanded its presence considerably in the Panama Canal since former President Jimmy Carter sold the shipping lane to Panama for $1 in 1977, and is funding multibillion-dollar infrastructure projects in the surrounding countryside while buying up ports to solidify its foothold. It’s also been a boon to American adversaries, like Iran. Panamanian court documents obtained by the Daily Caller News Foundation show how Iran appeared to have used proxy firms based in Hong Kong to register ships in the Panama Canal and attempted to reap the benefits of chartering its ships. “Given the presence of Chinese companies in port operations and infrastructure near the canal, U.S. officials worry that Beijing may seek commercial or strategic leverage in the region,” Umud Shokri, senior visiting fellow at George Mason University with expertise in foreign policy, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “The Trump administration’s efforts to regain influence over the canal reflect Washington’s broader view of the waterway as a critical national security asset.” The documents center on various cases involving three Hong Kong-based shipping companies—Grace Shipping, Expander Shipping, and Grandest Shipping—all of which have been accused of being subsidiaries of the state-owned Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines, a Tehran-based company owned by the Iranian government. IRISL was sanctioned under the first Trump administration, with the State Department describing the company as the “preferred shipping line for Iranian proliferators and procurement agents.” The EU went into more detail than did the Panamanian courts. The EU Council, charged with overseeing security, defense and diplomacy said that for years, IRISL has been “involved in shipping military related cargo,” while the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy “converts container ships owned by IRISL into drone carriers.” Iran has clandestinely operated in the Panama Canal for years, as the Latin American country is considered to be the world’s biggest supplier for “flags of convenience,” which allow shippers to register their vessels under Panamanian colors in exchange for a fee to conceal their port of origin, according to Reuters. Panama took away its flag usage privileges from 136 ships alone over their links to Tehran in 2023. In 2018, the Hong Kong-based companies were looking to sell three separate medium-range tanker ships through an agreement known as a bareboat charter to a Greece-based shipping company. But President Donald Trump announced sanctions on Iran that same year, effectively killing the deal and forcing the Iranian-backed companies to sell the ships outright to avoid penalties. The Greek company went on to use the ships unimpeded for two years after the 2018 sale. However, in 2020, the Hong Kong companies filed a lawsuit in Panamanian court to reclaim the ships from firms under the Greek company’s management that bought the vessels, alleging that the initial selloffs were invalid. The Panamanian court ordered the Greek company to return two of the ships to Grandest Shipping and Expander Shipping, respectively, or pay off the multimillion-dollar valuation of the ships to the plaintiffs, according to the legal documents. The case involving Grace Shipping has yet to be resolved. Though the companies now deny their association with IRISL, they have yet to disclose what third parties they were sold to and the nature of the supposed sales. The only people who have appeared as witnesses in the case for the companies are Iranians related to IRISL, according to court documents. The Hong Kong-based firms are represented by Arias B. & Associates in Panama, court documents show. China’s presence in the Panama Canal has allowed Iran to take its business to the Western Hemisphere right under the nose of the U.S. “China has become unabashed in its unwillingness to comply with U.S. efforts to stop Iranian illicit behavior, and has, in fact, enabled it,” Rebeccah L. Heinrichs, senior fellow and director of the Keystone Defense Initiative at the Hudson Institute, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “China is the one of the most effective enablers of Iran’s ability to evade U.S. sanctions.” The U.S.’ ability to curtail China-based front companies is partly a function of America’s willingness to potentially strain the U.S.-China business relationships, Heinrichs told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “So some of this is just implementing the sanctions, finding the front companies that pop up and not giving China any plausible deniability,” Heinrichs told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “All of this is endorsed by and facilitated by the [Chinese Communist Party].” Iran has long made moves to avoid Western sanctions, especially in its oil trade. President Donald Trump sanctioned Iranian minister of petroleum Mohsen Paknejad Thursday for allowing “the export of tens of billions of dollars worth of Iranian oil and has allocated billions of dollars’ worth of oil to Iran’s armed forces for export,” according to the Treasury Department. The Iranian government operates so-called shadow fleets that export primarily to Beijing. An entire shadow market for Iranian oil has emerged with China and Russia’s help. Beijing and Moscow have both taken steps to obfuscate the origins of the oil, according to the Atlantic Council. “I think we need to be very serious about Iran sanctions,” Matthew Levitt, director of the Reinhard Program on Counterterrorism and Intelligence at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “But being serious about Iran sanctions does not mean just listing more entities, listing more boats. I’m a former senior Treasury official. I’m all in favor of doing that. Can you do that without enforcement? It’s meaningless.” Panama has been more than happy to accommodate China in its expansion of maritime power. China’s Landbridge Group acquired Panama’s largest Atlantic port, Margarita Island, for $900 million in 2016. The acquisition was in conjunction with Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative, a global infrastructure project that has already made its way into a myriad of developing nations. The Belt and Road Initiative has been criticized for often giving China undue leverage over the target countries with debt, dubbed “debt-trap diplomacy,” according to the Council on Foreign Relations. Panama formally joined the Belt and Road Initiative in 2017. Moreover, Panama gave a 25-year no-bid renewal to the Hong Kong-based Hutchison Ports to operate two ports on either end of the canal, covering both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. However, American investment giant BlackRock agreed to purchase the ports from the China-based firm on March 5 for $22.8 billion. U.S. officials and congressmen, such as Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Republican Utah Sen. John Curtis, have levied criticism at the Panama Canal Authority for allegedly not doing enough to enforce sanctions, especially against China. The Panama Canal Authority has vehemently pushed back against the accusations, saying they are “not a haven for sanctions evasion.” “The United States has found that Iranian vessels are sometimes flagged by Panama in order to avoid sanctions so that they could sell the fuel that they have and then they can take that money and then use it as they wish,” Louis Sola, chairman of the Federal Maritime Commission, said during a Senate Commerce Committee hearing in January. Cruz also echoed the sentiment during the Commerce Committee hearing, saying the U.S. could not be “idle” while China grows its foothold. “China has always been firmly opposed to illegal and unjustifiable unilateral sanctions and so-called long-arm jurisdiction by the U.S. The international community, including China, has conducted normal cooperation with Iran within the framework of international law,” a Chinese Embassy spokesperson told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “This is reasonable and lawful without harm done to any third party, and deserves to be respected and protected.” “All of this is primarily about control of sea lanes,” Heinrichs told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “So, it’s critically important, and I credit the Trump administration for recognizing that and for understanding it, that you cannot let the Chinese take over the Panama Canal.” The Iranian Foreign Ministry and Arias B. & Associates did not respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

(“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RKLB) on behalf of purchasers of Rocket Lab securities between November 12, 2024 through February 25, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investor Deadline: Investors who purchased or acquired Rocket Lab securities during the Class Period may, no later than APRIL 28, 2025, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class. To learn your rights, CLICK HERE. Headquartered in Long Beach, Calif., Rocket Lab is a space company that provides launch and spacecraft design services. The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; and (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner. On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report accusing Rocket Lab of misleading investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025. The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to at least September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026. The report also alleged that the Company’s only Neutron contract so far is a discount deal with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space. On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, nearly 10%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025.

Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices.

Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck’s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil’s growth in China. The full truth finally emerged on February 4, 2025, when Merck announced it would no longer achieve the long-forecasted $11 billion in sales of Gardasil by 2030, as it would cease shipments of Gardasil to China “through at least midyear” to facilitate a “rapid reduction of inventory.” Defendants claimed this was necessitated by the continued over-inflation of overall channel inventories as demand in China for Gardasil had “not recovered to the level we had expected.” Following this news, Merck’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $99.79 per share on February 3, 2025, Merck’s stock price fell to $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025, a decline of more than 9% in the span of just a single day.

Title: Trump Pick for Panama Envoy: Chinese Influence Goes Beyond the Canal
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2025/03/26/trump-pick-for-panama-envoy-chinese-influence-goes-beyond-the-canal/
Time Published: 2025-03-26T15:00:09Z
Full Content:
Kevin Cabrera, President Donald Trump’s nomination as the next U.S. ambassador to Panama, said Tuesday during his confirmation hearing in Congress that China’s influence in Panama extends beyond the canal’s ports. Cabrera explained to Congress that China exerts influence in Panama’s higher education system through Confucius Institute agreements that China signed with all five local universities. Confucius Institutes are academic organizations entirely controlled by the Chinese regime that spread communist ideology and propaganda to teachers and students at international universities. The first such Confucius Institute in Panama was inaugurated in June 2018 during the administration of former Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela — one year after the Central American nation cut ties with Taiwan and simultaneously embraced the Chinese Communist Party’s “One-China Principle,” which states that there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is a “province” of China. Additionally, Cabrera detailed that China has inked agreements with Panama’s State Radio and Television System (SERTV), pointing out that the state media system “definitely never criticizes China.” “But again, I think that the Chinese influence is not just in the canal. It’s also in other areas. I know that they have memorandums of understanding with all five public universities in Panama for Confucius centers,” Cabrera said. “And they also have a relationship with the local government-owned TV, SERTV, where they provide information, which many times is put in an uncritical, it definitely never criticizes China, what goes on, the information they pass along.” Cabrera told Congress that, if confirmed as ambassador, he will work alongside President Donald Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and members of the House Foreign Relations Committee to continue to diminish Chinese influence in Panama while providing opportunities for American investment in the Central American nation. Additionally, Cabrera expressed his concern on the use of Chinese technology used in Panamanian infrastructure and listed the implementation of Chinese-made security cameras in the city of north-central city of Colón — where the Atlantic Ocean entrance to the Panama Canal is located — and the use of Chinese-made cranes in Colón’s port of Manzanillo, operated by a subsidiary of the Washington-based Carrix marine terminal and rail yard operators company. Cabrella stressed that the use of Chinese cameras and equipment could compromise cybersecurity and access to sensitive information. “We have seen how Chinese state-owned companies can bid significantly lower prices in tenders to ensure that governments buy their technology, Cabrera reportedly said. “This raises questions about who controls the information and whether these infrastructures can be manipulated.” President Trump started an ongoing debate over the Panama Canal in December after he expressed that the United States should take back control of the Canal due to the “exorbitant” transit fees imposed on U.S. ships and because of the growing influence of China in the important trade route. Control of the Panama Canal, which the United States built, was handed over to Panama in 1999 as per the terms of an agreement signed by both nations in 1977 during the administration of former U.S. President Jimmy Carter. Over the past months, President Mulino, officials from the Panama Canal Authority, and other Panamanian government authorities have repeatedly refuted President Trump’s claims and denied any Chinese influence in the Canal. Mulino has also insisted that his administration will not engage in any talks with the United States pertaining to the control of the Panama Canal. Cabrera stressed to Congress that both President Trump and Secretary Rubio have identified possible violations of Article IV of the 1977 Panama Canal Neutrality Treaty signed by former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Omar Torrijos, which states that the U.S. and Panama agree to maintain a regime of neutrality in the Panama Canal so that it remain “permanently neutral.” Cabrera identified the Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings Limited’s sale to BlackRock of its subsidiary that currently operates two ports at the Panama Canal as a positive step in reducing Chinese influence in the country. Bloomberg reported on Wednesday morning that despite China’s “anger” over the transaction, CK Hutchison Holdings Limited’s sale of the two Panama Canal ports to BlackRock is “moving ahead as scheduled.” Christian K.

According to official updates from the brand's manufacturing partner, inventory began tightening on March 11, 2025, as Aqua Sculpt sales spiked, prompting growing concern from customers about product authenticity and future restock timelines. Starting in late February, Aqua Sculpt saw a sharp uptick in demand across its authorized distribution network. Verified fulfillment partners reported rapid sellouts within days of restocking, attributed primarily to a surge in online orders from customers seeking trusted weight management solutions. The brand confirmed that the unexpected growth, primarily via direct-to-consumer platforms, placed temporary pressure on logistics and supply chains. Retail insights from March 1 to March 18, 2025, indicate a remarkable 730% increase in units sold compared to the previous year's timeframe. The influx of traffic to verified sellers highlights a consumer trend favoring secure, trustworthy channels to purchase wellness supplements like Aqua Sculpt. Concerned about counterfeit products, many customers visited the official Aqua Sculpt website for real-time availability and authenticity assurance.

This included accelerating production timelines, expanding batch sizes, and optimizing warehouse-to-fulfillment operations. Aqua Sculpt remains in active production, but the speed of incoming orders temporarily outpaced standard restocking rhythms.

Buyers are strongly advised to avoid third-party listings from unknown sources and instead rely on the official Aqua Sculpt site for verified product updates and restock alerts. Q2 to Bring Increased Supply Stability for Aqua Sculpt While March's inventory strain led to intermittent product unavailability, the brand anticipates improved supply levels moving into Q2.

Verified retail partners will receive priority shipments as part of this ramp-up strategy. Customers seeking legitimate purchasing options are urged to consult the official Aqua Sculpt website, which lists all authorized sellers and includes tools to verify retail sources before checkout. Spike in Counterfeit Listings Prompts Consumer Warning With Aqua Sculpt's popularity growing, a rise in unverified listings on third-party marketplaces has sparked concern among loyal customers.

The Science Behind Aqua Sculpt Ingredients: How Circadian Rhythm, Metabolic Thermogenesis, and Natural Compounds Combine for Effective Weight Management Aqua Sculpt is more than just another name in the world of natural weight loss support — it represents a scientifically inspired synergy of bioactive compounds that align with your body's natural rhythms to promote sustainable fat metabolism, appetite regulation, and enhanced energy expenditure. Backed by emerging research on circadian biology, thermogenic enhancers, and plant-derived bioactives like green tea catechins, caffeine, and L-theanine, Aqua Sculpt leverages your body's internal clock and metabolic pathways to unlock effective results. Circadian Rhythms and Fat Metabolism: Working With Your Body's Biological Clock Circadian regulation is one of the most overlooked aspects of weight management — the internal timing system influencing metabolism, hormone secretion, and energy balance. According to a landmark study published in Scientific Reports, titled "Circadian regulation in human white adipose tissue revealed by transcriptome and metabolic network analysis," researchers found that human fat cells exhibit distinct gene expression patterns based on the time of day, particularly in genes involved in lipid metabolism and insulin signaling (Nature, 2019). This discovery implies that fat cells work in metabolic "shifts," performing lipogenesis (fat storage) during certain times and lipolysis (fat breakdown) during others. Aqua Sculpt is formulated to enhance fat oxidation during peak fat-burning phases — primarily in the morning and early afternoon — by combining bioactives that synergize with the body's natural energy peaks. This circadian-informed approach helps avoid metabolic disruptions and supports a smoother, more effective weight-loss process by "sculpting" fat burn into your daily biological schedule. Caffeine and Green Tea Catechins: Thermogenic Duo That Boosts Energy Expenditure Caffeine, a well-known stimulant found naturally in coffee and tea, is a key ingredient in Aqua Sculpt. Its inclusion is backed by multiple studies showing a positive association between caffeine intake and successful long-term weight loss maintenance (PubMed, 2015). It works primarily by increasing thermogenesis — the body's heat production process that directly correlates with calorie burn — and by stimulating lipolysis, the breakdown of fat into usable energy. Even more impressive is the combination of caffeine with green tea extract, particularly epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a potent catechin known for its fat oxidation properties. A clinical study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed that this combination increased 24-hour energy expenditure and fat oxidation, making it highly effective for supporting weight management in healthy individuals (AJCN, 1999). Another randomized trial showed that green tea catechins significantly reduced body fat and cardiovascular risks, supporting its place in a comprehensive weight loss strategy like Aqua Sculpt (Wiley Online Library, 2007). L-Theanine: Calm Focus and Craving Control To balance the stimulating effects of caffeine, Aqua Sculpt also includes L-theanine, an amino acid found in tea that promotes relaxation without drowsiness. Multiple studies have found that combining L-theanine with caffeine leads to enhanced cognitive performance, reduced anxiety, and greater subjective alertness — all without the jittery side effects often associated with stimulants (PMC, 2015; PubMed, 2010). Moreover, L-theanine has been shown to modulate neurotransmitter activity, which may help reduce emotional eating and stress-induced cravings. By promoting a calm, focused mental state, Aqua Sculpt helps users control their eating habits, a critical — yet often overlooked — aspect of successful weight management. Synergistic Support for Glucose Control and Insulin Sensitivity Blood sugar balance plays a significant role in fat storage and energy regulation. Aqua Sculpt's green tea catechins are thermogenic and help improve insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism. A 2013 meta-analysis of 17 randomized controlled trials found that green tea supplementation significantly reduced fasting glucose and improved insulin function, supporting its use in weight-related metabolic support (AJCN, 2013). When blood sugar is stable, the body is less likely to store fat and more likely to use glucose efficiently for energy. This creates a metabolic environment that promotes fat loss rather than fat gain — a cornerstone of Aqua Sculpt's approach. Additional Thermogenic Support from Green Coffee Bean Extract and L-carnitine Beyond green tea, Aqua Sculpt also integrates green coffee bean extract, a natural source of chlorogenic acid. When combined with caloric restriction, this acid has been shown to modulate lipid metabolism and assist in fat burning (APJCN, 2017). L-carnitine, an amino acid derivative that helps transport fatty acids into mitochondria, which are converted into energy, further amplifies fat-burning potential. A systematic review and meta-analysis confirmed that L-carnitine supplementation is associated with significant reductions in body weight and fat mass, especially when combined with physical activity (PubMed, 2016). These ingredients create a multi-pronged metabolic support system that enhances energy levels, promotes efficient fat metabolism, and aids in long-term weight control. Aqua Sculpt and Long-Term Weight Management: More Than Just a Quick Fix Many products promise short-term weight loss but fail to support sustainable habits. Aqua Sculpt's science-backed ingredients are strategically chosen to support long-term metabolic flexibility, energy balance, appetite control, and cognitive clarity — all essential for losing weight and keeping it off. Longitudinal research from the Women's Health Initiative Dietary Modification Trial also reinforces the importance of sustainable changes. Over 7 years, participants on low-fat diets achieved modest but statistically significant weight loss, highlighting that consistent lifestyle choices, supported by metabolic enhancers like Aqua Sculpt, yield lasting results (WHI, 2006). Aqua Sculpt as a Science-Driven Daily Ritual Aqua Sculpt is designed as a supplement and a science-informed daily wellness ritual. It leverages your body's circadian rhythm, supports your metabolic engine with natural thermogenic compounds, and enhances mental clarity to make more intelligent eating and lifestyle decisions. By integrating powerful ingredients like green tea extract, caffeine, L-theanine, L-carnitine, and green coffee bean extract, Aqua Sculpt acts in harmony with your biology — not against it. The result? A sustainable, energizing, and body-friendly approach to weight management that helps you sculpt the best version of yourself — naturally and effectively.

Title: Fidelity Reportedly Preparing to Debut In-House Stablecoin

Asset manager Fidelity Investments is reportedly preparing to launch its own stablecoin. The Boston-based company, which manages more than $5 trillion in assets, is in the advanced stages of testing the coin, the Financial Times (FT) reported Wednesday (March 25), citing sources familiar with the matter. According to the report, the planned launch is part of Fidelity’s expansion into the burgeoning market for tokenized versions of US Treasuries. The report adds that the company has also recently filed to introduce a digital version of a U.S. money market fund at the end of May, which would put it in competition with rival asset management groups BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. As the report notes, Fidelity is making these efforts at a time when federal regulators are changing their attitude toward cryptocurrencies in the wake of President Donald Trump’s election last year. Trump had embraced crypto on the campaign trail — marking a contrast with the stricter approach by the Biden White house — and has pledged to promote the growth of dollar-backed stablecoins. There is also a pair of stablecoin bills before Congress. Fidelity published a report earlier this year arguing that central banks and world governments would be among the next “significant investors” in bitcoin. That report noted that while many countries hold bitcoin, it is typically through government seizures and recoveries from criminal prosecutions. Many governments also have rules for the selling or handling of this bitcoin and can’t list them as part of their treasury. “We expect 2025 to be the year this changes for both acceptance and adoption,” wrote Fidelity’s Matt Hogan. “This is to say, we anticipate more nation-states, central banks, sovereign wealth funds, and government treasuries will look to establish strategic positions in bitcoin.” Meanwhile, PYMNTS wrote last week about use cases for stablecoins beyond crypto market liquidity, with applications that include cross-border payments. “Traditional international transactions remain slow and expensive, burdened by correspondent banking networks and legacy financial systems,” that report said. “Stablecoins, pegged to fiat currencies, promise a faster and cheaper alternative. By leveraging blockchain rails, stablecoins can bypass intermediaries, facilitating near-instantaneous settlements at potentially lower costs.” For the Outlook 2030 B2B event at the end of last year, PYMNTS spoke with Ran Goldi, SVP, payments and network at Fireblocks, and Nikola Plecas, Visa Crypto’s head of commercialization, to explore the benefits and myths surrounding blockchain-based payments. This included a discussion of the concept of the “stablecoin sandwich,” a method of using stablecoins to transfer value between currencies, which helps illustrate blockchain’s efficiency in cross-border transactions.

Title: Fidelity makes a major crypto play – Joins the Solana ETF race

The March dip attracted massive buyers as over $470M SOL were withdrawn from exchanges. Fidelity, a $15 trillion asset manager, has joined the U.S. spot Solana [SOL] exchange-traded funds (ETF) race. On the 25th of March, the firm filed a 19b-4 form with the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission), via Cboe BZX exchange for a spot SOL ETF. Only BlackRock was yet to make a similar application. But Grayscale, 21Shares, Bitwise, Canary Capital, and VanEck had done so. The market’s expectation for approval was high, at 86% per Polymarket. In fact, in February, the agency acknowledged all the filings and subsequently entered them into the Federal Register (FR), triggering the 240-day window for an approval decision. As of this writing, Franklin Templeton’s filing was yet to hit the FR. Unsurprisingly, Fidelity’s move was expected after registering a trust in Delaware on the 20th of March, a common pathway for issuers eyeing a new ETF filing. After recent ETF futures approval and a subsequent debut on CME Futures, SOL was the top contender in the altcoin ETF lineup. Other altcoins like Litecoin [LTC], Polkadot [DOT], Avalanche [AVAX], Sui [SUI], and Dogecoin [DOGE] also saw ETF interest amongst issuers. However, Nate Geraci of ETF Store projected that the agency might not greenlight all altcoin ETFs. “Optimistic on approval of various altcoin ETFs (but SEC will likely draw line somewhere). Quite a bit of debate around whether advisors want broad crypto exposure ETFs vs targeting single crypto ETFs. I’m bullish on broad crypto ETFs.” On markets, speculators betted on the altcoin’s price upside. Notably, over the past seven days, holders withdrew approximately $70M of SOL from exchanges, signaling bullish expectations for the future. Source: Coinglass Coinglass data showed that over $470M SOL was moved from exchanges in the past three weeks alone. The demand triggered the altcoin to bounce nearly 30% from the March low of $112. However, bulls had to clear the $150 hurdle to climb higher, or short sellers could regain the market edge.

Title: inZoi early access review
URL: https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/inzoi-early-access-review
Time Published: 2025-03-26T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
Soulless simulation I was, like so many of my 1990s-born peers, a huge Sims girlie. I spent hundreds of hours as a teen and young adult making people I knew, characters from shows I was obsessing over, or original characters I wanted to experiment with, and diligently following their life paths and ambitions. I played it as a traditional life sim and I also got into all the weird, scrappy lore. I played with all the cheats and glitches and I, of course, put my sims in the pool and took the ladder out so that they were forced to drown. Try as I might, I could not capture any of these feelings in InZOI, Krafton’s early access life simulator that I would not typically immediately compare to another game if it did not beg for it by lifting every part of its design from the 25-year-old series that defined the genre. At first, navigating my shiny, photorealistic, model-perfect Zoi’s around the shiny, photorealistic, model-perfect world, I feared that I am simply thirty years old and that the whimsy in my heart has withered with time. But in the end, I must insist that it’s not me who is wrong. InZOI simply has awful vibes. Starting where you have to start: in character creation. Zois, the game’s controllable characters, are rendered in minute, slightly uncanny valley detail. Absolutely everybody is beautiful, with flawless skin and hair, and god forbid you want to make a fat person. You’ll have to choose between a “male” and a “female” body, and even though you can then set your Zoi’s gender as male, female, or nonbinary, you’ll still be locked into a lot of the baggage those body types imply. You can’t have a beard on a female body, for example. In short, for a life simulator, you can really only simulate a plastic-y, pared down sort of life. The Sims also has its limitations, but its cartoonish style gives it more leeway. InZOI’s photorealism implies a world close to our own, and so its delineations between the possible and the impossible feel more charged. This is not only true of character creation. When you’re done making Zois and ready to get into the game, there’s plenty to do: build a career, skills, and hobbies; explore the world and visit locations; and navigate relationships with other Zois. But each of these is just as shallow. Careers, skills, and hobbies are progressed straightforwardly. Your Zoi will have an overlapping set of ambitions and drives to push you towards choosing something among the cacophony of options. Take, for example, Eddie Jenkins, who desires a life of excitement, is a joyful and cheerful adventurer, and values accomplishment. These presumably influence the autoselected ambition to become a fitness star, so I put him to work. First, he wants to buy some home gym equipment, and then use it three times. This is easy enough. He then wants to read 10 fitness books and level up his fitness score to six. This takes a few days of steady reading, and since reading also increases the skill score, there’s not much else to it. He then spends three days doing pull ups to finish the entire ambition by hitting a fitness level of ten. This whole thing took maybe a week in-game and maybe an hour of real time. I could have spread this out with other activities, of course, but everything else feels just as vapid. Eddie works as an amusement park employee three days a week – this is considered a full time job – during which time he goes and walks around the boardwalk, loosely interacting with vending machines and rides. His housemate Helen, who is a journalist, sometimes pops up to ask how she should proceed in working on an article. Twice in a row with a couple of days of separation she discovered that her editors were up to something shady and got a bonus for calling them out, but the amusement park doesn’t seem to have any equivalent speedbumps. Eddie walks around. He gestures vaguely at the bins. Sometimes, he, like all Zois, gets a fleeting desire to do something different, like go boxing or talk to someone about his accomplishments. This changes his mood, which theoretically makes it easier to do certain tasks, except that all tasks are frictionless, so in practice it does nothing. Eddie’s intangibility at work extends to any interaction outside of the Zoi’s home. InZOI boasts of its open world; you can walk around as a Zoi and…look at things, I suppose. But I don’t know why you would want to. InZOI doesn’t seem to think it’s worthwhile either: if you actually choose to go somewhere specific, your Zoi will hop on a bus or into a taxi and the world will be replaced by a loading screen. These areas are where a self-driven narrative ought to open up for the creative player, if InZOI had the scaffolding to support it. It does not. You can interact with objects in these locations a thousand different ways, but all of them feel as intangible as doing 72 hours of pullups for no reward. One aspect which does potentially contain some of the creative spark I was hoping for is the building mechanics. I was never good at this; my Sims lived in ugly, boxy homes covered in mismatched wallpaper and the same cheap paintings. But I do remember the ability to have bowling alley carpets and bizarre, fun sculptures, and InZOI will let you put a badly looping gif of a firework on your walls and an ice cream truck in your garden, which I think is important. (Any of the pre-built homes you move your Zois into will, of course, be immaculately furnished as if by cutting-edge though somewhat sterile interior designers, so I have no doubt players can also create these kinds of homes if they want to and have skills that I do not.) Finally, there’s getting to know other Zois. There’s a waterfall of options you can speak to other characters about, from mint chocolate to mental health. Some of them are truly bizarre, like “say your soul chose you,” or “say life is but one layer of a dream.” A lot of them feel like this game is written by the worst people on LinkedIn: every Zoi is obsessed with AI, crypto, and the stock market. They all want to become influencers and are constantly thinking about social media metrics. (The game is also not properly localised yet, with a lot of leftover Korean and some broken strings showing hanging HTML tags.) It’s near impossible to leave Zois unattended and also build the social life you’re aiming for, because they will insult people at the drop of a hat and derail whatever you’ve been working on. And not just insult, either. At one point after I swapped away from the wife in a married couple who I had just instructed to spend several minutes talking about how much she wanted a divorce, and she immediately texted her husband saying she thought things were going great these days. I really could go on with detailing all the ways that InZOI’s vibes are simply not good, but here’s a final big one: the whole game is wrapped in this Assassin’s Creed-like meta layer where you’re actually controlling (?) a game developer (??) who works at a building full of cats (???) and is then controlling (????) the Zois in turn. The only thing this does for the game is add a veneer of corporate soullessness to the whole thing. Alongside the terrifyingly flawless faces and bodies of every Zoi, their obsession with being influencers, and the meaningless achievement grinding as a replacement for opportunities to find real stories to tell, it seems that the only thing I’m simulating is an endless “9-5 in the life of a corporate girlboss” TikTok trend. And, honestly, I find that an insult to every weird teenage girl who’s ever spent the weekend in the Sims burning their family lot to the ground so that they can seduce the grim reaper.

Title: Best Crypto Presales to Watch as BlackRock Bets on Bitcoin

Bitcoin may be taking a breather, but behind the scenes, the giants are quietly stacking chips. The latest move? BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, has launched a physically backed spot Bitcoin ETP in Europe called iShares Bitcoin ETP. Yes, the same BlackRock whose IBIT fund in the US made waves as one of the most successful Bitcoin ETF launches in history. When the whales start swimming, minnows take notice, and it’s not Bitcoin alone that’s attracting attention. We look at three of the best crypto presales that investors have been flocking to, but first, more about what BlackRock’s been up to. BlackRock doesn’t just toss darts. Their latest European Bitcoin ETP follows the roaring success of IBIT, which quickly became one of the most successful ETF launches in history. This isn’t a side hustle. It’s a signal. Larry Fink, BlackRock’s CEO, once called Bitcoin an ‘index of money laundering.’ Now, he’s all in. If that’s not a 180, we don’t know what is. And as BlackRock expands its crypto exposure into Europe, it tells us one thing: the institutional floodgates aren’t just open – they’re flooding. Bitcoin’s Hash Ribbon is an on-chain metric that tracks Bitcoin miners’ health and behavior. When it flips bullish, it usually means miners have stopped panic-selling and started hoarding coins again. Historically, it’s been a sure sign of an incoming rally. So, with BlackRock going full steam ahead on $BTC, and technical indicators flashing green, what’s the smart money move? Just before the next $BTC rally, Bitcoin is always the big play. But those who caught Ethereum in 2016 or Dogecoin in 2020 know the biggest gains can come through smaller players if you get in while they’re still small. So, let’s talk about some of the new kids on the blockchain, three of the best crypto presales you’ll want on your radar before the rocket takes off: If BlackRock is the heavyweight champ in the Bitcoin arena, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is an ambitious contender with serious crowd appeal. At its core, $BTCBULL is a reflection-based token that aims to amplify exposure to Bitcoin. When the price of $BTC moves up, $BTCBULL is designed to react even stronger – thanks to its tokenomics and smart contract mechanics. That means you’re not just betting on Bitcoin. You’re turbocharging the bet. Right now, you can buy $BTCBULL for just $0.00243, and the project has already raised over $4.1M in presale. That’s no small feat for a token that hasn’t even hit the main exchanges yet. There’s more under the hood. One of the token’s standout features is its Bitcoin airdrop system. As Bitcoin hits key milestones – $125K, $150K, and beyond – holders of $BTCBULL will receive $BTCBULL and $BTC airdrops. But there’s a catch: airdrops are only distributed to those who bought $BTCBULL via Best Wallet and continue holding it there. If you’re holding your tokens somewhere else, even in a cold wallet, you’ll miss the party. So if you’re chasing those juicy $BTC rewards, make sure you’re in the right wallet and ready for the next breakout. Next up is Meme Index ($MEMEX) – a token that could only exist in 2025. Picture this: what if there were a single index token that tracked the performance of top meme coins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe? That’s exactly what Meme Index is. Meme Index is made up of four unique indexes: Meme Titan, Meme MidCap, Meme Moonshot, and Meme Frenzy. Each one targets a different layer of the meme coin market, from established giants to up-and-coming underdogs and ultra-volatile moonshots. The platform uses automated smart contracts to track, weigh, and rebalance the top meme coins based on market cap and liquidity. $MEMEX holders automatically gain diversified exposure to the meme coin market – no active trading required. It’s meme investing made passive. If Dogecoin taught us anything, it’s that memes can turn into gold. $MEMEX isn’t just banking on it – it’s systematizing it. It might sound like a meme, but the index structure makes it a surprisingly smart play. You get exposure to the meme coin space, without having to put all your eggs in the Doge basket. In the rapidly evolving crypto landscape, Dawgz AI ($DAWGZ) is making waves by merging the playful essence of meme culture with cutting-edge artificial intelligence. Dawgz AI is an AI agent that stands out by offering powerful, automated AI trading bots designed to scan, analyze, and trade the crypto markets 24/7. These bots aren’t just fast – they’re trained on real-time data and refined by continuous machine learning to optimize decision-making and maximize returns. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or someone who panics during market dips, Dawgz AI aims to take the stress out of trading. The platform also includes an intuitive dashboard for monitoring performance and a suite of tools that lets you customize risk levels, strategies, and even tap into community-voted bot upgrades. The goal? Make AI-driven trading simple, efficient, and fun. $DAWGZ is currently in presale at $0.00345, and the project has already raised nearly $3M, reflecting strong investor confidence in the idea of democratizing AI trading. Let’s be real – Bitcoin isn’t going to zero. Not when BlackRock’s buying in. Not when miners are hoarding. And definitely not when the Hash Ribbon flashes bullish like it just did. But while $BTC is gearing up for its next leg up, the smartest money often finds the breakout stars before they hit the headlines. So whether you’re into altcoins, or just hunting for the best presale of 2025, now’s the time to act. Because once the market starts running again, hesitation will be the most expensive decision of all. As always, don’t forget to do your own research (DYOR) – crypto investments are highly volatile and carry risks, especially during presales. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: CoreWeave’s IPO Valuation Is Rotten To The Core

ByDavid Trainer ByDavid Trainer Contributor. CANADA - 2025/03/19: In this photo illustration, the CoreWeave logo is seen displayed on a ... More smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) CoreWeave (CRWV) is expected to start trading Friday, March 28. At the midpoint of its IPO price range, $51 a share, CoreWeave earns an unattractive stock rating. While CoreWeave’s expected $27 billion valuation is lower than the previously reported $35 billion target, it remains much too high. CoreWeave leases GPUs, CPU’s, and equipment within data centers to customers. Its solutions, connected via “proprietary software and cloud services”, allow customers to deploy and develop artificial intelligence (AI) workloads. With booming revenue growth, CoreWeave and its bankers are looking to capitalize on the AI hype – the same market narrative that’s driven many other AI and AI-related stocks to great heights. However, in my view, CoreWeave’s IPO looks more like a plan to boost Wall Street insider bonuses and throw a lifeline to a cash-burning business, rather than the launch of the next NVIDIA. The company faces persistent threats, not just from ever-changing/upgrading technology, but also from its own customers. Plus, the current proposed $27 billion valuation is far too high as it implies that CoreWeave will grow revenue at a 30% compounded annual growth rate for 7 years, while also maintaining tech-like margins, a highly unlikely feat. Below, I’ll detail these risks and use my reverse discounted cash flow (DCF) model to prove the current valuation is too expensive. My firm’s IPO research provides investors with an alternative to the popular narratives on IPOs that is based on more reliable fundamental research. After moving away from its crypto mining roots, CoreWeave has seen its revenue soar amidst growing demand for AI computing power. In 2024, CoreWeave’s revenue grew 737% year-over-year (YoY). However, CoreWeave’s Core Earnings remained negative, at $36 million in 2024. See Figure 1. Figure 1: CoreWeave’s Revenue & Core Earnings: 2023 – 2024 CRWV Revenue And Core Earnings 2023-2024 Unlike many of the unprofitable companies that went public during the booming IPO market of 2020-2021, CoreWeave is efficiently scaling its business, at least from an income statement perspective. In 2022, total expenses, which include cost of revenue, technology and infrastructure, sales and marketing, and general and administrative, were 245% of revenue. In 2023, total expenses fell to 106% of revenue before falling to 83% of revenue in 2024. The biggest improvements come from: The ability to grow revenue rapidly while managing costs is no small feat, especially in an era of reckless spending. Figure 2: CoreWeave’s Falling Expenses: 2022 – 2024 CRWV Expenses As Percent Of Revenue 2022-2024 We’ve seen that any product and service even tangentially related to AI has received significant investor interest in recent years…for good reason. Many analysts and industry experts believe AI has the ability to transform the global economy for years to come. For instance, CoreWeave notes in its S-1 that: With such high growth rates, it’s not surprising to see billions of capital flow to the AI market. And, Wall Street is, so far, successfully selling that CoreWeave offers the next big opportunity to invest in AI. However, as I’ve cautioned before, investing in the wrong AI could crush your portfolio. No matter how good an AI company looks now, I think there will be many more DeepSeeks looking to disrupt the market and garner a share of the huge amount of capital flowing into the space. Anytime billions flow into an industry, competition ramps up and stock valuations soar. Investors need to avoid stocks that are too expensive because they already embed huge revenue growth and super high margins far into the future. There are other risks of investing in CoreWeave, as I’ll show below. Just two customers accounted for 77% of CoreWeave’s revenue in 2024. Microsoft (MSFT), the company’s biggest customer, accounted for 62% of CoreWeave’s revenue. Revenue concentration is growing, not falling. In 2023, CoreWeave’s top three customers accounted for 73% of its revenue. In 2022, the company’s top three customers accounted for 41% of its revenue. From Michael Porter’s five forces, we all know that large customers can exert more influence over their suppliers. It’s fair to say that 2 customers accounting for 77% of revenue can exert a lot of influence. Should Microsoft decide that CoreWeave costs too much, they have significant leverage to negotiate better terms. In fact, The Financial Times reports that Microsoft is already reducing commitments to CoreWeave due to “delivery issues and missed deadlines.” While CoreWeave denies the reporting, such a story highlights the risk of such high customer concentration. Microsoft forcing lower prices on CoreWeave may be the least of the company’s (and investors’) concerns. Microsoft could decide that leasing compute power and data center space from CoreWeave is simply too expensive, and that it would be better to bring such operations in house…to its own Azure data centers. In such a scenario, CoreWeave’s revenue and profit growth would take a material dive. This risk is not a hypothetical one. Microsoft Azure already operates 300 data centers across the globe, and Microsoft recently reiterated its plans to invest billions in AI infrastructure in 2025. When the company doesn’t have enough capacity through its own Azure data centers to meet compute demand, it pays CoreWeave to fill the gap. However, should Microsoft build out enough Azure capacity to meet demand, it would no longer need to use CoreWeave. Worse yet, in a scenario where AI compute demand falls across the entire industry, neither Microsoft nor other potential customers would need CoreWeave. Such a scenario may be more likely than the market is pricing in. Alibaba’s Chairman Joe Tsai recently noted there may be a bubble forming in data center construction as the pace of investment may outstrip demand for AI services. Microsoft isn’t the only company that could find itself with no need for CoreWeave’s services either. In the leadup to its IPO, CoreWeave is touting a new agreement to provide cloud computing capacity to OpenAI. The deal is worth up to $11.9 billion through 2030. However, OpenAI is also building its own data centers, which could limit demand for CoreWeave’s services moving forward. One fact remains clear, CoreWeave faces lots of competition from a variety of firms, including its largest customers. Not only is CoreWeave’s biggest customer also a competitor, but CoreWeave is much less profitable than all its main competitors. In its S-1, CoreWeave notes its main competitors include the most well-known hyperscalers Amazon (AMZN) AWS, Alphabet (GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT), as well as International Business Machines (IBM), and Oracle (ORCL). Because these competitors have numerous business lines outside of AI computing, I think CoreWeave will struggle to gain any competitive advantage over its larger and more profitable competitors. Per Figure 3, CoreWeave’s invested capital turns (a measure of balance sheet efficiency) and return on invested capital (ROIC) rank last amongst its competitors. The company’s invested capital turns of 0.1 are particularly low and speak to the capital-intensive nature of the company’s business model, which requires leasing expensive data centers and filling those data centers with expensive equipment. With such low IC turns, the company only earns a 2% ROIC, even though its NOPAT margin is comparable to its competitors. Outfitting its data centers with the latest technology to handle and process AI workloads will continue to require large amounts of capital, which means capital efficiency is unlikely to improve. Figure 3: CoreWeave’s Profitability Vs. Competition: TTM CRWV Profitability Vs Competition Not only is CoreWeave less profitable than its competitors (who are also customers), but it is running out of capital to sustain its business. In 2024, CoreWeave burned $6.9 billion in free cash flow (FCF). As of December 31, 2024, CoreWeave had just $1.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet. CoreWeave could sustain its 2024 burn rate for only ~2.5 months from December 31, 2024. In other words, CoreWeave needs a capital raise to remain a going concern, which could explain the timing of its IPO and willingness to continue an IPO at a lower valuation than the company’s previously reported target. Even if I include the proceeds of the IPO, between $2.3 and $2.7 billion (depending upon the underwriters’ decision to exercise their over-allotment option) in the cash on CoreWeave’s balance sheet, CoreWeave’s cash on hand would be at most $4.1 billion. With $4.1 billion in cash, the company could only sustain its 2024 cash burn rate for ~9 months from December 2024. In other words, CoreWeave needs to significantly improve operations and drastically slow cash burn to remain a going concern. CoreWeave, with its high FCF burn and short cash runway, nearly qualifies as a Zombie Stock before it even goes public. The only criteria keeping it from being a Zombie Stock is its positive interest coverage ratio. Should this ratio fall into negative territory, CoreWeave would meet all the criteria of a Zombie Stock. At first glance at CoreWeave’s balance sheet, investors may presume that CoreWeave has just $8 billion in total debt. In fact, in the company’s S-1, it notes as of December 31, 2024, that its “total indebtedness was $8.0 billion.” That figure understates the company’s total debt by over 3x, as I’ll show. Only looking at short- and long-term debt risks missing a material liability in the form of operating leases. As part of its ongoing operations, CoreWeave leases data centers, brings in the technology to run its software, and then rents/leases that system back out to its end customers. Accordingly, operating leases are a key part of CoreWeave’s business. While the company reports $213 million in current operating lease liabilities and another $2.4 billion in non-current operating lease liabilities, these values only scratch the surface of CoreWeave’s actual lease obligations. As part of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02, companies can exclude “Not-Yet-Commenced” leases from the calculation of their operating lease obligation. To ensure I capture all of a company’s obligations, I included not-yet-commenced leases in my present value of future operating leases calculation. When doing so, I find that, with $15 billion in not-yet-commenced leases on its books, the total value of CoreWeave’s operating lease debt is $16.5 billion. When combined with CoreWeave’s reported debt, I find the company’s Total Debt is actually $24.5 billion, or over 3x higher than the $8 billion figure quoted in the “Risks” section of the company’s S-1. Many high growth and unprofitable companies present non-GAAP metrics to appear more profitable than they really are, in hopes of justifying a higher valuation. CoreWeave is no different. CoreWeave provides investors with the popular Adjusted EBITDA metric. Not surprisingly, Adjusted EBITDA gives a more positive picture of the firm’s business than GAAP net income and economic earnings. For instance, CoreWeave reports adjusted EBITDA of $1.2 billion in 2024. Meanwhile, GAAP net income is -$863 million and economic earnings are even lower at -$1.4 billion. See Figure 4. Why would the company overstate its results by so much? Maybe, the bankers are pushing this narrative to reap a big payday with the IPO? Figure 4: CoreWeave’s Adjusted EBITDA, GAAP Net Income, and Economic Earnings: 2023 – 2024 CRWV GAAP vs Ebitda Vs Economic Earnings 2023-2024 Even after I adjust the company’s numbers to get the right metrics in place, I don’t know if I can trust the financials because the company identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. Specifically, the material weaknesses pertained to: The company notes that “management has made improvements”, but the identified material weaknesses remain un-remediated. CoreWeave expects remediation efforts to continue to take place through 2025 and 2026. Weaknesses in internal controls increase the risk that the company’s financials are fraudulent and/or misleading. Making matters worse, the remediation efforts are expected to continue into 2026, thereby increasing the time during which the company’s financials are less trustworthy and increase the likelihood of restatements. The controls are so bad that they will take years to fix. Not a good sign. In its S-1, CoreWeave disclosed it will go public with dual class shares. Class A shares will be offered as part of the IPO. These class A shares will receive one vote per share and class B shares will receive 10 votes per share. This share and voting structure will give the three co-founders significant say over corporate governance matters. After the IPO, CoreWeave’s three co-founders, Michael Intrator (Chief Executive Officer), Brian Venturo (Chief Strategy Officer), and Brannin McBee (Chief Development Officer) will hold 79% of the voting power in the company. If the three co-founders elect to exercise their stock options to purchase Class A shares and exchange them for an equal number of class B shares (pursuant to their Equity Exchange Rights), they would hold 83% of the voting power in the company. In other words, new shareholders will not have much say in the corporate governance of this business. By confidentially filing its S-1 with the SEC when the company was still an emerging growth company, CoreWeave can, and did, take advantage of reduced disclosure requirements in its S-1. CoreWeave notes in its S-1 that it is using extended transition periods for complying with new or revised accounting pronouncements, which is one of the reduced requirements available to emerging growth companies. No matter the company, reduced disclosure is bad for investors. More disclosure is beneficial to all involved, unless the company has something to hide. These three red flags do no present a promising pattern of behavior for any company, especially one about to go public at a valuation that implies nothing but lots of good news for he foreseeable future. I think the stock holds large downside risk at its IPO valuation, especially considering all the red flags I’ve identified. When I use my reverse discounted cash flow (DCF) model to analyze the future cash flow expectations baked into CRWV, I find that shares, at $27 billion, embed very optimistic assumptions about margins and growth. To justify its midpoint IPO valuation of $51/share, my model shows that CoreWeave would have to: In this scenario, CoreWeave would generate $15.6 billion in revenue in 2032, which is 8.2x its 2024 revenue. While this revenue may pale in comparison to the revenue levels of CoreWeave’s customers/competition, it dwarfs the revenue of comparable data centers, which is the core of CoreWeave’s operation. $15.6 billion in revenue would be 1.1x greater than the combined revenue of Equinix (EQIX) and Digital Realty (DLR). This scenario also implies CoreWeave grows NOPAT to $4.2 billion in 2032, compared to $513 million in 2024. I think that it is overly optimistic to believe CoreWeave will maintain SAAS-level margins over the long-term without risking losing its biggest customers (who increasingly move services in-house) while also growing revenues at a 30% CAGR. Companies that grow revenue by 20%+ compounded annually for such a long period are “unbelievably rare”, making the expectations in CoreWeave’s midpoint IPO price even more unrealistic. Up until now, CoreWeave’s moat has been capital based, i.e. the ability to acquire GPUs and sell compute power. Capital as a weapon will last only so long as IPO investors are willing to subsidize it. Without any other meaningful competitive advantage, margins are likely to fall. Even if I instead assume CoreWeave can maintain high revenue growth rates, as the AI boom continues, and margins only slightly fall, the stock has large downside risk. If I assume: the stock would be worth just $29/share today – a 43% downside to the midpoint IPO price. This scenario still implies CoreWeave’s NOPAT improves to $3.1 billion in 2032, or 6x its 2024 NOPAT. Should AI demand slow, or worse, demand for CoreWeave’s services fall precipitously as customers move their operations in-house, the downside risk could be even greater. Figure 5 compares CoreWeave’s implied future NOPAT in these scenarios to its historical NOPAT. For reference, I include traditional data center operators Digital Realty and Equinix. Figure 5: Estimated IPO Price Looks Overvalued CRWV DCF Implied NOPAT Each of the above scenarios assume CoreWeave grows revenue, NOPAT, and FCF without increasing working capital or fixed assets. This assumption is highly unlikely but allows us to create best-case scenarios that demonstrate the high level of expectations embedded in the midpoint IPO valuation. For reference, CoreWeave’s invested capital increased 36% YoY in 2024.

In the leadup to its IPO, CoreWeave is touting a new agreement to provide cloud computing capacity to OpenAI. The deal is worth up to $11.9 billion through 2030. However, OpenAI is also building its own data centers, which could limit demand for CoreWeave’s services moving forward. One fact remains clear, CoreWeave faces lots of competition from a variety of firms, including its largest customers. Not only is CoreWeave’s biggest customer also a competitor, but CoreWeave is much less profitable than all its main competitors. In its S-1, CoreWeave notes its main competitors include the most well-known hyperscalers Amazon (AMZN) AWS, Alphabet (GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT), as well as International Business Machines (IBM), and Oracle (ORCL). Because these competitors have numerous business lines outside of AI computing, I think CoreWeave will struggle to gain any competitive advantage over its larger and more profitable competitors. Per Figure 3, CoreWeave’s invested capital turns (a measure of balance sheet efficiency) and return on invested capital (ROIC) rank last amongst its competitors. The company’s invested capital turns of 0.1 are particularly low and speak to the capital-intensive nature of the company’s business model, which requires leasing expensive data centers and filling those data centers with expensive equipment. With such low IC turns, the company only earns a 2% ROIC, even though its NOPAT margin is comparable to its competitors. Outfitting its data centers with the latest technology to handle and process AI workloads will continue to require large amounts of capital, which means capital efficiency is unlikely to improve. Figure 3: CoreWeave’s Profitability Vs. Competition: TTM CRWV Profitability Vs Competition Not only is CoreWeave less profitable than its competitors (who are also customers), but it is running out of capital to sustain its business. In 2024, CoreWeave burned $6.9 billion in free cash flow (FCF). As of December 31, 2024, CoreWeave had just $1.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet. CoreWeave could sustain its 2024 burn rate for only ~2.5 months from December 31, 2024. In other words, CoreWeave needs a capital raise to remain a going concern, which could explain the timing of its IPO and willingness to continue an IPO at a lower valuation than the company’s previously reported target. Even if I include the proceeds of the IPO, between $2.3 and $2.7 billion (depending upon the underwriters’ decision to exercise their over-allotment option) in the cash on CoreWeave’s balance sheet, CoreWeave’s cash on hand would be at most $4.1 billion. With $4.1 billion in cash, the company could only sustain its 2024 cash burn rate for ~9 months from December 2024. In other words, CoreWeave needs to significantly improve operations and drastically slow cash burn to remain a going concern. CoreWeave, with its high FCF burn and short cash runway, nearly qualifies as a Zombie Stock before it even goes public. The only criteria keeping it from being a Zombie Stock is its positive interest coverage ratio. Should this ratio fall into negative territory, CoreWeave would meet all the criteria of a Zombie Stock. At first glance at CoreWeave’s balance sheet, investors may presume that CoreWeave has just $8 billion in total debt. In fact, in the company’s S-1, it notes as of December 31, 2024, that its “total indebtedness was $8.0 billion.” That figure understates the company’s total debt by over 3x, as I’ll show. Only looking at short- and long-term debt risks missing a material liability in the form of operating leases. As part of its ongoing operations, CoreWeave leases data centers, brings in the technology to run its software, and then rents/leases that system back out to its end customers. Accordingly, operating leases are a key part of CoreWeave’s business. While the company reports $213 million in current operating lease liabilities and another $2.4 billion in non-current operating lease liabilities, these values only scratch the surface of CoreWeave’s actual lease obligations. As part of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02, companies can exclude “Not-Yet-Commenced” leases from the calculation of their operating lease obligation. To ensure I capture all of a company’s obligations, I included not-yet-commenced leases in my present value of future operating leases calculation. When doing so, I find that, with $15 billion in not-yet-commenced leases on its books, the total value of CoreWeave’s operating lease debt is $16.5 billion. When combined with CoreWeave’s reported debt, I find the company’s Total Debt is actually $24.5 billion, or over 3x higher than the $8 billion figure quoted in the “Risks” section of the company’s S-1. Many high growth and unprofitable companies present non-GAAP metrics to appear more profitable than they really are, in hopes of justifying a higher valuation. CoreWeave is no different. CoreWeave provides investors with the popular Adjusted EBITDA metric. Not surprisingly, Adjusted EBITDA gives a more positive picture of the firm’s business than GAAP net income and economic earnings. For instance, CoreWeave reports adjusted EBITDA of $1.2 billion in 2024. Meanwhile, GAAP net income is -$863 million and economic earnings are even lower at -$1.4 billion. See Figure 4. Why would the company overstate its results by so much? Maybe, the bankers are pushing this narrative to reap a big payday with the IPO? Figure 4: CoreWeave’s Adjusted EBITDA, GAAP Net Income, and Economic Earnings: 2023 – 2024 CRWV GAAP vs Ebitda Vs Economic Earnings 2023-2024 Even after I adjust the company’s numbers to get the right metrics in place, I don’t know if I can trust the financials because the company identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. Specifically, the material weaknesses pertained to: The company notes that “management has made improvements”, but the identified material weaknesses remain un-remediated. CoreWeave expects remediation efforts to continue to take place through 2025 and 2026. Weaknesses in internal controls increase the risk that the company’s financials are fraudulent and/or misleading. Making matters worse, the remediation efforts are expected to continue into 2026, thereby increasing the time during which the company’s financials are less trustworthy and increase the likelihood of restatements. The controls are so bad that they will take years to fix. Not a good sign. In its S-1, CoreWeave disclosed it will go public with dual class shares. Class A shares will be offered as part of the IPO. These class A shares will receive one vote per share and class B shares will receive 10 votes per share. This share and voting structure will give the three co-founders significant say over corporate governance matters. After the IPO, CoreWeave’s three co-founders, Michael Intrator (Chief Executive Officer), Brian Venturo (Chief Strategy Officer), and Brannin McBee (Chief Development Officer) will hold 79% of the voting power in the company. If the three co-founders elect to exercise their stock options to purchase Class A shares and exchange them for an equal number of class B shares (pursuant to their Equity Exchange Rights), they would hold 83% of the voting power in the company. In other words, new shareholders will not have much say in the corporate governance of this business. By confidentially filing its S-1 with the SEC when the company was still an emerging growth company, CoreWeave can, and did, take advantage of reduced disclosure requirements in its S-1. CoreWeave notes in its S-1 that it is using extended transition periods for complying with new or revised accounting pronouncements, which is one of the reduced requirements available to emerging growth companies. No matter the company, reduced disclosure is bad for investors. More disclosure is beneficial to all involved, unless the company has something to hide. These three red flags do no present a promising pattern of behavior for any company, especially one about to go public at a valuation that implies nothing but lots of good news for he foreseeable future. I think the stock holds large downside risk at its IPO valuation, especially considering all the red flags I’ve identified. When I use my reverse discounted cash flow (DCF) model to analyze the future cash flow expectations baked into CRWV, I find that shares, at $27 billion, embed very optimistic assumptions about margins and growth. To justify its midpoint IPO valuation of $51/share, my model shows that CoreWeave would have to: In this scenario, CoreWeave would generate $15.6 billion in revenue in 2032, which is 8.2x its 2024 revenue. While this revenue may pale in comparison to the revenue levels of CoreWeave’s customers/competition, it dwarfs the revenue of comparable data centers, which is the core of CoreWeave’s operation. $15.6 billion in revenue would be 1.1x greater than the combined revenue of Equinix (EQIX) and Digital Realty (DLR). This scenario also implies CoreWeave grows NOPAT to $4.2 billion in 2032, compared to $513 million in 2024. I think that it is overly optimistic to believe CoreWeave will maintain SAAS-level margins over the long-term without risking losing its biggest customers (who increasingly move services in-house) while also growing revenues at a 30% CAGR. Companies that grow revenue by 20%+ compounded annually for such a long period are “unbelievably rare”, making the expectations in CoreWeave’s midpoint IPO price even more unrealistic. Up until now, CoreWeave’s moat has been capital based, i.e. the ability to acquire GPUs and sell compute power. Capital as a weapon will last only so long as IPO investors are willing to subsidize it. Without any other meaningful competitive advantage, margins are likely to fall. Even if I instead assume CoreWeave can maintain high revenue growth rates, as the AI boom continues, and margins only slightly fall, the stock has large downside risk. If I assume: the stock would be worth just $29/share today – a 43% downside to the midpoint IPO price. This scenario still implies CoreWeave’s NOPAT improves to $3.1 billion in 2032, or 6x its 2024 NOPAT. Should AI demand slow, or worse, demand for CoreWeave’s services fall precipitously as customers move their operations in-house, the downside risk could be even greater. Figure 5 compares CoreWeave’s implied future NOPAT in these scenarios to its historical NOPAT. For reference, I include traditional data center operators Digital Realty and Equinix. Figure 5: Estimated IPO Price Looks Overvalued CRWV DCF Implied NOPAT Each of the above scenarios assume CoreWeave grows revenue, NOPAT, and FCF without increasing working capital or fixed assets. This assumption is highly unlikely but allows us to create best-case scenarios that demonstrate the high level of expectations embedded in the midpoint IPO valuation. For reference, CoreWeave’s invested capital increased 36% YoY in 2024.

Title: This is catastrophic’: Seattle payroll tax revenues $47M short as jobs leave city

Skip to comments. Posted on 03/26/2025 5:14:01 AM PDT by george76 Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell released his payroll expense tax (PET) report for 2024 Tuesday, and its projections came up nearly $50 million short. “Today’s announcement that PET revenues collected in 2024 were $47 million lower than projected requires action to ensure our budget remains balanced,” Harrell explained in a statement. Harrell said that his 2025 budget proposal was based on the projections from the independent Office of Economic and Revenue Forecasts. But since they got it wrong, the mayor said for the 2026 budget, “my office will consider all options, including additional revenue sources and appropriate expense reductions, to ensure we are making the priority investments and funding the essential services that matter to our residents.” Did the payroll expense tax push jobs out of Seattle? The payroll tax is levied on large corporations in the city, like Amazon and Expedia. Such a steep revenue forecast error suggests high-paying companies or their jobs are leaving the city. It’s precisely why KTTH host Jason Rantz called the news “catastrophic” in a thread on X. “What people haven’t realized yet—but soon will—is that the sharp drop in payroll expense tax revenue means jobs are leaving Seattle,” Rantz explained. “The whole point of the PET was to squeeze ‘free’ money out of businesses because the city arrogantly assumed it held all the cards. But what did PET actually do? It pushed Amazon jobs to Bellevue, kept employees working from home (and out of Seattle), and helped fuel layoffs at companies hit hardest by the tax—like Expedia.” Jobs are leaving Seattle Even Harrell acknowledged, “This decrease in revenue is aligned with recent reports of major employers moving thousands of high-paying jobs out of Seattle to other cities in our region.” “Large corporations should pay their fair share and we should be wary when they use job placements to avoid paying funding that our communities rely on, but we also must recognize businesses will make choices based on their bottom line,” Harrell wrote in his statement. “We need to design our tax policies with the full context of our economy and a comprehensive view that ensures we raise the revenue needed to support all of our residents in a progressive way, aligned with our values.” Rantz called Harrell’s response “strategically naïve.” “Businesses pay far more than their fair share and offer Seattleites high salaries that the city uses on wasteful, ineffective programs,” Rantz explained. “Harrell knows big business already pays ‘their fair share’ but offers his silly quote to try to villainize them, while lionizing his own efforts to go after the businesses he pretends are greedy. But he’s the greedy one: he wants more money that he didn’t earn so he can continue to misspend it. And he’ll target businesses as greedy or deceitful so it can help his re-election campaign.” He noted that the Seattle payroll tax idea may go statewide with the budget proposal from Washington Democrats. What’s next? Republican State Rep. Chris Corry of Yakima took notice of the payroll woes in Seattle. He posted, “Paging literally everyone in Olympia.” Not everyone sees this as “catastrophic,” though. KIRO Newsradio Political Analyst Matt Markovich says the revenue drop is “concerning,” but notes that the $47 million can be made up in the next budget cycle.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Harrell said that his 2025 budget proposal was based on the projections from the independent Office of Economic and Revenue Forecasts. But since they got it wrong, the mayor said for the 2026 budget, “my office will consider all options, including additional revenue sources and appropriate expense reductions, to ensure we are making the priority investments and funding the essential services that matter to our residents.” Did the payroll expense tax push jobs out of Seattle? The payroll tax is levied on large corporations in the city, like Amazon and Expedia. Such a steep revenue forecast error suggests high-paying companies or their jobs are leaving the city. It’s precisely why KTTH host Jason Rantz called the news “catastrophic” in a thread on X. “What people haven’t realized yet—but soon will—is that the sharp drop in payroll expense tax revenue means jobs are leaving Seattle,” Rantz explained. “The whole point of the PET was to squeeze ‘free’ money out of businesses because the city arrogantly assumed it held all the cards. But what did PET actually do? It pushed Amazon jobs to Bellevue, kept employees working from home (and out of Seattle), and helped fuel layoffs at companies hit hardest by the tax—like Expedia.” Jobs are leaving Seattle Even Harrell acknowledged, “This decrease in revenue is aligned with recent reports of major employers moving thousands of high-paying jobs out of Seattle to other cities in our region.” “Large corporations should pay their fair share and we should be wary when they use job placements to avoid paying funding that our communities rely on, but we also must recognize businesses will make choices based on their bottom line,” Harrell wrote in his statement. “We need to design our tax policies with the full context of our economy and a comprehensive view that ensures we raise the revenue needed to support all of our residents in a progressive way, aligned with our values.” Rantz called Harrell’s response “strategically naïve.” “Businesses pay far more than their fair share and offer Seattleites high salaries that the city uses on wasteful, ineffective programs,” Rantz explained. “Harrell knows big business already pays ‘their fair share’ but offers his silly quote to try to villainize them, while lionizing his own efforts to go after the businesses he pretends are greedy. But he’s the greedy one: he wants more money that he didn’t earn so he can continue to misspend it. And he’ll target businesses as greedy or deceitful so it can help his re-election campaign.” He noted that the Seattle payroll tax idea may go statewide with the budget proposal from Washington Democrats. What’s next? Republican State Rep. Chris Corry of Yakima took notice of the payroll woes in Seattle. He posted, “Paging literally everyone in Olympia.” Not everyone sees this as “catastrophic,” though. KIRO Newsradio Political Analyst Matt Markovich says the revenue drop is “concerning,” but notes that the $47 million can be made up in the next budget cycle.

But what did PET actually do? It pushed Amazon jobs to Bellevue, kept employees working from home (and out of Seattle), and helped fuel layoffs at companies hit hardest by the tax—like Expedia.” Jobs are leaving Seattle Even Harrell acknowledged, “This decrease in revenue is aligned with recent reports of major employers moving thousands of high-paying jobs out of Seattle to other cities in our region.” “Large corporations should pay their fair share and we should be wary when they use job placements to avoid paying funding that our communities rely on, but we also must recognize businesses will make choices based on their bottom line,” Harrell wrote in his statement. “We need to design our tax policies with the full context of our economy and a comprehensive view that ensures we raise the revenue needed to support all of our residents in a progressive way, aligned with our values.” Rantz called Harrell’s response “strategically naïve.” “Businesses pay far more than their fair share and offer Seattleites high salaries that the city uses on wasteful, ineffective programs,” Rantz explained. “Harrell knows big business already pays ‘their fair share’ but offers his silly quote to try to villainize them, while lionizing his own efforts to go after the businesses he pretends are greedy. But he’s the greedy one: he wants more money that he didn’t earn so he can continue to misspend it. And he’ll target businesses as greedy or deceitful so it can help his re-election campaign.” He noted that the Seattle payroll tax idea may go statewide with the budget proposal from Washington Democrats. What’s next? Republican State Rep. Chris Corry of Yakima took notice of the payroll woes in Seattle. He posted, “Paging literally everyone in Olympia.” Not everyone sees this as “catastrophic,” though. KIRO Newsradio Political Analyst Matt Markovich says the revenue drop is “concerning,” but notes that the $47 million can be made up in the next budget cycle.

Title: ‘Buckle Up’—Bitcoin Price Suddenly Braced For A ‘Cambrian Explosion’

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough Senior Contributor. 03/26 update below. This post was originally published on March 25 Bitcoin has surged over the last week as traders bet U.S. president Donald Trump could be pulling back from his threat of global trade tariffs (though fears are swirling over a new, mystery threat). Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has added around 10% since its early March lows but remains well off its peak of almost $110,000 per bitcoin set in January despite a a White House official revealing how Trump could spur the bitcoin price higher. Now, as a BlackRock executive predicts a “big catalyst” for bitcoin could be on the horizon, traders are braced for meme stock darling GameStop to make a bitcoin-related announcement when it reports fourth-quarter results after Tuesday’s market close—potentially following in the footsteps of Michael Saylor’s Strategy. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. president Donald Trump hosted bitcoin and crypto company executives, including Strategy's ... More Michael Saylor, at a White House bitcoin and crypto summit. Last month, GameStop received a proposal from Strive Asset Management recommending that the brick-and-mortar video game retailer convert its $5 billion in cash reserves into bitcoin, a move it claims would transform the company into the "premier bitcoin treasury company in the gaming sector." Strive Asset Management chief executive Matt Cole told GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen that he “has an incredible opportunity." “Letter received,” Cohen then posted to X. Just weeks earlier, Cohen set social media alight when he posted a picture of himself with Michael Saylor, the founder of software company turned acquisition vehicle Strategy. 03/26 update: GameStop has followed through with teased plans to adopt bitcoin, aping Michael Saylor’s Strategy that’s built up the world’s biggest corporate stash of bitcoin—with self-styled “bitcoin historian” Pete Rizzo telling traders to “buckle up.” While GameStop has $4.75 billion in cash and said it plans to use some of this cash as well as future debt or equity issuances to buy bitcoin, it didn't commit to an amount, somewhat disappointing those who had hoped the company would reveal a firm bitcoin-buy. GameStop's "investment policy permits investments in certain cryptocurrency assets, including bitcoin and U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoins, and if the company acquires bitcoin or U.S. dollar denominated stablecoins, the company will be exposed to certain risks associated with bitcoin or stablecoins, respectively," the company's fourth-quarter earnings report read. GameStop’s stock has climbed almost 20% overnight after the announcement, though it remains well below the sky-high levels it reached in 2021. Meme stock traders, unofficially led by Keith "Roaring Kitty" Gill, helped send the stock price of companies, including GameStop and cinema chain AMC, to astronomical levels alongside cryptocurrencies like dogecoin. Traders are betting GameStop could become the next Strategy, which has seen its stock explode 3,000% since it started buying bitcoin in the summer of 2020. "Welcome to team bitcoin, Ryan Cohen," Saylor posted to X along with the photo of their pair. That growing team includes Metaplanet and Semler Scientific, both of which have adopted so-called bitcoin treasury strategies. “Overall, news about crypto initiatives could make GameStop stock even more susceptible to sharp movements," analysts at crypto payments platform B2BinPay, said in emailed comments. “In the short term, this has already acted as a positive decision, as reflected in the company’s stock growth, however, it also carries risks of volatility. Stablecoins, of course, won’t carry those risks, but bitcoin can go both ways — offering potential for growth but also for a drop. So if the crypto market takes a big hit, it could negatively affect GameStop’s financial standing.” Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has rocketed higher over the last year, recently falling back from its all-time ... More high of almost $110,000 per bitcoin as traders pare back bets on Donald Trump's bitcoin and crypto policy. Strategy, until recently known as MicroStrategy, now holds around 500,000 bitcoin worth $42 billion after it began aggressively buying bitcoin in 2020. Saylor was one of a handful of bitcoin and crypto company executives that attended the White House digital asset summit hosted by U.S. president Donald Trump earlier this month. Last week, Saylor predicted there’s about to be a “Cambrian explosion” of companies and countries buying bitcoin during a Blockworks podcast.

The SGMW Wuling Hongguang EV offers Chinese car buyers five or seven-seat configurations, 300 km of range (that’s about 185 miles to you and me), and a $9,600 price tag – but it’s the 1000 km EREV version that would take the US by storm in 2025. Context: this is an opinion/satire piece, so get that out of the way and have some fun. Despite the fact that we still have the same POTUS we did in 2020 and that familiar sense of impeding, civilization-wide collapse has never quite went away after David Bowie died and they shot the gorilla, the automotive world has changed quite a bit since Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced an affordable, $25,000 Tesla “Model 2” at the company’s now infamous 2020 Battery Day event. Back then, it seemed like just about every automaker this side of the Pacific was announcing plans to go “fully electric” by 2030 or 2035 or whatever in a cynical bid to emulate TSLA and its trillion-dollar market cap. It’s 2025 now, the shareholder cash grab didn’t take, and Toyota’s pocket Senator Joe Manchin succeeded in advancing the company’s “hybrids are electric” cause by lowering the rebate floor for battery-powered vehicles to just 7 kWh. With batteries still being the limiting reagent in America’s EV reaction, the name of the game now is plug-in hybrids and EREVs – and with Musk buddying to the Indian and Chinese governments, US oil lobbyists, and hoping to sell more cars to a cash-strapped middle America, the timing feels right for an affordable EREV Tesla. This is the one. Eggs are still $9 here in Chicago, despite what Chester Cheetah promised on the campaign trail. Rent is still high, and utility prices are about to start creeping up, too. What’s more, there are currently zero new cars with an MSRP below $20,000 for sale in the US, where the average transaction price for a new vehicle has crept up to $48,039 (more than the median annual income at the last census, by the way). The time is right, in other words, for Tesla to roll out a car exactly like the SGMW Wuling Hongguang EREV. And by “exactly like,” I mean exactly. Like. This is how I think a multinational Wuling Tesla rebadge Model 2 could work, and benefit all of Elon’s other plans: If you squint, the Wuling Hongguang already looks like it might the 7/8 scale offspring of a first-gen Model Y and a Kia Rondo. Heck, Tesla might not even have to change the logo because: how many Tesla logos have they really seen in South Dakota, you know? It wouldn’t even be the first time Tesla (or its CEO) repurposed someone else’s engineering and put their name on it. The original Tesla Roadster was essentially a re-powered Lotus Elise with a body kit, wasn’t it? Tesla is a "tech" company that marks itself as the "Apple" of cars, meaning it is exorbitantly priced, filled with fancy gadgetry and thus expensive. What the public needs and can afford is a very basic no-frills shoebox design daily-driver moving at flow-of-traffic crawl speed. Of course it was, and this new Tesla Model 2 could be just as great, thanks to a rear-wheel drive layout paired with a relatively low-weight, sport-tuned chassis and 200 combined hp from its 1.5L range extender and 75 kW electric motor. The 8.5 kWh DCFC-capable lithium iron phosphate battery pack is good for about 35 miles (50 km) of all-electric range – but they’ll sell the car’s 1,000 km “total range.” It might even have more genuine performance cred than this LeMans-inspired French cargo van, and that thing costs over $50K! That’s my take, anyway – let me know what you think in the comments. SOURCES | IMAGES: links throughout; photos by Wuling, via CarNewsChina. FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.

The weekly cycles of the S&P 500, NASDAQ Composite, and the 1-4-10 year cycle combination for the Dow Jones have all bottomed, so the market is due to rally through April. Tesla’s monthly cycle has bottomed and price has turned up. The stock is oversold both daily and weekly. And, if bearish sentiment is a price propellant through the application of contrary opinion, this stock has this additional booster. April, May, and June have been the strongest months over the last 14 years as the histogram of expected return shows. The stock is likely to retrace 50% of its prior decline by reaching $325 to $330. Tesla Monthly Cycle This cycle points to a rally through April Tesla Monthly Histogram This is the strong season for TSLA. Amazon is in a similar technical/cyclical condition. The monthly cycle is rising and seasonality is favorable. This stock did not keep pace with the Mag Seven pack on the way down. In other words, relative strength is strong, having bottomed in August 2024. Over the last 27 years, the stock has risen from March 3 to April 27 78% of the time.

Title: Exploring Telecom's Four Strategic Options For Navigating Change

ByClaudio Saes ByClaudio Saes Forbes Councils Member. Claudio Saes is a partner and telecom practice leader at Bell Labs Consulting, a group of the award-winning Nokia Bell Labs. It has been more than a year since I last wrote about the global telecommunication landscape scenario. In that article, I provided my view of four possible strategic options telecom providers could explore to adapt to "ever-increasing data transmission rates": subsidies, mergers and acquisitions (M&As), infrastructure split and network facilitation. In this article, I want to review what's happened in recent years in the realms of these four strategic imperatives, the possible outcomes and considerations for telecom operators moving forward. In my original article, I advocated for the importance of subsidies, but there's a risk of confining telecom operators, original equipment manufacturers and their customers. At the time, the Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment (BEAD) program in the U.S. was seen as the solution to bringing the country fast, reliable connectivity. Fast forward to today, and the BEAD program has shown mixed results. While it aims to expand broadband access in underserved areas and help local businesses flourish with high-speed internet access, the rollout faces challenges, such as complex regulations. While all participating states and territories have approved their "internet for all" plans, some have pointed out that navigating state-level regulations and bureaucratic red tape could delay project implementation, echoing the initial concern about subsidies potentially creating dependency. For instance, certain smaller internet service providers rely on government grants, which raises the question of how sustainable these deployments might be once the funds dry up. Despite these challenges, the overall impact of subsidies has been constructive. With the new U.S. administration, I believe there may be an opening for the possibility of using low Earth orbit satellite technology and lowering regulation requirements for the skilled labor force. My second strategic imperative was related to M&As. In 2024, relevant moves took place in the U.S. market. Led by Verizon's $20 billion acquisition of Frontier Communications in the U.S., the Americas accounted for 62% of last year's global telecom M&A deal value. T-Mobile acquired fiber internet provider Metronet for $4.9 billion, which boosted its fixed broadband capabilities. This acquisition allowed T-Mobile to expand its home internet services and compete more effectively in the fixed broadband market. Bell Canada Enterprises (BCE) made a surprising move by acquiring Ziply Fiber, a fiber internet provider based in Washington. This strategic investment gives Bell a foothold in the U.S. market and access to a new fiber network infrastructure. Last year also saw an increase in technology, media and telecommunications M&A activities compared to 2023. With $514 billion in deals, the landscape is evolving faster than ever, and we might see others following in 2025. Investors and companies targeting acquisitions should be prepared to scrutinize asset values and possible future investments. The infrastructure split trend has gained momentum, with several notable fiber companies’ deals in 2024. For instance, in a joint venture with BlackRock, AT&T spun off its fiber assets into a separate entity, GigaPower, and the companies said last year they wanted to expand that venture, according to Fierce Network. Additionally, AT&T expanded its fiber reach through partnerships with four open-access providers in late 2024, Fierce Network also said. The move will allow AT&T to expand its open fiber solution to its own subscribers in new areas and share the costs of deployment with third-party internet service providers. Telecom Italia completed a significant split by spinning off its fixed landline network. This move aimed to streamline operations and help the company compete more effectively. I'm finding this split model is becoming increasingly common as it provides clarity on the value of underlying network infrastructure and opens opportunities for coinvestment from technology partners or private equity. Telecom CEOs must have their eyes and hearts open for such a competitive strategy move, even if that means disrupting your own market first before others do it. Network facilitation has seen significant advancements, particularly in network slicing, data center interconnect and consumable bandwidth solutions. For example: 1. Network Slicing: T-Mobile was the first operator worldwide to shift to a standalone nationwide 5G network in August 2020, and the company started providing network slicing for some events in 2023. 2. Data Center Interconnect: EdgeConneX, a global hyperscale and hyperlocal data center provider, continued to expand last year to offer data center interconnect solutions ranging from mid to large data centers internationally. 3. Consumable Bandwidth Solutions: AT&T partnered with Equinix in 2022 to provide its customers with geo-redundant cloud on-ramps, according to an Equinix blog titled "5 Equinix Fabric Use Cases for Network Service Providers." This collaboration allows AT&T's clients to access cloud availability zones across Equinix's global footprint, the blog also said. I've found there’s a consensus that Network-as-a-Service won’t be widespread due to integration complexity and cost. However, I believe the telcos that have contracts with medium and large enterprises are the ones that benefit the most from these value-added services, especially in light of the AI investment surge. As we reflect on the developments across these four strategic imperatives, it's clear that the telecom industry continues to evolve rapidly. The interplay among subsidies, M&As, infrastructure strategies and network facilitation shapes a new landscape where traditional boundaries are blurring and new opportunities are emerging. Whether a telco embraces strategic partnerships for infrastructure expansion, leverages M&As for competitive positioning or capitalizes on NaaS for enterprise growth, it is imperative to reassess its organization and governance structure. In our experience, companies fail to meet time to market and get lost in pursuing new initiatives with existing organizations, so they're unable to reap the benefits of a new strategic direction. Looking ahead, the industry must navigate challenges such as regulatory uncertainties, technological disruptions and lower operating margins. However, those that can effectively leverage these strategic imperatives will be well-positioned to thrive in the ever-changing telecom ecosystem.

Title: Spot XRP ETF ‘Matter Of Time’: Expert Expects BlackRock To Join The Race

Nate Geraci—President of The ETF Store, host of ETF Prime, and Co-Founder of The ETF Institute—renewed his confidence in a future spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. Geraci’s comments arrived via X, where he stated, “Ripple lawsuit coming to end… Seems obvious spot XRP ETF approval simply matter of time IMO. And yes, I expect BlackRock, Fidelity, etc to all be involved. XRP currently 3rd largest non-stablecoin crypto asset by market cap. Largest ETF issuers aren’t going to ignore this.” Geraci, who had already forecast a spot ETF filing by BlackRock in mid-March, reiterated that it is increasingly plausible that major asset managers will seek to tap into top altcoins beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. On March 14, he wrote: “I’m ready to log formal prediction… BlackRock will file for both solana & xrp ETFs. Solana could be any day. Think XRP once SEC lawsuit concluded.” The expert emphasized that BlackRock is currently the leader (followed by Fidelity) by assets under management for both spot Bitcoin and spot Ethereum ETF. “I simply don’t see them allowing competitors to come in & launch ETFs on 2 of the top 5 non-stablecoin crypto assets w/out any sort of fight. I also believe BlackRock will file for crypto index ETFs btw,” Geraci stated. Notably, yesterday’s filing by Fidelity for a spot Solana ETF filing appears to reinforce the notion that leading fund issuers are stepping into the altcoin ETF domain. Geraci’s renewed optimism comes on the heels of yesterday’s announcement from Ripple Chief Legal Officer (CLO) Stuart Alderoty, who provided what he characterized as his “last update on SEC v Ripple ever.” Last week, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) agreed to drop its appeal against Ripple. “Ripple has now agreed to drop its cross-appeal. The SEC will keep $50M of the $125M fine (already in an interest-bearing escrow in cash), with the balance returned to Ripple. The agency will also ask the Court to lift the standard injunction that was imposed earlier at the SEC’s request. All subject to Commission vote, drafting of final documents and usual court processes,” Alderoty revealed. Nonetheless, pro-XRP attorney Fred Rispoli has clarified via X that the case is not entirely concluded until the SEC’s formal vote and subsequent filings have been processed. Based on standard timelines, Rispoli suggests it could take up to 30 days for the Commission to vote and another 30 days for Judge Torres to sign off on lifting the injunction. In the best-case scenario, observers could see a fully resolved matter within roughly 60 days. The formal conclusion of the SEC lawsuit against Ripple would ostensibly remove a central barrier to major institutional products tied to XRP, thereby making Geraci’s spot XRP ETF prediction more plausible. At press time, XRP traded at $2.4495. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email. Jake Simmons has been a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2016.

Title: Bitcoin Rally To $95K? Market Greed Suggests It’s Possible

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Bitcoin is on everyone’s crosshairs once more. The cryptocurrency shot up to $88,500 today, exciting traders who think the price will rise to $95,000 in the near term. But while optimism is high, so is caution. Some analysts are warning that a retreat back to $80,000 may occur before the next major rally starts. Market intelligence platform Santiment reports that greed is building among crypto investors. References of Bitcoin reaching $100,000 or even as high as $159,000 have surged through social media platforms. While hope is generating all the excitement, Santiment reminds that such peaks in greed generally precede an imminent price adjustment. 🤑 As crypto has bounced nicely in the second half of March, traders have swung the pendulum back toward mild greed. After showing major fear in late February and early March following two stints of Bitcoin dipping as low as $78K, it appears that this rebound to $88.5K has… pic.twitter.com/WGvmvKSv2X — Santiment (@santimentfeed) March 25, 2025 Traders had also been holding back earlier in the year when Bitcoin fell to a low of $78,000. But that recent spike back to $88,500 does appear to have changed the general sentiment. Santiment suggests this might be an ideal time for traders to consider taking profits. Bitcoin miners appear to be confident about the future. According to data from CryptoQuant, miners have not been selling much of their Bitcoin recently. In fact, miner reserves now total 1.81 million BTC, which is worth around $159 billion. Ali Martinez, a crypto analyst, confirmed in a comment on X that no significant selling activity has been recorded among miners over the past 24 hours. This behavior could be a sign that miners are expecting higher prices and prefer to hold onto their earnings for now. Institutional investors are also playing a big role in the market’s momentum. On March 25, Bitcoin spot ETFs in the US recorded a total daily inflow of $27 million. BlackRock, one of the largest asset management firms, led the way with $42 million in inflows that day. Whereas some other funds such as Bitwise and WisdomTree experienced $10 million and $5 million outflows respectively, the robust demand for BlackRock helped in nudging the general trend into positive direction. BlackRock’s net assets in its Bitcoin spot ETF are currently at a little over $50 billion, demonstrating that institutional investors still have a passion for Bitcoin. Technical analysis is indicating Bitcoin might experience a temporary decline before the next peak. On its 4-hour chart, Bitcoin is having a difficult time surpassing a trendline of resistance, creating what experts refer to as a “double top” formation. The pattern suggests the potential for a price drop towards $85,000. Meanwhile, the most important support level is at $86,146, according to the 61.80% Fibonacci retracement level. If Bitcoin manages to stay above this level, analysts indicate that the price may rebound and move towards $95,000.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto.

Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects.

Title: Ripple SEC settlement – Partial fine stays, injunction to be lifted

What’s next for XRP as regulatory headwinds clear with pending SEC settlement? Ripple [XRP] reportedly settled with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This followed after the agency dropped its appeal against the firm without condition last week. According to Ripple’s Legal Chief Stuart Alderoty, the $125M fine for unregistered ‘institutional XRP sales’ was reduced to $50M as part of the agreement. Alderory stated, “The SEC will keep $50M of the $125M fine, with the balance returned to Ripple. The agency will also ask the Court to lift the standard injunction that was imposed earlier at the SEC’s request.” Here, the injunction referred to Judge Analisa Torres’s ruling that barred Ripple from future sales of XRP tokens, especially to institutions that could be deemed unregistered security offerings. The agreement was subject to a Commission vote. But policy watchers speculated it could be officially over within two months. According to pro-crypto attorney Fred Rispoli, “Then we wait on filing by SEC to lift injunction, which will be unopposed by Ripple. Judge Torres will sign off on it (less than 30 days from motion filing). At most, we are 60 days out from this being 100%, formally, legally, and spectacularly over.” Rispoli added that the case would be revisited only if no legislation was passed before 2028 and a crypto-hostile regime got into power. However, U.S. lawmakers were on track to pass legislation for stablecoins and crypto market structure by 2025. In fact, Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association, expected them to be passed by August of this year. Besides, the new SEC’s ongoing regulatory rollbacks were part of its push for clarity in the sector. It recently held a roundtable discussion on the security status of crypto assets. In addition, the agency has planned more public events between now and June. These would clarify regulations on crypto trading, custody, tokenization, and DeFi. Reacting to the latest settlement update, Nate Geraci of ETF Store stated, “Ripple lawsuit coming to end…Seems obvious spot XRP ETF approval is simply matter of time IMO. And yes, I expect BlackRock, Fidelity, etc., to all be involved.” On the market side, the whale wallets with 10 million to 100 million XRP coins were on a steady accumulation spree from late February. XRP price was more sensitive to their movements (yellow) than the larger cohort with 100 million to 1 billion coins (they held 10 billion XRP, red). Source: Santiment XRP didn’t bulge on the price chart, perhaps because it had pumped 12% after last week’s dismissal update. With regulatory headwinds out of the way, the next price catalyst would be XRP ETF approval.

Fidelity Investments is in advanced stages of testing its own stablecoin, which is designed to act as cash in cryptocurrency markets and will be managed through its digital assets arm. 1 26 March 2025 Be the first to comment This content has been selected, created and edited by the Finextra editorial team based upon its relevance and interest to our community. The FT reports that Fidelity’s launch is part of its expansion into the nascent market for tokenised versions of US Treasuries. Late last week it filed to launch a digital version of a US money market fund at the end of May, in direct competition with traditional asset manager rivals BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. The move comes as crypto-friendly President Donald Trump pledged to promote the growth of “lawful and legitimate” dollar-backed stablecoins to support the US currency and called for supporting legislation to be ready to be signed into law by August. In no surprise to anyone, World Liberty Financial, the crypto project promoted by Trump and his sons, has also announced plans to launch its own stablecoin. The coin’s reserves will be backed by short-term US Treasuries and other cash equivalents.

Title: Will Microsoft be laid low by the feds’ antitrust probe?

Microsoft is on top of the world right now, riding its AI dominance to become the world’s second-most valuable company, worth somewhere in the vicinity of $3 trillion, depending on the day’s stock price. But that could easily change — and not because competitors have found a way to topple it as king of AI. A federal antitrust investigation threatens to do to the company what was done to it 35 years ago by a US Justice Department suit that tumbled the company from its perch as the world’s top tech company. It also led to a lost decade in which Microsoft lagged in the technologies that would transform the world — the internet and the rise of mobile. The current investigation was launched last year by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) under the leadership of Chair Lina Khan. Khan was ousted by President Donald J. Trump when he re-took office in January, and there’s been a great deal of speculation about whether his administration would kill the investigation or let it proceed. That speculation ended this month, when new FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson asked the company for a boatload of information about its AI operations dating back to 2016, including detailed requests about its training models and how it acquires the data for them. The investigation isn’t just about AI. It also covers Microsoft’s cloud operations, cybersecurity efforts, productivity software, Teams, licensing practices, and more. In other words, just about every important part of the company. Although the investigation is a broad one, the most consequential parts focus on the cloud, AI, and the company’s productivity suite, Microsoft 365. It will probably dig deep into the way Microsoft uses its licensing practices to push or force businesses to use multiple Microsoft products. Here’s how The New York Times describes it: “Of particular interest to the FTC is the way Microsoft bundles its cloud computing offerings with office and security products.” The newspaper claims the investigation is looking at how Microsoft locks customers into using its cloud services “by changing the terms under which customers could use products like Office. If the customers wanted to use another cloud provider instead of Microsoft, they had to buy additional software licenses and effectively pay a penalty.” That’s long been a complaint about the way the company does business. European Union regulators last summer charged that Microsoft broke antitrust laws by the way it bundles Teams into its Microsoft 365 productivity suite. Teams’ rivals like Zoom and Slack don’t have the ability to be bundled like that, the EU says, giving Microsoft an unfair advantage. Microsoft began offering some versions of the suite without Teams, but an EU statement about the suit says the EU “preliminarily finds that these changes are insufficient to address its concerns and that more changes to Microsoft’s conduct are necessary to restore competition.” Microsoft’s AI business is also in the legal crosshairs, though very few details have come out about it. However, at least part of the probe will likely center on whether Microsoft’s close relationship with OpenAI violates antitrust laws by giving the company an unfair market dominance. The investigation could also focus on whether Microsoft uses its licensing practices for Microsoft 365 and Copilot, its generative AI chatbot, in ways that violate antitrust laws. In a recent column, I wrote that Microsoft now forces customers of the consumer version of Microsoft 365 to pay an additional fee for Copilot — even if they don’t want it. In January, Microsoft bundled Copilot into the consumer version of Microsoft 365 and raised prices on the suite by $3 per month or $30 for the year. Consumers are given no choice — if they want Microsoft 365, they’ll have to pay for Copilot, whether they use it or not. Microsoft also killed two useful features in all versions of Microsoft 365, for consumers as well as businesses, and did it in a way to force businesses to subscribe to Copilot. The features allowed users to do highly targeted searches from within the suite. Microsoft said people could instead use Copilot to do that kind of searching. (In fact, Copilot can’t match the features Microsoft killed.) But business and educational Microsoft 365 users don’t get Copilot bundled in, so they’ll have to pay an additional $30 per user per month if they want the search features, approximately doubling the cost of the Office suite. It’s almost certain the feds will file at least one suit against Microsoft by the FTC, the Justice Department, or maybe both. After all, federal lawsuits against Amazon, Apple, Google, and Meta launched by the Biden administration have been continued under Trump. There’s no reason to expect he won’t target Microsoft as well. There’s another reason the feds could hit Microsoft hard. Elon Musk is suing OpenAI and Microsoft, claiming their relationship violates antitrust laws. He’s also spending billions to compete against them. Given that he’s essentially Trump’s co-president — as well as being Trump’s most important tech advisor — it’s pretty much a slam dunk that one more federal suit will be filed. As one piece of evidence that suits are coming, the FTC weighed in on Musk’s side in his suit against the company and OpenAI, saying antitrust laws support his claims. In a wink-wink, nudge-nudge claim that no one believes, the agency says it’s not taking sides in the Musk lawsuit. Expect the investigations into Microsoft to culminate in one or more suits filed against the company. After that, it’s anyone’s guess what might happen. The government could ask that Microsoft be broken into pieces — perhaps lopping off its AI arm. It could even ask that the cloud as well as AI be turned into their own businesses. Or it could go a softer route by fining the company billions of dollars and forcing it to change its business practices. Either way, hard times are likely ahead for Microsoft. The big question will be whether CEO Satya Nadella can weather the turbulence better than Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer did when the previous federal suit against the company laid it low for a decade.

Title: World’s Largest Asset Manager BlackRock Unveils First Bitcoin ETP In Europe

BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager and now a major player in the broader crypto landscape, is making headlines again with the upcoming launch of its first Bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) in Europe. Following the successful performance of its $48 billion US fund that tracks Bitcoin, the new iShares Bitcoin ETP is set to debut on Xetra and Euronext Paris under the ticker IB1T, and on Euronext Amsterdam under the BTCN ticker on Tuesday. To attract investors from the outset, BlackRock is implementing a temporary fee waiver of 10 basis points, which will reduce the expense ratio to 0.15% until the end of the year. According to Bloomberg, this pricing strategy positions IB1T among the most competitively priced options in the market—significantly cheaper than Europe’s largest crypto ETP, CoinShares International Ltd’s physical Bitcoin product, which charges 0.25%. Manuela Sperandeo, BlackRock’s head of Europe & Middle East iShares Product, commented on the launch, stating that it represents a potential “tipping point” in the industry. The iShares Bitcoin ETP marks BlackRock’s first venture into crypto-linked ETPs outside North America. While similar products have been available in Europe for years, the market—valued at $13.6 billion—remains significantly smaller compared to the US market. BlackRock’s US-listed iShares Bitcoin Trust made headlines upon its launch in January 2024 following the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval, quickly accumulating billions in assets and setting records for ETF launches. The physical Bitcoin backing the IB1T will be custodied by Coinbase Global. The product is designed for both institutional and informed retail investors and will be issued by a special purpose vehicle based in Switzerland. In related developments, the asset manager is also expanding its digital asset offerings through collaboration with Securitize, a financial technology company for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. The BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), which has recently surpassed $1 billion in assets under management, will launch a new share class on the Solana (SOL) blockchain, representing BlackRock’s first tokenized fund to be issued on a public blockchain. Launched in March 2024, BUIDL provides qualified investors with access to US dollar yields on-chain, featuring flexible custody options, daily dividend payouts, and near real-time peer-to-peer transfers. With BUIDL now available on seven blockchains—including Aptos (APT), Arbitrum (ARB), Avalanche (AVAX), Ethereum (ETH), Optimism (OP), and Polygon (POL)—cross-chain interoperability is facilitated by Wormhole, allowing secure and seamless token transfers. Carlos Domingo, co-founder and CEO of Securitize, highlighted the growing demand for tokenized real-world assets and the asset manager’s decision to expand to the Solana blockchain, stating: In the year since BUIDL’s launch, we’ve experienced significant growth in demand for tokenized real-world assets, reinforcing the value of bringing institutional-grade products on-chain. As the market for RWAs and tokenized treasuries gains momentum, expanding BUIDL to Solana—a blockchain known for its speed, scalability, and cost efficiency—is a natural next step At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $88,000, up 8% on a weekly basis. Solana, on the other hand, has seen even greater gains with a price spike of nearly 20% in the same time frame, trading at $145.

Title: Time for businesses to return to their essential purpose

U.S. Federal Housing director Bill Pulte exposes more empty office buildings and wasteful spending in Washington on 'The Ingraham Angle.' Corporate America is poised to unlock its potential as never before. For years, progressive activists have successfully pushed boards of directors and CEOs at top companies to support and promote radical causes that would never stand a chance at the ballot box. The end-result has been to compromise many corporate leaders’ commitment to fulfilling their fiduciary duties and diminished the American economy’s capacity to deliver prosperity for the American people. A correction is long overdue. And it’s finally underway. When businesses try to play politics, they often make things worse rather than better. (Getty Images) Consider the recent news from BlackRock, where CEO Larry Fink has signaled his company’s rejection of legally risky and divisive "Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion" commitments, and abandoned his position as a leader in the so-called "Environmental, Social, and Governance" revolution. DEATH OF DEI IS A MASSIVE REMINDER THERE ARE BETTER WAYS TO RUN A BUSINESSBlackRock’s course correction is confirmation of a massive sea change throughout Corporate America. Other financial giants like State Street and JPMorgan Chase have also ditched DEI, along with household brands like Walmart, Target, McDonald’s and Ford. The list is expansive and should be encouraging to every American CEO, shareholder, consumer and employee. After more than half a decade of allowing their businesses to be weaponized by activists, leaders like Fink are now refocusing on the main goals of businesses. Those goals are at the center of the Good for Business Coalition and our Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation. This coalition’s vision rests on four pillars: creating economic value, maintaining clear accountability to shareholders, avoiding entanglement in political controversies, and advancing the general welfare through business success rather than political advocacy. LAWFARE AND THE DEATH OF DEI AND AFFIRMATIVE ACTION This approach recognizes an essential truth: that businesses serve society best when they focus on what they do best: creating wealth by delivering consumers with goods and services that people need and want. Profit is what drives a pharmaceutical company to develop life-saving medicines. It also drives a technology company to create tools that enhance human capability to do great things that our grandparents could never have imagined. This doesn't mean corporations should be indifferent to broader social questions or have a license to provide unethically. It simply means that their specific contribution to society’s well-being is through doing what business does best. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Through pursuing profit and generating economic value, businesses serve customers, develop innovative products, create jobs and generate returns that help build millions of Americans' retirement savings. If businesses choose, they can also contribute through traditional corporate citizenship such as supporting local communities or engaging in philanthropy. Businesses aren't designed to be political actors – they lack both the democratic legitimacy and the institutional competence for that role. When they try to play politics, they often make things worse rather than better. The path forward is clear: American businesses need to recommit to their fundamental purpose. That means living up to high ethical standards and good business practice, pursuing operational excellence, maintaining clear accountability to shareholders and avoiding unnecessary political entanglements. It means measuring success by the value created for customers and the returns generated for investors. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP When businesses focus on doing what they do best, they create the innovation, prosperity and opportunity that truly advance human flourishing. The business of business is business – not because social issues don't matter, but because this is how business best serves society. And business leaders who reprioritize along these lines deserve our support. It's time for American corporations to remember this fundamental truth and return to their essential purpose.

Title: 3 Things Marketers Should Know About Magna’s 2025 Ad Forecast Update

We deliver! Get curated industry news straight to your inbox. Subscribe to Adweek newsletters. Today, Magna released its spring update to its U.S. Ad Forecast report for 2025, and the results focus on what the market looks like during an uncertain time. Magna found that U.S. ad sales reached $380 billion in 2024, as fourth-quarter earnings were strong across the board. This reflects a more than 12.4% increase (+9.9% excluding cyclical spending). However, Magna, which already expected a down year in 2025, is reducing that forecast even more. “Confidence plays a crucial role in marketing and advertising investment decisions. The current—hopefully temporary—dip in confidence has already dampened the dynamics of the ad market, prompting U.S. to revise our growth forecast for 2025,” Vincent Létang, evp, global market intelligence, Magna, and co-author of the report, said in a statement. “While total ad spend is still expected to grow in the mid-single digits, digital media ad sales will continue to experience high-single-digit growth. In contrast, most traditional media channels may face stagnating ad revenues this year.” Here are some of the standout points and key takeaways from the report: Magna predicts that the lack of visibility and risk of a trade war may cause marketing and advertising budgets to either freeze or result in cuts in industries that are vulnerable to global trade, supply chain disruptions, and consumer confidence issues. That includes consumer packaged goods companies, in food, drinks, and personal care, as well as quick-service restaurants and the automotive industry. These industries account for a sizeable share of ad spend in the U.S., but there are still large, growing industry verticals that are not particularly sensitive to global costs or economic fluctuations, like pharmaceuticals, retail, tech/telecoms, entertainment, finance, and insurance. Moreover, endemic and organic growth factors (media innovation, retail media, ad-supported streaming) that drove ad spend faster than the general economic growth in recent years will continue to make advertising formats more effective, efficient, and attractive to brands and encourage advertisers to maintain or develop advertising budgets. Considering the various business and economic factors, Magna has reduced its 2025 ad market growth forecast from +4.9% in December 2024 to +4.3%. Non-cyclical ad sales will grow by +6.7% (previous forecast +7.3%). Still, some categories will continue with robust revenues. For instance, digital pure players (DPP) in search, retail media, social media, digital video, and digital audio (such as Google, Meta, Amazon, and Spotify) will see ad revenue grow by +9.6% to $293 billion. Magna points out that traditional media owners (TMO) (categories that fall under television, premium long-form streaming, audio media, publishing, out-of-home advertising, and cinema) are more vulnerable when a lack of business visibility leads some marketers to prioritize short-term KPIs and lower-funnel channels. Because of this, Magna expects TMOs’ non-cyclical ad sales to decline by -1% to $103 billion, while cross-platform TV sales stabilize, with growth in ad-supported streaming (+14%) helping to offset an ongoing decline in linear ad sales (-7%). Ad-supported streaming—which includes FAST channels and all premium long-form streaming platforms like Hulu, Peacock, Netflix, Prime, etc.—benefits from growing reach and viewership as 75% of all streaming hours are now ad-supported, up from 58% a year ago, per Magna. Among other highlights, sports will continue to grow for TV with content such as the college football playoffs, the WNBA on Prime Video, and exclusive NBA games on Peacock. Meanwhile, out-of-home (OOH) ad sales are predicted to grow by more than 4.8% this year to $10 billion, driven by double-digit growth in digital OOH revenues. However, other traditional media channels may struggle in 2025. For instance, Magna forecasts a decrease of -2% for audio media and publishing ad revenues, with digital ad formats not being able to offset declines on legacy formats. Magna predicts that audio media will account for $16 billion, while publishing will account for $15 billion. 3 Big Takeaways Marketers Should Know About Magna’s 2024 US Ad Forecast The Magna report explores how business and consumer confidence deteriorated since January due to several factors, such as the stock market recording decreases and the cost of food rising. Though overall food costs did not rise in Q1—staying around 3%—U.S. consumers were shaken by the sharp inflation in eggs, which is typically a food staple of American households. The combination caused a drop in the consumer confidence index, which decreased from 74 in December to 58 in March, close to the all-time low recorded in June 2022 when gas hit $5 per gallon in the wake of the Ukraine invasion. When it comes to the economic outlook on the U.S. ad market, the research notes how the core economic fundamentals like consumer price index (CPI) inflation, job market, retail sales, and corporate profits stayed healthy. Additionally, international trade tensions don’t necessarily lead to extensive economic damage. However, the current confidence crisis has already impacted economic activity in Q1, and Magna expects negative GDP growth for the first quarter and cautious investment and marketing spending in the months ahead.

Title: The outlook for ad tech M&A in 2025

Time Published: 2025-03-26T04:01:00Z

According to LUMA Partners’ 2024 Full Year Market Report, the digital media and marketing ecosystem experienced a 13% annual increase in overall mergers and acquisitions compared to the previous year. Specifically, the ad tech sector saw a notable 73% rise in deal volume during this period, and per the Q1 deal flow this year, that trend looks set to continue. Some have even tipped a return of initial public offerings in the space in 2025. But what kind of mergers and acquisitions will keep corporate development execs busy in the coming months: distressed exits or frothy returns, and who will be in market? As of March 2025, several notable M&A deals have been made in the ad tech sector since the start of the year, with strategic players helping to swell the ranks of potential ad tech acquirers. Notable deals during the period include Publicis Groupe’s purchase of Lotame and T-Mobile’s activity, which marked a return of telcos in the space. Even noted M&A outlier The Trade Desk wrote a check for Sincera, building on the Q4 trend of strategic ad tech players entering the market, as exemplified by MediaOcean’s purchase of Innovid and Experian’s purchase of Audigent. A further sign of a return to the halcyon days of ad tech, i.e., 2021 or the mid-2010s, was MNTN’s announcement of its intention to IPO in its S-1 filing. However, sources approached by Digiday suggested any such move could be an anomaly, with LUMA Partners’ CEO, Terence Kawaja, observing that not all such filings will result in IPOs. “I’m not banking on an IPO market [similar to 2021],” he said, adding his observation that “the industry is healthier now” than at the beginning of the decade. When quizzed on which constituency would drive deal volume in the coming months, he noted how “the preponderance of dialog has been driven by strategics; with private equity, that tends to be more correlated to interest rates.” Stephen Masters of GTCR — a PE firm that purchased demand-side platform Simpli.fi in 2017 and later sold a stake to Blackstone in a 2021 in a deal valuing the ad tech firm at $1.5 billion — explained how it is important to consider the market dynamics of the mid-to-late 2010s when contemplating the contemporary landscape. “There were a couple of [ad tech] failures on the public markets around 2015… and that experience meant there were relatively underappreciated assets in the late 2010s, despite really strong growth, that created a good dealmaking environment for PE,” he said. Whether the current widespread public market declines will fuel a further swoop for ad tech from PE circles, similar to how AdTheorent was taken private last year, remains to be seen. Still, more sources stated this would be governed by PE’s’ comfort levels with the impact of AI on the business models of ad tech. For many, Scope3’s recent launch exemplifies the potential of the disruptive impact of “agentic AI tools,” with the business models of traditional programmatic trading outfits and measurement firms expected to be challenged. Dave Helmreich, CEO of TripleLift — an ad tech company that was bought by PE firm Vista Equity Partners in 2021 after it considered an IPO — echoed Kawaja’s thoughts that not all S-1 filings will result in a public listing. He added that his firm used its funds (the company was valued at $1.4 billion in the latest PE deal) to subsequently drive differentiation as a supply-side platform, principally with its $150 million purchase of 1plusX* in 2022. Sources approached by Digiday noted that pressurized margins will most likely impact the scale of 2025 exits compared to the more frothy days of 2021. Additionally, premiums in 2021 were also driven by the fact that many ad tech companies were entertaining overtures from both PE firms as well as their peers that were newly minted on the public markets. “The difference between 2021 and the late 2010s is that there was a lot of exuberance in both public and private markets… and valuations as a result were much higher [in 2021],” observed GTCR’s Master. He further echoed Kawaja’s observation that the prevalence of AI may cause some PE entities to wait until they can fully understand the impact such technologies will have on the space before they make significant further investments. Meanwhile, several sources, many of whom requested anonymity to maintain business relationships, noted how demand-side platforms’ and SSPs’ take-rates have been under pressure compared to 2021. One corporate development source, who declined to be named, noted that some mid-range ad tech companies picked up by PE firms at the height of the 2021 M&A surge will likely be offloaded as margin compression means they could soon breach their debt covenants. The source added, “In 2021, valuations were high, and there was reason to believe the dynamics that drove those trends would continue, but what you actually got was stagflation — a lot of people call that the ‘Covid whiplash.’” A separate financing source, who similarly requested anonymity, added, “If you overpaid for assets in 2021, you might find it difficult to restore value, but you could have big retailers like Walmart looking to buy their own tech. Why wouldn’t you when you have players like Amazon gaining in the market?” Meanwhile, Atlas Technology Group’s Brian Andersen — a banker who worked on deals this year, including DoubleVerify’s purchase of Rockerbox and Publicis’ Lotame deal — told Digiday 2025 activity would likely be “muddled.” Andersen’s comments referenced widespread cutbacks in the digital sector following its massive acceleration during the Covid-19 pandemic — as exemplified by mass layoffs at Big Tech companies. He added, “Personally, I thought 2024 would be more active for M&A, but in reality, it turned into more of a recovery year. I’m still convinced it [2025] will be a decent year.” Editor’s note: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the company’s name was “X+1.” Agencies say Google reps are using aggressive sales tactics to push AI media buying tools like Performance Max and Demand Gen. Meta is now in the principal-based buying business, putting its own twist on the hotly debated practice in talks with agency holdcos. There’s still a lag between the availability of alt-IDs and actual demand from media buyers.

March 25, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, March 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS), Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: MRVI), AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP), and Manhattan Associates, Inc. (NASDAQ:MANH). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) Class Period: July 30, 2024 - February 5, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Skyworks’ expected revenue for the fiscal year 2025. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Skyworks’ ability to expand its mobile business and capitalize on its growth potential by investing in new technologies to diversify its portfolio of offerings. On February 5, 2025, after market close, Skyworks announced its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 and provided lower-than anticipated revenue guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed its results and low guidance to a “competitive landscape” that had “intensified” in recent years. Following this news, the price of Skyworks’ common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $87.08 per share on February 5, 2025, Skyworks’ stock price fell to $65.60 per share on February 6, 2025, a decline of over 24% in the span of just a single day.

(NASDAQ: MRVI) Class Period: August 7, 2024 - February 24, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 On February 25, 2025, before the market opened, Maravai announced it was postponing its fiscal 2024 earnings release and would delay filing its annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024. The Company had identified an error in revenue recognition that “resulted in approximately $3.9 million in revenue being recorded in the final week of the second quarter of 2024 upon shipment when it should have been recorded in the first week of the third quarter of 2024 upon receipt by the customer.” The Company had identified “a material weakness in its internal controls over revenue recognition.” Maravai also required additional time to “complete its assessment of a potential non-cash impairment charge related to goodwill associated with its previous acquisition of Alphazyme LLC.” On this news, the Company’s share price fell $0.87, or 21.70%, to close at $3.14 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Maravai lacked adequate internal controls over financial reporting related to revenue recognition; (2) as a result, the Company inaccurately recognized revenue on certain transactions during fiscal 2024; (3) its goodwill was overstated; and (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

In truth, AppLovin was exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms and using manipulative practices that forced unwanted apps on customers via a “backdoor installation scheme” which inaccurately inflated installation numbers, and, in turn, its profit figures, the complaint alleges. The AppLovin class action lawsuit further alleges that on February 26, 2025, analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures, the complaint alleges. On this news, the price of AppLovin shares fell by more than 12%, the AppLovin class action lawsuit alleges.

(NASDAQ:MANH) Class Period: October 22, 2024 - January 28, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 28, 2025 The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants provided investors with material information concerning Manhattan Associates' expected revenue for the fiscal year 2025. Specifically, the Complaint alleges that Defendants' statements included, among other things, confidence in the Company's ability to forecast guidance despite macroeconomic fluctuations, the growth potential of their professional services offerings, and the ability for their cloud revenue to drive revenue for its professional services. On January 28, 2025, Manhattan Associates issued a press release reporting its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2024. Among other items, the Company disclosed services revenue of $119.5 million for the quarter, growing by only 0.3% compared to the year-ago quarter and falling approximately $2 million short of the guidance provided in October 2024. Manhattan Associates attributed the results to delays in professional services work and deferred deals, predicting that the Company's services revenue would reach a low point in the first quarter of 2025 and that solid revenue growth would not resume until mid-year. Manhattan Associates further revealed emerging challenges in its services business, noting that around 10% of customers with ongoing implementations had scaled back their planned services work for the upcoming calendar and fiscal year. The Company also announced that its 2025 revenues would see modest growth of just 2% to 3%, while GAAP EPS was expected to decline by 10% to 13%. On this news, Manhattan Associates' stock price fell $72.26 per share, or 24.49%, to close at $222.84 per share on January 29, 2025. Then, on February 10, 2025, Manhattan Associates announced that Eddie Capel, Manhattan's President and Chief Executive Officer, would retire from those positions effective February 12, 2025. On this news, Manhattan Associates' stock price fell $23.20 per share, or 11.55%, to close at $177.70 per share on February 10, 2025.

Specifically, Defendants allegedly failed to disclose to investors: (1) the Company’s channel management initiatives were not progressing as represented; (2) that, faced with pricing pressure, the Company had made the decision not to compete on prices and instead walk away from sales opportunities; (3) that, as a result, the Company had inflated inventory in the channels in “LATAM, including Brazil, Asia, including India, as well as Canada and Eastern Europe;” and (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

The Merck class action lawsuit further alleges that on July 30, 2024, Merck revealed that in the second quarter of 2024 "there was a significant step down in shipments from our distributor and commercialization partner, Zhifei, into the points of vaccination, compared with prior quarters, resulting in above normal inventory levels at Zhifei." On this news, the price of Merck stock fell nearly 10%, according to the complaint. Then, on February 4, 2025, the Merck class action lawsuit alleges that Merck published its fourth quarter fiscal year 2024 results, disclosing that "GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 Sales Declined 3% to $8.6 Billion; Excluding the Impact of Foreign Exchange, Sales Declined 2%" "primarily due to lower demand in China, partially offset by higher demand in most international regions, particularly in Japan." On this news, the price of Merck stock fell more than 9%, according to the complaint.

(NASDAQ: RKLB) Class Period: November 12, 2024 - February 25, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 28, 2025 On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume.

Title: Elon Musk’s X Sees Popularity Slide After Election — While Threads, Bluesky Makes Gains

Elon Musk’s X, formerly known as Twitter, has experienced a drop off in U.S. user traffic since November’s presidential election—when he used his account to rally support for President Trump—while rival social media platforms Threads and Bluesky have seen significant increases, according to data from digital market intelligence company Similarweb. Musk purchased Twitter for $44 billion in 2022. (Photo by Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images) X’s daily web visits are down an average of 8.4% to 31.7 million from November through March 21, after briefly spiking during the election and largely plateauing in the proceeding days, while average daily app users (iOS and Android combined) are down 7.2% to 25 million in that same window of time, according to Similarweb. Meta’s Threads platform had the largest daily app user increase since November, boasting a 14.9% increase to 13.6 million daily users since then. However, Threads’ average daily web visits are the lowest, occasionally reaching above the 1 million mark since November. Bluesky maintained a post-election boom with Similarweb reporting average daily web visits up 21.5% from November to 2.3 million while average daily app users are up 2.3% to 1.5 million. Bluesky has mostly managed to keep its number of daily app users above 1.5 million since the election, marking a roughly threefold jump since the start of November, when active users numbered around 540,000.

X’s daily web visits (calculated on a day-by-day basis) have fallen to 30.6 million since its Election Day peak of 46.5 million, according to Similarweb. Meanwhile, daily active iOS and Android users on X have slid 22.1% from Election Day to March 21, to 24.3 million, according to Similarweb. Unclear. Musk made thousands of posts to his over 200 million followers during the election that garnered over 33 billion views, according to The Washington Post. But Musk, who endorsed and funded Trump in the election and gained popularity among right-wing social media users, has since navigated a turbulent 2025. The billionaire received criticism for his role overseeing Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency, concern he’s neglecting his role heading Tesla, which has seen a steep stock price drop, and continued backlash against a gesture he made in January likened to a Nazi salute, as well as Nazi-related posts and puns he published on X. Some high-profile users flocked to Bluesky from X over the latter platform’s increasing popularity among the right-wing, as well as Musk’s amplification of right-wing stances on immigration, transgender people, diversity, equity and inclusion programs, voter fraud and more. Public figures such as actor Mark Hamill, journalist Don Lemon, author Stephen King, director Guillermo del Toro and others outright left X or reduced their posts on Musk’s platform following the election. Bluesky was regularly promoted—and derided—on X as a more Democrat-leaning alternative. Bluesky was co-founded by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and has been propped up as a partisan alternative platform to X, one that also allows users to make text-based posts and message others. The app was invite-only until last year and also allows users to block others, a welcome feature for some who have taken issue with the block feature on X. X no longer blocks users from seeing public posts from a user that has blocked them. Meta’s Threads platform was launched in 2023 as a competitor to X, and positioned as a way to “enable positive, productive conversations,” attempting to distance the platform from the partisan rancor on X. Threads posts are integrated into Instagram and Facebook feeds, making it easy for users on either platform to visit the app. Threads’ monthly active users reached 320 million in January, according to Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, a 45 million user increase from November.

Title: Market rally runs out of steam amid economic anxieties

The stock rally faltered on Tuesday as U.S. consumers turned their gloomiest in over a decade and as uncertainty persisted over plans for the next round of President Donald Trump’s tariffs, set to be unveiled on April 2. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes both closed slightly higher after fluctuating, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average adding just 4.18 points. Nvidia (NVDA-1.18%) stock fell 0.6%, while Tesla (TSLA+2.13%) eked out a 3.5% gain even after its European unit sales and market share dropped again last month. GameStop (GME-23.01%) jumped more than 5% in postmarket trading after it amended its investment policy to include Bitcoin. The company’s fiscal-fourth quarter earnings also topped expectations. Consumer confidence cratered in March, with the index’s future expectations gauge plunging 9.6 points to 65.2, the lowest reading in 12 years. A reading of 80 or below is a recession signal, according to the the Conference Board, which conducts the survey. The headline number also fell by more than expected, and new-home sales data also fell short of estimates. The drop in the consumer confidence “index shows the new administration’s plans for tariffs and spending cuts are going down like a lead balloon with households,” Pantheon Macroeconomics economist Sam Tombs said. Stocks of consumption-related companies including UPS (UPS+0.13%), Dollar Tree (DLTR+11.01%) and Target (TGT+0.80%) declined on Tuesday. Dollar Tree reports earnings before the market opens on Wednesday morning. Markets rose Monday after Trump said reciprocal duties may stop short of his pledge to equalize with levels charged by foreign countries on U.S. goods. The administration may also delay duties on particular types of products. The tariffs are still set to give the market a negative surprise, Goldman Sachs (GS-2.34%) economist Alec Phillips wrote in a note to clients. Trump administration officials have said initial duties are meant as a basis for talks — which incentivizes them to set high rates, Phillips said. A recent survey shows market participants expect an initial 9 percent reciprocal tariff rate, but it may be double that level, he wrote. And despite the lowered pitch of Trump’s rhetoric, the new duties are likely to cover almost all of U.S. trade, Phillips said. The president’s plans to add extra tariffs on buyers of Venezuelan oil add complications, as do the possible inclusion of value added taxes (VATs) and currency undervaluations in the calculations. Stocks active Tuesday included Trump Media, which jumped 8.9% after it announced a tie-up with Crypto.com to start exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Additionally, Trump family-backed World Liberty Financial said it plans to issue a stablecoin. Boeing’s (BA+0.72%) stock gained 0.9% after the Wall Street Journal reported that the planemaker is seeking to withdraw its earlier agreement to plead guilty in a criminal case that alleged it deceived regulators before two fatal crashes of its 737 MAX jets. It was a bad day for Chinese EV makers, with Xiaomi (XIACF-1.25%) falling o.7% in U.S. trading after saying it sold 800 million new shares for about $5.5 billion to fund its expansion plans. BYD (BYDDY+4.13%) was unable to sustain Monday’s post-earnings gains, with its ADRs dropping 5.2%. Decliners also included 23andMe (ME+49.03%), which fell 11%, adding to Monday’s 59% plunge following its bankruptcy filing. Carvana (CVNA+1.73%) jumped 3.8% after Morgan Stanley (MS-2.48%) analyst Adam Jonas increased his recommendation on the stock to buy from hold and bumped his price target to $280 from $260, Barron’s reported. Mobileye Global (MBLY-1.49%) gained 8.7% after it announced a tie-up with Volkswagen (VWAGY+0.27%) on automated-driving technology.

During the early days of Nvidia (NVDA)’s annual developer conference, the San Jose, Calif., event was more akin to a science fair. In 2024, the increasingly popular gathering was dubbed the “Woodstock of A.I.” This year, with a record-breaking 28,000 attendees, GTC 2025 was upgraded to the new technology’s “Super Bowl.” Thank you for signing up!

In recent years, the Jensen Huang-helmed chipmaker has become the undisputed darling of the A.I. world, with demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) boosting its market cap to a staggering $2.93 trillion. But nowhere else is Nvidia’s soaring success more evident than in San Jose’s downtown district, where Nvidia’s GTC conference has become so popular that Huang had to deliver his annual keynote address from a jam-packed hockey arena this year. Compared to GTC 2024, Nvidia’s newest iteration of its developer conference “literally almost doubled in size,” Alex Stettinski, CEO of the San Jose Downtown Association, told Observer. Foot traffic at the San Jose Convention Center, which serves as GTC’s primary venue, rose from around 19,000 last year to roughly 26,000, according to Stettinski, who noted that event correlated to some 13,000 downtown dining visits—a more than 130 percent increase year-over-year. It’s too early to gauge the total economic impact that the conference, which was held between March 17 and 2021, had on San Jose this year. However, given the increase in attendees and restaurant activity, it will surpass last year’s figure of $15.5 million, representing the city’s largest conference since the Covid-19 pandemic. “I would say, anecdotally, that the number probably is substantially higher,” said Stettinski. Around 1,500 attendees came to Nvidia’s first-ever GTC conference in 2009, which took place in the poster-lined hallways of San Jose’s Fairmont Hotel and served as a gathering for engineers and scientists eager to discuss the world of GPUs. Nowadays, however, GTC has become one of the tech world’s most closely-watched events, one scrutinized by analysts and attended by industry leaders like Jeffrey Katzenberg, co-founder of DreamWorks; Michael Dell (DELL), CEO of Dell; and Yann LeCun, Meta (META)’s chief A.I. scientist. It’s also an increasingly incorporated spectacle. During Huang’s keynote on March 18, the chief executive didn’t just discuss his company’s upcoming A.I. chips—he also fired Nvidia merch into the crowd with the help of T-shirt cannons. Attendees wandering San Jose’s downtown, which was awash in Nvidia’s signature colors of green and black, were also treated to a litany of activations that included a Taiwanese-style night market complete with 20 vendors. To accommodate its growing size, Nvidia GTC expanded from two downtown locations to seven this year, said Stettinski, with the chipmaker temporarily taking over areas such as Cesar Chavez Park or the Tech Interactive museum. In some ways, GTC 2025 was a rehearsal for San Jose’s ability to handle major upcoming events like the 2026 Super Bowl and World Cup. “It was a little bit of a test run to see what we can do,” said Stettinski, who noted that the response from locals has been largely positive. “The only complaint that I heard once in a while is, ‘Man, I can’t get a dinner table.'” Whether or not Nvidia’s GTC will become too big for San Jose remains to be seen. While the chipmaker hasn’t yet confirmed that the event will return to the Northern California hub next year, Stettinski said the city “will do anything we can” to bring Nvidia back in 2026. Huang, for his part, seems set on staying put. “The only way to hold more people at GTC is we’re going to have to grow San Jose,” remarked the executive during his keynote. “And we’re working on it.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: Bitcoin Outperforms Tesla in Standard Chartered’s “Magnificent 7” Index

Time Published: 2025-03-25T18:31:10Z
Full Content:
A recent Standard Chartered report reveals that swapping Tesla for Bitcoin in the “Magnificent 7” index enhances returns and reduces volatility. Notably, the “Magnificent 7” index traditionally includes stocks of major tech giants, including Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and Tesla. However, in the newly devised model, Standard Chartered’s Head of Digital Asset Research, Geoffrey Kendrick, removed Tesla, the smallest company in the index by market capitalization of around $800 billion, and replaced it with Bitcoin, which currently boasts a market cap of approximately $1.7 trillion. According to Kendrick, the decision to substitute the electric manufacturer with Bitcoin was based on Bitcoin’s increasing role in financial markets. “This tells us that the Mag 7 portfolios would have benefited over the past seven years from adding BTC and excluding TSLA,” he stated. The analysis found that the revised “Mag 7B” index has outperformed the traditional Mag 7 by about 5% since December 2017. Additionally, the Bitcoin-included index demonstrated nearly 2% lower volatility on average compared to the original lineup. Kendrick emphasized that these findings suggest Bitcoin is not only a hedge against traditional financial risks but also behaves similarly to high-performing technology stocks. The pundit also pointed out that Bitcoin’s correlation with the Nasdaq is stronger than its correlation with gold, reinforcing the argument for its classification alongside tech equities. “If it were included, the implication would be more institutional buying as BTC would serve multiple purposes in investor portfolios,” he added. Notably, Bitcoin’s growing institutional adoption, particularly following the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024, has made trading the cryptocurrency as seamless and cost-effective as dealing in traditional tech stocks. He also highlighted a notable shift in Bitcoin’s trading behavior. Since the inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump in January 2025, Bitcoin’s price behavior has mirrored Nvidia’s on a volatility-adjusted basis. In contrast, he noted that Tesla now trades more similarly to Ethereum. “Since the launch of spot ETFs, Bitcoin investment has become more institutionalized,” Kendrick noted, adding, “We believe BTC should be viewed as a multi-functional instrument in investor portfolios; this will open up the opportunity for even more institutional buying.” That said, Kendrick noted he remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s near-term prospects, citing its increasing correlation with the stock market, which is rebounding from its worst quarter since mid-2022. “Higher Nasdaq will equal higher Bitcoin. $90,000 in focus now,” he said, referencing Bitcoin’s next major price target. Bitcoin’s integration into high-profile investment indices and its performance compared to traditional tech stocks further cement its role in institutional portfolios. As more institutional investors recognize Bitcoin’s multi-functional utility, its inclusion in mainstream financial indices could become a reality in the future. At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $87,628, reflecting a 0.36% surge in the past 24 hours.

Title: GLP-1s are driving returns on R&D investments for Big Pharma, report says

Big Pharma is expected to see big returns from its investment in a class of drugs made famous by Novo Nordisk’s (NVO-2.01%) popular diabetes drug Ozempic. Deloitte’s annual report, Measuring the Return from Pharmaceutical Innovation, found that GLP-1 drugs could fuel significant returns on research and development investments made last year by major drugmakers. The consulting firm analyzed the projected internal rate of return for late-stage pipeline assets across the 20 leading pharma companies. On average, these companies forecast peak sales of $510 million per asset. But when GLP-1s are excluded, that figure drops sharply to $370 million. The internal rate of return for late-stage pipeline assets climbed from 5.9% in 2024, from 4.1% in 2023 — again driven in large part by GLP-1 drugs. Without them, returns would have declined, dipping to 3.8% in 2024 and 3.4% in 2023. This matters even more given that the report also found that the average cost to develop a drug for Big Pharma was $2.23 billion in 2024, up from $2.12 billion the year before. GLP-1 drugs mimic hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite, making them highly sought after for treating obesity and Type 2 diabetes. The surging demand has propelled Eli Lilly (LLY-0.28%) and Novo Nordisk into becoming the largest pharma companies in the world. Eli Lilly’s weight-loss drug Zepbound generated $4.9 billion in annual revenue, while Novo Nordisk’s rival treatment, Wegovy, reached roughly $8 billion in sales. Wall Street has taken notice. Since the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Zepbound in November 2023, Eli Lilly’s stock has soared more than 40%, pushing its market capitalization past $750 billion. Novo Nordisk has seen an even steeper climb, with its stock rising over 76% since Wegovy’s launch in 2021. With such massive returns, several companies — including Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly, Pfizer, and Amgen — are advancing next-generation GLP-1 drugs and investigating their potential for new uses, such as treating sleep apnea and improving heart health.

United Parcel Service (UPS) was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 on Tuesday as the shipping giant's shares closed at their lowest level in nearly five years. UPS shares fell 5% to $109.95, their lowest level since June 29, 2020, when they ended trading at $109.48. The company did not appear to issue a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing or press release Tuesday. UPS shares plummeted 14% on Jan. 30, when the company reported weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter results and said it was cutting its business with Amazon (AMZN), its largest customer. They have lost more than half their value since closing at an all-time high of $232.11 on Feb. 2, 2022, amid record pandemic demand.

Title: The Trump administration is being asked to relax some AI chip rules

As the U.S. prepares to roll out rules that will affect global artificial intelligence development, foreign government officials and tech company leaders are asking the Trump administration to relax some rules around chips, according to Bloomberg. The Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion, which was unveiled at the tail end of the Biden administration, aims to control which countries, including U.S. allies, can import advanced semiconductors needed for AI development. Known as the AI diffusion rule, the framework puts countries into three different tiers, and it outlines how many chips countries can import, where the chips can be deployed, and how nations can work together on AI. With the May 15 deadline to be in compliance looming, foreign governments and tech companies are asking the Trump administration to rethink some restrictions out of worries that the rules could hamper AI development and investment, Bloomberg reported. Poland, for example, is reportedly concerned that data center investments from Google (GOOGL-1.38%) and Microsoft (MSFT+0.36%) could be negatively affected by computing caps. Indian officials, meanwhile, met with former president Joe Biden’s national security council in January to discuss how it can access AI chips, people told Bloomberg. Oracle (ORCL-1.23%) and Nvidia (NVDA-1.18%), which both conduct business in countries under tougher restrictions from the rule (such as those in Southeast Asia), have both asked the Trump administration to scrap the current rule and draft regulations, Bloomberg reported. In January, Nvidia pushed back at the proposed rules in a blog post. “While cloaked in the guise of an ‘anti-China’ measure, these rules would do nothing to enhance U.S. security,” Ned Finkle, vice president of government affairs at Nvidia, said in a statement. “The new rules would control technology worldwide, including technology that is already widely available in mainstream gaming PCs and consumer hardware. Rather than mitigate any threat, the new Biden rules would only weaken America’s global competitiveness, undermining the innovation that has kept the U.S. ahead.” At the moment, White House officials are debating how to implement the rule. Some officials have proposed getting rid of the tiered system and caps on computing power in favor of leaning more on export licenses for a majority of countries, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

It’s an April Fools’ Day miracle. On Tuesday, Nvidia (NVDA-1.18%) unveiled its experimental version of Project G-Assist, an AI assistant for gamers and gaming content creators that the company first teased as a joke on X (then Twitter) on April Fools’ Day in 2017. Nvidia demoed the feature at computer and technology trade show Computex Taipei last year. The AI assistant will be available via the NVIDIA app to desktop users of the company’s visual computing platform GeForce RTX; laptop support will come in a future update. While the assistant can’t do everything advertised in the April Fools’ prank eight years ago (it certainly can’t tell you when your drinks have been optimally chilled in the fridge), it does help PC gamers control and optimize a wide variety of PC settings via simple voice or text commands. The assistant can provide real-time diagnostics and recommendations to improve power efficiency or optimize game settings. It can also control peripheral settings such as keyboard colors, fan speeds, and the lighting in your room on supported devices. And for content creators who film themselves gaming, the assistant makes it easier to record their screen. The model uses a small language model (SLM), so this assistant isn’t supposed to be a broad, conversational AI, Nvidia said in a press release. But AI developers can leverage and extend the assistant’s capabilities through the use of plug-ins. For example, users can add a Spotify (SPOT+0.99%) plug-in to enable music and volume control via voice command while gaming, or they can add Google’s (GOOGL-1.38%) Gemini plug-in to bring more complex conversations and web searches that can help users get live advice on gameplay.

March 25, 2025 12:00 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, March 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming April 28, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RKLB) securities between November 12, 2024 and February 25, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR ROCKET LAB INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Rocket Lab securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than April 28, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Title: Broadcom's AI Boom: How High Can This Semiconductor Giant Go?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/gurufocus/2025/03/25/broadcoms-ai-boom-how-high-can-this-semiconductor-giant-go/
Time Published: 2025-03-25T15:37:32Z

ByGuruFocus ByGuruFocus Contributor. By Nabeel Bukhari Broadcom Inc is a semiconductor giant, making the chips and infrastructure that power the most advanced computing systems in the world. Broadcom’s technology is everywhere, whether it’s the hyperscalers such as Amazon and Alphabet training large AI models or enterprises integrating AI-driven applications. But the more interesting thing is that the company just delivered another blowout quarter, with revenue exploding and AI-related sales skyrocketing. It's also very profitable, with a very high expected adjusted EBITDA margin, which is rare in semiconductors. Despite a premium valuation, Broadcom's future still looks bright with strong cash flow and noteworthy partnerships. Also, as the stock has dropped 16% YTD, this dip might be a buying opportunity before the next leg up and the stock could continue to surprise investors. The question is, how high can Broadcom go? Let's dive in to find out. Broadcom crushed estimates in its first quarter of fiscal 2025. The AI hardware leader beat on earnings-per-share (EPS) of $1.60 by 9 cents and significantly surpassed revenue expectations of $14.92 billion, $330 million ahead of estimates. The 25% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth of the company is a result of continued heavy investment by data centers and hyperscalers upgrading their AI infrastructure. Infrastructure software revenue clocked in at 47% and Broadcom's semiconductor solutions revenue grew 11% year over year on broad-based demand across its portfolio. Now, let’s talk a bit about AI spending, which is only accelerating, placing Broadcom to ride a long-term tailwind. Tech giants like Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Apple are shelling out in order to stay at the forefront of the AI race, and Broadcom is benefiting from their activities. The company's Q1 AI-related revenue increased 77% compared to the previous year to $4.1 billion, which is clear evidence of the growing demand for its AI-optimized chips and connectivity solutions. And this is only the beginning. The data center and AI-related hardware and software market are seen as expanding at a ridiculous 40-55% annually toward $1.4 trillion by 2027. As more and more industries increasingly adopt AI usage in their business processes, the demand for AI infrastructure will quickly increase and Broadcom is well set to take a large portion of it. Strong free cash flow momentum: Beyond top-line growth, Broadcom's free cash flow (FCF) increased even faster than revenue, which is evidence of strong cash generation and operational efficiency by Broadcom. The company generated a FCF of $6.0 billion, up 28% YOY. This figure outpaced revenue growth by three percentage points. It also meant a 40% FCF margin, up 1 percentage point quarter-over-quarter and validating Broadcom's ability to reinvest in growth, pay down debt and return capital to shareholders. Since Broadcom is executing flawlessly and AI demand is growing rapidly, the company should continue to deliver brilliant results in the quarters ahead. Q2 FY25 looks just as strong as well. Revenue is expected to come in around $14.9 billion, which is a strong 19% YOY increase, a symbol that the demand for its products is not slowing down anytime soon. And with no surprise, the biggest driver is AI. Broadcom's AI semiconductor revenue alone is expected to be around $4.4 billion in the quarter due to hyperscalers spending on AI XPUs and connectivity solutions. This is a huge tailwind, and it resonates with the importance of Broadcom's tech in driving the AI revolution. Finally, their profitability with an expected 66% adjusted EBITDA margin is more impressive. That's rare in semis, but such a mix of high-value AI chips and infrastructure software of Broadcom maintains fat margins. Broadcom is pushing the semiconductor innovation boundaries as hyperscalers step it up on AI investments. Its tech has become extremely essential, and the company's Q2 expectations in AI semiconductor revenue are a testament to that. The company is pouring resources into R&D to keep ahead, putting focus on cutting-edge AI XPUs and networking. It is developing a 10,000 teraflops XPU with 2nm 3.5D packaging and scaling AI clusters to 1 million XPUs on Ethernet. On the networking side, it has doubled RAID capacity and is prepping 1.6T bandwidth switches for sampling. These advancements in AI will be game-changers in the AI accelerator industry. Strategically, Broadcom is winning big. Just recently, two more hyperscalers tapped Broadcom for AI XPUs in order to draw on its stature as a key enabler of AI infrastructure. Now the company is making Alphabet’s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), Microsoft's Maia, Amazon's Trainium and Inferentia, Meta Platforms' MTIA, and ByteDance's AI ASIC chips, essentially providing the custom silicon for the biggest names in AI. Broadcom's balanced model of high-margin software and AI-driven hardware is shown by this deep integration across most of the major cloud and AI players and the VMware-driven enterprise software growth. If Broadcom continues at this speed, the company might cement itself as one of the most powerful forces in AI infrastructure. Broadcom has done an excellent job of maintaining an earnings consistency track record, having either met or beaten EPS estimates in every quarter over the past few years. Such outperformance speaks to the company's business model's enduring power as well as the ability to drive continued growth. Broadcom Inc Price Chart Investors have taken notice as Broadcom's stock price has surged 53% over the past year and a whopping 931% over the past half-decade. This performance is not simply luck but instead reflects the company's strategic positioning in AI-driven semiconductors and enterprise software. Broadcom Inc EPS Quarterly Estimate Chart Looking ahead, Broadcom is set to post robust earnings and revenue growth. The EPS for FY2025 and FY2026 are projected to increase substantially YOY, at $6.62 and $7.86 respectively. Nonetheless, seeing how Broadcom has a track record of exceeding estimates, it can do the same in the future as well. If Broadcom delivers results in line or above the past quarters by the same margin of say 3-5%, then its EPS for FY2025 can touch $6.80-$6.95 and for FY2026 can cross $8.00. This means that the potential of this outperformance will make its valuation even more attractive. Premium price? Not really: Broadcom's forward P/E at 28.7 may seem elevated at first glance compared to traditional value stocks. However, as stated above, premium valuations are justified if a company generates superior growth. Broadcom's earnings trajectory supports its multiple in its case. A deeper look at Broadcom's Price-to-Earnings Growth (PEG) ratio provides further evidence that it is relatively cheap. The stock is trading at a PEG ratio of 1.31, based on a forward P/E of 28.7 times and a matching EPS growth rate. Broadcom's PEG indicates that the company is attractively priced in view of its strong earnings trajectory and is notably 18.75% lower than the sector median of 1.67. The bottom line is that despite the premium valuation of Broadcom, the stock is still relatively cheap when one takes into consideration its growth rate. With a solid track record of consistent estimate beats and strong EPS and revenue growth, Broadcom has a lot of room to run. In FY2025, EPS is forecasted to be $6.62, rising to $7.86 in FY2026 and higher. This implies a short-term price target of about $205 to $210 (based on FY2025 estimates) given this company's forward P/E of approximately 28.7 times. In the long-term, EPS is expected to rise to $9.12 in FY2027 and $12.74 in FY2028. If it happens, a conservative P/E multiple of about 21 times implies the stock should trade near $280-$290 in 3-4 years. Broadcom Inc EPS Quarterly Estimate Trends Bullish case scenario: If Broadcom exceeds estimates, due to AI demand, networking expansion, and software growth, EPS would grow faster than expected. If EPS reaches $7.00 in FY2025 and $8.25 in FY2026, and the market rewards Broadcom with a higher multiple of 32 times P/E, the stock could trade above $235 in the short-term. And if EPS hits $10.50 by FY2027 and $14.00 by FY2028, a 23-25 times P/E multiple would take the stock to $350-$375 within the next few years in the long-term bullish case. Broadcom Price Target Scenarios Broadcom insiders have been selling a notable amount of stock over the past year, which naturally piques some eyebrows. CEO Hock Tan sold $26 million worth of shares at $173 each, one of the biggest sales. It seems concerning, but as it was only 10% of his holdings, it's not necessarily a red flag. In addition, insider selling dropped in the past three months and no insider sales occurred in the past month, perhaps implying that the company's executives hang on to their shares after Broadcom's latest earnings release. Furthermore, Broadcom's 1.3% insider ownership worth $14 billion is still a good thing. It is not a huge stake, but it is a statement that executives and important decision-makers have an interest in the company's long-term success. Institutional investors are stepping in: Although there have not been any insider buys recently, institutional investors are increasingly confident in Broadcom's long-term potential, even as insiders are cashing out. Institutional buying tends to outweigh insider selling, as these funds are taking a long-term, research-backed approach. Broadcom Inc Number of Guru Trades While some gurus are taking profits or rebalancing, trades demonstrate a steady accumulation trend, which implies that large funds see Broadcom as a stock they want to hold or add to at current levels. One of the standout among them is Ken Fisher, the founder of Fisher Investments who currently has 23.9 million shares. Fisher uses tech stocks heavily in bull markets, as they are supposed to lead the rally. According to him, Broadcom is a key pillar of market strength, and his large stake in his firm reflects his confidence that the stock will continue to be this way. Balancing debt repayment with growth potential: Broadcom's insider selling could be deemed a strategic move of offloading shares at premium valuations to repay debt. Broadcom took on a big bet on debt with its $69 billion VMware acquisition and has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.14 which is very low, so it makes sense to lower leverage. That said, the company has enough free cash flow to reinvest in innovation while improving its balance sheet. If Broadcom continues to grow at such a pace, the dilution from insider sales may be minimal and the company may be able to grow past any concerns, making these insider sales a natural part of its financial strategy, not a reason to worry. Broadcom's growth trajectory is still very compelling, but a few risks may counter its bullish outlook. The biggest risk is Broadcom relying on Apple. Beginning with the iPhone 17 in 2H25, Apple's transition to in-house Wi-Fi chips could have a big impact on Broadcom's sales. This revenue stream may decline, provided Apple fully phases out Broadcom's chips over the next three years. Another concern is valuation risk. If growth fails or doesn't merit these superior multiples, Broadcom might face downward pressure. Lastly, profitability concerns remain. While sales are growing, gross margin expansion must be sustained. Investors would shift out of Broadcom if it grows revenue but cannot keep the margin momentum. Broadcom is in a perfect situation to take advantage of the AI boom and enjoy solid top and bottom-line growth. The long-term risk from Apple's move toward in-house chips is a big one, but the stock's AI momentum is more than enough to make up for lost revenue. Valuation too continues to be a point of debate, but the history of beating estimates and AI demand surging make its premium multiple justified. Insider selling might also make investors worry, which is justified and should be kept an eye on, but investors should not finalize their bet on a stock based on it. There are many other watch factors, for instance, maintaining profitability. Broadcom can stay ahead as long as it continues to expand margins with revenue growth. For now, the stock looks well positioned for long-term upside.

ByGuruFocus ByGuruFocus Contributor. By Nabeel Bukhari Broadcom Inc is a semiconductor giant, making the chips and infrastructure that power the most advanced computing systems in the world. Broadcom’s technology is everywhere, whether it’s the hyperscalers such as Amazon and Alphabet training large AI models or enterprises integrating AI-driven applications. But the more interesting thing is that the company just delivered another blowout quarter, with revenue exploding and AI-related sales skyrocketing. It's also very profitable, with a very high expected adjusted EBITDA margin, which is rare in semiconductors. Despite a premium valuation, Broadcom's future still looks bright with strong cash flow and noteworthy partnerships. Also, as the stock has dropped 16% YTD, this dip might be a buying opportunity before the next leg up and the stock could continue to surprise investors. The question is, how high can Broadcom go? Let's dive in to find out. Broadcom crushed estimates in its first quarter of fiscal 2025. The AI hardware leader beat on earnings-per-share (EPS) of $1.60 by 9 cents and significantly surpassed revenue expectations of $14.92 billion, $330 million ahead of estimates. The 25% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth of the company is a result of continued heavy investment by data centers and hyperscalers upgrading their AI infrastructure. Infrastructure software revenue clocked in at 47% and Broadcom's semiconductor solutions revenue grew 11% year over year on broad-based demand across its portfolio. Now, let’s talk a bit about AI spending, which is only accelerating, placing Broadcom to ride a long-term tailwind. Tech giants like Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Apple are shelling out in order to stay at the forefront of the AI race, and Broadcom is benefiting from their activities. The company's Q1 AI-related revenue increased 77% compared to the previous year to $4.1 billion, which is clear evidence of the growing demand for its AI-optimized chips and connectivity solutions. And this is only the beginning. The data center and AI-related hardware and software market are seen as expanding at a ridiculous 40-55% annually toward $1.4 trillion by 2027. As more and more industries increasingly adopt AI usage in their business processes, the demand for AI infrastructure will quickly increase and Broadcom is well set to take a large portion of it. Strong free cash flow momentum: Beyond top-line growth, Broadcom's free cash flow (FCF) increased even faster than revenue, which is evidence of strong cash generation and operational efficiency by Broadcom. The company generated a FCF of $6.0 billion, up 28% YOY. This figure outpaced revenue growth by three percentage points. It also meant a 40% FCF margin, up 1 percentage point quarter-over-quarter and validating Broadcom's ability to reinvest in growth, pay down debt and return capital to shareholders. Since Broadcom is executing flawlessly and AI demand is growing rapidly, the company should continue to deliver brilliant results in the quarters ahead. Q2 FY25 looks just as strong as well. Revenue is expected to come in around $14.9 billion, which is a strong 19% YOY increase, a symbol that the demand for its products is not slowing down anytime soon. And with no surprise, the biggest driver is AI. Broadcom's AI semiconductor revenue alone is expected to be around $4.4 billion in the quarter due to hyperscalers spending on AI XPUs and connectivity solutions. This is a huge tailwind, and it resonates with the importance of Broadcom's tech in driving the AI revolution. Finally, their profitability with an expected 66% adjusted EBITDA margin is more impressive. That's rare in semis, but such a mix of high-value AI chips and infrastructure software of Broadcom maintains fat margins. Broadcom is pushing the semiconductor innovation boundaries as hyperscalers step it up on AI investments. Its tech has become extremely essential, and the company's Q2 expectations in AI semiconductor revenue are a testament to that. The company is pouring resources into R&D to keep ahead, putting focus on cutting-edge AI XPUs and networking. It is developing a 10,000 teraflops XPU with 2nm 3.5D packaging and scaling AI clusters to 1 million XPUs on Ethernet. On the networking side, it has doubled RAID capacity and is prepping 1.6T bandwidth switches for sampling. These advancements in AI will be game-changers in the AI accelerator industry. Strategically, Broadcom is winning big. Just recently, two more hyperscalers tapped Broadcom for AI XPUs in order to draw on its stature as a key enabler of AI infrastructure. Now the company is making Alphabet’s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), Microsoft's Maia, Amazon's Trainium and Inferentia, Meta Platforms' MTIA, and ByteDance's AI ASIC chips, essentially providing the custom silicon for the biggest names in AI. Broadcom's balanced model of high-margin software and AI-driven hardware is shown by this deep integration across most of the major cloud and AI players and the VMware-driven enterprise software growth. If Broadcom continues at this speed, the company might cement itself as one of the most powerful forces in AI infrastructure. Broadcom has done an excellent job of maintaining an earnings consistency track record, having either met or beaten EPS estimates in every quarter over the past few years. Such outperformance speaks to the company's business model's enduring power as well as the ability to drive continued growth. Broadcom Inc Price Chart Investors have taken notice as Broadcom's stock price has surged 53% over the past year and a whopping 931% over the past half-decade. This performance is not simply luck but instead reflects the company's strategic positioning in AI-driven semiconductors and enterprise software. Broadcom Inc EPS Quarterly Estimate Chart Looking ahead, Broadcom is set to post robust earnings and revenue growth. The EPS for FY2025 and FY2026 are projected to increase substantially YOY, at $6.62 and $7.86 respectively. Nonetheless, seeing how Broadcom has a track record of exceeding estimates, it can do the same in the future as well. If Broadcom delivers results in line or above the past quarters by the same margin of say 3-5%, then its EPS for FY2025 can touch $6.80-$6.95 and for FY2026 can cross $8.00. This means that the potential of this outperformance will make its valuation even more attractive. Premium price? Not really: Broadcom's forward P/E at 28.7 may seem elevated at first glance compared to traditional value stocks. However, as stated above, premium valuations are justified if a company generates superior growth. Broadcom's earnings trajectory supports its multiple in its case. A deeper look at Broadcom's Price-to-Earnings Growth (PEG) ratio provides further evidence that it is relatively cheap. The stock is trading at a PEG ratio of 1.31, based on a forward P/E of 28.7 times and a matching EPS growth rate. Broadcom's PEG indicates that the company is attractively priced in view of its strong earnings trajectory and is notably 18.75% lower than the sector median of 1.67. The bottom line is that despite the premium valuation of Broadcom, the stock is still relatively cheap when one takes into consideration its growth rate. With a solid track record of consistent estimate beats and strong EPS and revenue growth, Broadcom has a lot of room to run. In FY2025, EPS is forecasted to be $6.62, rising to $7.86 in FY2026 and higher. This implies a short-term price target of about $205 to $210 (based on FY2025 estimates) given this company's forward P/E of approximately 28.7 times. In the long-term, EPS is expected to rise to $9.12 in FY2027 and $12.74 in FY2028. If it happens, a conservative P/E multiple of about 21 times implies the stock should trade near $280-$290 in 3-4 years. Broadcom Inc EPS Quarterly Estimate Trends Bullish case scenario: If Broadcom exceeds estimates, due to AI demand, networking expansion, and software growth, EPS would grow faster than expected. If EPS reaches $7.00 in FY2025 and $8.25 in FY2026, and the market rewards Broadcom with a higher multiple of 32 times P/E, the stock could trade above $235 in the short-term. And if EPS hits $10.50 by FY2027 and $14.00 by FY2028, a 23-25 times P/E multiple would take the stock to $350-$375 within the next few years in the long-term bullish case. Broadcom Price Target Scenarios Broadcom insiders have been selling a notable amount of stock over the past year, which naturally piques some eyebrows. CEO Hock Tan sold $26 million worth of shares at $173 each, one of the biggest sales. It seems concerning, but as it was only 10% of his holdings, it's not necessarily a red flag. In addition, insider selling dropped in the past three months and no insider sales occurred in the past month, perhaps implying that the company's executives hang on to their shares after Broadcom's latest earnings release. Furthermore, Broadcom's 1.3% insider ownership worth $14 billion is still a good thing. It is not a huge stake, but it is a statement that executives and important decision-makers have an interest in the company's long-term success. Institutional investors are stepping in: Although there have not been any insider buys recently, institutional investors are increasingly confident in Broadcom's long-term potential, even as insiders are cashing out. Institutional buying tends to outweigh insider selling, as these funds are taking a long-term, research-backed approach. Broadcom Inc Number of Guru Trades While some gurus are taking profits or rebalancing, trades demonstrate a steady accumulation trend, which implies that large funds see Broadcom as a stock they want to hold or add to at current levels. One of the standout among them is Ken Fisher, the founder of Fisher Investments who currently has 23.9 million shares. Fisher uses tech stocks heavily in bull markets, as they are supposed to lead the rally. According to him, Broadcom is a key pillar of market strength, and his large stake in his firm reflects his confidence that the stock will continue to be this way. Balancing debt repayment with growth potential: Broadcom's insider selling could be deemed a strategic move of offloading shares at premium valuations to repay debt. Broadcom took on a big bet on debt with its $69 billion VMware acquisition and has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.14 which is very low, so it makes sense to lower leverage. That said, the company has enough free cash flow to reinvest in innovation while improving its balance sheet. If Broadcom continues to grow at such a pace, the dilution from insider sales may be minimal and the company may be able to grow past any concerns, making these insider sales a natural part of its financial strategy, not a reason to worry. Broadcom's growth trajectory is still very compelling, but a few risks may counter its bullish outlook. The biggest risk is Broadcom relying on Apple.

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster Contributor. MISTAKES TO AVOID Here’s some good news in these uncertain times: Most investors who’ve invested for the long haul are well-equipped to deal with this selloff. That’s because, over the last five years, stocks have been on an absolute tear. In that period, the S&P 500 has delivered an average annual total return of 19.1%, as of this writing. That’s more than double the average of about 8% in the last century. Think back five years for a moment. Back then, the stock market’s prospects looked bleak, indeed, as we were at the beginning of the pandemic-driven selloff. In the middle of March 2020, lockdowns had just begun in the U.S. (the first one was on March 16, in San Francisco, and March 19 was the first statewide lockdown). Thinking back to that troubled period highlights something important to remember when it comes to investing: Be careful not to take the current circumstances and project them over the long run, because historically the market’s long-term direction is up, especially over periods much longer than five years. Early 2020 also tells us something when it comes to trying to discern if the stock market is overpriced or underpriced: Just looking at a certain time period of stock returns to try to tell whether or not stocks are a bargain is misleading because of something called base effects. In other words, your returns will be impacted by where you start looking, which can sometimes cause some big distortions. That’s always good to bear in mind, of course. But it’s still interesting to look at periods of extreme outperformance and tease out those assets that did better still. Finding one might lead us to a real gem—especially if we can pick it up at a bargain. With that in mind, let’s look at some funds—high-yielding closed-end funds, to be precise—that actually returned more than 19.1% annualized in the last five years. This is important because many wealth advisors and market gurus say that actively managed funds can’t beat the market. Yet these three funds can—and have—even in an extremely hot market like the one we saw after COVID-19 got real. I should be honest and say right now that the reason for this outperformance is that these funds invest in corners of the market that have dominated in that time, as well as assets beyond the S&P 500. These are the main reasons why they’ve outperformed. But this precisely points to why diversifying across both sectors and assets is a proven strategy—it gives us exposure to some outperformance, even in the best of times. That, in turn, boosts the value of our overall portfolio in the long term while helping cushion us from sudden, nasty downturns like the one at the start of the pandemic. Or, for that matter, the one we’re seeing now. Plus, these three funds have another compelling feature: big dividends. Two of them yield over 6%, and one yields 9.5%, so you can see how they don’t just give us the ability to diversify—they also give us the opportunity for a massive income stream that index funds just can’t offer. The benchmark S&P 500 index fund, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), for example, yields just 1.2%. So, let’s jump in, starting with the “worst” performer of our trio and wrapping up with our best. Our first fund returned an astounding 205% over the last five years. That’s mainly because the Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK) focuses on tech stocks: Broadcom (AVGO), NVIDIA (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) are all top holdings. With that in mind, its outperformance is no surprise. But unlike most tech funds, STK yields 6.3%—actually on the low side for CEFs, which yield around 8% on average. Even so this fund remains an unusually powerful way to draw a healthy income stream from the reality of tech encroaching on every part of our lives. There’s just one issue here: When it comes to CEFs, we always strive to buy when a fund is trading at a discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio) and STK trades near par as I write this. This may mean STK will see a market-price decline to bring it to the kind of valuation its peers have. But if this smartly run fund hits a 5% discount to NAV or greater, I see it a “no-brainer” buy. The 31.9% annualized return we’ve seen from the Adams Natural Resources Fund (PEO), which yields 9.5% today, is astounding on its surface. But if you think for a second, it makes sense: Oil was crashing five years ago and actually hit negative prices a couple weeks after the pandemic began. So crude had nowhere to go but up! And the large cap energy stocks this fund holds—PEO currently has ExxonMobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX) and EOG Resources (EOG)—naturally benefited. Plus, this fund’s massive 11.7% discount to NAV is a strong value for that huge income stream, which essentially turns gains from energy stocks into income without you having to buy and sell these stocks yourself. No question about it: Brave contrarians who chose this well-run energy fund five years ago have enjoyed strong gains and healthy income. The fact that we can still get in at a discount means PEO still has appeal, despite that strong run. This last fund is our top performer of the three, and what a performance it’s been. If you’re unfamiliar with PIMCO, it’s a specialist investment firm that operates in the bond market and has a lot of funds that outperform their indices; in the world of credit, it’s considered one of the best, if not the best, there is. So the outperformance of the PIMCO Dynamic Income Strategy Fund (PDX) isn’t too surprising, but the size of that outperformance certainly is. An unbelievable 47.3% annualized return over the last five years, as of this writing, makes PDX an unquestionably powerful wealth builder. But five years ago, you had to be very brave to buy it. Consider that PDX invests in junk bonds, and buying at the start of a global pandemic, during which bankruptcies were expected to be the norm, took an iron-willed contrarian indeed. As I write this, PDX yields 6%. And it’s worth noting that the fund’s payouts have been volatile since its inception in 2019. However, it currently trades at a 6.8% discount, which is unusual for a PIMCO fund (most trade at a premium), so we’ve got an extra margin of safety and an opportunity for discount-driven upside, too, even after this fund’s incredible five-year run.

The fact that we can still get in at a discount means PEO still has appeal, despite that strong run. This last fund is our top performer of the three, and what a performance it’s been. If you’re unfamiliar with PIMCO, it’s a specialist investment firm that operates in the bond market and has a lot of funds that outperform their indices; in the world of credit, it’s considered one of the best, if not the best, there is. So the outperformance of the PIMCO Dynamic Income Strategy Fund (PDX) isn’t too surprising, but the size of that outperformance certainly is. An unbelievable 47.3% annualized return over the last five years, as of this writing, makes PDX an unquestionably powerful wealth builder. But five years ago, you had to be very brave to buy it. Consider that PDX invests in junk bonds, and buying at the start of a global pandemic, during which bankruptcies were expected to be the norm, took an iron-willed contrarian indeed. As I write this, PDX yields 6%. And it’s worth noting that the fund’s payouts have been volatile since its inception in 2019. However, it currently trades at a 6.8% discount, which is unusual for a PIMCO fund (most trade at a premium), so we’ve got an extra margin of safety and an opportunity for discount-driven upside, too, even after this fund’s incredible five-year run.

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster Contributor. MISTAKES TO AVOID Here’s some good news in these uncertain times: Most investors who’ve invested for the long haul are well-equipped to deal with this selloff. That’s because, over the last five years, stocks have been on an absolute tear. In that period, the S&P 500 has delivered an average annual total return of 19.1%, as of this writing. That’s more than double the average of about 8% in the last century. Think back five years for a moment. Back then, the stock market’s prospects looked bleak, indeed, as we were at the beginning of the pandemic-driven selloff. In the middle of March 2020, lockdowns had just begun in the U.S. (the first one was on March 16, in San Francisco, and March 19 was the first statewide lockdown). Thinking back to that troubled period highlights something important to remember when it comes to investing: Be careful not to take the current circumstances and project them over the long run, because historically the market’s long-term direction is up, especially over periods much longer than five years. Early 2020 also tells us something when it comes to trying to discern if the stock market is overpriced or underpriced: Just looking at a certain time period of stock returns to try to tell whether or not stocks are a bargain is misleading because of something called base effects. In other words, your returns will be impacted by where you start looking, which can sometimes cause some big distortions. That’s always good to bear in mind, of course. But it’s still interesting to look at periods of extreme outperformance and tease out those assets that did better still. Finding one might lead us to a real gem—especially if we can pick it up at a bargain. With that in mind, let’s look at some funds—high-yielding closed-end funds, to be precise—that actually returned more than 19.1% annualized in the last five years. This is important because many wealth advisors and market gurus say that actively managed funds can’t beat the market. Yet these three funds can—and have—even in an extremely hot market like the one we saw after COVID-19 got real. I should be honest and say right now that the reason for this outperformance is that these funds invest in corners of the market that have dominated in that time, as well as assets beyond the S&P 500. These are the main reasons why they’ve outperformed. But this precisely points to why diversifying across both sectors and assets is a proven strategy—it gives us exposure to some outperformance, even in the best of times. That, in turn, boosts the value of our overall portfolio in the long term while helping cushion us from sudden, nasty downturns like the one at the start of the pandemic. Or, for that matter, the one we’re seeing now. Plus, these three funds have another compelling feature: big dividends. Two of them yield over 6%, and one yields 9.5%, so you can see how they don’t just give us the ability to diversify—they also give us the opportunity for a massive income stream that index funds just can’t offer. The benchmark S&P 500 index fund, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), for example, yields just 1.2%. So, let’s jump in, starting with the “worst” performer of our trio and wrapping up with our best. Our first fund returned an astounding 205% over the last five years. That’s mainly because the Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK) focuses on tech stocks: Broadcom (AVGO), NVIDIA (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) are all top holdings. With that in mind, its outperformance is no surprise. But unlike most tech funds, STK yields 6.3%—actually on the low side for CEFs, which yield around 8% on average. Even so this fund remains an unusually powerful way to draw a healthy income stream from the reality of tech encroaching on every part of our lives. There’s just one issue here: When it comes to CEFs, we always strive to buy when a fund is trading at a discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio) and STK trades near par as I write this. This may mean STK will see a market-price decline to bring it to the kind of valuation its peers have. But if this smartly run fund hits a 5% discount to NAV or greater, I see it a “no-brainer” buy. The 31.9% annualized return we’ve seen from the Adams Natural Resources Fund (PEO), which yields 9.5% today, is astounding on its surface. But if you think for a second, it makes sense: Oil was crashing five years ago and actually hit negative prices a couple weeks after the pandemic began. So crude had nowhere to go but up! And the large cap energy stocks this fund holds—PEO currently has ExxonMobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX) and EOG Resources (EOG)—naturally benefited. Plus, this fund’s massive 11.7% discount to NAV is a strong value for that huge income stream, which essentially turns gains from energy stocks into income without you having to buy and sell these stocks yourself. No question about it: Brave contrarians who chose this well-run energy fund five years ago have enjoyed strong gains and healthy income. The fact that we can still get in at a discount means PEO still has appeal, despite that strong run. This last fund is our top performer of the three, and what a performance it’s been. If you’re unfamiliar with PIMCO, it’s a specialist investment firm that operates in the bond market and has a lot of funds that outperform their indices; in the world of credit, it’s considered one of the best, if not the best, there is. So the outperformance of the PIMCO Dynamic Income Strategy Fund (PDX) isn’t too surprising, but the size of that outperformance certainly is.

Title: The Phony Comforts of AI Optimism
URL: https://www.wheresyoured.at/optimistic-cowardice/
Time Published: 2025-03-25T13:37:35Z
Full Content:
A few months ago, Casey Newton of Platformer ran a piece called "The phony comforts of AI skepticism," framing those who would criticize generative AI as "having fun," damning them as "hyper-fixated on the things [AI] can't do." I am not going to focus too hard on this blog, in part because because Edward Ongweso Jr. already did so, and in part because I believe that there are much larger problems at work here. Newton is, along with his Hard Fork co-host Kevin Roose, actively engaged in a cynical marketing campaign, a repetition of the last two hype cycles where Casey Newton blindly hyped the metaverse and Roose pumped the bags of a penguin-themed NFT project. The cycle continues with Roose running an empty-headed screed about what he "believes" about the near-term trajectory of artificial intelligence — that AGI will be here in the next two years, that we are not ready, but also that he cannot define it or say what it does — to Newton claiming that OpenAI’s Deep Research is "the first good agent" despite the fact his own examples show exactly how mediocre it is. You see, optimism is easy. All you have to do is say "I trust these people to do the thing they'll do" and choose to take a "cautiously optimistic" (to use Roose's terminology) view on whatever it is that's put in front of you. Optimism allows you to think exactly as hard as you'd like to, using that big, fancy brain of yours to make up superficially intellectually-backed rationalizations about why something is the future, and because you're writing at a big media outlet, you can just say whatever and people will believe you because you're ostensibly someone who knows what they're talking about. As a result, Roose, in a piece in the New York Times seven months before the collapse of FTX, was able to print that he'd "...come to accept that [crypto] isn't all a cynical money-grab, and that there are things of actual substance being built," all without ever really proving anything. Roose's "Latecomer's Guide To Cryptocurrency" never really makes any argument about anything, other than explaining, in a "cautiously optimistic" way, the "features" of blockchain technology, all without really having to make any judgment but "guess we'll wait and see!" While it might seem difficult to write 14,000 words about anything — skill issue, by the way — Roose's work is a paper thin, stapled-together FAQs about a technology that still, to this day, lacks any real use cases. Three years later, we’re still waiting for those “things of actual substance,” or, for that matter, any demonstration that it isn’t a “cynical money-grab.” Roose's AGI piece is somehow worse. Roose spends thousands of words creating flimsy intellectual rationalizations, writing that "the people closest to the technology — the employees and executives of the leading A.I. labs — tend to be the most worried about how fast it’s improving," and that "the people with the best information about A.I. progress — the people building powerful A.I., who have access to more-advanced systems than the general public sees — are telling us that big change is near." In other words, the people most likely to benefit from the idea (and not necessarily the reality) that AI is continually improving and becoming more powerful are those who insist that AGI — an AI that surpasses human ability, and can tackle pretty much any task presented to it — is looming on the horizon. The following quote is most illuminating: Roose's argument, and I am being completely serious, is that he has talked to some people — some of them actively investing in the thing he's talking about who are incentivized to promote an agenda where he tells everybody they're building AGI — and these people have told him that a non-specific thing is happening at some point, and that it will be bigger than people understand. Insiders are "alarmed." Companies are "preparing" (writing blogs) for AGI. It's all very scary. But, to quote Roose, "...even if you ignore everyone who works at A.I. companies, or has a vested stake in the outcome, there are still enough credible independent voices with short A.G.I. timelines that we should take them seriously." Roose's entire argument can be boiled down to "AI models are much better," and when he says "much better" he means "they are able to get high scores on benchmarks," at which point he does not mention which ones, or question the fact that they (despite him saying these exact words) have had to "create new, harder tests to measure their capabilities," which can be read as "make up new tests to say why these models are good." He mentions, in passing, that hallucinations still happen, but "they're rarer on newer models," a statement he does not back up with evidence. He mentions that "...in A.I., bigger models, trained using more data and processing power, tend to produce better results, and today’s leading models are significantly bigger than their predecessors." He does not explain what those results are, what results they produce, and what said results lead to as products, largely because they haven't. He talks about "...if you really want to grasp how much better A.I. has gotten recently, talk to a programmer," then fails to quote a single programmer. I won't go on, because the article is boring, thinly-sourced and speciously-founded. But it's also an example of how comfortable optimism is. Roose doesn't have to make actual arguments – he makes statements, finds one example of something that confirms his biases, and then moves on. By choosing the cautiously-optimistic template, Roose can present "intelligent people that are telling him things" as proof that confirms what he wants to believe, which is that Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, who he just interviewed on Hard Fork, is correct when he says that AGI is mere years away. Roose is framing his optimism as a warning – all without ever having to engage with what AGI is and the actual ramifications of its imminence. If he did, he would have to discuss concepts like personage. Is a conscious AI system alive? Does it have rights? And, for that matter, what even is consciousness? That’s no discussion of the massive, world-changing consequences of a (again, totally theoretical, no proof this exists) artificial intelligence that's as smart and capable (again, how is it capable?) as a human being. Being an AI optimist is extremely comfortable, because Roose doesn't even have to do any real analysis — he has other people to do it for him, such as the people that stand to profit from generative AI's proliferation. Roose doesn't have to engage with the economics, or the actual capabilities of these models, or even really understand how they work. He just needs enough to be able to say "wow, that's so powerful!" Cautious optimism allows Roose to learn as little as necessary to write his column, knowing that the market wants AI to work, even as facts scream that it doesn't. Cautious optimism is extremely comfortable, because — as Roose knows from boosting cryptocurrency — that there are few repercussions for being too optimistic. I, personally, believe that there should be.Here's a thing I wrote three years ago — the last time Roose decided to boost an entire movement based on vibes and his own personal biases. I hate that I've spent nearly two thousand words kvetching over Roose's work, but it's necessary, because I want to be abundantly clear: cautious optimism is cowardice. Criticism — skepticism — takes a certain degree of bravery, or at least it does so when you make fully-formed arguments. Both Roose and Newton, participating in their third straight hype-cycle boost, frame skepticism as lazy, ignorant and childish. To quote Casey: Newton doesn't actually prove that anyone has raised a ceiling, and in fact said: This is not meaningful analysis, and it's deeply cowardly on a number of levels. Newton does not prove his point in any way — he makes up a person that combines several ideas about generative AI, says that open source will “catch up,” and that also there will be some sort of indeterminate harm. It doesn't engage with a single critic’s argument. It is, much like a lot of Newton’s work, the intellectual equivalent of saying “nuh uh!” Newton delights in his phony comforts. He proves his points in the flimsiest ways, knowing that the only criticisms he'll get are from the people he's steadfastly othered, people that he will never actually meaningfully engage with. He knows that his audience trusts him, and thus he will never have to meaningfully engage with the material. In fact, Newton isn't really proving anything — he is stating his own assumptions, giving the thinnest possible rationale, and then singling out Gary Marcus because he perceives him as an easy target. This is, to repeat myself, extremely comfortable. Newton, like Roose, simply has to follow whatever the money is doing at any given time, learn enough about it to ask some questions in a podcast, and then get on with his day. There is nothing more comfortable than sitting on the podcast of a broadsheet newspaper and writing a newsletter for 150,000 people with no expectation that you'd ever have to push back on anything. And I cannot be clear enough how uncomfortable it is being a skeptic or a cynic during these cycles, even before people like Casey Newton started trying to publicly humiliate critics like Gary Marcus. My core theses — The Rot Economy (that the tech industry has become dominated by growth), The Rot-Com Bubble (that the tech industry has run out of hyper-growth ideas), and that generative AI has created a kind of capitalist death cult where nobody wants to admit that they're not making any money — are far from comfortable. The ramifications of a tech industry that has become captured by growth are that true innovation is being smothered by people that neither experience nor know how (or want) to fix real problems, and that the products we use every day are being made worse for a profit. These incentives have destroyed value-creation in venture capital and Silicon Valley at large, lionizing those who are able to show great growth metrics rather than creating meaningful products that help human beings. The ramifications of the end of hyper-growth mean a massive reckoning for the valuations of tech companies, which will lead to tens of thousands of layoffs and a prolonged depression in Silicon Valley, the likes of which we've never seen. The ramifications of the collapse of generative AI are much, much worse. On top of the fact that the largest tech companies have burned hundreds of billions of dollars to propagate software that doesn't really do anything that resembles what we think artificial intelligence looks like, we're now seeing that every major tech company (and an alarming amount of non-tech companies!) is willing to follow whatever it is that the market agrees is popular, even if the idea itself is flawed. Generative AI has laid bare exactly how little the markets think about ideas, and how willing the powerful are to try and shove something unprofitable, unsustainable and questionably-useful down people's throats as a means of promoting growth. It's also been an alarming demonstration of how captured some members of the media have become, and how willing people like Roose and Newton are to defend other people's ideas rather than coming up with their own. In short, reality can fucking suck, but a true skeptic learns to live in it. It's also hard work. Proving that something is wrong — really proving it — requires you to push against the grain, and battering your own arguments repeatedly. Case in point: my last article about CoreWeave was the product of nearly two weeks of work, where, alongside my editor, we poured over the company’s financial statements trying to separate reality from hype. Whenever we found something damning, we didn’t immediately conclude it validated our original thesis — that the company is utterly rotten. We tried to find other explanations that were equally or more plausible to our own hypothesis — “steelmanning” our opponent because being skeptical demands a level of discomfort. Hard work, sure, but when your hypotheses are vindicated by later reporting by the likes of Semafor and the Financial Times, it all becomes worthwhile. I’ll talk about CoreWeave in greater depth later in this post, because it’s illustrative of the reality-distorting effects of AI optimism, and how optimism can make people ignore truths that are, quite literally, written in black ink and published for all the world to see. An optimist doesn't have to prove that things will go well — a skeptic must, in knowing that they are in the minority, be willing to do the hard work of pulling together distinct pieces of information in something called an "analysis." A skeptic cannot simply say "I talked to some people," because skeptics are "haters," and thus must be held to some higher standard for whatever reason. The result of a lack of true skepticism and criticism is that the tech industry has become captured by people that are able to create their own phony and comfortable realities, such as OpenAI, a company that burned $5 billion in 2024 and is currently raising $40 billion, the majority of it from SoftBank, which will have to raise $16 billion or more to fund it. Engaging with this kind of thinking is far from comfortable, because what I am describing is one of the largest abdications of responsibility by financial institutions and members of the media in history. OpenAI and Anthropic are abominations of capitalism, bleeding wounds that burn billions of dollars with no end in sight for measly returns on selling software that lacks any real mass market use case. Their existence is proof that Silicon Valley is capable of creating its own illogical realities and selling them to corporate investors that have lost any meaningful way to evaluate businesses, drunk off of vibes and success stories from 15 or more years ago. What we are witnessing is a systemic failure, not the beginnings of a revolution. Large Language Models have never been a mass market product — other than ChatGPT, generative AI products are barely a blip on the radar — and outside of NVIDIA (and consultancy Turing), there doesn't appear to be one profitable enterprise in the industry, nor is there any sign any of these companies will ever stop burning money. The leaders behind the funding, functionality, and media coverage of the tech industry have abdicated their authority so severely that the consensus is that it's fine that OpenAI burns $5 billion a year, and it's also fine that OpenAI, or Anthropic, or really any other generative AI company has no path to profitability. Furthermore, it's fine that these companies are destroying our power grid and our planet, and it's also fine that they stole from millions of creatives while simultaneously undercutting those creatives in an already-precarious job market. The moment it came out that OpenAI was burning so much money should've begun an era of renewed criticism and cynicism about these companies. Instead, I received private messages that I was "making too big a deal" out of it. These are objectively horrifying things — blinking red warning signs that our markets and our media have reached an illogical point where they believe that destruction isn't just acceptable, but necessary to make sure that "smart tech people" are able to build the future, even if they haven't built anything truly important in quite some time, or even if there’s no evidence they can build their proposed future. I am not writing this with any comfort or satisfaction. I am fucking horrified. Our core products — Facebook, Google Search, Microsoft Office, Google Docs, and even basic laptops — are so much worse than they've ever been, and explaining these things unsettles and upsets me. Digging into the fabric of why these companies act in this way, seeing how brazen and even proud they are of their pursuit of growth, it fills me full of disgust, and I'm not sure how people like Roose and Newton don't feel the same way. And now I want to show you how distinctly uncomfortable all of this is. Last week, I covered the shaky state of AI data center provider CoreWeave — an unprofitable company riddled by onerous debt, with 77% of its $1.9 billion of 2024 revenue coming from Microsoft and NVIDIA. CoreWeave lost $863 million in revenue in 2024, and when I published this analysis, some people suggested that its "growth would fix things," and that OpenAI's deal to buy $11.9 billion of compute over five years was a sign that everything would be okay. Since then, some things have come out: To summarize (and repeat one part from my previous article): I'm afraid I'm not done explaining why I'm uncomfortable. Let me make this much simpler. Okay, simpler. CoreWeave's continued existence is contingent on its ability to borrow money, pay its debts, and expand its business, which is contingent on OpenAI's ability to raise money and expand its business, which is contingent on SoftBank's ability to give it money, which is contingent on SoftBank's ability to borrow money. OpenAI is CoreWeave. CoreWeave is OpenAI. SoftBank is now both CoreWeave and OpenAI, and if SoftBank buckles, both CoreWeave and OpenAI are dead. For this situation to work even for the next year, these companies will have to raise tens of billions of dollars just to maintain the status quo. There is nothing comfortable about my skepticism, and in fact I'd argue it's a huge pain in the ass. Being one of the few people that is willing to write down the numbers in stark, objective detail is a frustrating exercise — and it's isolating too, especially when I catch strays from Casey Newton claiming he's taking "detailed notes" about my work as a punishment for the sin of "doing basic mathematics and asking why nobody else seems to want to." It isn't comfortable to continually have to explain to people who are all saying "AI is the future" that the majority of what they are discussing is fictional, because it reveals how many people believe things based entirely on someone they trust saying it's real, or being presented a flimsy argument that confirms their biases or affirms their own status quo. In Newton and Roose's case, this means that they continue being the guys that people trust will bring them the truth about the future. This position is extremely comfortable, as it doesn't require them to be correct, only convincing and earnest. I don't fear that we're "not taking AGI seriously." I fear that we've built our economy on top of NVIDIA, which is dependent on the continued investment in GPUs from companies like Microsoft, Amazon and Google, one of which has materially pulled back from data center expansion. Outside of NVIDIA, nobody is making any profit off of generative AI, and once that narrative fully takes hold, I fear a cascade of events that gores a hole in the side of the stock market and leads to tens of thousands of people losing their jobs. Framing skepticism as comfortable is morally bankrupt, nakedly irresponsible, and calls into question the ability of those saying it to comprehend reality, as well as their allegiances. It's far more comfortable to align with the consensus, to boost the powerful in the hopes that they will win and that their victories will elevate you even further, even if your position is currently at the very top of your industry. While it's possible to take a kinder view of those who peddle this kind of optimism — that they may truly believe these things and can dismiss the problems as surmountable — I do not see at this time in history how one can logically or rationally choose to do so. To choose to believe that this will "all just work out" at this point is willful ignorance and actively refusing to engage with reality. I cannot speak to the rationale or incentives behind the decision to do so, but to do so with a huge platform, to me, is morally reprehensible. Be optimistic if you'd like, but engage with the truth when you do so.

Title: An AI bubble threatens Silicon Valley, and all of us

An AI bubble threatens Silicon Valley, and all of us. by Bryan McMahon March 25, 2025 5:30 AM This article appears in the April 2025 issue of The American Prospect magazine. Subscribe here. The week of Donald Trump’s inauguration, Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, stood tall next to the president as he made a dramatic announcement: the launch of Project Stargate, a $500 billion supercluster in the rolling plains of Texas that would run OpenAI’s massive artificial-intelligence models. Befitting its name, Stargate would dwarf most megaprojects in human history. Even the $100 billion that Altman promised would be deployed “immediately” would be much more expensive than the Manhattan Project ($30 billion in current dollars) and the COVID vaccine’s Operation Warp Speed ($18 billion), rivaling the multiyear construction of the Interstate Highway System ($114 billion). OpenAI would have all the computing infrastructure it needed to complete its ultimate goal of building humanity’s last invention: artificial general intelligence (AGI). Art for this story was created with Midjourney 6.1, an AI image generator. But the reaction to Stargate was muted as Silicon Valley had turned its attention west. A new generative AI model called DeepSeek R1, released by the Chinese hedge fund High-Flyer, sent a threatening tremor through the balance sheets and investment portfolios of the tech industry. DeepSeek’s latest version, allegedly trained for just $6 million (though this has been contested), matched the performance of OpenAI’s flagship reasoning model o1 at 95 percent lower cost. R1 even learned o1 reasoning techniques, OpenAI’s much-hyped “secret sauce” to allow it to maintain a wide technical lead over other models. Best of all, R1 is open-source down to the model weights, so anyone can download and modify the details of the model themselves for free. It’s an existential threat to OpenAI’s business model, which depends on using its technical lead to sell the most expensive subscriptions in the industry. It also threatens to pop a speculative bubble around generative AI inflated by the Silicon Valley hype machine, with hundreds of billions at stake. Venture capital (VC) funds, drunk on a decade of “growth at all costs,” have poured about $200 billion into generative AI. Making matters worse, the stock market’s bull run is deeply dependent on the growth of the Big Tech companies fueling the AI bubble. In 2023, 71 percent of the total gains in the S&P 500 were attributable to the “Magnificent Seven”—Apple, Nvidia, Tesla, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft—all of which are among the biggest spenders on AI. Just four—Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta—combined for $246 billion of capital expenditure in 2024 to support the AI build-out. Goldman Sachs expects Big Tech to spend over $1 trillion on chips and data centers to power AI over the next five years. Yet OpenAI, the current market leader, expects to lose $5 billion this year, and its annual losses to swell to $11 billion by 2026. If the AI bubble bursts, it not only threatens to wipe out VC firms in the Valley but also blow a gaping hole in the public markets and cause an economy-wide meltdown. The basic problem facing Silicon Valley today is, ironically, one of growth. There are no more digital frontiers to conquer. The young, pioneering upstarts—Facebook, Google, Amazon—that struck out toward the digital wilderness are now the monopolists, constraining growth with onerous rentier fees they can charge because of their market-making size. The software industry’s spectacular returns from the launch of the internet in the ’90s to the end of the 2010s would never come back, but venture capitalists still chased the chance to invest in the next Facebook or Google. This has led to what AI critic Ed Zitron calls the “rot economy,” in which VCs overhype a series of digital technologies—the blockchain, then cryptocurrencies, then NFTs, and then the metaverse—promising the limitless growth of the early internet companies. According to Zitron, each of these innovations failed to either transform existing industries or become sustainable industries themselves, because the business case at the heart of these technologies was rotten, pushed forward by wasteful, bloated venture investments still selling an endless digital frontier of growth that no longer existed. Enter AGI, the proposed creation of an AI with an intelligence that dwarfs any single person’s and possibly the collective intelligence of humanity. Once AGI is built, we can easily solve many of the toughest challenges facing humanity: climate change, cancer, new net-zero energy sources. And no company has pushed the coming of AGI more than OpenAI, which has ridden the hype to incredible heights since its release of generative chatbot ChatGPT. Last year, OpenAI completed a blockbuster funding round, raising $6.6 billion at a valuation of $157 billion, making it the third most valuable startup in the world at the time after SpaceX and ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company. OpenAI, which released ChatGPT in November 2022, now sees 250 million weekly active users and about 11 million paying subscribers for its AI tools. The startup’s monthly revenue hit $300 million in August, up more than 1,700 percent since the start of 2023, and it expects to clear $3.7 billion for the year. By all accounts, this is another world-changing startup on a meteoric rise. Yet take a deeper look at OpenAI’s financial situation and expected future growth, and cracks begin to show. “Big Tech Incinerates Its Fortune,” in the style of Vincent van Gogh To start, OpenAI is burning money at an impressive but unsustainable pace. The latest funding round is its third in the last two years, atypical for a startup, that also included a $4 billion revolving line of credit—a loan on tap, essentially—on top of the $6.6 billion of equity, revealing an insatiable need for investor cash to survive. Despite $3.7 billion in sales this year, OpenAI expects to lose $5 billion due to the stratospheric costs of building and running generative AI models, which includes $4 billion in cloud computing to run their AI models, $3 billion in computing to train the next generation of models, and $1.5 billion for its staff. According to its own numbers, OpenAI loses $2 for every $1 it makes, a red flag for the sustainability of any business. Worse, these costs are expected to increase as ChatGPT gains users and OpenAI seeks to upgrade its foundation model from GPT-4 to GPT-5 sometime in the next six months. Financial documents reviewed by The Information confirm this trajectory as the startup predicts its annual losses will hit $14 billion by 2026. Further, OpenAI sees $100 billion in annual revenue—a number that would rival Nestlé and Target’s returns—as the point at which it will finally break even. For comparison, Google’s parent company, Alphabet, only cleared $100 billion in sales in 2021, 23 years after its founding, yet boasted a portfolio of money-making products, including Google Search, the Android operating system, Gmail, and cloud computing. OpenAI is deeply dependent on hypothetical breakthroughs from future models that unlock more capabilities to boost its subscription price and grow its user base. Its GPT-5 class models and beyond must pull godlike capacities for AI out of the algorithmic ether to create a user base of hundreds of millions of paid subscribers. Yet, with the release of the open-source DeepSeek R1 model earlier this month, OpenAI has no moat for its increasingly expensive products. The R1 matched its performance across math, chemistry, and coding tasks, independently learned OpenAI’s reasoning techniques, and can be downloaded, modified, and deployed for free. Why would people continue to pay $20, let alone the $200 tier OpenAI reserves for its latest, greatest models, rather than use something that can deliver the same performance at a 95 percent lower price? Venture capital funds, drunk on a decade of “growth at all costs,” have poured about $200 billion into generative AI. Wall Street asked itself the same question after the release of DeepSeek R1 and panicked, wiping more than 15 percent ($600 billion) off Nvidia’s stock price, the largest single-day loss for a company ever. And that’s not the only bad sign Altman received about OpenAI’s future. OpenAI is in talks again to raise more money (less than a year after raising $10 billion) at a proposed $340 billion valuation. In most cases, a startup doubling its valuation would be great news. But for OpenAI, the money may make things worse. It signals a desperate need for cash and puts more pressure on a company that today loses $2 for every dollar it makes. As Zitron pointed out, at $340 billion, few companies have the liquidity to acquire OpenAI, and public investors expect strong returns and profitability to justify an IPO anywhere near that price. Plus, the latest round of funding is being led by Masayoshi Son, a billionaire investor known more for losing money than making it. Given Son’s Vision Fund’s disastrous investing record, Zitron said, it’s as bearish a signal as you could find. Hanging over all this for OpenAI is the fact that Microsoft’s investments in the company, which run north of $10 billion, are not standard equity investments but “profit participation units” that will convert to debt in a year and a half. It’s not just OpenAI that’s burning through billions. Silicon Valley has hyped AI as the next internet or iPhone, and has invested like it cannot afford to miss out on the next big tech revolution. In 2021, with the last gasp of zero-interest-rate loans paired with trillions in COVID relief spending, venture capitalists poured a record $78.5 billion into the AI space. And, despite a broader slowdown in venture activity, the second quarter of 2024 set the record for quarterly venture investing in AI at $23.3 billion. In fact, 33 percent of VC portfolios are committed to AI, another worrying sign of concentration. … in the style of Hokusai Even so, Big Tech companies are the biggest spenders on AI. While VCs dropped approximately $200 billion into AI between 2021 and 2024, Big Tech is on pace to surpass that amount this year alone. According to Goldman Sachs research, cloud computing giants are expected to plow over $1 trillion over the next five years into graphics processing units (GPUs) and to build data centers to power generative AI. AI is an expensive technology like few before it. All those racks of GPUs and supercluster data centers need power, and the power industry is also embarking on a once-in-a-generation investment spree to keep up. The scale of expected data centers to power generative AI is difficult to wrap your head around. Oracle recently announced plans to build a gigawatt-scale data center just for AI, powered by a trio of nuclear reactors, while OpenAI pitched the White House on the necessity of five-gigawatt data centers, which would be enough power for about three million homes consumed by a single AI data center. A recent report from McKinsey expects the electricity going to fuel AI data centers will triple from 3 to 4 percent of the country’s electricity to 11 to 12 percent by 2030. The power industry typically grows 2 to 3 percent a year, far too little to meet the predicted jump in demand. McKinsey estimates that power utilities would have to spend $500 billion on top of their planned capital expenditure to keep up with AI needs. If true, this presents a serious bottleneck for not just OpenAI but the expected growth of the AI industry. Between VCs, Big Tech, and power utilities, the bill for generative AI comes out to close to $2 trillion in spending over the next five years alone. Adding all this up, some are starting to question the economic fundamentals of generative AI. Jim Covello, head of global equity research at Goldman Sachs, doubts the technology can recoup what’s been invested as, unlike the internet, it fails to solve complex business problems at a lower cost than what’s available today. Plus, he argues, the most expensive inputs for generative AI, GPUs and energy, are unlikely to decline meaningfully for the tech industry over time, given how far demand outstrips supply for both. While AI-fueled coding could definitely boost productivity, it’s hard to see how it could become a multitrillion-dollar industry. Surveys confirm that for many workers, AI tools like ChatGPT reduce their productivity by increasing the volume of content and steps needed to complete a given task, and by frequently introducing errors that have to be checked and corrected. A study by Uplevel Data Labs tracked 800 software engineers using Copilot on GitHub and found no measurable increase in coding productivity, despite this exact use case being the one pointed to the most by AI companies. And even productivity gains may come at a cost: Microsoft researchers concluded that workers became more productive using generative AI tools but their critical thinking skills declined, presumably because they were offloading the thinking to AI. Looking past the hype, the business case for generative AI two years after the stunning success of ChatGPT appears weaker by the day. … in the style of Jacob Lawrence Even worse, as AI expert Gary Marcus pointed out, DeepSeek’s R1 model spells serious trouble for OpenAI and the cloud giants. The only way OpenAI could hope to recoup the billions it was spending on GPUs to train bigger and bigger models was to maintain a large enough technical lead over other AI companies to justify charging up to $200 for paid subscriptions to its models. That lead just vaporized and was given to the entire industry for free. In response, Altman has already twice cut the prices of his subscriptions in an effort to stay competitive. But without millions of paid subscriptions, it’s difficult to see the pathway to profitability for a company that loses $2 for every $1 it brings in and expects costs to continue to grow approximately tenfold in five years. OpenAI has set $100 billion as its break-even point, which would require it to increase its revenue by a factor of 25 in just five years, an incredible feat of scale that its current business model does not justify. OpenAI is, however, the perfect kind of growth-at-all-costs story investors need to think still exists—capable of not only achieving Meta- or Amazon-like growth again, but becoming an indispensable part of growth and innovation in every industry in the future, too. No industry could escape, and software would close its jaws around the world, finally, as Marc Andreessen predicted in 2011. For his part, Gary Marcus has taken to calling OpenAI the WeWork of AI—WeWork, of course, is the poster boy for wasteful, nearly fraudulent, growth-at-all-costs investing that led to a spectacular downfall. Marcus is so confident current approaches cannot take us to the promised land of AGI that he bet Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei $100,000 that AGI would not be achieved by the end of 2027. Without AGI, the valuations of leading AI startups like OpenAI ($340 billion) and Anthropic ($61.5 billion) stop making sense. If GPUs are no longer the most capital-efficient or effective way to build better AI models, then the expected AI computing “supercycle” that the hundreds of billions in capital expenditure is premised on never arrives. Instead, the underlying asset bubble of a multitrillion-dollar bet on GPUs as the necessary component to an internet-like era of growth vanishes into thin air. For many workers, AI tools reduce their productivity by increasing the volume of steps needed to complete a given task. OpenAI’s incredible burn rate, the trillions in capital expenditure by cloud giants and utilities to build out the infrastructure necessary to support AI, the supply bottlenecks ahead from the power and semiconductor industries, and the questionable economic gains from these tools all point to a generative AI bubble. Should the bubble burst, startups and venture funds alike face possible extinction, and a big enough drop from the Magnificent Seven could spark skittish markets to panic, leading to wider economic contagion, given how dependent on the growth of the top technology companies the public markets have become. In 2024, the Magnificent Seven were responsible for the lion’s share of the growth of the S&P 500, with the returns of the other 493 companies flat. When Nvidia hit its peak valuation of $3 trillion over the summer, just five of the seven—Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Amazon—accounted for 29 percent of the total index’s value, surpassing the concentration of the five top technology companies just before the dot-com crash. Nvidia has been on an incredible bull run over the last five years, its shares gaining a dizzying 4,300 percent, reminiscent of how network equipment maker Cisco grew about 4,500 percent in the five years leading up to its peak just before the dot-com crash in 2000. Nvidia and the other Magnificent Seven members are in a codependent relationship when it comes to AI hype. They are Nvidia’s biggest customers, feeding the bull run by pushing demand for GPUs beyond even what chipmaker TSMC can supply. At the moment, Nvidia can pass those prices on to their customers, the only clusters big enough for AI computing. But should demand for AI fall, all seven will tumble with it. … in the style of Roy Lichtenstein For the tech industry, DeepSeek is a threat to its incredible bull run because it proved three things. First, frontier AI models could be trained much more cheaply and efficiently than the current Silicon Valley approach of building massive models requiring hundreds of thousands of GPUs to train. From a capital perspective, the U.S. strategy is wasteful, relying on at least ten times the investment to make similar model progress. Second, DeepSeek showed you could train a state-of-the-art model without the latest GPUs, calling into question the current demand for the latest GPUs that is so hot customers have been facing delays of six months to a year to get their hands on them. Finally, the high valuations of leading AI startups depend on a technical lead in their models to charge prices anywhere near what they need to recoup their computing costs, but that technical lead, enabled by a combination of closed-source models, billions in capital expenditure, and export controls blocking Chinese companies like DeepSeek from accessing the latest GPUs, is gone. Should demand for GPUs fall or even not hit the exponential increases the billions invested are betting on, the bubble will pop. Given the stock market’s dependence on tech companies for growth, the trigger may not come from the AI industry itself, but any pullback in spending will crater the current trajectory of the AI industry. Many potential triggers abound: a crypto crash; President Trump’s trade wars with Canada, Mexico, and China; the stated goal to cut more than $1 trillion of government spending by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency; or a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, where nearly 70 percent of the world’s advanced computer chips are manufactured. You can tell Wall Street is worried about a bubble, because Nvidia is hit the hardest by any bearish AI news, and even when the market panic has nothing to do with the tech industry, like when the Japan currency trade happened last summer, the Magnificent Seven suffer punishing losses. The AI bubble wobbles more precariously by the day. Some bubbles, like that of the dot-com crash, end up being positive in the long run, despite the short-term economic pain of it bursting. But some, like the 2008 housing bubble, leave permanent scars on the economy and can knock an entire industry off its growth trajectory for years. To date, the U.S. housing industry has not recovered to pre-2008 growth trend lines, a major contributor to the housing crisis gripping the U.S. That is the fire that the tech industry is playing with today. This is not the Silicon Valley of lore. Venture investors, for all their tech manifestos celebrating “little tech” and entrepreneurship, have come to resemble more traditional financial firms, raising money from pension funds, hedge funds, and sovereign wealth funds. Silicon Valley has gone corporate and managerial; even private equity invests in the Valley today. The fusion of venture capital and Wall Street threatens to bring the unbridled speculation of unregulated finance and the breathless tech industry hype together in a single, massive bubble. Inimical to the old ethos of the Valley and emblematic of a bloated, rotten investing strategy, in Silicon Valley now the money chases founders rather than founders chasing money. Maybe, after the fallout of the AI bubble is felt and the sun sets on Silicon Valley for a bit, the tech world can do a hard reset and return to its more innovative days again.

POSTED BY Amanda Coopersmith RELATED READING Nick Schäferhoff Ben Sailer Ready to build your first website but confused by the technical lingo? In this post, we’ll provide a glossary of terms you might encounter as you build a website. We recommend bookmarking this page for easy reference—like a pocket dictionary you can return to whenever you encounter an unfamiliar term. We’ll focus on WordPress websites throughout, but most of the principles and definitions apply to websites built on any platform. Every website requires a few key technical components. Understanding what each does can help you choose the right location for your site and evaluate different providers. Your site must be stored on physical servers through a website host. Hosting is essentially your site’s place of residence on the internet. Managed hosting (like the hosting plans we have on WordPress.com!) is often an ideal choice for website owners because they take on an active role in running your website. In the case of WordPress.com, we take care of your server setup and the day-to-day management of your website, including security, uptime, and software updates, all for one flat price. A domain is a website’s address, like mygroovywebsite.com. Like physical addresses, every website must have a unique domain name. Domain prices vary depending on the web extension (like .com, .net, .org) and which domain provider you choose, and you can use a domain lookup tool to see what domains are currently available. WordPress.com offers affordable domains with over 350 different domain extensions and averaging just $13/year! Similar to domains, URLs are the specific page addresses for your web pages. URLs are a version of your domain with added information that tells your computer which page to load. So if a website’s homepage is mygroovywebsite.com, subpages have additional path information, like mygroovywebsite.com/about, which would load the website’s about page. Permalinks are permanent URLs that point to a specific piece of content (you can update your default permalink structure on a WordPress site with just a few clicks), while slugs are part of the URL that identifies a specific page (like “about” in our example above). A content delivery network, or CDN, hosts your website on a system of distributed servers instead of one individual server. By utilizing location-specific servers, a CDN improves site speed by delivering content from a server that’s geographically closer to your visitors. Multiple servers also create redundancy, ensuring your site works even when you have a lot of visitors or if a server goes down. All WordPress.com plans have a CDN, powered by 28+ data centers across 6 continents, that puts your content as close to your visitors as possible. An XML sitemap is a list of all of the crawlable URLs on your website so that search engines (like Google) can index and show them in search results. A sitemap helps search engines better understand your site’s structure and how your content is related. A CMS is a tool that helps you build and manage a website without needing to code it from scratch. It provides a user-friendly interface to make it easy to build pages, write posts, and share other content. What is the most popular CMS in the world? WordPress! “Code” is a computer-readable direction written in programming languages. Even if you use a CMS like WordPress to build your site, there’s still a bunch of code running behind the scenes to make everything work and run smoothly. There are many programming languages, but some that you’ll most commonly see when working with WordPress are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) defines the content structure of your website. Think of this as a computer-readable version of your website that includes all the page’s core content, including titles, text, lists, buttons, and images. HTML uses “tags” to define each of these building blocks of your website, like <H1> for top-level headings and <p> for paragraphs. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) defines the style of your website. It is a design reference glossary for the browser, indicating what fonts, colors, sizes, and other elements to use when displaying your website. The cool thing about CSS is that your site updates automatically everywhere when you change a style in your glossary. For example, if you have an <H1> primary header tag in your HTML, the computer will look to the CSS to see what <H1> headers should look like. The CSS might define an <H1> as Arial font, bolded, and 36 pixels. Anywhere that the computer sees the <H1> on your website, it will show that text in Arial font, bolded, and 36 pixels. JavaScript controls the interactive elements of your website that move or change on your otherwise static web pages. JavaScript runs on the user’s side to create animations, popups, banners, alerts, and more. For example, you might use JavaScript to alert users if they didn’t properly fill out a form or to change the screen once they submit it to show them that their response has been received. PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is similar to JavaScript in that it “makes things happen” in real-time on your website. One big difference with PHP is that it runs “server-side,” meaning it changes data or dynamically updates a page’s content before it loads for visitors. PHP is an open source programming language and the language that powers the WordPress software. Metadata helps search engines identify what kind of content is on your website. This allows search engines to know when your website is relevant to someone searching the web for specific information. A title tag is an HTML element used by both search engines and visitors to understand what your webpage is about. Usually, this is the same as the post or page’s headline or title. Meta descriptions are short paragraphs (ideally 120 to 160 characters) that offer additional information to engines about your content. These often include important keywords and phrases. These descriptions may appear in search engine results, so it’s important to write strong, clear descriptions to make your website shine. Schema markup is computer-readable information added to your site’s code to identify different types of content on your webpage. This helps search engines better understand your site’s purpose. Schema markup improves site SEO, contributing important information for search engine snippets and AI-powered search results. For example, recipe plugins provide search engines with this kind of markup, enabling them to showcase recipes in search results with extra details such as images, ingredients, and cook times. Your website’s navigation elements define how site visitors move across your website. You will likely use a variety of navigation elements across your site to meet the specific goals of each page. Your menu is the primary navigation tool for your website, linking to its high-level sections. Menu options may vary depending on your template, including primary navigation menus in your header and footer, sidebar menus from specific pages, and dropdown submenus. “Hamburger menus” are common on mobile views, where detailed headers can take up too much space. These menus are hidden inside a button instead of always being visible in the header. Links are clickable text that take the site visitor to another page. They may direct users to another page on your site (internal links) or an external website (external links). They also help search engines better understand the importance of your site pages—when a page has many relevant links that allow users to navigate to it, search engines will understand that it is a valuable page on your site. Site breadcrumbs show users the “path” they took to reach their current page. For example, on a blog, a user may go from Home > Category > Blog Post. Breadcrumbs are useful on sites with many layers of interconnected pages like stores, forums, or Wikis. Buttons are clickable visual elements that encourage users to take a specific action or navigate to a specific page. A site usually has three “levels” of buttons, with the primary buttons being the biggest and brightest, followed by secondary and tertiary buttons for less important navigation items. Buttons should be strategically placed on your pages to nudge visitors to the most important content or action, such as your storefront or blog. Sharing buttons enable site visitors to easily share content from your website on other platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, or Pinterest. They are a great way to promote your content cross-platform and build your following organically. Sharing buttons are included for free on WordPress.com with Jetpack. The website header is the content at the top of every page. This section usually includes your logo, site name, tagline, and top-level site navigation (your menu!). The footer is the bottom section of your site, visible below your content on every page. It can contain additional information such as website copyright, contact forms, newsletter subscription boxes, physical addresses, social media links, or lower-priority navigation items like your privacy policy or refund policy. Your website content is what makes your website unique. Whether you are a blogger or a virtual store, your content helps you to create a personalized presence on the web. Your website’s text or copy is anything you write or customize, from menu labels to page titles, blog posts, about pages, and more. Want to learn how to write truly excellent blog copy? Use this blueprint. High-quality and relevant images are an essential part of any website. You can use your own high-quality images, license images through a stock image company, get free unlicensed imagery from sites like Pexels, or generate images with tools like Jetpack AI. Check out our WordPress image size guide to ensure your images are optimized for the web. Videos are widely used on websites because they’re often more engaging than static images. If you have a WordPress site, you can use the YouTube block to easily embed YouTube-hosted videos on your posts or pages. You can also upload your videos directly onto your site. WordPress.com offers 4K video hosting with VideoPress on the Premium plan and above. Sandwiched between your header and footer is your main page. Regardless of the page content or layout, many pages have a few standard parts. Your headline, known in HTML lingo as the <H1>, describes what your page is about; this could be something short like “About” or more specific, like the title of your blog post. You should only ever have one <H1> on a webpage. A website tagline, similar to a brand tagline, is a short, memorable phrase that explains your site’s purpose. Site taglines are usually displayed in the site header next to or under the site title or logo, in search engine results, and in social media blocks. The body content is the meat of your webpage, located between the header and footer. It is specific to each page and includes all of its content elements, such as text, images, and videos. WordPress makes it incredibly easy to add different kinds of content to your posts or pages with its block editor. There are many different blocks that come standard with any WordPress site, allowing you to customize your content exactly how you want. Website pages can vary depending on your site’s purpose, but we recommend a few standard page types for every site. Your homepage is the first page people will visit on your site, so it’s key that it is visually appealing, explains who you are and what you do, and directs visitors to other important pages across your site. Businesses use product or service pages to explain their products and provide pricing. These pages vary in complexity, from simple text lists to full ecommerce stores. Some product and service pages are purely informational; others are interactive, allowing users to purchase products directly from the page. An about page tells your site’s story, whether you’re an individual or a business. This should cover who, what, and why—that is who you are, what you do, and why you do it. You may include your personal or company history, awards or accolades, brand values, and individual or team biographies. Your contact page is where site visitors can find information on how to reach you, whether they want to schedule a meeting, contact you via email, or visit a physical location. This can be a simple text page or include forms, maps, and scheduling tools. A 404 error page alerts visitors if they are trying to visit a web URL that won’t load because the page they’re trying to access doesn’t exist. Users may see a 404 if they mistype a URL or try to access a page that you haven’t created on your site. For example, they may try to go to example.com/about-me when your about page URL is actually example.com/about. You may want to optimize your 404 page to provide assistance to anyone who accidentally sees it with a search bar and links to helpful pages on your site. For many personal and professional websites, the blog is the heart of your site: this is where you will regularly create and post new content. Unlike standard web pages, a blog is designed for easy, ongoing publishing, engagement, and sharing. Need to start a blog? Check out our 12-step guide. A post is a piece of content on your blog. Posts can include text, photos, and videos, but they also have unique elements like status, publish date, author, tags, and categories. These elements enable better navigation, search, and sorting. Posts can be structured in many different ways, but there are a few common types of posts, including lists, how-tos, personal stories, case studies, features, interviews, product reviews, and news articles. Categories help you catalog and sort your blog posts. Categories split your content into a few high-level buckets. Categories should be broad enough to organize all of your posts but specific enough to be meaningful to your readers. Category pages serve as an archive for all content grouped together under a specific category. Similarly, tags group posts together, but they’re more specific ways to describe your content. For example, you may have a “Movies” category and “Adventure,” “Rom-Com,” “Horror,” and “Sci-Fi” tags. You can use multiple tags on a single post, but to avoid clutter and to ensure your tags are useful for finding relevant content, you should only add tags for keywords that recur frequently across your website. There are a variety of reasons people may want to reach out to you through your website. Contact information—whether it’s a public email address, physical address, or form—is an important aspect of any website. You’ll also want to ensure that you have ways for visitors to stay in the loop with what you’re up to. Whether you’re sending out a regular newsletter to your subscribers or sharing your content on social media, content sharing is a key component of a sustainable brand. Contact forms allow website owners to receive messages—like questions, service requests, or feedback—without sharing their email addresses publicly. Visitors put their contact information and requests into a contact form, and the submitted form information is securely forwarded to an email address of your choosing. There are many contact form plugins available, and the Form block is free to use for WordPress.com users with Jetpack. Newsletter signup forms allow site visitors to sign up for your newsletter. These forms have inputs for a visitor’s email address and sometimes their name, and then this information is added to your mailing list. Subscribe blocks are available out-of-the-box for sites hosted on WordPress.com. Plugins are also available for third-party newsletter providers. Social media integrations allow you to connect your blog to your social media platforms. Once these integrations are in place, you can easily pass content back and forth between your website and your social media platforms, posting directly from your blog to your social media sites or embedding your social media feeds directly on your website. An ecommerce website sells goods or services online. WooCommerce, an open source plugin, is a sister company to WordPress.com. This plugin adds key ecommerce features like product pages, shopping carts, and payment processing to your site. Checkout carts are virtual shopping carts that allow visitors to select or save products they want to buy in one place. Checkout carts enable users to keep track of their items and buy multiple products in one transaction. In order for site visitors to be able to make a payment online, you need to use a payment processing software to securely accept credit card information and finalize payments. For sites hosted on WordPress.com, you can easily collect payments through Stripe, the Paid Content block, and PayPal. WordPress websites have their own internal language for different aspects of your site. If you use WordPress as your CMS or WordPress.com for hosting, these terms will help you better understand the tool and all that’s possible with it. WordPress themes are professionally designed templates that you can install and customize. Themes make it simple to start with a base design you really love to then make your own with fonts, colors, images, text, and layouts. WordPress.com has many different themes available to suit every website’s needs and visual style, including free themes and paid third-party themes. You can also install your own third-party themes on the Business plan and above. Plugins are like apps for your website—they extend your site’s functionality and features. The WordPress plugin library offers free and paid plugins for security, SEO, marketing, forms, and more. All WordPress.com users receive free essential functionality through the Jetpack plugin, with additional Jetpack features available at higher tiers. Third-party plugins can be added to sites on the Business plan and above. Patterns are professionally designed page layouts for commonly used web pages, like about pages, photo galleries, storefronts, and contact pages. Patterns use a series of WordPress blocks to build eye-catching layouts that are easy to customize. Blocks (aptly named) are the building blocks of your WordPress website. Blocks are drag-and-drop elements that you can add to any post or page. There are around a hundred unique block types available for text, media, formatting, embedded content, theme-specific designs, forms, and more, with new block types added regularly. With WordPress.com, you get even more with Jetpack-enabled block types. Site backups save previous versions of your website so that you can easily revert your site if something breaks. This can be useful when adding or updating plugins or updating your WordPress version or theme. WordPress.com offers backups with VaultPress on the Business plan and above. Web security is essential to ensure that both your data and your visitors’ data are protected. Security features include general site security to verify your website and block phishing or spam attacks, user-based permissions, and domain privacy to protect your personal data. One benefit of using a managed hosting provider like WordPress.com is that many core security features—like automatic updates, SSL certificates, firewall protection, brute force attack prevention, downtime monitoring, and vulnerability scanning—come included, providing peace of mind for non-technical professionals. The Reader is an aggregator from WordPress.com that compiles content from Jetpack-enabled WordPress sites. Your Reader feed will show every post from the blogs you follow in one place.

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team Contributor. META Stock Meta Platforms stock (NASDAQ:META) price surged 4% on Monday, March 24, following reports that the Trump administration might refrain from imposing sector-specific tariffs on April 2. [1] At its current price point of around $620, META stock presents an attractive investment opportunity. Our comprehensive analysis evaluates the stock through multiple critical lenses: growth potential, profitability, financial stability, and resilience during market downturns. After a detailed examination of Meta Platforms' recent operational performance and financial health, we find the company demonstrates exceptional strength across key metrics. Despite its seemingly elevated valuation, the underlying fundamentals suggest significant potential for investors. Our assessment reveals a robust financial framework that positions META as a compelling investment choice, supported by its consistent performance and strategic market positioning. The detailed evaluation considers not just surface-level metrics, but a holistic view of the company’s operational capabilities, financial robustness, and capacity to navigate challenging market conditions. This in-depth analysis underpins our confidence in META's investment potential. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, META stock looks slightly expensive compared to the broader market. Meta Platforms' Revenues have grown considerably over recent years. Meta Platforms’ profit margins are considerably higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. Meta Platforms' balance sheet looks very strong. META stock has been more resilient than the benchmark S&P 500 index during one of the two recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. In summary, Meta Platforms' performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: • Growth: Extremely Strong • Profitability: Extremely Strong • Financial Stability: Extremely Strong • Downturn Resilience: Strong • Overall: Very Strong Overall, despite the stock's elevated valuation, META remains an attractive investment opportunity, bolstered by its strong underlying performance. The company's strategic AI investments are beginning to yield tangible results, particularly in driving user engagement across its platforms. Meta’s core revenue model remains firmly anchored in advertising across its extensive app ecosystem, including Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp. By strategically deploying artificial intelligence, the company is not only refining its ad targeting capabilities but also exploring innovative AI-powered content generation technologies. These initiatives position Meta to potentially unlock new revenue streams and enhance its competitive advantage in the rapidly evolving digital advertising landscape. The convergence of AI technology with Meta’s robust user base and established advertising infrastructure suggests promising growth potential. While it doesn’t look like there is much upside to META stock, the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid- and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: 2025: The Year Of The Layoffs?

ByWinnie Sun ByWinnie Sun Contributor. WASHINGTON, DC - MARCH 9: White House Senior Advisor Elon Musk walks to the White House after ... More landing in Marine One on the South Lawn with U.S. President Donald Trump (not pictured) on March 9, 2025 in Washington, DC. Trump was returning to the White House after spending the weekend at Mar-a-Lago, his private club in Florida. (Photo by Samuel Corum/Getty Images) It’s only the first quarter of the year but already layoffs are making financial headlines. Tens of thousands — and more each day — of traditionally secure government employees are finding themselves with a pending layoff. As someone who has worked with employees of varying businesses and entities for over two decades, here are my valuable tips on what to do if you’re facing a job loss. Meet DOGE: Department of Governmental Efficiency? Or Dismissals, Outsourcing, and General Exits? According to a recent Forbes article and the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Office of Personnel Management, government job cuts reported across multiple federal agencies number more than 35,000. They include more than 5,000 from the Department of Education, 4,000 from the Department of Energy, 3,500 from the Department of Transportation, more than 5,000 from the IRS, tens of thousands more expected from the Department of Defense. More than 15,000 federal contractors also have been cut. Taken together, they represent a federal workforce decline of 2.5% in the first quarter of 2025, according to the federal Office of Personnel Management. The cuts stem from efforts to streamline government operations and a spending cap agreement passed by Congress. Know that private-sector layoffs are happening, too: According to BLS, Layoffs.fyi, Bloomberg and various company reports, there are plenty of job cuts in the private sector. Some examples: Google (Alphabet Inc) shed 12,000 positions; Amazon, 18,000; Citigroup, 6,500; Walmart, 7,000; Disney, 5,500; Ford, 4,200; Warner Bros. Discovery, 2,000-plus; Paramount Global, 1,800. Job cuts across all industries in the first two months of this year totaled more than 250,000. Unemployment claims rose 12% since January, according to the BLS Weekly Unemployment Report. Be aware that laid-off workers usually are entitled to severance pay and benefits: Federal government employees may receive up to one week of pay per year worked, while private workers are entitled to an average weekly state benefit of $450. The amount varies by state but is typically 40% to 50% of your previous salary for up to 26 weeks. Apply right away because it can take two to four weeks to start receiving benefits. Find your state’s unemployment application portal: U.S. Department of Labor. Explore options for health insurance after job loss: COBRA programs allow a laid off worker to continue for up to 18 months on an employer’s health insurance plan but it’s expensive because the worker must assume the full share of the monthly premium. A better bet might be the marketplace plans offered under the federal Affordable Health Care Act. You can explore the possibilities at Healthcare.gov. The best option, if available, is to join a spouse’s company health care plan. If your income drops drastically, you may qualify for free or low-cost coverage through Medicaid. (Check eligibility through your state’s health department.) Review your 401k, Pension, Company Stock and your employee benefits to be aware of what you own ... More before you face the unexpected layoff. Schedule a meeting with a Sun Group Wealth Partners financial advisor today. Understand severance benefits: If you receive a layoff package from your employer, study the details for severance pay, unused personal time payout, stock options, and other possible benefits. Check into pension and retirement savings plans. Use any unused sick days and wellness benefits before your last day on the job. Negotiate if possible, as some employers may offer more severance, extended healthcare or a delayed layoff date. If you have a health savings account, know that you can use your balance for medical expenses even after leaving the job. Do budgeting and gather emergency savings: Cut non-essential spending (subscriptions, dining out, luxuries). Prioritize debt payments and contact lenders to see if you can get a payment deferment or a lower interest rate. Use emergency savings wisely and avoid withdrawing from retirement accounts unless absolutely necessary. Evaluate your financial situation, including amount of debt, amount of savings and all your monthly expenses. If you have time before your job ends, beef up your savings while you still are getting a paycheck. If you own a home, consider taking out a home equity line of credit while you are still employed. See your financial planner for ideas to help bulk up your emergency fund. Begin your job search and networking skills: Update your resume and LinkedIn profile with relevant skills. Reach out to former colleagues for job leads and referrals. Consider gig work, freelancing, or remote jobs for immediate income. Explore upskilling and career pivoting: Enroll in online courses to gain new skills (LinkedIn Learning, Coursera). Consider high-growth job sectors (AI, cybersecurity, healthcare, renewable energy). Explore federal retraining programs available to laid-off government employees (DOL Workforce Programs). Conference speakers handshaking after presentation at the convention center Prepare mentally for the change that comes with a layoff: Stay positive and proactive. Layoffs are often not personal but are done for economic reasons. Set daily goals–for the number of job applications filed, time for networking and for building new skills. Seek emotional support from family, friends or support groups as you navigate your transition. Learn a bit more about DOGE: Created by an executive order shortly after President Donald Trump took office, the Department of Government Efficiency brings a new, controversial wrinkle to a broader effort to reorganize government and cut costs. The initiative to restructure and modernize technology aligns with ongoing federal layoffs as part of this effort. The U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organization is intended to exist until July 4, 2026, to execute the 18-month modernization agenda. Every federal agency and department was required to create a DOGE team to lead its restructuring cost-cutting efforts. Know the options for laid-off federal employees: They can use the Career Transition Assistance Program for priority job placement.

Title: Trump Is Selling American Democracy to the Highest Bidder

Time Published: 2025-03-25T10:00:00Z

Even the Easter Bunny is for sale now: The Trump administration has turned the White House’s annual Easter Egg Roll, which dates back to the presidency of Rutherford B. Hayes, into an opportunity for corporate sponsorship. Bidding options range from $75,000 to $200,000. If you’re willing to pay enough, you can also score tickets to brunch with the first lady. “This is an enterprise,” one of the planners told CNN. “This is not your grandmother’s Easter Egg Roll, where people lined up outside the gate and go and roll an egg and get a little gift bag and walk out.” This is the latest, and perhaps silliest, example that Donald Trump is selling his presidency to the highest bidder. By the end of his second term, we may well be living in the United States of Big Mac and Diet Coke, our nation’s ideals reduced to branding opportunities. The sponsored Easter Egg Roll won’t be the first time that Trump has used the White House grounds to cater to corporations. He hosted a Tesla infomercial on the White House lawn earlier this month to help out his buddy Elon Musk, whose electric vehicle company is suffering from weak sales, a plummeting stock price, and embarrassing recalls. But I suppose it was the least Trump could do for someone who put $288 million into making him president again. We knew this was coming because Trump told us so. During the 2024 campaign, he wasn’t shy about making demands of corporations. He let the oil and gas industry know in no uncertain terms that he expected them to furnish him with $1 billion for his campaign. He took in over $10 million from crypto groups and, unsurprisingly, has since been extraordinarily friendly toward that industry, promoting the idea of a “crypto strategic reserve” that would open the country up to all the volatility of digital currencies without producing any discernible benefits beyond those that would go to his backers. Trump made sure to make a killing for himself too, in the crypto market, with both him and Melania releasing their own meme coins right before he took office. From day one of Trump’s administration, it was clear that ethical considerations would take a back seat to financial ones, resulting in a pay-to-play atmosphere. He sold inaugural seats for $1 million “donations” (an extortion racket, really), reserving the best spots at the Capitol ceremony for a line of billionaires and corporate heads, indicating—literally and symbolically—that they will be the ones in the front row for the next four years. It’s easy to sell your soul to the highest bidder when you’re an empty shell. Trump’s nature has always been transactional. His supporters view this as an asset: Because Trump stands for nothing, they believe, he won’t be influenced by ideological concerns and instead will make the best deals he can for the nation. What they don’t see is that the nation will always come second to Trump himself and that he’ll quickly sell out our collective future for his personal present. They also miss that money—with the possible exception of acts of vengeance—will always be Trump’s primary motivator, meaning that the welfare of the poor, care for the elderly, and the preservation of lives through programs like USAID will always take a back seat to corporate profits. So will the fate of Eastern Europe. Will America continue to support Ukraine? It depends on how much they’re willing to give us as far as natural resources. Teslas can’t run on spilt blood, after all. Rather than make decisions based on sound reasoning, evidence, and morality, Trump will always do what’s best for his own pockets and those of his billionaire pals. Though he’d initially supported a ban on TikTok, he suddenly reversed himself after winning the election, declaring that he no longer sees the company as a major security threat. It just might have had something to do with the fact that Jeff Yass, a major Trump supporter and by far the top Republican donor last cycle, has a stake in the app’s parent company, ByteDance. It also didn’t hurt that TikTok execs were putting up money and throwing parties for the Trump inauguration. The same holds true for Trump’s immigration policies. While the administration is trying to strike fear into undocumented workers, ending asylum programs, selling off Venezuelans to work in El Salvador’s notorious prison system, violating basic human rights in its treatment of Colombians, canceling the CHNV program for over half a million Latinos looking to become American citizens, and preparing a brand-new “travel ban” to target immigrants from predominantly Black and Muslim countries, Trump has somehow found it in his heart to welcome certain immigrants—those willing to pay $5 million for a visa “gold card.” He’s even suggested calling it the “Trump card,” which is fitting not only because it would allow Russian oligarchs to jump the line but because it also symbolizes the special privilege he’s had throughout his life. Forget “Give me your tired, your poor / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.” Now it’s “Give me your money, your gold, your stock options, and I’ll get you in.” If only Mahmoud Khalil was filthy rich, he might not be in ICE custody right now. You see, free speech also carries a price tag. For Columbia University, the price is evidently $400 million, which Trump withheld until the university agreed to become a Big Brother state wherein students will be constantly watched for any sign they disagree with the administration. Those students are learning a very severe lesson: Money talks, and you had better keep your mouth shut until you have it. In fairness, the Columbia charade shows that Trump isn’t the only person who thinks that everything is for sale. Like Columbia, other universities are also falling in line, staying quiet even though a recent survey found that 94 percent of university leaders felt Trump is a threat to academic freedom. They’re putting dollars before decency, cents before sense. It’s not just a selling out of principles. It’s a selling out of the American Idea—the elevation of financial considerations above all else. Once we buy into the notion that everything is transactional and that money represents the total value and true meaning of all that we see, we lose our moral compass—which may be what Trump is counting on. We also don’t know where exactly this ends. One has to wonder whether the White House itself could soon be branded. Why not make the Green Room produce some green by renaming it the Amazon Room? Jeff Bezos might be willing to pony up another $40 million for a second Melania documentary if that’s thrown in as a sweetener. Or perhaps the State Dining Room can be brought to us by Uber Eats. Certainly, it’s a shock that the China Room hasn’t been renamed already. We may be just a single payment away from Trump insisting that we all start calling porcelain plates “Brazil” or “Azerbaijan.” Google would have to go through and change its algorithm to reflect it in search results, as they did with their maps for “Gulf of America.” Remember, this is a man who named one of his children after a luxury jewelry brand. And right now, he’s branding all of us. Who winds up a winner or loser will depend on what we have to offer. For the poor, the disabled, members of the LGBTQ+ community, liberals, and people who don’t view the purpose of life as to make as much money as possible, we’ll find ourselves completely expendable. The same can be said for our democratic institutions. Anything that isn’t making a profit for the corporate class is on DOGE’s chopping block, no matter how many people it helps or what good it does in the world. Freedom is not free. We’ll pay a heavy price for Trump’s selling out of America. Ross Rosenfeld is a political writer and educator who lives on Long Island. Follow him on Substack.

Title: The tech industry is souring on Trump

Even conservative executives are fed up with tariffs, DOGE, and "crypto bro schemes." Two months into Donald Trump's second term, conservative leaders in the tech industry — some of whom are advising the administration — are in a state of turmoil. They are bristling at how the president's chaotic governing, unusual even by the standards of Trump 1.0, is making it increasingly difficult to run their companies. "None of my friends who voted for Trump are happy right now. Everyone is annoyed," says Reggie James, the founder of Eternal, a new-media company backed by Andreessen Horowitz. "When tech people got involved in the government, they thought Trump was going to take more of a surgical approach and act less like a wrecking ball." Several Silicon Valley executives I spoke to — some of whom requested anonymity for fear of retribution — echoed this sense of disappointment, in particular at the havoc the Department of Government Efficiency has wreaked throughout the federal government. "We were all on board for a more business-friendly presidency, but in the end, the whole industry of crypto and AI got rug pulled," says the partner of a top-tier venture firm directly involved in the Trump administration. "The people surrounding Trump are all scamsters. They are getting rich off our votes, our dollars, and our time." While the tech industry at large remains relatively liberal, especially among rank-and-file employees, many influential players warmed to Trump in recent years. They include high-profile venture capital firms like Andreessen Horowitz and Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, the hosts of the popular tech podcast "All-In," as well as billionaire CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos, who donated to and had prime seating at Trump's second inauguration. But in recent weeks — amid herky-jerky tariffs, mass government layoffs, and a shaky stock market — some influential pro-Trump players are growing impatient and disenchanted. The consternation is especially pitched among startup founders, many of whom are bracing for an economic downturn. "There is a lot of uncertainty right now, and it makes people nervous," says Sara Mauskopf, the founder of the venture-backed childcare marketplace provider Winnie. Many founders, she says, are deeply worried over whether "they're going to be able to raise funding." Others are exasperated with what they see as unscrupulous dealings with cryptocurrencies. The tech industry itself has a fraught relationship with crypto: Investors were burned by Sam Bankman-Fried's fraudulent FTX, and many tech leaders regard cryptocurrencies as Ponzi schemes with little functional value that stain the tech industry at large. Where the Biden administration took a hard-line approach to crypto, Trump has enthusiastically embraced the crypto community. Days before he was inaugurated, he launched $Trump coin, a memecoin that reached a market cap of $14.5 billion before immediately plunging in value; today, it hovers at $2 billion. As president, Trump has appointed the venture capitalist and "All-In" cohost David Sacks as the country's "crypto czar," hosted a Crypto Summit at the White House, pardoned the Silk Road founder and crypto folk hero Ross Ulbricht from serving double life sentences, and signed an executive order establishing a strategic bitcoin reserve and US digital asset stockpile. On X, the Palantir cofounder and vocal Trump supporter Joe Lonsdale compared creating a digital currency reserve with taxpayer dollars to theft: "It's wrong to steal my money for grift on the left; it's also wrong to tax me for crypto bro schemes," he wrote. Lonsdale told me over email that he objects to the administration naming individual coins in "a way that moved markets and meant people could trade them ahead of time." The executive branch, he said, shouldn't be in the business of "picking winners and losers." "The crypto stuff smells weird," says a venture capitalist who is a major backer of conservative news networks. "Both AI and crypto are fields that require a specialized, technical skill set, and just because David Sacks is a podcaster doesn't mean he's qualified in AI or crypto." That same venture capitalist who is advising the Trump administration also claims that crypto founders are using their proximity to Trump for personal gain. Steve Witkoff, for instance, a longtime Trump associate who was appointed as the United States special envoy to the Middle East, has been cashing in on his proximity to Trump to secure private deals, this person says. Witkoff's son, Zach Witkoff, is the cofounder of World Liberty Financial, the crypto banking platform that launched Trump's memecoin. Early in March, Steve Witkoff sent cryptocurrency advocates to the Middle East to promote World Liberty Financial's latest stablecoin project, The Wall Street Journal reported. "Steve Witkoff is calling every sovereign government and saying, 'You need to support this coin if you want to be in good standing with Trump,'" the person says. Witkoff did not respond to multiple requests for comment. One conservative entrepreneur suggests that the relationship between Trump and the technology industry was never destined to last. "Tech people don't get politicians, and politicians don't understand tech," he says. "Some of this is because tech people don't really have an ideology. They operate in a globalist, new world order. Trump is only interested in deals for America." This America-first mindset still resonates in the country's more resolutely conservative tech enclaves such as El Segundo, California, an area dedicated to building American manufacturing and defense technology companies. "One thing that I appreciate about Trump is that it's all pretty public," says Isaiah Taylor, an El Segundo-based founder of the nuclear energy company Valar Atomics, who in January presented a briefing on nuclear energy for the president at Mar-a-Lago. "People are concerned about Elon and how his companies might benefit, but the reality is that everything Elon does is out in the open so it's under scrutiny all the time." Others, like Erik Kriessmann, a board member of the defense tech company Anduril, say that the current moment of pain and uncertainty is only temporary. He says of Trump: "I genuinely believe he has surrounded himself with highly competent people who are doing what they believe is best for America and we should be patient as they execute their plan." Still, there's the reality that defense tech companies like Anduril and Palantir, which rallied around Trump given his outwardly steadfast support of the defense industry, are now reeling as Trump proposes dramatic cuts to the military budget. "Democrats think that Trump wants to help billionaires, but that's not the case," says Noah Smith, an economist who writes a popular Substack called Noahpinion. "Trump is kicking the shit out of America's billionaires. To be a billionaire who continues to support Trump even as your entire portfolio plummets would mean that you're an insane cultist who loves having your wealth destroyed, and you don't become a billionaire by being an insane cultist who loves having your wealth destroyed." Smith believes that Chinese tariffs are already causing one of Trump's wealthiest supporters, Jeff Bezos, to sour on the administration. Roughly 25% of items on Amazon come from China. In late February, Bezos announced that the opinion page of The Washington Post, which he owns, would now be dedicated to the "support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets." While many saw the move as kissing Trump's ring, Smith has a very different — and unusual — interpretation. "This was Bezos' declaration of war against Trump but not conservatism. Trump is anti-free enterprise. So if you want to be in with the business people but against Trump, you say, 'I am for free enterprise.' Just look at what the Post is publishing: They are going hard against Trump. And they are writing, 'Screw tariffs.'" (Bezos did not respond to a request for comment.) "The people that are very unhappy right now — the people who should have been the staunchest supporters in the tech world — are getting the rug pulled out from under them," Smith continues. For now, the tech industry is clinging to the hope that any economic setbacks will only be temporary. Zoë Bernard is a feature writer based in Los Angeles.

Title: The Case Against Streaming TV Shows - by Trungphan2

Time Published: 2025-03-25T05:47:02Z

Thanks for subscribing to SatPost. Today, we are talking about why you probably shouldn’t watch the hot new streaming TV show that everyone is telling you to watch. Also this week: YouTube turns 20 Apple Intelligence’s Massive Failure …and them fire posts (including the Ralph Lauren Bear) People keep telling me to watch Apple TV+’s show Severance (which is on its second season). I mean the reviews are great and the memes look funny based on how many “😂”- emojis I see when they are posted. But I refuse. I will not watch Severance until the narrative arc is completely done (or if the show gets cancelled, then I will have saved 20-30 hours of my time). As a blanket policy for 2025, I implemented a “no new streaming TV show” policy. Why? I’ve been burnt way too many times in the past 5 years with people telling me I have to watch a new show: “Dude, The Bear is sooooo good!” “Bro, you seriously HAVE to watch Ted Lasso!” “Trung, have you seen Bridgerton? YOU HAVE TO!!” “Man, this GoT spin-off House of the Dragon is INSANE!!!” “Trung, I’m telling you. Yellowstone will make you shit your pants.” “Are you watching The Mandalorian? It’s unreal! You have to! I’m serious!” “Dude, dude, dude. 3 Body Problem is amazing. You gotta watch it. Seriously!” So, I did. I watched all of them and every single one had the same outcome: started strong with some laughs, suspense and well-timed cliffhangers…but then storylines became circular or didn’t make a lot of narrative sense (either within a single season or between seasons). These two posts nail the vibe of the current streaming TV experience. Take Ted Lasso, which was the original Apple TV+ hit show. I loved the first season and pumped the show’s tires so hard that even the official Apple TV+ Twitter account was re-tweeting my pumps. Season 1 was an easy A+. But the second season was B- and the third season was a solid D (I gave up after two episodes). Don’t even get me started on Season 3 of The Bear or Westworld. FML. It’s not just that so many new streaming TV shows seem to get progressively worse as the story unfolds, but there is also the risk of getting invested into a new show and then watching it get cancelled because streaming economics are vicious. Example: I was really feeling Tokyo Vice and — boom! — cancelled after two seasons. In my unprofessional opinion, HBO’s Succession is the only multi-season show from the past decade that has truly earned its keep. I have zero regrets watching those 36 hours of runtime. So many banger quotes. So many incredible memes. Now, I understand that not every streaming TV show is meant to be prestige and in the same league as Succession. Most of the time, viewers just want to throw something on the screen and turn their brains off. I get that. I’m not some paragon of productivity that needs to optimize every minute of my life. The specific problem I have with new (or new-ish) streaming TV shows is that they often ask for a double-digit hour time commitment to receive a pay-off (and those pay-offs either don’t come or just straight up suck). When someone tells you “seriously bro, you HAAAVVEEE to watch [new narrative TV streaming show X]”, they’re about to tie up 20 hours of your life. Other TV formats are much easier to start and stop. Cooking shows. Home-hunting shows. Dating shows. 1990s sitcom shows. Same with film. A 2-hour watch and you’re done. What about social apps like X or Instagram or TikTok? These are definitely a time-suck — and the media equivalent of Doritos — but seems we all know they are a time suck and often respond to the “time sucki-ness”. When I’m deep in the doom-scroll, my brain says “wow, I’m fried and need to take a break” (at a minimum, I feel awful after). Or any other type of popular internet media, really. NBA highlights on YouTube, newsletter essays, memes and even podcast interviews are all shorter asks of your time (and you can multi-task with long-form podcasts). So, no “bro”, I’m not going to “check out” the show you want me to watch. Quit telling me things I “have” to do. You do it, “seriously!”. Anyway, let me firm up my case against watching new TV streaming shows with a few additional thoughts: How streaming changed TV economics and incentives Matt Stone on how streaming distorts the art of TV Quentin Tarantino on why TV isn’t memorable So, Netflix is obviously the elephant in the streaming room. It has a $380B market cap and is more valuable than Disney+, NBCU, Warner Bros. Discover and Paramount combined. Apple and Amazon have different business models than the pure play streamers but compete for talent and ideas all the same. While not every streamer has the exact same strategy — especially after the shakeout in recent years — Netflix is the industry’s pace-setter. In 2023, The New Yorker’s Rachel Symes had an eye-opening profile on Netflix’s Chief Creative Officer Bela Balajaria. Along with co-CEO Ted Sarandos, she is a key decision-maker on Netflix’s ~$20B a year content budget. Here are three excerpts that define the Netflix approach, which is very much about volume: Netflix is a “Gourmet Cheeseburger”: Bajaria [says] that the ideal Netflix show is what one of her V.P.s, Jinny Howe, calls a “gourmet cheeseburger,” offering something “premium and commercial at the same time.” The New Cable Bundle: Bajaria’s team more readily embraced the company’s new objective, the executive said: not only to compete with cable but to “replace all television.” Sarandos [said] that Netflix’s strategy today is to function as “equal parts HBO and FX and AMC and Lifetime and Bravo and E! and Comedy Central.” Old Network TV vs. Netflix: Sarandos invoked the “Golden gut”, the idea that for old school TV executives “things worked because they picked them and they made them work.” The role of Netflix leader’s today is entirely different. When you’re trying to grow as quickly as possible in as many places as possible, you can’t afford to get bottlenecked behind one sensibility. An industry producer quoted in the article calls it the “Walmart-ization of Netflix”. Sarandos sums up the strategy as “saying yes in a town that’s built to say no.” By trying to capture all types of content, Netflix gets the entire spectrum of quality. That’s fine. I watch a lot of low-brow stuff and enjoy it. The issue is how the viewer is trained. How much of Netflix is just meant as background viewing like the majority of cable TV? How much of Netflix is being watched while scrolling social media or doing chores? Probably a lot. This reality informs the creative process. According to Will Tavlin in N+1 Magazine, Netflix categorizes content into 36,000 micro-genres. One category is called “casual viewing” (eg. something people can watch while doing other things and without full focus). Tavlin writes this type of content was traditionally made as “breezy network sitcoms, reality television, and nature documentaries” and now serves as a cornerstone of Netflix’s playbook. Netflix execs (allegedly) provide script notes for screenwriters to “have this character announce what they’re doing so that viewers who have this program on in the background can follow along.” I get the rationale but the approach is the opposite of the classic screenwriting rule to “show, don’t tell”. Here is one example from the Lindsay Lohan film Irish Wish with overly-explanatory dialogue: Lohan’s character: “We spent a day together, I admit it was a beautiful day filled with dramatic vistas and romantic rain, but that doesn’t give you the right to question my life choices. Tomorrow I’m marrying Paul Kennedy.” Lohan’s side-piece: “That will be the last you see of me, because after this I’m off to Bolivia.” Granted, that is a C-level film and not a TV show. But if the micro-genre categorization is true, would it be surprising if TV creators were getting similar notes from Netflix? Talent on uber-prestige TV projects probably get free creative rein but that’s a fraction of the total content on Netflix (and all streaming platforms). Balajaria was recently asked about these supposed script notes by Matt Belloni on The Town podcast. She doesn’t seem to directly deny it (~17 minute mark): Matt Belloni: “There's been some news coverage [that] if you watch some of the lesser prestige or not prestige shows [on Netflix], you do notice that the characters will constantly inform you what's going on. If you're doing laundry or on your Hinge account, you will continue to watch.” Bela Balajaria: “You fundamentally think that's different on Netflix than if you're watching a procedural show or something else somewhere else.” Matt Belloni:“Maybe. I'm raising the issue. That is part of the Netflix narrative.” Bela Balajaria: “I totally disagree with that…it's also so disrespectful to so many creators we work with, and that's not true.” To be clear, I don’t think creatives are out there trying to make slop but — as the late Charlie Munger used to say — show me the incentive and I’ll show you the outcome. Since the new era of TV began with Netflix producing House of Cards in 2013 — which also had a massive drop-off in quality in the final two of its 6 seasons — a major battle for the industry in the age of streaming has been how to structure the compensation. During the network TV hey day, a top-tier creator could bank on numerous income streams including: 1) payment to make the show; 2) profit participation in cable syndication deals on re-runs; 3) international rights; and 3) home video or DVD box set sales. These payments were also based on straightforward metrics (viewership, DVD sales etc.). Today, Netflix’s prodigious content spend is mostly structured as a one-time upfront payment with little upside participation. In an op-ed for the New York Times in 2022, horror super-producer Jason Blum touched on how the streaming model may hamper creativity: When the financial incentives of the people paying for the movies and TV shows are aligned with those of the creators, the overall system is much more cost-effective — and often the movies and TV shows are better.So what does this have to do with Netflix and streaming? The streaming platforms have, until very recently, balked at any kind of visibility into the success of movies and TV on their platforms (though that could change at Netflix if it adds an advertising-supported tier). This is understandable: Having spent hundreds of millions of dollars building their algorithms and distribution platforms and billions more licensing Hollywood’s movies and TV shows to draw subscribers, they absolutely have the right to protect that proprietary information. But the system leaves creators with precious little visibility into whether their works succeed in drawing viewers. By typically paying an upfront flat fee, Netflix buys out the usual success-based incentive compensation (known as the back end in Hollywood). This effectively treats every creator as a part of a hit movie or TV show before the camera ever rolls. An actor who might typically make a million dollars upfront with a healthy back end if the film does well will instead get $3 million upfront and no back end participation. Streamers have improved data transparency since this article (especially Netflix with its engagement reports). But TV talent and the platforms are still not totally aligned. Without a real feeling of ownership, creators may understandably care a little bit less about the final product. The streaming economics are also hurting the industry’s talent pipeline for writers. Since syndication fees on re-runs were so lucrative in the network TV days, young writers could count on longer seasons (eg. more episodes) with steady work and an opportunity to hone their crafts under more senior creatives. Conversely, streaming TV has shorter (more binge-friendly) seasons and smaller writer rooms. Many writers are now forced to patch together multiple odd writing jobs instead of focusing solely on a single show. It is not hard to see how these changes would eventually affect the product’s quality…and I think people are noticing. *** The year of Blum’s op-ed was the same year of “Peak TV”, when the number of original scripted TV series hit a record of 600. While the figure has since trended down, there are still thousands of new cumulative shows in recent years that no single person — even if their entire diet was just 5-Hour Energy and Starbucks Nitro Cold Brew — could conceivably finish. Moving forward, the industry should be more rational with streamers bucketed into a few tiers: Must-have: Netflix Must-have if you’re a parent: Disney+/Hulu (Bluey is ~10% of viewing on this app) Must-have if you hate triple back-to-back unskippable ads: YouTube Premium Will be fine because they getting bankrolled by Beaucoup Big Tech Bucks: Apple+, Amazon Prime. Too small and will probably need to consolidate: Max, Peacock, Paramount+ That’s still enough competition to keep new shows coming, though. South Park’s Matt Stone nailed the situation during an interview with Bloomberg’s Lucas Shaw. He was commenting on how streaming’s thirst for content was distorting the artistic process. Borrowing a line from J.R.R. Tolkien, Stone said that the streamers were making too much “bread” (new shows) when the world only had so much “butter” (actual good ideas worth making into TV shows): “I feel like part of the butter and bread equation [has] gotten screwed up in the 2010s from streaming. Let's make the bread. We got this [amount of bread] and there's [a lot less] butter in the world. So, it doesn't work. There's just not that much good stuff out there…the technology made it so with editing and photography, everything looks glossy and it looks good and feels good. Then they fool you and then episode 7, you realize they’re wasting my time.” The reference Stone makes is to a Star Wars show on Disney+. He was watching it and enjoyed the first few episodes but then got hit by a complete clunker. He quit the show and said whenever there was one of these dud episodes, it felt like “a betrayal”. Streamers are making all this bread because there’s a high correlation between subscription churn and engagement. By one measure, “seven hours of extra engagement per month reduces churn by 1%” on average according to Hernan Lopez, founder of media consulting firm Owl & Co. Stone made these comments and fully acknowledged it was funny coming from someone that is running a show that has gone on for 27 seasons. But he and South Park co-creator Trey Parker definitely earn their stripes and know what they are talking about (in fact, they earned their stripes so much that “South Park Controversies” incredibly has its own Wikipedia page). A bit earlier I mentioned my frustration with Season 3 of The Bear (after really enjoying the first two seasons). The show seemed to be dealing with this butter-bread problem. My specific beef was that each episode was either slow or circular with the characters going through the same type of struggles without the story advancing much and nothing really happening. Well, apparently, the show’s creator Christopher Storer only intended the entire narrative arc to be 3 seasons but FX offered more money for a 4th season and the writers basically stretched the narrative. If we tease apart Stone’s argument, there are two ways that too much streaming TV can “distort” the art: Filler episodes: If shows are created at volume and paid up beforehand — based on the streaming business model — then there is less incentive for every episode to be solid. Rather, the incentive to just get the project done and that means there will be some duds along the way. Lower completion rates = cancellations: One of the key metrics for streamers is “completion rate” (which is the % of people who start and finish a show). Filler episodes are probably annoying a lot of viewers and leading them to quit a show. That lowers the completion rate and incentivizes the streamer to cancel the show, thus leaving the entire narrative arc hanging (which is incredibly annoying as a viewer). The cancellation of streaming TV shows has become such a meme that fans have created theories on how to predict if a show will get canned. One heuristic is that “a new Netflix live-action series has to accrue 100 million hours watched in its first full week on Netflix” or it will get taken out to pasture like my Ed Hardy t-shirts when I moved in with my now-wife. Of course, TV cancellations also happened a lot in network TV days. However, the on-demand and ubiquitous nature of streaming means there are endless (and hyper-targeted) options for someone to get rugged. The worst part is that you’ll get rugged and might not even remember any of the hours you put into the show. Let’s discuss why in the next section. *** Aside from the “bread” and “butter” analogy, let me zero in on another bit from the Matt Stone interview: “the technology made it so with editing and photography, everything [on TV] looks glossy and it looks good and feels good.” Quentin Tarantino was on the Joe Rogan podcast and made a similar observation. He was doing it as part of a larger spiel about why film is better than TV. We obviously have to take this with a grain of salt because Tarantino is a film guy (you may have seen his movies) but it hits pretty hard. Tarantino used Taylor Sheridan’s hugely successful show Yellowstone as an example: “A lot of the TV now has the patina of a movie. They're using cinematic language to get you caught up…while I'm watching [Yellowstone], I am compelled…but at the end of the day, it's all just a soap opera. They've introduced you to a bunch of characters. You actually kind of know all their backstories. […] You don't remember it 5 years from now. You're caught up in the minutia of it at the moment. The difference [with film] is I'll see a good western movie and I'll remember it for the rest of my life. I'll remember the story. I'll remember this scene or that scene. It built to an emotional climax of some degree…it's not just about interpersonal relationships. The story is good itself but there's a payoff. There's not a payoff on [a lot of TV]. It's just more inter-connectional drama. While I'm watching it, that's good enough. But when it’s over, I couldn’t tell you anything about the show.” Just to be clear: Tarantino is referring to quality film and TV (Tarantino cites Season 1 of Homeland as a piece of TV with an quality film-calibre arc). There are clearly a lot of shitty films that are instantly forgettable. However, Tarantino’s larger point is tapping into basic human psychology when he talks about how films are more memorable than TV. Even before our attention spans were shot from social media and doomscrolling, the 90-120 minute film format was an ideal capsule to tell a story and elicit emotion. Legendary director Alfred Hitchcock used to say, “The length of a film should be directly related to the endurance of the human bladder." People can stay focussed for that timespan and digest the ubiquitous three-act story structure that has been refined over thousands of years (usually in some form of the Hero’s Journey). Because of tech advances, TV has all the “patina” and “glossy” look of the film experience, but it is packaged in a smaller and much more open-ended format which doesn’t lend itself to being as psychologically impactful. This is doubly true if you’re comparing the experience of watching a film in theatre (big sound, full focus, no phone, shared experience sitting next to other people) vs. watching TV in bed on a laptop (while meme-ing an NBA game on X and laughing at cancel-able memes in various group chats). One analogy that popped in my head: a lot of narrative streaming TV is like an elliptical cardio machine. It kind of looks like a workout. Your arms and legs are moving. You might sweat. But let’s be real, a run — aka watching a film in this comparison — is a superior workout. Anecdotally, I’d say that 80% of my quotes and cultural references from screen-based media comes from film. About 5% come from classic my favourite sitcoms including Silicon Valley, Seinfeld and The Office. The final 15% comes from the best-of-best TV shows that really stuck the landing and completed a full narrative arc with iconic characters including The Sopranos, Breaking Bad, Mad Men, The Wire, The Shield, Succession and Game of Thrones before Season 8 (definitely watch all of those before jumping into a new network TV show). Back to Taylor Sheridan. I’m a fan. Landman was the last show I started before my “no new streaming show” policy. Previously, I was very invested in Yellowstone. It did actually make me shit my pants with excitement. But I quit when Kevin Costner left and — like Tarantino — actually don’t remember a single quote from all the hours I put into the show. Perhaps unsuprisingly, favourite piece of art from Sheridan is a film: Sicario, which I love love love and liberally quote out of context. Sticking the landing it obviously hard AF. To do it over a multi-season TV show with multiple storylines is understandably a harder task than wrapping up a 120-minute film narrative. When narrative arcs are left hanging or the payoff is weak, then the entire product become much less memorable. Probably helps to explain the emotional resonance of films over TV (at least in the N=2 case for me and Tarantino). *** If I were to critique my rant against the state of streaming TV, an easy riposte would be, “Dude, you think network TV was better than this? Do you know how much slop we had in the 1990s and 2000s?” I’ll admit that the previous era was also a time suck and very capable of screwing the viewer (*cough* Lost *cough*). However, streaming TV is a different beast. It all looks so good now and the storytelling techniques are perfectly honed to manipulate your emotions with cliffhangers, mysteries and hanging storylines. Perpetual blue balls to keep you coming back. There’s endless content to drive engagement, which is the streaming platform’s #1 priority. It’s all algorithmically served to a person’s specific interests. And it’s all on-demand! You feel compelled to keep watching and time washes away. One final and important difference worth pointing out is how anti-social it is to binge on streaming TV. How many people watch alone on their phones or laptops? All at different speeds and paces. At least with pre-streaming TV, there was a higher likelihood of a broad shared experience. Whether that was NBC’s “Must-See TV” line-up (Seinfeld, Friends) or ABC’s "Thank God It's Friday" (Full House, Family Matters, Boy Meets World) or HBO's "Golden Age of TV" (that started with Oz, followed by The Sopranos, The Wire, Sex & The City etc.). You knew that millions of other people were watching at the exact same time. Below is a photo photo of people congregating in Times Square for the Seinfeld finale in 1998. With 76 million viewers, it was the largest non-Super Bowl (or Presidential Debate) TV event of the past 30 years and nicely encapsulates the peak water cooler shared experience from network TV days. Last year, I wrote a whole piece comparing the two most popular children's streaming shows: Cocomelon (algorithmic slop) and Bluey (the work of a true artist, Joe Blumm). The piece was recently resurfaced on Hacker News and this comment feels relevant: My favorite thing about the Cocomelon phenomenon is how outraged we get as adults, while simultaneously failing to realise how TV has been doing the same to us for the longest time. When I moved out of my parents' house I got an apartment with no TV, and I hate watching shows on the smartphone or on desktop, so I ended up dropping the habit. Now every time I go back to my folks' place I'm shocked by how zombied they get in front of the TV, and how normalized it is between adults in 2025 to waste away whole days bingeing shows on Netflix. If you know what to look for you can see these "long format TV" shows use similar patterns to zombifying kid's media If I go hard on Cocomelon, then I should also go hard on myself for previous mindless binge-ing. Is there really that much of a difference for a pre-schooler watching "Wheels on the Bus" over 100x while I finish an entire season of a show in one weekend? Honestly, the kid will probably remember more lyrics from that song than I will quotes from the show. From a cultural cache, at least Apple TV+ and HBO Max are keeping the “same time, once-a-week” release schedule for new shows (compared to Netflix’s "every-episode-at-once" approach). This weekly cadence maximizes the likelihood of a shared viewing experience. I do get jealous when people start using new meme formats from shows I’m not watching. Thankfully, I get enough meme material from the daily business and tech news cycles that I don’t have to waste time watching every new show. Speaking of which, I do have one confession to make: I am currently watching Season 3 of HBO’s The White Lotus. I’m technically not breaking my “no new streaming TV show” policy since it’s an anthology series. Each season — about American tourists acting a fool in a tourist hotspot (Hawaii, Sicily, Ko Samui) — is largely a standalone and can be viewed without having seen previous seasons. The show’s main attractions are the luxury destinations, the general vibes and creator Mike White’s wild writing. It’s only an 8-hour commitment and I know I’ll get a completed narrative arc by the end. That’s a reasonable ask of my time. The season is at the halfway mark and has been quite good. So, if you’re in to Thailand and dark humor, you HAVE to watch it...bro. Seriously! Speaking of video time sucks, YouTube is obviously infamous for its multi-hour rabbit holes. I’ve written about how the video sharing platform is the greatest learning tool since the printing press (when used the right way), but am cognizant that a lot of viewing is just mindless slop. Here’s the key: do NOT under any circumstance look at the “For You” recommendation sidebar on the right of the video. Last night, I was watching Lebron and Luka highlights, then was recommended an Ed Sheeran and Andrea Bocelli duet…then watched a Hot Ones interview…then a bad-ass figh scene from The Bourne Identity...and an hour later was deep into a Vietnam War documentary. WTF. Anyway, YouTube is celebrating its 20th anniversary. It was founded on February 14, 2005, by three former PayPal employees including Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim. Variety dropped a solid long-read on the platform’s evolution from pet videos to the world’s largest video site and 2nd largest search engine (after Google): The original idea: “The founders actually launched the platform as a site for video dating. But after one week, not a single person had uploaded any videos. So they pivoted to promoting YouTube as a general-purpose video-sharing platform.” First video: “The very first video was uploaded April 23, 2005, by Karim; titled “Me at the Zoo,” it was a 19-second clip he shot in front of the elephant exhibit at the San Diego Zoo.” First viral videos: “In YouTube’s first year, its primary traffic driver was viral videos. Two stood out: In November 2005, a Nike ad featuring Brazilian soccer star Ronaldinho improbably hitting a goal’s crossbar with a ball four times in a row became the first YouTube video to reach 1 million views. The following month, fans of “Saturday Night Live” and Andy Samberg uploaded copies of the Lonely Island’s mock-rap short “Lazy Sunday.” It racked up 5 million views before NBC’s lawyers demanded the three-minute clip be pulled down.” YouTube is “TV” now: “According to Nielsen, for two years running, Americans have spent more time watching YouTube on their TV sets than any other streamer, including Netflix, Disney+ and Amazon Prime Video.” Backstory on Google’s $1.65B acquisition price: “Google ultimately closed its acquisition for $1.65 billion in stock in November 2006. (The YouTube founders landed on the price tag because they thought it would be cool to sell the company for 10% more than eBay paid for PayPal in 2002.)” Power laws among creators: “Never mind that only about 4% of an estimated 50 million creators worldwide earn more than $100,000 per year, according to Goldman Sachs research.” What would YouTube be worth on its own? “As a stand-alone entity, apart from Google, YouTube would be worth more than $400 billion, Wall Street analyst firm MoffettNathanson has estimated — more than Disney, Comcast, Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount Global combined.” This issue is brought to you by Bearly AI Why are you seeing this ad? Because I also had an idea for a video dating website but the name (Bearly Single) tested poorly in the focus group and I had to pivot with brand. So instead, I co-founded an AI-powered research app called Bearly AI that can save you and your team hours of work. We just added two new powerful models from Anthropic (Sonnet 3.7) and OpenAI (GPT 4.5) for coding, reading and writing. You can try those along with image, text and audio models from DeepSeek, Grok, Whisper, Gemini, Stable Diffusion and more. It’s all available in one keyboard shortcut (and an iPhone app). Use code BEARLY1 for a FREE month of the Pro Plan. Try Bearly AI for FREE We recently talked about the failed rollout of Apple Intelligence. A number of the features that it showed during its developer conference (WWDC) in June 2024 still haven't shipped...and aren't expected to until 2026 (they even had to pull a Siri ad that was straight vapourware). One of Apple's top observers Jon Gruber bodied the company in a long peice titled "Something Is Rotten in the State of Cupertino". It's a must read and the jist is that Apple has seriously burnt its credibility and the organization will need a massive shake-up: "What Apple showed regarding the upcoming “personalized Siri” at WWDC was not a demo. It was a concept video. Concept videos are bullshit, and a sign of a company in disarray, if not crisis…Modern Apple — the post-NeXT-reunification Apple of the last quarter century — does not publish concept videos. They only demonstrate actual working products and features. […] The Apple of the Jobs exile years — the Sculley / Spindler / Amelio Apple of 1987–1997 — promoted all sorts of amazing concepts that were no more real than the dinosaurs of Jurassic Park, and promised all sorts of hardware and (especially) software that never saw the light of day. Promoting what you hope to be able to someday ship is way easier and more exciting than promoting what you know is actually ready to ship. However close to financial bankruptcy Apple was when Steve Jobs returned as CEO after the NeXT reunification, the company was already completely bankrupt of credibility. Apple today is the most profitable and financially successful company in the history of the world. Everyone notices such success, and the corresponding accumulation of great wealth. Less noticed, but to my mind the more impressive achievement, is that over the last three decades, the company also accumulated an abundant reserve of credibility. When Apple showed a feature, you could bank on that feature being real. When they said something was set to ship in the coming year, it would ship in the coming year. In the worst case, maybe that “year” would have to be stretched to 13 or 14 months. You can stretch the truth and maintain credibility, but you can’t maintain credibility with bullshit. And the “more personalized Siri” features, it turns out, were bullshit. Keynote by keynote, product by product, feature by feature, year after year after year, Apple went from a company that you couldn’t believe would even remain solvent, to, by far, the most credible company in tech. Apple remains at no risk of financial bankruptcy (and in fact remains the most profitable company in the world). But their credibility is now damaged. Careers will end before Apple might ever return to the level of “if they say it, you can believe it” credibility the company had earned at the start of June 2024 [WWDC].” It may take Apple Intelligence Siri over two years to get to market. That's longer than it took Apple to ideate on and ship the iPhone. I'm not saying that this wouldn't have happened under Steve Jobs. But I'm also not not not not not not saying that. Well, based on what Gruber wrote in the article...I am saying that. Some other baller links for your weekend: Google DeepMind released demo of its Gemini Robotics platform...and it showed some impressive dexterity for household tasks including packing lunches, organizing toys and folding origami (not really a house thing but impressive). Gemini Robotics can take natural language instructions can "see" with its mechanical hands (a "vision language action model"). Look, if this thing can fold laundry and do dishes it scale, it's a $1T business and will save countless marriages. A $95m lottery arbitrage: A Texas lottery with bi-weekly draw saw its jackpot hit ~$95m in Q1 2023. The draw only had 26 million possible numbers. Someone sniffed out the arb ant bought 26 million tickets at $1 each. The risk is that the pot would be split if there were multiple winners. The scheme ended up scoring $58m. There may have been some tomfoolery (including the involvement of a state lotto commission) and it’s all under investigation now. Next-level husband move…some dude made his wife a multi-course sashimi Omakase meal with a giant fresh tuna (presumably flown in from Japan) that he carved with a sushi sword that he blessed by spitting sake on it while wearing a Krispy Kreme hat. That previous sentence has never been written before now. Nice gesture and all but Sushi Husband Guy completely broke the Bro Code and posted the video on social media, thus shaming all other husband gifts. C’mon man. Manus is an AI agent tool out of China…that some are calling a “second DeepSeek moment” after it went super viral last week. It also became a sensation because people weren’t really expecting a Chinese startup to create leading consumer AI startups in the West. Here is a 14-minute demo of the tool (and a good ChinaTalk podcast on whether the hype is justified and the geopolitical implications of the release). Who is the luckiest musician in the world? The Coldplay drummer according to this old classic bit from comedian Nish Kumar. TLDR: Coldplay splits its royalties four ways…so the drummer is rich AF…can do anything he wants (like get a cameo in Game of Thrones)…but also gets to stay anonymous because most people only know Chris Martin…and he gets to sit while playing music while the two other Coldplay guys have to stand. …and them wild posts (including President Trump injecting another wild new phrase into the lexicon, “Everything’s computer”…that came with this Daily Show riff on a "White House Tesla Dealership"): Alright, so last week’s meme of the week was the Rare Vances (aka hundreds of random photoshops of Vice President JD Vance). The entire trend reached its apex when Vance himself posted a meme of him as Leonardo DiCaprio in Once Upon A Time In Hollywood pointing at the TV screen as if to say “hey, that’s me”. Of all the Rare Vance memes that he could have chosen, this was on point. Very well played. Here is decent collection of Rare Vances. Here is SatPost reader Paul C. taking a viral captcha challenge I made of Rare Vances and turning it into an actual website JD Captcha (thank you and lol). Since Vance posted the meme, it’s probably over now but I’l share another popular one. It’s also of Leo and I wonder if Leo knows he’s the subject of two of the best Rare Vances. Came to this post with the post-cliffhanger clarity of Severance S2's last episode... Wish you had written this in Jan and saved me 20 hours of my life. I thought Season 1 was terrific and expected Season 2 to answer all the questions they had asked. But like an engineering student in a midterm test, they seem to be pushing all the important questions to the end hoping for a miracle. Loved the explanation for WHY this is happening – I've been noticing a lot of Netflix shows, even Sitcoms turning to heavy exposition, like "I literally spent all of my time working on this Robotus AI and now you're going to give credit to the guy on the team who did nothing?" As a guy who doesn't multitask when watching this stuff or watch things 'on the background', I was baffled, like "Why are you explaining to me what's going on? I'm literally seeing it!" But maybe I'm not the target audience. Great Article! We all became addicted to Streaming Content without realising over the years.

Stocks surged on Monday as Donald Trump said he may scale back tariffs set to be unveiled on April. 2. The Nasdaq Composite index gained 2.3%, as all Magnificent 7 stocks surged, the S&P 500 gained 1.8%, and the Dow Jones industrial average gained 1.4%, or almost 600 points. The reciprocal tariffs may stop short of his pledge to equalize with levels charged by foreign countries on U.S. goods, the president told reporters, according to the Wall Street Journal. The administration may also delay duties on particular lines of goods, including autos, lumber, drugs and chips. This apparent moderation came even as Trump announced a 25% additional tariff on all countries that import oil from Venezuela. China is the biggest foreign buyer of Venezuelan oil. India, Cuba and several European countries are also customers. Big tech was a big beneficiary of Monday’s rally, with Tesla (TSLA+2.13%) stock adding almost 12%, cutting its year-to-date decline to about 27%. The increases for the rest of the Mag 7 shares were 3.7% for Meta (META-0.90%), 3.6% for Amazon (AMZN+0.40%), 3.2% for Nvidia (NVDA-1.18%), 2.2% for Google (GOOGL-1.38%), 1.1% for Apple (AAPL+1.32%), and 0.5% for Microsoft (MSFT+0.36%). BYD’s (BYDDY+4.13%) stock jumped almost 5.4% in New York after the Chinese electric vehicle maker’s 2024 earnings topped expectations, overtaking Tesla in revenue. Its revenue jumped 29% from 2023 to 777 billion yuan ($107 billion), compared with $97.7 billion for its chief U.S. rival. Tesla still leads in profit, however, at $7.1 billion, compared with its rival’s $5.6 billion. BYD’s profit gained 34% year-over-year, topping the StreetAccount consensus estimate, with its net margin widening to 5.2% from 5.0%. Crypto stocks also got buoyed by the shift into riskier assets, also reflected in increased token prices. MicroStrategy (MSTR-1.24%) surged 10% after saying it’d boosted its bitcoin holdings to more than 500,000. Coinbase (COIN-2.00%), Robinhood (HOOD-0.93%) and Hut 8 (HUT-2.78%) all also advanced. Not all the news was good today: Manufacturing shrank again this month, after a brief reprieve in January and February, according to the flash manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for March. The entire economy is probably slowing, Citi (C-1.41%) economists wrote. —With reporting by William Gavin, Britney Nguyen, and Harri Weber Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Major U.S. equities indexes popped higher following reports that President Donald Trump could limit the scope of the reciprocal tariffs set to take effect on April 2. Monday's upbeat market session marked the beginning of a new trading week. Several important economic data points, including updates on consumer sentiment, the housing market, and inflation, are expected to be released. The S&P 500 gained 1.8%, while the Dow added 1.4%. A resurgence among tech stocks helped lift the Nasdaq, which closed 2.3% higher. Tesla (TSLA) shares surged 11.9%, logging the S&P 500's top daily performance. The march higher on Monday extended gains posted late last week after Tesla CEO Elon Musk held an all-hands meeting with employees, arguing that investors have underestimated the potential of the firm's self-driving and humanoid robot technology. Tesla also announced it would activate its smart driving-assistance feature in China as soon as it receives regulatory approval. United Airlines (UAL) increased annual fees for its rewards credit cards and airport lounge memberships. While customers will have to pay more for these travel perks, United also announced sign-up bonuses for new co-branded credit cards with JPMorgan Chase, along with additional benefits for cardholders, such as credits for ridesharing services. The carrier stressed that the enhanced benefits should outweigh the cost increase, and United Airlines shares soared 7.2%. Semiconductor stocks got a boost from the developments on trade policy, with suggestions that chips could receive a reprieve in the upcoming round of reciprocal tariffs. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) gained 7.0% after China's Ant Group said it had developed a more cost-efficient technique for training artificial intelligence (AI) models. Although Ant has used AI chips from Nvidia (NVDA) in the development process, it is reportedly considering alternatives from AMD and Chinese rivals. While the alleviation of tariff concerns helped lift high-risk, high-reward investments like tech stocks, shares of companies known for their more defensive characteristics came under pressure. Shares of Hormel Foods (HRL), the parent company of Spam and other packaged food brands, fell 2.4%, losing the most of any S&P 500 stock. Hormel announced last week that former CEO Jeff Ettinger would rejoin its board of directors and participate in the committee tasked with naming a replacement for current CEO Jim Snee, who is set to retire later this year. Shares of MarketAxess Holdings (MKTX), operator of a digital trading platform for fixed-income securities, moved 2.4% lower. Monday's downturn reversed some of the gains posted by the stock this month after MarketAxess reported robust growth in average daily volume for February. While strength in emerging markets and Eurobonds contributed to the positive monthly trading figures, the platform experienced softness in U.S. credit markets. Brown-Forman (BF.B) stock also slipped 2.3%. Shares of the alcoholic beverage maker have been trending downward over the past two weeks as tensions between the U.S. and major trade partners shine a spotlight on whiskey and other spirits. However, recent reports that the European Union might delay its impending tariff on U.S. whiskey could spell some relief for the Jack Daniels parent.

PCMag editors select and review products independently. If you buy through affiliate links, we may earn commissions, which help support our testing. UPDATE: AST SpaceMobile has clarified that FM1 is a second-generation BlueBird satellite. "The FCC filing describes our Block 2 satellite design; this satellite will launch with ISRO and is scheduled in Q2 this year," the company tells us. Although AST is requesting FCC clearance to launch the satellite under an experimental authority, the company is signaling it'll try to use FM-1 for commercial activities, pending regulatory approval. The company's request to the FCC notes it's going to formally apply for FM-1 to become the sixth satellite of its emerging constellation, which would give it the capability to beam data over AT&T's and Verizon's licensed radio bands. Original story: AST SpaceMobile—a rival to SpaceX’s cellular Starlink system—is requesting permission to launch a new prototype satellite that differs from the company’s original plans. On Friday, AST asked the FCC for experimental authority to launch and operate an "FM1" satellite. At first glance, it appears to be a second-generation BlueBird satellite. The FM1 and second-gen BlueBird satellites are both 223 square meters, or about three times larger than first-gen BlueBirds, which launched in September and have successfully powered demo video calls. AST envisions launching dozens of second-generation BlueBirds to deliver satellite connectivity to consumer phones by 2026. But according to the FCC filing, the company only wants to launch one FM1 satellite “for a testing and demonstration mission” in Earth’s low orbit at 520 kilometers. In addition, the FM1 is designed to harness radio spectrum in the lesser used “V-Bands,” rather than the cellular frequencies for AT&T and Verizon, AST's key partners. The FCC filing also notes that “FM1 will conduct a testing and demonstration mission critical to initiating services for the company’s commercial and Department of Defense customers,” after AST secured a $43 million contract from the US Space Force. Still, the FM1 raises questions about how it fits into AST’s plans since this is the first we're hearing about it. The company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But on Friday, a spokesperson told us the company is still slated to launch the first block of second-generation BlueBird satellites in Q2 through the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). “These satellites are approximately 2,400 sq ft in size (223 square meters), providing 100 times larger capacity than BlueWalker 3 and 10 times larger than the first block of BlueBird satellites,” the spokesperson said in a statement. Last week, an Indian media outlet also reported that ISRO plans on launching the satellites in May. But it’s possible things may be changing. AST’s spokesperson also noted: “The exact launch timeframe is contingent on a number of factors, including the final normal course of testing the satellites, regulatory approvals, confirmation of the final launch date by the launch provider, logistics, weather conditions, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.” The FCC filing about the FM1 also suggests it’ll act as a prototype to help the company iron out potential design issues due to the massive size of the second-generation BlueBirds. “Specifically, FM1 will allow AST SpaceMobile to test the satellite’s architecture and function of its mechanical systems,” the company wrote in the filing. “FM1 will be physically larger than the BB1s and deploy via an unfolding process that will enable the spacecraft to extend its solar arrays and antenna. The instant test will evaluate various mechanical components and subsystems of the new platform, including mechanisms and firmware employed to unfold the FM1’s phased array antenna.” The same filing also says AST plans on launching the FM1 from India in June. AST also still needs approval from the FCC to commercially launch and operate its second-generation BlueBird satellites in the US, but no application has even been filed. Not helping the matter is that FCC clearance can potentially take more than a year. Friday’s filing, if granted, would only give AST authority to test the FM1. Still, the company noted in the application that it “plans to file a further modification application" to receive commercial clearance to operate 248 satellites for satellite-to-phone connectivity. AST has asked the FCC to grant experimental authority for FM1 "no later than April 21, 2025."

AST’s spokesperson also noted: “The exact launch timeframe is contingent on a number of factors, including the final normal course of testing the satellites, regulatory approvals, confirmation of the final launch date by the launch provider, logistics, weather conditions, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.” The FCC filing about the FM1 also suggests it’ll act as a prototype to help the company iron out potential design issues due to the massive size of the second-generation BlueBirds. “Specifically, FM1 will allow AST SpaceMobile to test the satellite’s architecture and function of its mechanical systems,” the company wrote in the filing. “FM1 will be physically larger than the BB1s and deploy via an unfolding process that will enable the spacecraft to extend its solar arrays and antenna. The instant test will evaluate various mechanical components and subsystems of the new platform, including mechanisms and firmware employed to unfold the FM1’s phased array antenna.” The same filing also says AST plans on launching the FM1 from India in June. AST also still needs approval from the FCC to commercially launch and operate its second-generation BlueBird satellites in the US, but no application has even been filed. Not helping the matter is that FCC clearance can potentially take more than a year. Friday’s filing, if granted, would only give AST authority to test the FM1. Still, the company noted in the application that it “plans to file a further modification application" to receive commercial clearance to operate 248 satellites for satellite-to-phone connectivity. AST has asked the FCC to grant experimental authority for FM1 "no later than April 21, 2025."

Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement Buying groceries in bulk can save you serious money. Here are six essential items you can stock up on to last for months. We spoke with a meal planning expert to find out which foods are smartest to buy in bulk. Grocery prices continue to be a major concern for many Americans. In fact, a recent CNET survey found that rising food costs are still the top source of sticker shock -- and I can relate. We've explored plenty of ways to help stretch your grocery budget, from using food-saving apps like Flashfood, to comparing name brand versus store brand groceries, and even examining whether shopping at Trader Joe's really saves you money. Another tried-and-true strategy? Buying in bulk, which can offer significant savings on everyday staples. After doing some math, I found that the average person could save $1,000 a year by shopping at Costco for bulk foods. Buying in bulk can be more complicated, however, due to storage considerations, and the difference in shelf life between various items. According to Mary Ann Kelley, the meal planning expert behind AddSaltandServe, "Shoppers can ask themselves three questions: Will my savings be significant compared to the lowest price at all stores? Will I use the items before they expire or lose quality? A great price does not save money if the item will not be used. And finally, do I have room to store items I buy in bulk?" Read more: Here's What an Expert Told Me About Food Expiration Dates Accepting that bulk shopping is generally a financially savvy move, and given the considerations posed above, I asked a few shopping and meal prepping experts what the best foods are to buy in bulk. Here they are: Beans are packed with protein and they're the perfect candidates to buy in bulk. "Canned beans are a pantry staple and a smart bulk purchase, thanks to their long shelf life and affordability at warehouse stores," says Kristen Markel, the bulk shopping expert behind Warehouse Wanderer. Beans also are incredibly versatile for food prep, as they can fit into just about any meal, including dessert. (Black bean brownies are worth your time.) Plus they have real staying power. "Properly stored in a cool, dark place, canned beans can last up to five years," says Markel. An eight-pack of canned beans at Costco retails for about $8, bringing the cost per can to under a dollar, and the cost per serving to about 30 cents. If you've got the time and wherewithal for dried beans, the savings are even bigger. A 10-pound bag of black beans costs around $18, for a cost per serving of less than 25 cents. If freezer space allows, fish is far more affordable when you buy in bulk. Meat and seafood in the freezer section are often frozen right after harvesting, so they can still be very high in quality. You can also process proteins bought fresh and freeze them yourself, and either way certain types of meat and seafood can stay in your freezer for up to a year. (This FoodKeeper app from the US Department of Health and Human Services is a handy guide to how long you can store various foods.) "Shoppers can often find bulk-packaged fresh and frozen meat at a better price, or they may stock up on bulk amounts of normal packages of meat when they are on sale," says Kelley. It's possible to have a bulk shopping mindset even if you don't have access to a traditional bulk store. "Meat bought in bulk at a good price can be frozen as is, but shoppers can also save space -- and make dinner prep less stressful -- by cooking meats ahead that will be used later in cooked form in recipes. For instance, shoppers can cook bulk packages of ground beef or chicken when they bring them home, and then they can use the cooked meat for recipes like tacos, chili, and chicken soup." Butter is more shelf-stable than most people think, making it a good candidate for buying in bulk. We typically think primarily of the pantry or freezer when it comes to buying in bulk, but "don't overlook dairy, especially butter," says Markel. "Butter freezes beautifully and can last up to a year in the freezer." Costco's Kirkland Signature butter is considered one of its most economical offerings among fans, around $18 (in my region) for 4 pounds, which doesn't come with an overwhelming space requirement in the freezer. At my nearest grocery store, the same amount of butter costs twice that much. Boxed pasta lasts for up to two years. Boxed pasta may require some storage space, but if you're able to bulk up on it, it has the longevity to make it worthwhile. "Dry pasta is another bulk-buy winner, with an unopened shelf life of up to two years," says Markel. "For even longer storage, consider vacuum-sealing pasta to maintain freshness well beyond its typical expiration." (Here are the best vacuum sealers we've tested.) Eight pounds of Barilla penne cost $13 at Costco, which results in a savings of over a dollar per pound compared with buying individual boxes at my local supermarket. Italian American families, or carb lovers, take note. Not all spices are good to buy in bulk, but whole peppercorns keep their pep for a while. Items with the highest prices per ounce can be prime candidates for bulk shopping, on a case-by-case basis depending on longevity. "Specialty items that cost significantly less on sale can be worth buying in bulk, but only if they will be used," says Kelley. "A good example of this is expensive spices that might be used frequently, like quality black peppercorns," she says. Other specialty items that can be pricey but can be stockpiled when they're on sale include saffron, tinned fish and even caviar -- which can actually be frozen when unopened and kept for up to a year. If you want to get the most bang for your buck, buy paper towels and other household products in bulk. So long as you're bulk shopping, here's a bonus nonfood item. "Paper products are among the items that are less expensive to buy in bulk packaging, especially toilet paper and paper towels," says Kelley." "Since paper products do not need to be stored in a climate controlled area, utility spaces, attics, and other unfinished spaces are fine for storage, making it easier to make room for them." If you have a paper towel dependency, as I do, consider a 12-pack of Kirkland paper towels for $23, versus single rolls that can be as much as $3 and up.

CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures.

Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Merck’s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck’s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil’s growth in China. The full truth finally emerged on February 4, 2025, when Merck announced it would no longer achieve the long-forecasted $11 billion in sales of Gardasil by 2030, as it would cease shipments of Gardasil to China “through at least midyear” to facilitate a “rapid reduction of inventory.” Defendants claimed this was necessitated by the continued over-inflation of overall channel inventories as demand in China for Gardasil had “not recovered to the level we had expected.” Following this news, Merck’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $99.79 per share on February 3, 2025, Merck’s stock price fell to $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025, a decline of more than 9% in the span of just a single day.

March 24, 2025 13:17 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, March 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) is facing a class-action lawsuit from investors who allege the pharmaceutical giant misled them about the prospects of its experimental obesity drug, CagriSema. Hagens Berman urges investors who purchased Novo Nordisk shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge of the trial and its design to contact the firm’s attorneys. Class Period: Nov. 2, 2022 – Dec. 19, 2024Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Mar. 25, 2025 Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/nvo Contact the Firm Now: NVO@hbsslaw.com | 844-916-0895 Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Securities Class Action: The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713, accuses the company and certain top executives of securities violations related to disclosures about the drug’s Phase 3 trial, dubbed REDEFINE-1. The plaintiffs, representing investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities between Nov. 2, 2022, and Dec. 19, 2024, claim the company misrepresented the likelihood of CagriSema achieving at least 25% weight loss in the study. The suit alleges that Novo Nordisk created a “false impression” of reliable data supporting this projection, while downplaying concerns about dosage tolerability. Specifically, the lawsuit contends that the company’s “repeated optimistic claims” about CagriSema’s potential fell short of reality. It further argues that the trial’s “flexible protocol,” which allowed patients to adjust their dosage, hampered the study’s ability to accurately assess weight loss at the tested dosage. This, the suit suggests, indicates either worse-than-anticipated tolerability, forcing patients to lower their doses, or a rushed patient selection process that included individuals not aiming for the targeted 25% weight loss. The complaint highlights the company’s December 20, 2024, announcement of headline results from the REDEFINE-1 trial. The disclosure revealed that the study utilized a flexible dosing protocol and that, after 68 weeks, only 57.3% of patients on CagriSema were on the highest dose, compared to 82.5% for cagrilintide and 70.2% for semaglutide, the other drugs being compared. Following this announcement, Novo Nordisk’s stock price dropped nearly 18%, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs argue this decline demonstrates the impact of the alleged misrepresentations on investors. Shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the complaint’s allegations. “We’re examining whether Novo Nordisk may have intentionally misled investors about the trial’s design and potential tolerability issues,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

ByJoe Cornell ByJoe Cornell Contributor. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) Deal OverviewAs per media articles on March 17, 2025, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN; $196.21, Market Capitalization: $2.1 trillion), the world’s largest e-commerce company, is considering spinning off its India business and listing it on the domestic stock market. If implemented, this strategy would enable Amazon to strengthen its foothold in one of the rapidly expanding digital markets while adhering to India’s stringent e-commerce regulations. Data localization requirements and the ability to maintain direct inventory are among the key factors driving this consideration. Indian regulations only permit domestic companies to use an inventory model in e-commerce, limiting foreign players like Amazon from operating under a marketplace model. Post-separation, Amazon India (SpinCo) would retain its existing operations, including an online marketplace, which would continue to offer a diverse range of products across various categories to cater to the Indian market. In addition to its e-commerce platform, it will also continue to own Amazon Prime platform for an expedited shipping and streaming service, Amazon Pay for digital payments, and Amazon Business for B2B transactions. Amazon.com Inc Price Performance Spin-Off Details and Top 5 Shareholders On the other hand, Amazon (RemainCo) would remain focused on its core operations, including e-commerce, cloud computing, online advertising, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence services. The separation would enable the company to allocate resources more efficiently while allowing Amazon India to focus on local expansion and innovation. Amazon has begun conversations with banking advisors regarding a potential spin-off and local listing in India. Recently, the company’s management, including senior executives from India and the US, held discussions with a couple of investment bankers, including its Wall Street banker, JP Morgan. While these discussions are in the preliminary stages, they signify Amazon’s intent to adapt its business model to better align with local market dynamics and regulatory frameworks. Deal Rationale Amazon India, a subsidiary of Amazon.com, Inc., operates as an online marketplace, offering various products across various categories to cater to the Indian market. In addition to its e-commerce platform, Amazon India provides services such as Amazon Prime for an expedited shipping and streaming service, Amazon Pay for digital payments, and Amazon Business for B2B transactions. Amazon’s consideration to spin off its Indian division and pursue a domestic listing is likely influenced by several strategic factors dependent on the dynamics of the Indian market. One of the key factors is India’s regulatory framework, which prohibits companies with foreign direct investment of 51.0% or more from running inventory based e-commerce operations. These regulations mandate that foreign companies function as marketplaces connecting buyers and sellers, limiting their control over inventory management. In contrast, domestic companies can manage inventory directly, enabling faster deliveries, improved branding, and reduced shipping costs. By spinning off its Indian operations into a locally listed entity, Amazon could potentially navigate these restrictions more effectively, aligning its business model with local regulations. Another significant factor is data localization. Indian regulations mandate that data generated within the country must be stored locally. By creating a separate entity for its Indian operations, Amazon can ensure compliance with these regulations more effectively, thereby avoiding potential legal and operational challenges. In recent years, Amazon has also faced certain challenges in India, losing market share to Flipkart, which now holds around half of the country’s e-commerce market. Furthermore, it is encountering increasing competition from SoftBank-backed Meesho, which recently raised over $500 million in new funding. The company’s recent struggles in the quick commerce segment have also likely influenced the spin-off decision. While pilot services have begun, it faces stiff competition from established players such as Flipkart’s Minutes, JioMart, Swiggy Instamart, Blinkit, and Zepto, all of which have a strong foothold in the segment. A spin-off could enable Amazon to compete more effectively by aligning its operations closely with local market dynamics. The Indian e-commerce market is projected to grow from $123 billion in 2024 to $292.3 billion in 2028, reflecting a CAGR of 18.7%. This rapid growth presents a compelling opportunity for Amazon. A more autonomous and locally attuned entity would position Amazon to capitalize on this growth. We believe, a spinoff would enable the company to tailor its strategies more precisely to local consumer behaviors and preferences, enhancing its competitiveness against domestic rivals. In summary, Amazon’s potential spinoff and domestic listing of its Indian business are driven by regulatory navigation, market growth opportunities, and localization strategies. This strategic move aims to align Amazon’s operations more closely with India’s unique market dynamics, positioning it for sustained success in the region.

Title: Novo Nordisk's weight loss drug Wegovy is now cheaper for even more patients

Time Published: 2025-03-24T16:30:00Z

Novo Nordisk (NVO-2.01%), the maker of the blockbuster drug Ozempic, is cutting the price of its weight loss drug by more than half for even more patients that pay without insurance. The Danish pharma giant announced today that it is expanding its savings program, offering Wegovy for $499 a month at all local pharmacies in the U.S. That marks a steep discount — more than 60% off the drug’s $1,349.02 list price. Previously, this reduced price was only available through Novo Nordisk’s direct-to-consumer service, NovoCare Pharmacy. “At Novo Nordisk, we are committed to developing innovative medicines and will continue to prioritize making them accessible to and affordable for the communities we serve,” said Dave Moore, executive vice president of U.S. operations at Novo Nordisk, in a statement. “With the evolution of our Wegovy savings program, we continue to deliver options that empower people living with obesity to more easily pursue their weight management and health goals.” The expanded program offers relief for those without insurance coverage for obesity medications. Patients paying out of pocket can now get a 28-day supply of Wegovy for $499 at their local pharmacy, down from the savings program’s previous $650 monthly price. Those with commercial insurance that covers Wegovy may pay as little as $0 per month, with savings of up to $225 per 28-day supply. However, the discounts do not apply to patients on government-funded healthcare programs. Eli Lilly launched a similar offer last year through its direct-to-consumer program, selling the lowest doses of its weight loss drug Zepbound starting at $399. However, the medication came in single-dose vials, requiring patients to use a traditional syringe instead of the more convenient auto-injector pen that treatment usually comes in. Since then, the company has lowered the price and expanded the program to include all dose sizes. The program has since been integrated into several telehealth platforms including Ro, and more recently, Costco-partner Sesame. Novo Nordisk’s announcement comes as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently removed semaglutide — the active ingredient in Wegovy and Zepbound — from its drug shortage list. The move put pressure on companies that have been able to sell off-brand, or compounded, versions of the drug amid past shortages. The FDA said that state-licensed pharmacies and physicians, known as 503A compounders, must stop making and distributing off-brand semaglutide products by April 22. Outsourcing facilities, known as 503B’s, have until May 22 to do the same. In its press release, Novo Nordisk said the updated savings program is meant to help patients “avoid the significant risks that can be posed by the compounding marketplace.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

March 24, 2025 12:00 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, March 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming April 14, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Merck & Co (“Merck” or the “Company”) (NYSE: MRK) securities between February 3, 2022, to February 3, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR MERCK INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On July 30, 2024, Merck released its second quarter 2024 financial report and disclosed a significant reduction in Gardasil vaccinations, resulting in an overabundance of inventory at Merck’s Chinese distributor. The Company announced that its shipments of Gardasil to China may fall below contracted levels for 2024. On this news, Merck’s stock price fell $12.53, or 9.8%, to close at $115.25 per share on July 30, 2024, thereby injuring investors. Then, on February 4, 2025, Merck disclosed that it would entirely cease shipments of Gardasil to China “through at least midyear” to facilitate a “rapid reduction of inventory,” citing a continued over-inflation of channel inventories as demand in China had “not recovered to the level [the Company] had expected.” Merck also announced that it would no longer achieve its long-forecasted $11 billion in sales of Gardasil by 2030. On this news, Merck’s stock price fell $9.05, or 9.1%, to close at $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025, thereby injuring investors further. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor; and (2) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Merck securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than April 14, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Magnificent 7 stocks rose during Monday morning trading after reports that the Trump administration is considering excluding some tariffs that are set to go into place on April 2. Microsoft (MSFT+0.36%) and Apple (AAPL+1.32%) stocks were up by less than 1%, while Alphabet (GOOGL-1.38%) rose by 1.2% at the market open. Amazon (AMZN+0.40%) and Nvidia (NVDA-1.18%) were up by more than 2% during early morning trading, while Meta (META-0.90%) rose by close to 4%, and Tesla (TSLA+2.13%) climbed by more than 5%. Tesla stock was up by more than 4% before the market open on Monday, while shares of Meta, Nvidia, and Amazon were up by more than 2% during pre-market trading. Alphabet, Apple, and Microsoft stocks were all up by more than 1%. S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures all gained in pre-market trading after Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal reported that the White House is narrowing its focus for reciprocal tariffs that President Donald Trump will announce on April 2. The Trump administration will exclude some of the reciprocal tariffs it plans to put on other countries, including U.S. allies, on April 2, Bloomberg reported, citing officials familiar with the matter. Additionally, Trump will reportedly not announce the separate, industry-specific tariffs that he has previously spoken about. Countries without tariffs on the U.S. or that have a trade surplus with the U.S. will not be targeted by the reciprocal tariffs, an official told Bloomberg. However, President Trump reportedly wants to announce rates that are effective immediately. “April 2nd is going to be liberation day for America,” Trump reportedly said on Friday. “We’ve been ripped off by every country in the world, friend and foe.” He added that the tariffs will bring the U.S. “tens of billions.” Despite a more targeted approach, the tariffs will still largely impact major U.S. import partners, the Wall Street Journal reported. The White House reportedly now is focused on implementing tariffs on about 15% of nations with which the U.S. has an ongoing trade imbalance.

Title: How India's market slump impacts small investors
URL: https://www.dw.com/en/how-indias-market-slump-impacts-small-investors/a-72019078
Time Published: 2025-03-24T13:37:00Z

Trump's tariff threats have rattled global markets. But in India, the market slump isn't just about the new US president. Millions of small investors are feeling the squeeze, for other reasons than a trade war. It was FOMO, or Fear of Missing Out, that got Kanishk* to start investing in the stock market. He told DW that as India battled the second wave of COVID-19 in 2021, he started noticing ads on Instagram featuring social media influencers giving money-making tips. "I didn't want to miss out on this — the way people were making money. That, I would say, is the first thing that got me into the market," Kanishk said. He explained how, after initially investing in mutual funds, he gradually moved to trading on the stock market. Like a lot of amateur investors, he had no clue about the fundamentals of investing, he said, but he kept up with the market trends, "especially on Reddit," the US-based social media platform. And in the beginning, "everything was great." To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Saloni Puj* and Ishan Shah shared similar stories to Kanishk's. Both Puj, a media professional from Kolkata, the capital of the state of West Bengal, and Shah, who runs a cultural center that teaches art and music in the western city of Ahmedabad, also started trading in the stock market sometime during the pandemic lockdown. "The market was doing so well it felt anyone who was making any money was making it in the markets," Shah said, who added that he bought random stocks, sometimes based on the recommendations of others. "Weirdly, whatever I did, I kept making money." Puj took a more guarded approach. "I knew that the market [was] in a euphoria stage, I was very aware of the bubble that was happening," she said. Then came September 2024 and all three were hit hard when the bubble burst. After months of rallying, the market eventually corrected, followed by a monthslong slump. For most Indians who started trading on the stock markets, the rally after the pandemic slump was a great time. It reflected the $275 billion (€250 billion) economic stimulus package Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government had injected in 2020. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video In lockdown, a lot of people had more time and disposable income, and many were influenced by the idea of making some quick and easy money. "During COVID, people had surplus cash, and a large number of young investors entered the capital markets as retail investors," said Sagun Agrawal, a derivatives trader in the Indian capital markets and a financial literacy advocate for women. "This was positive for the markets as it boosted liquidity and created investable funds for capital formation." Online trading has become more popular thanks to new companies offering low brokerage fees and easy access to credit. One such option is Margin Trading Facility (MTF), which lets traders buy shares by paying only part of the cost upfront. The brokerage covers the rest as a loan, with interest. National Stock Exchange (NSE) data showed that between March 2020 and March 2024, the number of registered investors in India almost tripled to 92 million. India's NIFTY 50 stock market index went from about 8,000 points in March 2020 to record levels of more than 26,000 points in September 2024. For the retail investors caught up in the euphoria, it felt like nothing could go wrong — until it did. In the months since September last year, Indian equities have lost more than $1.2 trillion in value. In February, the NIFTY 50 benchmark index was down 16% from its peak, and on its longest losing streak since 1996. It was the worst performing global market. Small retail investors were among the worst hit. "Many of these [retail] investors were uninformed and chased hyped-up securities, leading to froth in the market. As corrections took place over the last six months, these investors faced major financial setbacks," said Agrawal. Bijoy Peter, a senior partner at Bangalore-based Germinate Investor Services, said one of the reasons for the market correction was the disparity between the soaring valuations of corporate India and their declining earnings. India's GDP growth had also slowed to 5.4% in the July-September 2024 quarter, he said. He also pointed to a lack of government spending in infrastructure and other sectors at the time, as well as other global factors. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) started pulling their money out of India. China started implementing significant stimulus measures in its market, which contributed to money moving there, he said. This movement of money out of India had a huge impact. "When such a large sum moves out, the effect is massive because investors have to sell their holdings. Selling at that magnitude has a huge impact on stock prices," Peter said. "As a result, the market began to fall." Peter added that a lot of positive developments initiated by the government had been overlooked by the market — including an increase in tax limits, measures taken by the Reserve Bank of India to inject liquidity into the banking system, as well as the announcement of increased infrastructure spending. Agrawal also noted that last September, the real sellers were Indian High-Net-Worth Individuals (HNIs) and high-value investors. They sensed that the market was overvalued and had limited scope for further upside, she said. "The major investors pulled their money out of the market, causing the decline, while smaller investors were left to bear the losses," one trader, who asked not to be named, told DW. While Indian markets have been navigating stormy waters over the last five months, some said the situation was starting to look up with the stock market experiencing significant gains last week. However, investors remained cautious amid US President Donald Trump's threats to impose reciprocal tariffs on India from April 2, calling India "a very big abuser" of tariffs. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video New Delhi has said that it is in negotiations with the US to establish a trade framework addressing levies and market access. Economist Dr. Surjit Bhalla, former executive director for India at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and a member of the Economic Advisory Council to the second Modi government, said he was feeling bullish as Trump "has presented India with a unique opportunity for reform." "We've never had a chance like this before, particularly in areas like trade, foreign direct investment, and other key factors that drive GDP growth and profits." "For us, this is a crucial moment to implement much-needed reforms, both in the external sector and domestically, including areas like agriculture," Bhalla said. "This could be India's opportunity to advance to the next stage of reforms." Meanwhile, retail investors such as Kanishk, Shah and Puj, having survived hard times in the past few months, are bracing for the possible impact of Trump's threatened tariffs, while keeping their fingers crossed. Kanishk said he was more cautious now after the slump and was "taking the words of the finance influencer with a pinch of salt." Shah stopped trading about a year ago, sometimes reflecting on whether it was too early. "But seeing how stressed everyone is, I feel I might have dodged a bullet," he said. Puj has reworked her investment strategy altogether, she is staying put and buying only in small quantities when markets are down. Having seen all her investments in the red not too long ago, she said she is wiser now, adding, "Going down is not so fun." *names changed on request Edited by: Keith Walker

To test his theory, Kendrick created a hypothetical "Mag 7B" index, a spin on the Magnificent 7 index, that replaces Tesla with Bitcoin. Normally, the Mag 7 refers to tech giants Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and Tesla. And traders who had done so in 2017 would be up 5% now, he concluded. If you add Bitcoin to the mix, its $1.7 trillion market capitalization makes it the sixth largest among the group. At the time of writing, Bitcoin has been retracing slightly after getting close to retaking $88,000. BTC has gained 3.7% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data. There's more evidence that traders are feeling less uncertain. Open interest in Bitcoin futures contracts has swelled by more than 10% in the past day, according to CoinGlass data. There are currently $57 billion worth of open Bitcoin derivatives contracts. Earlier this month, when markets were acutely feeling the effects of President Donald Trump's tariff troubles, that figure had dropped as low as $45 billion. But now that macroeconomic jitters have eased, traders seem more comfortable buying back into BTC. If BTC had been swapped into the altered Mag7 index—starting in 2017, when Bitcoin had just hit what was then an all-time high—it would have outperformed the Mag 7 by about 5%, Kendrick writes. In addition, traders who swapped Bitcoin for TSLA over the past seven years would have seen fewer price fluctuations, as well. "Perhaps more importantly than returns is Mag 7B’s lower volatility relative to Mag 7 in every year," he added. "Over the full period, average annualized volatility is almost 2% lower for Mag 7B than for Mag 7." Stock correlations have been a hotly contested topic among Bitcoin investors. In the last quarter of 2024, BTC appeared to break away from gold and equities completely and outperformed "every asset class," NYDIG noted. "Furthermore, during the period since President Trump’s inauguration on 20 January, BTC has traded like most of the Mag 7 stocks," Kendrick wrote. "If we compare price declines against [volume] levels over this period, BTC trades in a similar vol-adjusted fashion to NVDA, while TSLA trades a lot like ETH."

March 24, 2025 09:00 ET | Source: Rev Rev AUSTIN, Texas, March 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rev, the world’s most accurate speech-to-text technology company, today announced it has acquired SmartDepo, the legal industry’s most trusted and comprehensive solution for AI-powered deposition summaries. The acquisition unites two companies devoted to quality and accuracy, offering best-in-class tools that allow law firms and court reporting agencies to focus on client interactions and case strategy instead of countless hours manually reviewing and organizing testimony. Started in 2023 by a civil rights lawyer, SmartDepo offers the most thorough deposition summaries available. Summaries are designed to meet specific needs of legal professionals with page-line citations that capture every detail, allowing them to excerpt quickly and bracket precise and contextually relevant citations to present in court documents and proceedings. SmartDepo’s patent-pending AI technology produces summaries within minutes, not days, including 100% accurate page-line citations, hyperlinked tables of contents, a key admissions analysis, and a Deposition Memo, which surfaces the most salient themes discussed. SmartDepo uniquely introduces a human-in-the-loop, whereby every summary undergoes rigorous quality checks to ensure the highest quality standards. “The legal industry is ripe for AI innovation, but it can be difficult to translate exactly how AI tools can be most helpful to lawyers in their day-to-day work," said Isaac Manoff, Esq., CEO and Co-Founder of SmartDepo. "Drawing on my own experience as a lawyer, we were able to create a solution that addresses a real pain point in this profession. Being chosen by many top law firms and several of the nation's largest court reporting agencies within two years speaks to the market demand, and to the impact of AI tools that are purpose-built for specific industry needs. The alignment between our company missions is perfect, as both Rev and SmartDepo were founded on an unwavering commitment to quality and accuracy at our core. As a lawyer, there's simply no room for error. I'm excited for the future as we work together to create products that deliver the highest standards of precision while promoting efficiency and justice in the legal system.” SmartDepo's summarization tools perfectly complement Rev, which delivers industry-leading ~96% accurate AI transcription and >99% accuracy with human review — all designed to increase attorney and court reporter productivity, reduce fatigue, and optimize client outcomes. Unlike generic AI summary tools, SmartDepo was built by lawyers for lawyers, with a deep understanding that legal professionals need comprehensive organization with precise topic identification and page-line citations—not just condensed text. Rev's transcriptions are upwards of 60% more accurate than competitors like Google and Microsoft, even in tough audio conditions, and the company has processed over 18 billion words from 7 million hours of human speech data while serving AM Law 100 firms and leading court reporting agencies for more than 12 years. As Rev and SmartDepo move forward together, they remain committed to delivering top-tier legal AI solutions for law firms and court reporting agencies. This acquisition will broaden both companies' range of offerings, delivering greater value to meet the evolving needs of their legal partners. SmartDepo’s Manoff will stay on as an advisor, helping oversee a smooth transition. SmartDepo CCO and Co-Founder Ely Cohn will assume the position of General Manager of SmartDepo, ensuring continuity and growth for existing customers. “SmartDepo’s technology is a game-changer for law firms and court-reporting agencies in terms of efficiency,” said Jason Chicola, CEO and Founder of Rev. “As Rev increases our investment in supporting the legal field—which relies intrinsically on accuracy and quality—we saw a massive opportunity with SmartDepo to do more for our clients. Rev is trusted by court reporting agencies and law firms for generating the best instant AI transcripts of meetings and digital evidence. By adding the highest-quality deposition summarization tool on the market, we’re establishing Rev as the go-to AI partner for legal professionals looking to record and transcribe case materials, connect key themes, and reveal case-winning insights.” This strategic acquisition accelerates Rev's capabilities in the legal category.

Title: Five Foreign Stocks Worth Considering As U.S. Market Lags
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/johndorfman/2025/03/24/five-foreign-stocks-worth-considering-as-us-market-lags/

ByJohn Dorfman ByJohn Dorfman Contributor. Scene in Paris, France, before the 2024 Olympics. France is one of several countries whose stock ... More markets are outperforming the U.S. market so far this year. (Photo by Kevin Voigt/GettyImages) This year through March 21, stocks were up 9% in France, 15% in Germany, and 18% in Hong Kong. In the U.S. stocks were down 3%. A little international diversification might be a good idea, especially with U.S. stocks currently on the expensive side. Yet many American investors have 100% of their portfolios in U.S.-based companies. If you want a few international stocks in your portfolio, here are five that I think are worthy of consideration. In Germany, I like Hannover Rueck SE (HVRRY) a reinsurance company (an insurer to insurers) based in Hannover. It gets about 18% of its revenue in Europe, 16% in Britain, 42% in North America, and 24% in the rest of the world. Hannover Rueck has notched a profit in 22 of the past 23 years. It had a modest loss in 2008, the height of the great financial crisis. The stock seems moderately valued to me, selling for 14 times recent earnings, and is up 16% this year. In Japan, I’m drawn to Hikari Tsushin Inc. (HKTGF), which sells networking and automation products to small and medium-sized businesses. For example, it offers routers, LED lighting and water coolers. It has grown its earnings at a 22% annual clip over the past decade, though revenue growth was considerably slower. The stock sells for only 11 times recent earnings. It’s up about 6% this year. In France, I’m partial to Total Energies SE (TTE). It’s France’s biggest oil company and is also active in solar and wind energy. The stock weighs in at less than 10 times earnings, 0.8 times revenue and 1.2 times book value (corporate net worth per share), even though it’s up 15% year-to-date. The company produces or sells energy in 120 countries. It has attracted both praise and criticism for its close relationship with the French government, and for dealing with Russia and China. I’m almost entirely out of China these days, mostly because I dislike the governing philosophy and methods of President Xi Jinping. I have no Chinese stocks for most clients, and only one small holding in my hedge fund. Nonetheless, many Chinese stocks are cheap at the moment. One is JD.com Inc. (JD), which is one of the three largest e-commerce companies in China. (Alibaba is the largest; JD.com and Pinduoduo fight for second.) JD.com has increased its sales at a 34% annual pace over the past decade. The stock, up 23% this year, still sells for only 11 times earnings. What company manufactures semiconductor chips for Apple, Nvidia and Qualcomm? The answer is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), universally recognized as the world’s most advanced chip maker. Taiwan Semiconductor boasts a net profit margin of about 40%, a return on equity of more than 30%, and five-year earnings growth exceeding 25%. If a U.S. company posted numbers like that, I believe it would be priced in the stratosphere. Taiwan Semiconductor sells for 25 times recent earnings, not cheap but not terribly expensive either. That’s because the threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan hangs over its head like a sword of Damocles. Foreign stocks are riskier than American ones in some respects. Most countries have accounting standards less rigorous than those in the U.S., and less vigorous enforcement of those standards. Many countries have economic swings wider than those in America. In some countries, expropriation is a risk. Also, investment gains can sometimes be wiped out by currency fluctuations. If you make, say, a 10% gain in Euros, but the dollar appreciates 11% against the Euro, you have a loss. This is the 20th column I’ve written since 1998 recommending some non-U.S. stocks. The average one-year return on the recommendations in my previous 19 columns has been 14.4%. That edges out the average return on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Total Return Index for the same periods, at 14.2%. My most recent column on the subject (January 2023) pulled down my batting average. My picks advanced 7.6% in 12 months, while the S&P 500 roared ahead 24.6%. My best pick was Itochu Corp (ITOCF) of Japan, up 40%. Worst was Aurubis AG (AIAGY) of Germany, down 28%. Of the 19 columns, 15 were profitable but only nine beat the S&P 500. Bear in mind that my column results are hypothetical and shouldn’t be confused with results I obtain for clients. Also, past performance doesn’t predict the future. Disclosure: I own Total Energies and Taiwan Semiconductor personally and for most of my clients.

Stocks extended gains as an economic indicator — the March flash Purchasing Mangers Index (PMI) — improved by more than expected. The S&P 500, the Nasdaq 100, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average had all gained at the open following reports that the Trump administration may take a more-targeted approach than initially planned on tariffs it’s set to roll out on April 2. The White House will probably omit industry-specific tariffs but apply reciprocal levies on nations that account for the bulk of trade with the U.S., the Wall Street Journal (NWSA-1.66%) said, citing an unidentified Trump administration official. With investors uncertain about what will materialize from Donald Trump’s plans — especially over trade — economic indicators are set to be in focus this week. The preliminary composite purchasing manager index (PMI) for March rose to 53.5 — consensus had been for 51.7 — from 51.6 in February, driven by an unexpected jump in the services reading to 54.3 from 51.0. The manufacturing measure worsened by more than expected to 49.8. Any number below 50 indicates a contraction. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney called a snap election for April 28 over the weekend. His ruling Liberal party is leading in some polls. The ShopTalk Conference starts in Las Vegas on Monday and runs through Thursday. It will focus on the future of retail and e-commerce. Here are some stocks to watch today: Bayer’s (BAYRY+0.33%) ADRs fell 7.4%. The chemical company was ordered by a Georgia jury to pay about $2.1 billion to a plaintiff who claimed its Roundup weedkiller caused cancer, Bloomberg reported. The company said it plans to appeal the verdict. The company has won 17 out of the last 25 trials over the issue. James Hardie (JHX+3.19%) stock fell 16% after unveiling an agreement on Sunday to buy AZEK (AZEK+2.15%) for a total of $8.75 billion, including debt. AZEK investors will receive $26.45 in cash and 1.0340 James Hardie shares for each of their shares. AZEK surged 18%. Both companies make construction materials. MicroStrategy’s (MSTR-1.24%) stock jumped 5.6% after the tech company said it now owns 506,137 Bitcoins. Nvidia’s (NVDA-1.18%) and Palantir’s (PLTR-1.13%) shares rose by about 2% and 5.4%, respectively. Bloomberg News reported that Jack Ma’s Ant Group (BABA+3.06%) has used China-made semiconductors to develop techniques for training AI models that would cut costs by 20%. Tesla’s (TSLA+2.13%) stock gained about 7.7%, extending Friday’s 5.3% gain. The shares have still lost about 19% of their value over the past month.

March 24, 2025 08:00 ET | Source: Adagene Inc. Adagene Inc. Muzastotug Phase 2 dose expansion in MSS CRC with a 20 mg/kg loading dose regimen shows 33% overall response rate with four confirmed partial responses SAFEbody technology utilized to create masked T cell engagers for potentially superior safety profile with enhanced therapeutic index Cash balance of $85.2 million provides runway into late 2026 SAN DIEGO and SUZHOU, China, March 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Adagene Inc. (“Adagene”) (Nasdaq: ADAG), a platform-driven, clinical-stage biotechnology company transforming the discovery and development of novel anti-body-based therapies, today reported financial results for the full year 2024 and provided corporate updates. “The clinical data we generated in 2024 with ADG126 gives us great confidence in our ability to provide patients with colorectal cancer a tolerable, efficacious treatment option. These data also provide the basis for us to expand our study in microsatellite stable colorectal cancer (MSS CRC) to include earlier lines of therapy and patients with liver metastases, a patient subpopulation that has historically seen little to no benefit from checkpoint inhibitors,” said Peter Luo, Ph.D., Chairman, CEO and President of R&D at Adagene. “Regulatory T cells, a primary mechanism of resistance, can be overcome through higher and more frequent dosing of a conditionally active anti-CTLA-4 antibody. We continue to believe that anti-CTLA-4 therapy can transform immunotherapy in combination with anti-PD-1 and other therapies. Our SAFEbody masking capability enables the best therapeutic index among all CTLA-4 programs, showing the potential to unlock therapeutic value with a target previously limited by safety concerns.” Dr. Luo continued, “In addition to ADG126, we have also utilized our SAFEbody masking technology to create T cell engagers (TCEs) that can link T cells to any number of antigens presented on tumor cells. These masked TCEs can recruit the immune system for conditional cytotoxicity, shrinking tumors and prolonging patient survival. The combination of TCEs with ADG126, which depletes CTLA-4 mediated regulatory T cells, is expected to enhance the response to TCE therapy. We look forward to sharing more on our TCE programs going forward.” PIPELINE HIGHLIGHTS ADG126 - Phase 1b/2 data: ADG138, a SAFEbody engineered T cell engager targeting HER2, has shown a wide therapeutic window and extended half-life for prolonged circulation in the tumor micro-environment in preclinical models. ADG138 is currently IND-ready. ADG152, a SAFEbody engineered T cell engager targeting CD20, is designed to conditionally bind to CD20 on tumor cells and show negligible interaction with healthy cells, yielding a 100-fold reduction in cytokine release syndrome in preclinical models. ADG152 is currently in the IND-enabling phase. The Company is pursuing strategic partnerships to advance the SAFEbody T cell engager programs. ONGOING COLLABORATIONS Exelixis: In June 2023, Adagene received a US$3.0 million milestone payment from Exelixis for the successful nomination of lead SAFEbody candidates for the second collaboration program under a technology licensing agreement to develop novel masked antibody-drug conjugate candidates. Including upfront and other milestone payments, we have received over US$18 million in total from Exelixis to date. Sanofi: Adagene and Sanofi are collaborating to develop both bispecific and monoclonal SAFEbody antibody candidates, preparing preclinical candidates using Adagene’s SAFEbody precision masking technology for future development and commercialization by Sanofi. The collaboration announced in March 2022 included an upfront payment of US$17.5 million for the initial two programs, an option fee for two additional programs, potential milestone payments of up to US$2.5 billion, and tiered royalties. Roche: Roche is sponsoring and conducting a phase 1b/2 multi-national trial to evaluate ADG126 in a triple combination with atezolizumab and bevacizumab in first-line hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To date, the combination has been well tolerated. Adagene retains global development and commercialization rights to ADG126. 2025 MILESTONES & CASH RUNWAY Consistent with ongoing initiatives to prudently manage its cash balance, Adagene expects its current cash balance to fund activities into late 2026, with the following milestones expected in 2025: CORPORATE UPDATES JC Xu, M.D., Ph.D., Adagene’s Chief Strategy Officer and Head of Regulatory Affairs, has recently transitioned from a full-time employee of Adagene to a consulting role. JC will continue to support the Company’s development while serving as a consultant. Ms. Yumeng Wang, a member of Adagene’s Board of Directors and a Vice President at General Atlantic, will step down from the Board upon filing of the Company’s 2024 Annual Report on form 20-F due to personal reason. Ms. Wang has served on Adagene’s Board since 2023 and provided invaluable guidance as Adagene has developed ADG126 through first-in-human clinical trials. Mervyn Turner, Ph.D., Independent Director of Adagene’s Board of Directors, will complete his term as Independent Director concurrent with the filing of the Company’s 2024 Annual Report on form 20-F, and transition to an advisory role. Mr. Turner has served on Adagene’s Board of Directors since April of 2023 and will continue to provide strategic guidance to the Company in this advisory capacity. FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents were US$85.2 million as of December 31, 2024, compared to US$109.9 million as of December 31, 2023. Total borrowings from commercial banks in China (denominated in RMB) decreased to US$18.2 million as of December 31, 2024 from US$21.9 million as of December 31, 2023. The associated loan proceeds were primarily used to support the company’s R&D activities. Net Revenue: Net revenue was US$0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to US$18.1 million in 2023. Research and Development (R&D) Expenses: R&D expenses were US$28.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to US$36.6 million in 2023. The decrease of approximately 21% in R&D expenses reflects clinical focus on and prioritization of the company’s masked, anti-CTLA-4 SAFEbody ADG126. Administrative Expenses: Administrative expenses were US$7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to US$8.7 million in 2023. The decrease was due to both a reduction in personnel and in office-related expenses as a result of cost-control measures. Other Operating Income, Net: Other operating income, net was nil for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to US$3.5 million in 2023. The amount of US$3.5 million included a one-time compensation payment from a contract manufacturer for a preclinical-related outsourcing arrangement. Net Loss: Net loss attributable to Adagene Inc.’s shareholders was US$33.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to US$18.9 million in 2023. Ordinary Shares Outstanding: As of December 31, 2024, there were 58,886,944 ordinary shares issued and outstanding. Each American depository share, or ADS, represents one and one quarter (1.25) ordinary shares of the company. Non-GAAP Net Loss: Non-GAAP net loss, which is defined as net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders for the period after excluding share-based compensation expenses, was US$28.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to US$11.7 million in 2023. Please refer to the section in this press release titled “Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” for details. Non-GAAP Financial Measures: The company uses non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per ordinary shares for the year, which are non-GAAP financial measures, in evaluating its operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes. The company believes that non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per ordinary shares for the year help identify underlying trends in the company’s business that could otherwise be distorted by the effect of certain expenses that the company includes in its loss for the year. The company believes that non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per ordinary shares for the year provide useful information about its results of operations, enhances the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects and allows for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by its management in its financial and operational decision-making. Non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per ordinary shares for the year should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to operating profit, loss for the year or any other measure of performance or as an indicator of its operating performance. Investors are encouraged to review non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per ordinary shares for the year and the reconciliation to their most directly comparable GAAP measures. Non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per ordinary shares for the year here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to the company’s data. The company encourages investors and others to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. Non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per ordinary shares for the year represent net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders for the year excluding share-based compensation expenses. Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense arising from the grant of stock-based awards to employees. The company believes that the exclusion of share-based compensation expenses from the net loss in the “Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” assists management and investors in making meaningful period-to-period comparisons in the company's operating performance or peer group comparisons because (i) the amount of share-based compensation expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the company’s underlying performance, (ii) such expenses can vary significantly between periods as a result of the timing of grants of new stock-based awards, and (iii) other companies may use different forms of employee compensation or different valuation methodologies for their share-based compensation. Please see the “Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” included in this press release for a full reconciliation of non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per ordinary shares for the year to net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders for the year.

Good morning. Baby boomers' hopes for a comfortable retirement could be at risk if the stock market keeps falling. Financial experts shared key strategies with BI to help protect their savings. In today's big story, female executives are fed up with alpha male CEOs acting like "billionaire boys in the sandbox." Now, they're fighting back. What's on deck Markets: Faith-based investing is having a moment. (And we don't mean confidence.) Tech: Cybersecurity researchers are role-playing with ChatGPT. Business: The rich are taking to the skies for their commutes — Ubers be damned. But first, deprogramming the bro-code. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Lately, boardrooms are brimming with the bro-ish bravado you'd expect to find in a locker room. A buff Mark Zuckerberg wants Meta to celebrate a culture of "aggression." He also likes martial arts and butchering his own meat. 200 push-ups while wearing a weighted vest? No problem. Jeff Bezos (also now buff) laid down the hammer at The Washington Post, demanding editors give him a "hell yes" to affirm they're all in on "personal liberties and free markets." Let's not forget Elon Musk, who over the last several years, has been challenging anyone from Zuckerberg to Vladimir Putin to single combat. Not in the least surprised by all this chest-thumping: women in business. The return of the alpha male CEO has engendered a new opponent, BI's Amanda Hoover writes. Female executives are fed up with the "billionaire boys in the sandbox," as one sociologist put it — and instead of waiting to be let in, some are building their own arenas. Fabrik founder Jaclyn Pascocello told BI that she is seeing a collective of women coming together and starting to build companies to address issues sometimes ignored by men. When companies won't offer the flexibility that working parents need, it can embolden people to become more entrepreneurial and build under their own terms. "Oftentimes the easiest way to find that is to build it yourself," Pascocello said. Amanda spoke with female founders, psychologists, and sociologists about the resurgent machoism in corporate America — and how female executives are fighting back. 1. Praying for returns? Look no further than religious ETFs. Faith-based investments are a small part of the ETF world, but rising religious fervor and President Trump's leadership are driving interest. However, these funds can be picky about what to include. 2. President Trump could be making the same mistake as Biden. Trump's economic policies have some worried about a potential recession, and the stock market has taken a hit. With the 2026 midterms not far off, Trump risks political damage by continuing to ignore the elephant in the room. 3. Has bitcoin already peaked this year? Betting markets seem to think so. They expect the cryptocurrency to reach $110,000, barely above its record price. Wall Street bulls beg to differ. 1. Jensen made a joke, but who's laughing? At Nvidia's big AI conference, CEO Jensen Huang joked that new Blackwell GPUs would render the company's older chip models obsolete. Its cloud giant customers might not find that very funny, though, since it would cost them billions. 2. You can get ChatGPT to make password-stealing malware. Just play pretend. Researchers cracked some LLMs' security features to generate code that could breach Google's password manager. The key? Make the chatbot pretend to be a superhero. 3. A former Point72 exec's new data startup wants to level the playing field. Kirk McKeown's Carbon Arc allows small funds and businesses to purchase private data by the megabyte — sometimes for less than $1. The startup's goal is to make it more accessible for anyone looking to trade or feed AI models. 1. Out: Ubering. In: Blading. The wealthy are ditching hired cars for helicopter services like Blade, where a nine-minute ride from Manhattan to JFK airport starts at $95. When a rush-hour Uber in the city can cost more than $100, that sounds like a deal. 2. Law firms split over Trump's attack. Elias Law Group rebuked Trump's Friday memo that warned firms against "frivolous" suits against his administration. Marc Elias said in a statement on Saturday that there would be "no negotiation" about the clients his firm represents. Meanwhile, after Paul Weiss struck a deal with Trump on Friday, its chairman, Brad Karp, sent an email to staff addressing their unease over the decision. 3. Freebies for federal workers. DC businesses are offering perks like free workout classes and financial planning sessions to federal employees as they navigate the uncertainty around their jobs.

Title: SEBI Tightens Social Media Ad Rules for Registered Intermediaries
URL: https://www.medianama.com/2025/03/223-sebi-tightens-social-media-ad-rules-for-registered-intermediaries/
Time Published: 2025-03-24T11:45:21Z
Full Content:
MEDIANAMA Technology and policy in India The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has directed registered intermediaries uploading advertisements on social media platforms to use email IDs and mobile numbers registered on the SEBI intermediary (SI) portal while signing up. In an advisory issued on March 21, the regulator also directed such intermediaries to update their contact details on the SI portal by April 30, 2025. Further, Social Media Platform Providers (SMPPs) like Google and Meta would later conduct advertiser verification of such entities. SEBI’s new guidelines come amid rising frauds in the securities market on social media platforms including YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, X, Telegram, and app stores. The regulator noted the patterns like perpetrators luring victims in the guise of providing online trading courses and seminars, furnishing misleading testimonials, or guaranteeing risk-free returns on social media. Besides this, Ananth Narayan, SEBI’s whole-time member (WTM), also announced in a speech that the regulator, in collaboration with social media companies, has removed 70,000 misleading posts and handles since October 2024. However, this is not the first time SEBI has cautioned users and registered intermediaries of such activities on social media. In December 2024, the Board advised investors to not conduct transactions or share sensitive personal details on unauthorised or unregistered electronic platforms, noting that such platforms violate laws like the Securities Contract (Regulation) Act, 1956 and the SEBI Act, 1992. Previously, in August 2024, the Bombay and National Stock Exchanges furnished a joint report urging investors to refrain from joining social media forums like WhatsApp, Telegram, or Instagram channels providing stock recommendations or falsely offering trading opportunities through fake SEBI-issued certificates. The exchanges also highlighted other illegal online activities like offering “dabba” or illegal trading services, claims to facilitate pre-IPO subscriptions with false promises of assured profits, impersonating applications of registered trading members, etc. The intermediaries clarified that victims of such fraud communications can report these through the Sanchar Saathi Portal, the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal, or the 1930 cybercrime helpline number. Notably, in 2022 SEBI conducted raids in multiple cities across the country for operating Telegram channels which made recommendations of selected listed scrips, creating artificial volume and price rise. In 2024, SEBI also released a consultation paper highlighting when a platform is recognised as a ‘Specified Digital Platform’ (SDP), stipulating that these portals take measures like leveraging AI and ML to curb illegal activity on their platforms and prohibiting associations between unregistered influencers and registered intermediaries. Further, SDPs were directed to enable SEBI and its registered entities to escalate or report unlawful content alongside establishing a mechanism to report misleading content or advertisements. Debating the justification of this regulation, speakers at MediaNama’s discussion on “SEBI Platform and Influencer Regulations” disclosed that the law is all-encompassing and could even impact platforms like WhatsApp where users forward trading advice. Capital Mind Founder and CEO Deepak Shenoy also compared individuals offering free trading advice on platforms like YouTube to similar advice furnished on TV channels, with SEBI cracking down on the former and taking down videos from different creators and channels. Returning to the advisory, it also notes that SMPPs must conduct advertiser verification post the onboarding of such users. Google’s advertiser verification for financial services stipulates that entities must demonstrate that they are licensed by the relevant financial regulatorâSEBI in this caseâand later obtain third-party verification from Google’s vendor G2. Notably, advertisers, such as search engines or e-commerce platforms, who don’t promote financial services but have a “compelling reason to target users” seeking financial advice must also apply to G2. And evidently, only authorised representatives can submit such applications.

New research into how marketers are using AI and key insights into the future of marketing with AI. Updated: 03/24/25 Published: 03/14/25 AI agents are like the backstage crew at the concerts we attend: Operating independently on the backend to deliver a smooth experience on the user end. They power many of the tech we use – and have for a while – but haven’t gotten that visibility until recently. In this article, we’ll break down real-world examples of how AI agents are used across industries. Every time you sift through recommendations on your Netflix, you’re seeing AI agents at work. AI agents take action without constant human intervention by recognizing patterns and predicting behavior. When Netflix is recommending you shows to watch, that rec list has been compiled by an AI agent tasked with analyzing your watch history and ratings for trends and genre preferences. Brands like Amazon, YouTube, and Spotify all use similar agents to personalize user experience. New research into how marketers are using AI and key insights into the future of marketing. All fields are required. Click this link to access this resource at any time. Hotels, ride-hailing apps, and airlines all have one thing in common: Surge pricing – powered by AI agents. These companies operate on a flexible pricing structure that fluctuates based on factors like supply, demand, and user trends. Source Take Lyft for instance. If I order a ride at 2 a.m. on a Saturday during Art Basel, it will surely cost me more than on a Tuesday night at 8 a.m. When the user even places the request for a ride, the AI agent evaluates these factors, sets the price, and responds to the user’s request. OpenAI and Google have both introduced AI agents, – Operator and Mariner respectively – that can search the web independently and serve as a true assistant, filling up shopping carts and getting answers to your most pressing questions. “It can understand that it needs to press a button to make something happen,” Demis Hassabis, who oversees Google’s core A.I. lab, said in an interview with The NYT. “It can take action in the world.” Source While AI assistants escalate support requests and direct users toward self-service options, AI agents are working behind the scenes to: Sites built on user-generated content – think Reddit, YouTube, Meta – require advanced content moderation practices to keep users safe. Human moderators rely on AI agents to do some of the legwork of flagging, reviewing, and sorting content that goes against the site’s policies. Think about how good YouTube has gotten at flagging when a video includes copyrighted music. There’s no human reviewing each upload – instead, Google relies on AI systems to analyze content as they’re uploaded to the site and take actions if they’re not compliant. For instance, on YouTube, an uploaded video will be muted automatically if it includes copyrighted music. On TikTok, a content creator’s video will be first muted, then removed for review. These steps allow moderation teams to focus on higher priority work and automate routine tasks. When you’re spending money on an ad, you’re looking for return on investment (ROI). Doing so entails optimizing your ad after it’s placed – that can mean anything from doubling down on the version that performs the best to customizing the ad based on user history. While this can be done manually, it’s not scalable – and that’s where an AI agent comes in. Based on historical trends and performance data, advertisers can optimize their campaigns in real time, which saves them money and increases ROI. Recruiters on LinkedIn can now automate routine tasks like finding and following up with candidates, and scheduling interviews. Source According to LinkedIn, recruiters report spending around 20 hours a week on these tasks, and these AI agents can cut that time by half – at least. While I haven’t had the chance to (read: the guts to) ride in a Waymo, Google’s robotaxi, I can tell you a bit about how it works. To operate safely, Waymo vehicles must rely on AI systems to perceive their surroundings, understand other drivers’ behaviors, control the vehicle, and make safe driving decisions. It relies on real-time and historical data to guide and adapt its actions. Tesla’s AutoPilot feature is another example of an AI agent at work. The stock market is unpredictable. Imagine if you had an AI agent tracking it during pre- and open market hours to recommend strategies? Beyond recommendations, consumers and businesses alike are beginning to leverage AI agents to make trades based on their own risk profiles and investment strategies. U.S. hospitals and healthcare orgs, like Mayo Clinic, are piloting the use of AI agents for a series of administrative tasks, including: “For some years now, we‘ve collected mountains of data in EHRs and data lakes but struggled to translate those insights into meaningful impact. Too often, it’s added more burden to clinicians instead of relieving it," said the executive director for Atlantic Health System, an org overseeing over 550 medical care sites, to Becker’s Health It. The next time you get a fraud alert notification from your bank, you’ve likely got an AI agent to thank. (Or rather the team who configured it.) In the banking space, AI agents monitor users’ transaction activity and track spending habits. When they flag behaviors that fall outside of routine, they’ll respond by freezing cards, alerting users, and requesting transaction approvals. BMW is one of many companies using AI-powered robots to streamline production lines. They operate through a series of complex AI systems that assign them tasks and program them to adjust their behavior based on historical data. Alongside humans, production lines function much more smoothly, allowing workers to focus on higher-impact tasks that require human oversight. As you can now see, AI agents are working all around us.

Title: Would You Buy a Fighter Jet From Donald Trump?
URL: http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-f-35-fighter-jet-allies.html
Time Published: 2025-03-24T09:00:43Z
Full Content:
Not so long ago, the F-35 fighter jet was the hottest ticket in the international arms market. Though it had suffered teething pains in development, going over budget by 50 percent in its first decade, Lockheed Martin’s Lightning II glowed up into a remarkably capable weapons platform. Stealthy, supersonic, and able to both dogfight and strike targets on the ground, it’s arguably the most sophisticated weapon in the U.S. arsenal and undeniably the most sought-after. As nation after nation held competitions to choose their next frontline fighter, the F-35 came in and trounced its rivals time and again. “I can’t think of a competition that it entered in Europe that it didn’t win,” says Douglas Barrie, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. “Anywhere Lockheed Martin pitched the F-35, it wound up getting chosen.” Today, some 18 years after its first flight, more than 1,000 F-35s are in operation in 20 countries. But then, earlier this month, something happened. One after another, nations that had signed up for the F-35 started voicing qualms. On March 13, Portugal’s defense minister said that the country would cancel plans to buy the plane. Then Canada’s prime minister said it would reconsider its purchase. Germany, too, is said to be wavering in its commitment to the jet. Nothing had changed about the plane’s performance. It’s just that, in the eyes of some international customers, the F-35 can’t fully be trusted anymore because of who is the commander-in-chief. Donald Trump has an affinity for authoritarianism, has exhibited poor treatment of NATO (whose Article 5 obligates collective defense), and, in particular, has threatened to annex Greenland and Canada. “Canada is one of our closest allies, and they have fought with us. They have died with us,” says Cynthia Cook, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “And to have the new president of the United States cast doubt on their independence is really viewed as a challenging pill to swallow. It’s making the U.S. be seen as a less reliable ally.” The long-term effects of America’s heel turn might not just be deleterious for the F-35 program but for the $238 billion U.S. weapons-export industry as a whole, including the recently announced Boeing F-47 next-generation fighter, which could enter service in the 2030s. If the “arsenal of democracy” no longer stands on the side of democracies, what is it good for? To understand why the F-35 is suddenly in trouble, the first thing you need to know is that a state-of-the-art fighter jet isn’t just a physical airframe. It’s both hardware and software, a whole suite of networked systems that requires software patches and data in order to work effectively. It’s a bit like a smartphone: If you don’t update the software, it gradually works less and less well and eventually bricks. The F-35 has to depend on software because of the environment it will fight in. Even though the plane is stealthy, meaning hard to detect by conventional radar, it is not invisible and will not survive long in a modern air-defense environment unless it can track and assess enemy radars and countermeasures. To do that, it needs to constantly update its assessment of the threat environment. That information is stored inside a software package called the mission data file, or MDF. The software is updated by a civilian unit located at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida called the F-35 Partner Support Complex, whose website explains that nations deploying the F-35 “are not allowed to conduct independent test operations” outside the U.S. and that “U.S. citizens perform specific functions in order to protect critical U.S. technology.” In other words, any one nation that flies the F-35 is wholly dependent on the U.S. to keep the planes functioning properly. When the program launched, this provision rankled some allies, but it didn’t prove to be a deal-breaker because it was inconceivable at the time that the U.S. would ever be anything other than a trusted ally. (Israel, presciently, insisted on retaining control of the F-35’s software and today operates the aircraft with considerably more autonomy.) Buying planes that they don’t fully control now looks like an incredibly poor decision. Since Trump took office, Europe’s trust in its ally has withered as the U.S. has pivoted from democracy toward autocracy, increasingly aligned with Europe’s most dangerous adversary, Russia. As the legendary aviation journalist Bill Sweetman writes, “A hypothetical: A crisis is emerging, and U.S. strategy and policy differs from that of a partner nation; the U.S. is not going to intervene militarily at any likely threshold. The pressure point is simple: The door code at Eglin is changed. The partner nation’s people can’t get in.” Effectively, the F-35 is bricked. The delicacy of the situation that Europe now finds itself in goes far beyond the F-35 or any of the other major weapons systems that it is heavily dependent on the U.S. to maintain and operate, like the U.K.’s nuclear-weapons program. It’s that the whole defense edifice, from top to bottom, has been designed with a deep level of interdependence baked in. “One of the strengths of the U.S. defense industrial cooperation is we’re able to incorporate the best offerings from our allies and partners from their technological advances,” Cook says. “It’s something that our adversaries like Russia and China can envy but not replicate.” The idea that the U.S. would just walk away from a global security system that it has spent the better part of a century building and nurturing, and which undergirds the country’s global power, is nearly incomprehensible. For Europeans, it’s a bit like coming home and finding your husband in bed with the au pair. The swiftness and profundity of the betrayal is so enraging that a lifetime of commitment can vanish in an instant. “Since I’ve been born, all I’ve ever known was a U.S. alliance,” says Thomas Withington, a white-haired associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, Britain’s venerable defense think tank. “Occasionally, there’s been good-natured criticism on both sides of the Atlantic. But nobody has ever envisaged a world in which the U.S. and Europe are not very strong security partners. And what’s shocking to me now is that I have a number of friends — mainly French but German and Italian as well — who were quite strong Atlanticists but have totally changed their position in the last two weeks. “I was having a drink with a colleague last week, and he said that he remembered vividly how in the wake of 9/11, the U.S. declared Article 5 and pretty much all allied nations around the world stepped up. And he said, ‘God forbid if that happens again, because we would never assist America in any future wars.’ He was very adamant: Europe must not come to U.S. aid in the future. The U.S. is on its own.” “Trust is hard to win, and it’s really easy to lose,” Barrie says. “Even if this is a four-year blip in terms of the transatlantic relationship, it’s going to take a bit of time to move back toward a more balanced position.” For now, even if Trump’s most ominous pronouncements turn out to be mere bluster, Europe has been forced to confront how exposed it is. With remarkable speed, it has pivoted to the consensus that it needs to achieve self-reliance as quickly as it can, and that means replacing U.S. weapons and capabilities with those of a more dependable origin. With a friendly neighbor locked in an interminable and grinding bloodbath, the sense of urgency is real. As for the U.S., it is hard to see how it is going to come out ahead in this realignment. Trump often talks about rebuilding American manufacturing and restoring American military power around the world, but by torpedoing allies’ trust in us, he has profoundly undermined the strategic capabilities of the U.S. military and tied an anchor around the defense industry, which last year reached a record-breaking $318 billion in overseas sales. “The U.S. defense industry lives off exports,” says Withington. “And anything that that reduces that will have a serious effect — and not only on the defense companies themselves but all of the businesses around them geographically. Think about all of the businesses that support the F-35 line in Fort Worth, everything from sandwich joints to real-estate agents and Uber drivers. There’s a whole ecosystem that’s developed. I saw what happened when the U.K.’s defense industry had to retool post–Cold War. Towns that were dependent on it just died.” If there’s a winner in all this, it’s Vladimir Putin. “If you were to sit down with a blank sheet of paper and say, ‘What are the things, both in terms of domestic and international policy, that an American leader could do that would best suit Russia’s and China’s long-range strategic goals and visions?,’ it looks a lot like the last 70 days,” says Steven Horrell, a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis. Another big beneficiary is European weapons-makers. Amid a planned surge in regional defense spending, French president Emmanuel Macron is pushing the Dassault Rafale as an alternative to the F-35, and Airbus is doing the same with the Eurofighter Typhoon. Sweden’s Saab, which makes the Gripen fighter jet, has seen its share price double since Trump took office, and German arms titan Rheinmetall has also doubled its stock value since last year. “If you’re a European defense aerospace manufacturer,” says Barrie, “somebody else is doing your marketing work for you at the moment, and that’s the U.S.” By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to receive email correspondence from us.

Title: A Tech Billionaire Attacks His Own Kind

Before Alex Karp cofounded Palantir Technologies, the shadowy data analysis firm and defense contractor of which he is now the CEO, he wanted to be an academic social theorist. Upon graduating from Stanford Law School—where he befriended his eventual Palantir cofounder, Peter Thiel—Karp enrolled in a PhD program at Goethe University Frankfurt. There, under the tutelage of a specialist in Freudian psychoanalytic theory, he immersed himself in the thought of the Frankfurt School, the collective of Marxian theorists and cultural critics who inspired student protest movements in the 1960s. It is unclear what led Karp to abandon his high-minded pursuits and build a company whose software has been used by ICE to track down suspected illegal immigrants for deportation, by the U.S. military to target drone strikes, and possibly by the Israel Defense Forces to develop “kill lists,” among other ethically fraught pursuits at the frontier of intelligence and warfare. What is certain is that today, Karp has ascended to a position on the world stage that his former student cohort could never imagine. Since Palantir went public in 2020, the company’s market cap has soared from $16 billion to a recent high of more than $280 billion, briefly surpassing stalwarts like Toyota and making Karp a billionaire many times over (after a nearly 500 percent surge in the company’s stock price last year, The Economist named Karp its top-performing CEO of 2024). And despite Karp’s liberal commitments—he has supported Democrats most of his life, and has referred to himself as a socialist and even a neo-Marxist—Palantir now wields tremendous influence in Trumpworld, largely through Thiel, who has backed Trump since 2016 and is J. D. Vance’s former employer. “Palantirians,” including one of Karp’s closest advisers, are installed in senior roles across the new administration. Despite Karp’s liberal commitments—he has called himself a socialist and even a neo-Marxist—Palantir wields tremendous influence in Trumpworld, largely through Peter Thiel. “Palantirians” are installed in senior roles across the new administration. At the height of his power, Karp is using his platform to publish a scathing critique of the academic community he once aspired to join. The Technological Republic, cowritten with Karp’s Palantir deputy Nicholas Zamiska, argues that it is academics and other liberal elites, not Karp, who have betrayed their shared values. By abandoning the pursuit of truth in favor of problematizing the pro-West worldview, they have discouraged generations of America’s best and brightest from contributing to the national defense, and diverted precious technical talent to trivial endeavors such as “building algorithms that optimize the placement of ads on social media platforms.” This, in turn, has weakened the liberal world order in the face of rising authoritarian threat, particularly from China. Why would a man in Karp’s position write an alienating, combative political treatise? On the surface, the book calls on academics to do what Karp believes he has done himself, and embrace a more forceful and pragmatic role in defending democracy—in their case, by strengthening, rather than tearing down, young Americans’ sense of patriotic duty. But the argument Karp delivers is unlikely to convince them. So unlikely, in fact, that it raises the question of who Karp is truly speaking to. The Technological Republic begins with an assessment of Silicon Valley that channels Karp’s leftist academic roots. The tech industry of the internet era, he says, allocates an incredible amount of financial and human capital to endeavors that contribute little to, and often detract from, the collective welfare. For Karp, the tech industry’s finest moments came during World War II and the Cold War, when STEM talent partnered with the government—and especially the military—to pursue “grand, collectivist” projects. Government initiatives such as the Manhattan Project and the Apollo program produced world-changing breakthroughs. In the private sector, companies like Fairchild Semiconductor turned government-funded research, and military procurement work, into the bedrock innovations of the modern internet. Karp views the modern tech industry, and especially Big Tech, as having abandoned this spirit of ambition and public purpose. The platform empires are built not on breakthrough innovations that lifted up the broader economy, but rather on the “aggressive disruption of incumbents and the construction of new monopolies.” They have not sought to solve humanity’s great challenges, but rather to address the “inconveniences of daily life for those with disposable income,” such as getting a taxi or ordering takeout. The Technological Republic drips with disdain for a generation of companies that, while draping themselves in the rhetoric of changing the world, have been content to “sat[e] the often capricious and passing needs of late capitalism’s hordes.” As China channels its resources toward strategic technologies—Karp is particularly concerned about China’s advances toward intelligent drone swarms, which he believes represent the future of warfare—this “complacency” is no longer acceptable. How did we get here? The contrast Karp draws between the mid-20th-century and the modern-day tech world provides an opportunity to reflect on structural economic changes that might have contributed to the slowdown he sees in innovation and ambition. Has the rise of the venture capital model, or more recently the dominance of a few incumbent players, encouraged founders to think small? Karp suggests that America has “ceded too much control to the whims of the market,” and gestures vaguely at the need for a “Manhattan Project” for battlefield AI, as well as increased allocations to AI in the defense budget (surprise, surprise). But he declines to elaborate on these proposals. The Technological Republic is not fundamentally interested in questions of political economy—it is interested in culture. What set apart the technologists of the World War II and Cold War eras, Karp claims, was their mentality. These were not “technical minds chasing trivial consumer products,” but builders who “aspired to see the most powerful technology of the age deployed to address challenges of industrial and national significance.” The core premise of The Technological Republic is that this collectivist ethos was made possible by a strong sense of national identity rooted in “shared culture”—the mythologies, religious beliefs, and common experiences, such as mandatory military service, that forged bonds between citizens and constituted their understanding of what it meant to be part of the American project. But over the latter half of the 20th century, America’s national identity faded. Improbably, Karp blames this entirely on efforts by the academic left to promote tolerance and inclusivity in higher education. Karp’s narrative of decline begins with efforts to reform Eurocentric university core curricula. Starting in the 1950s and accelerating in the countercultural moment of the late 1960s, rising generations of historians made the obvious point that required general education courses on Western civilization—which for decades had taught students that America was the inheritor of a civilizational legacy linking the ancient Near East, classical Greece and Rome, and early modern Europe, progressing all the while toward liberty and reason—excluded the histories of civilizations elsewhere in the world, and warped students’ understanding of what “civilization” meant. Universities assented, refashioning “Western Civ” into world history courses or, more often, abandoning it altogether. Later, in the 1980s and ’90s (although Karp fuses these distinct episodes into one), the humanities faced a similar reckoning in what became known as the “Canon Wars.” Dead White Men were asked to share space with a more diverse cast of authors. Meanwhile, a more combative strain of intellectual reform sought to directly “deconstruct” the edifice of Western identity and knowledge. Karp picks on two prominent postcolonial scholars here: Kwame Anthony Appiah, who attacked the coherence of Western civilization as a march from Athenian democracy to the Age of Enlightenment; and Edward Said, whose 1978 tract, Orientalism, produced the revolutionary—and, Karp admits, “brilliant”—insight that productions of history and anthropology reflect power dynamics between speaker and subject. Said’s influence was particularly profound, Karp writes, generating “a new industry in American higher education, built around dismantling colonial understandings of the world,” which “remade” academia as a whole. To his credit, Karp’s criticism of these academic challenges to the West—the instincts of postwar intellectuals toward diversification and deconstruction—is somewhat more nuanced than the familiar complaints of aggrieved campus conservatives. Unlike his Palantir cofounder Peter Thiel, whose 1996 screed, The Diversity Myth, lambasts multiculturalism as “anti-Western zealotry” in disguise, Karp acknowledges that the intellectual projects of Appiah and Said had merit. “The dismantling of an entire system of privilege was rightly begun,” Karp writes. His gripe is that the generation of academics the reformers, and especially Said, inspired “failed to resurrect anything substantial, a coherent collective identity or set of communal values, in its place.” In the hands of more radical thinkers, Karp argues, Said’s insight that subjectivity is inherent in the production of knowledge about other cultures was twisted into a belief that accurate descriptive knowledge of other cultures was not possible at all—and therefore that comparative value judgments about different cultures was an inherently problematic, and futile, endeavor. How could Americans claim that their art, ethics, or social organization was superior to the art, ethics, or social organization of another society, from behind their American eyes? Borrowing a term popularized by the traditionalist historians of the Canon Wars era, Karp claims that cultural “relativism” became dogma in academia by the end of the 20th century, and from there permeated political institutions, journalism, Hollywood, and other bastions of the liberal elite. It became, Karp writes, “the dominant form of elite establishment thinking.” As academia, and the broader liberal establishment, pulled away from comparing cultures, Karp argues, it ceased making normative claims about what America’s shared culture should be. It became uninterested in, or perhaps afraid of, articulating a positive vision of America’s national identity. Certain segments became outright hostile to the idea of having one at all. Karp catches two high-profile academics in the act: the sociologist Richard Sennett, who pondered, in The New York Times, whether there might be “ways of acting together without invoking the evil of a shared national identity,” and the philosopher Martha Nussbaum, who castigated Americans’ unique “patriotic pride” as “morally dangerous,” and instead called for “primary allegiance” to “the community of human beings in the entire world.” The result, according to Karp, was that the generation of Americans raised in this intellectual environment developed no concept of being part of a worthy national endeavor—and retreated into the pursuit of riches instead. Whereas mid-20th-century technologists’ sense of patriotic duty was fortified by their education, the education of Uber and Instagram founders had systematically stamped theirs out. Into the resulting void, Karp writes, “the market rushed in with fervor.” This generation “knew what it opposed—what it stood against and could not condone—but not what it was for.” Karp views the modern tech industry, especially Big Tech, as having abandoned ambition and public purpose. The platform empires, he argues, are not built on breakthrough innovations that lifted up the broader economy, but rather on “aggressive disruption of incumbents and the construction of new monopolies.” Ironically, The Technological Republic falls into this trap itself. Karp concludes the book with what is essentially a call for academics and the liberal elite broadly to reject cancel culture and orthodoxy—one that resembles Thiel-style cultural warfare more than it resembles an original, or constructive, critique. In one eyebrow-raising passage, Karp appears to sympathize with a 1998 speech by a German writer that railed against what Karp describes as “the yoke of an enforced remembrance” of the Holocaust. This speech was also the subject of Karp’s doctoral dissertation, although he did not condone it then. But Karp, like the academics he criticizes, fails to articulate a positive vision of what a new American identity should be. Nor does he grapple with recent liberal attempts to do so—contrary to Karp’s claim that such projects have been thought-policed out of existence—such as Jill Lepore’s This America, and Colin Woodard’s voluminous work in the Washington Monthly and elsewhere. If there is a path forward suggested by The Technological Republic, it is that by embracing “intellectual confrontation,” the liberal establishment can allow a new national identity to spontaneously emerge through debate. Considered in isolation, Karp’s key observations are likely to resonate with his supposed target audience of academics and liberal thought leaders. Readers with ties to elite educational institutions would likely agree that their peers are more motivated by money than any sense of duty to the collective, especially when one considers the staggering percentages of graduates who flock to the finance and consulting industries. (Karp himself notes this phenomenon in one passage, though his focus is on the tech world; for a deeper dive, see Zach Marcus, “The Corporate Raid on Campus.”) And it’s difficult to argue with his claims that America’s national identity has been eroded, or that higher education has become more interested in questioning, rather than strengthening, a pro-West perspective. As academia and the broader liberal establishment retreated from comparing cultures, Karp argues, it ceased making normative claims about what America’s shared culture should be. It became uninterested in, or perhaps afraid of, articulating a positive vision of America’s national identity. Certain segments became outright hostile to the idea of having one at all. But The Technological Republic fails to convince that these phenomena are interconnected. Do many of America’s best and brightest today work for Facebook and McKinsey because they lack patriotism? Was one semester of “Western Civ” so pivotal in the career trajectories of the engineers who put a man on the moon? If so, Karp provides no evidence. And he strenuously avoids grappling with other historical events and cultural currents that likely contributed to the elite’s abandonment of public service careers—does it have more to do with their belief that America is bad, or that “greed is good”? As far as there is a disinclination toward military work specifically, the impact on public opinion of America’s disastrous military campaigns in Southeast Asia and the Middle East goes unmentioned. Perhaps, after two decades at the helm of an infamously cult-like company where he is “accustomed to being received as an oracle,” according to a recent profile, Karp’s powers of persuasion have dulled. Or perhaps he was simply limited by the scope of the book. The main text of The Technological Republic clocks in at 218 breezy pages, 56 of which are dedicated to a non sequitur on Palantir’s corporate culture. But for a man of Karp’s intellectual mettle—which does shine through in the book, in his command of intellectual history—these explanations are doubtful. One can’t help but feel that he has not made an earnest attempt at persuasion. Which brings us to the question of Karp’s true purpose in writing the book. There are moments when he seems to be making a friendly appeal for liberals to get their act together; the clearest example is his warning, borrowed from the political philosopher Michael Sandel, that “fundamentalists rush in where liberals fear to tread.” But the carelessness with which he argues his central points, and his neglect of a thoughtful solution, do not ultimately leave the impression that The Technological Republic is rooting for the liberal establishment to recover. What we are left with is a vicious critique of that establishment, delivered through gleeful transgressions of its boundaries on acceptable topics of discussion. In short: red meat for the right. Viewed this way, the book forms a pattern with other publicity stunts Karp has performed in the wake of last November’s vibe-shifting election. After Palantir reported blowout earnings in February, Karp went viral and successfully triggered the libs by proclaiming on the (video-streamed) investor call his commitment to “scare our enemies and, on occasion, kill them.” Appearing on CNBC’s Squawk Box the morning The Technological Republic hit shelves, Karp called Elon Musk “obviously the most important builder in the world.” He applauded Musk’s controversial DOGE initiative, which he claimed “90 percent of Americans” support, for targeting “the fraud, waste, and abuse we know is there.” Musk tweeted the clip. The moral case for Palantir that Karp has made throughout his career—that the company is a project to promote democracy, and strengthening Western militaries is its means to this end—has always been somewhat simplistic. But Karp seemed to genuinely believe in this calculation, and his conduct could be seen as consistent with it. He made a point of refusing to work in autocratic countries, and of meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Ukraine to offer Palantir’s support in its war against Russia. But as Karp attempts to curry favor with an administration that is not only disassembling the world order Karp cherishes but actively undermining America’s standing as a beacon of liberal democracy at home, the coherence of Palantir’s political project has begun to unravel. In his TV interview, and in his book, Karp no longer comes across as a man with firm commitments. “I’ve been a Democrat most of my life,” Karp said on CNBC. “I still—I kind of view myself as outside it.” Kainoa Lowman is a communications associate at the American Economic Liberties Project, an anti-monopoly research and advocacy group.

March 23, 2025 16:00 ET | Source: Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC NEW YORK, March 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Attorney Advertising--Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC, a nationally recognized law firm, notifies investors that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo Nordisk” or “the Company”) (NYSE: NVO) and certain of its officers. Class Definition This lawsuit seeks to recover damages against Defendants for alleged violations of the federal securities laws on behalf of all persons and entities that purchased or otherwise acquired Novo Nordisk securities between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Such investors are encouraged to join this case by visiting the firm’s site: bgandg.com/NVO. Case Details The Complaint alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Novo Nordisk’s projected successful outcome of Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1,” while avoiding discussions centered around dosage tolerability; (2) Novo Nordisk’s repeated optimistic claims that CagriSema would achieve at least 25% weight loss in the REDEFINE-1 study fell short of reality; and (3) the utilization of the “flexible protocol” limited the study’s ability to effectively provide weight loss data on the dosage tested, suggesting either that tolerability was significantly worse than anticipated, resulting in patients titrating down their dosages to avoid complications, or that the patient selection process was rushed, leading to the onboarding of patients that did not desire to even achieve the 25% weight loss Novo Nordisk sought to demonstrate. What's Next? A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to review a copy of the Complaint, you can visit the firm’s site: bgandg.com/NVO. or you may contact Peretz Bronstein, Esq. or his Client Relations Manager, Nathan Miller, of Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC at 332-239-2660.

SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1.” Defendants’ statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants’ statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk’s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

ByWilliam Arruda ByWilliam Arruda Senior Contributor. Photo credit This month, a wave of layoffs across various industries has raised concerns among professionals about job security. Major corporations, particularly in the tech sector, have announced significant workforce reductions. Siemens plans to cut over 6,000 jobs in its automation and electric vehicle (EV) charging businesses to enhance competitiveness. Similarly, Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft have announced layoffs, reflecting a broader trend in the industry.​ This trend extends beyond the tech industry. Major retailers like Walgreens, CVS, and Joann Fabrics are also in the process of, or planning layoffs. Additionally, significant reductions are anticipated in various government sectors as part of Trump’s DOGE initiative. The Pentagon announced 60,000 cuts and the IRS plans to shed 45,000 jobs. Experts predict weaker employment reports and a rise in unemployment claims, citing economic uncertainty and increased automation in the workplace as key drivers. Although no one is certain that we are entering a recession, the news about widespread layoffs can be stressful. Even if you currently feel secure in your position, it’s time to acknowledge potential challenges in the job market. The best time to prepare for a job search is while you are still employed. Implementing a proactive plan can help safeguard your career and stave off anxiety.​ Focus on these 7 actions. If you haven’t worked on your personal brand in a while, it’s time to for a review. To effectively convey your value, review, update, and enhance your resume and online profiles.​ We all know that more jobs are filled through networking than job postings. Many career opportunities arise through relationships that you have built.​ Career cushioning—investing in skill development will make you a more attractive candidate for in-demand roles.​ It involves discreetly preparing for potential job loss by upskilling and networking. The bonus is that you gain essential skills that you can use in your current role. Being prepared financially is vital in uncertain times.​ Take these actions to reduce financial risk and the stress that comes from money issues. When it comes time to decide who gets put on the layoff list, make sure your manager and other decision makers see you as indispensable. Demonstrating your value within your organization will enhance job security.​ Increasing your visibility and demonstrated value positions you as a must-keep team member.​ Often, the value you build externally impacts how you’re seen inside your organization. Your online presence will influence potential employers’ perceptions, too.​ A positive online presence enhances your attractiveness to potential employers.​ While no one can fully predict what’s ahead, the wave of recent layoffs is a clear signal that professionals should stay ready, not reactive. The key to long-term career resilience is preparation. Whether or not a recession materializes, these steps will put you in a stronger position for whatever the market brings. Your career is your greatest asset—treat it like one.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, March 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo Nordisk” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) and reminds investors of the March 25, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that the true state of Novo’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” On December 20, 2024, during pre-market hours, Novo announced headline results for its REDEFINE-1 trial, which determined CagriSema had achieved a weight loss average of only 22.7% after 68 weeks. The Company attributed this diminished result, in part, on the previously undisclosed “flexible” nature of the protocol. This flexibility resulted in less than 60% of patients apparently completing the dose escalation period and thus being treated with “2.4 mg cagrilintide and 2.4 mg semaglutide once-weekly,” the maximum dosage of CagriSema contemplated by the trial, during the 52-week maintenance period in the manner outlined by the published protocol for the REDEFINE-1 study. Investors and analysts reacted immediately to Novo’s revelation. The price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $103.44 per share on December 19, 2024, Novo’s stock price fell to $85.00 per share on December 20, 2024, a decline of about 17.83% in the span of just a single day. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Novo Nordisk’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the Novo Nordisk class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/NVO or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

Title: 5 phones you should consider instead of the Google Pixel 9a

Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site. Why trust us? The year has only really just begun, but we’ve already had some great phones launch in 2025. Samsung wowed us as usual with the new Galaxy S25 series, but then Apple came out of nowhere to release a brand new model in its lineup, the iPhone 16e. And the hits just keep on coming too; Google has just revealed the Google Pixel 9a, the latest in its line of excellent mid-range priced smartphones. The Pixel 9a continues Google’s record of excellence within the midrange space, with a 1080p 6.3-inch display, 120Hz refresh rate, the usual showstopping cameras, and a brand new and stunning look, for just $499. That’s an incredible deal, and no mistake — but it’s not the only game in town, not by a long shot. While the Google Pixel 9a is the new hotness, there are plenty of other smartphones that can, and should, steal your attention away from Google’s latest. Here are five of the phones you should also consider if you’re tempted by the Google Pixel 9a. One of the major advantages of the Pixel 9a is that it’s able to use Google’s own flagship Tensor G4 processor, giving it top-tier power at a lower price. But it’s not alone in offering staggering amounts of performance at a midrange price tag, and it’s actually quite likely this top pick beats the Pixel 9a hands down. The OnePlus 13R is OnePlus’s current top midrange handset, and it’s an incredibly powerful package starting from just $600. Key to this performance is the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 found in the device’s heart. It’s not this year’s Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, but as last year’s processor of choice for phones like the Galaxy S24 Ultra and OnePlus 12, it’s still plenty powerful, and the OnePlus 13R fair flies through any task you give it. Backing that flagship chip up is 12GB of RAM and storage starting from 256GB. If those sound like flagship specs, well, they are, and it’s a big part of the reason this phone is such a winner. Behind it all is a massive 6,000mAh battery that easily manages two days of use on a single charge, with three days being possible on lighter use. Recharging has been lowered from last year’s OnePlus 12R, but that still puts it at a mighty 55W, outdoing the charging speeds of Apple’s, Google’s, and Samsung’s flagships. There’s no wireless charging though, which means the Pixel 9a does have some advantages over the OnePlus phone. But with the Pixel 9a’s wireless charging being limited to a measely 7.5W, you’re probably better off not having it at all. OnePlus had to cut corners somewhere, and so it’s fair to say the 13R isn’t the most attractive phone around. Still, it’s not ugly by any means, with the best word for it being “functional”. The aluminum frame and glass back both have matte coatings, and the build and execution are solid and professional. There’s very little to complain about here, except for a lack of style and flair. There’s even less to complain about where the display is concerned. It’s a 6.78-inch AMOLED panel with a 2780 x 1264 resolution, a variable 1-120Hz refresh rate, and a max brightness of 4,500 nits. It’s bright, clear, and extremely responsive. Finally, there’s the camera systems. OnePlus’s camera systems have previously tended to sit in the “okay” pile, but have recently graduated to being solidly good across the board, and we see that continue here. The 13R has 50-megapixel primary lens, a 50MP telephoto lens with a 2x optical zoom, and an 8MP ultrawide lens around the back, and a 16MP fixed-focus camera around the front. It performs well across the board, and while it lacks the longer zooms of actual flagship phones, it’s still a camera system you can rely on. The price starts from a full $100 more than the Pixel 9a at $600, but if you can afford to spend the extra, then the OnePlus 13R is a solid competitor for Google’s latest. Nothing’s rise has been nothing short of incredible, and it’s most recent phones have been devices you can’t afford to miss out on. The Nothing Phone 3a Pro is a stellar midrange phone, and absolutely one of the best phones Nothing has ever produced. At just $70 more than the Pixel 9a’s starting price, it’s another strong option if you’re looking for a midrange phone, and it comes with the bonus of a jaw-droppingly unique style. We’ll start with the design, because it’s unlike anything else you’re likely to see. The transparent back is chaotic and eye-catching, and whether you like it or not, it’s certainly unique. the rear camera is contained in a large circular module, like a OnePlus phone — but unlike OnePlus, Nothing’s signature Glyph lighting can be seen around the module. These LED lights will react to your phone use, mimicking timers and showing the proximity of your Uber ride, and can even function as a camera flash or flashlight. Whether or not you like the design, and we’re sure plenty won’t, you can fault Nothing for trying something different. The 6.77-inch AMOLED display is good too, thanks to a 120Hz refresh rate and 1080p resolution. You won’t find a flagship chip here, instead the Nothing Phone 3a Pro uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 processor. While it may not have the high-power shine of the OnePlus 13R or Pixel 9a, it’s still a very capable chip, and we rarely found it lacking. There’s also 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage as standard, giving a strong spec baseline. In terms of software, you can either use Google’s stock Android 15, or swap it for Nothing’s minimalist take on Android. Either is fun, and we suggest trying out both. Nothing has shoehorned a lot of AI into this phone, but it’s worth mentioning Essential Space, which is an AI-powered organizer that stores your screenshots and voice notes collected with the dedicated Essential Space button. It’s a quieter and more subtle take on AI than we’ve seen recently, and it has potential as something that could be actually useful. The camera is good, but let down by a rubbish 8MP wide-angle lens, which isn’t a surprise. However, the 50MP main lens is strong, and it’s joined by a 50MP periscope zoom with a 3x optical zoom. These two lens are great, and take well blanaced shots with punchy colors and just the right contrast and brightness. It’s just a shame that yet another manufacturer packs in a terrible 8MP wide-angle lens. The battery isn’t anything special, managing a single day on one charge. However, it offers 50W fast charging, again putting a number of flagships in the dust, even if it doesn’t offer wireless charging at all. This is simply one of the best smartphones Nothing has made yet, and at $570, it’s within reaching distance of the Pixel 9a. If a unique style and flair matters to you, or if you really love the look Nothing has gone for, then check this phone out. You won’t be disappointed. It’s hard to wade around this price point without attracting some big fish, and they don’t get much bigger than the Apple iPhone. The Apple iPhone 16e has supplanted the iPhone SE as the cheapest iPhone, and while it may no longer reach down into budget territory, it’s now an even more solid alternative to the Google Pixel 9a. The iPhone 16e is a blast from the past in a number of ways. Not only does it sport the notched style of display we thought had disappeared with the iPhone 14, but it also has only one camera lens in its rear camera setup. It’s still unmistakably an iPhone, but the design makes it clear this is the lowest tier of Apple’s smartphone. The colors are a little dull, but it’s still not a bad looking phone, even if we wish it had more pop. It’s light though, which is a real bonus for one-handed use. The 6.1-inch display is the same size as that found on the iPhone 16, but unfortunately, it also has the same 60Hz refresh rate. While we didn’t expect Apple to leapfrog the iPhone 16 with a cheaper model, it continues to be a disappointment that Apple refuses to embrace superior screen technology for what are still expensive smartphones. But putting that aside, it’s still a great display, with bright colors and deep blacks. The biggest draw here is the inclusion of Apple’s AI service, Apple Intelligence. The 16e has been built to include all of Apple’s AI features, including Visual Intelligence, and many new AI inclusions in Apple’s apps, like the Notes app. It’s the cheapest way to experience Apple Intelligence. Performance is similarly strong, being powered by a slightly tweaked version of the A18 processor. It’s slower than most of the other iPhones you can buy from Apple, but not to be point where it’ll be overly obvious or a problem. Battery life puts most of its stablemates in the dust though, with the phone managing multiple days of use on a single charge. That longevity comes at a price though, specifically being limited to 20W fast charging, and not having MagSafe at all. It does have wireless charging, but it tops out at 7.5W. Unsurprisingly, the single lens on the 16e’s rear doesn’t match up to other iPhones in terms of pure versatility, but it’s not a bad lens by any means. It’s a 48MP lens, and can use pixel binning to improve low light shots, and can crop a shot to 12MP to spoof a 2x optical zoom. If you’re coming from a phone with multiple lenses, then the single lens may be a disappointment. But if a camera is just something that’s nice to have, then this won’t let you down. The iPhone 16e isn’t for everyone, that’s for sure, but it’s still a solid alternative to the Pixel 9a. If a top-tier camera is a must, then avoid this. But, if an iPhone is a tempting offer for you, then this is the option to check out. It starts from $599. The Pixel 9a is a standout phone at $499, but so is the previous year’s flagship Pixel, the Pixel 8. While prices for this phone can tend to fluctuate, we have seen it at the price of $499 for the 128GB model, putting it on an equal footing with the midrange version of this year’s Pixel range. That gets you an extremely good camera system, long battery life, and all of the same AI features, packaged up in a flagship phone. The centerpiece of any Pixel has always been the camera, and the Pixel 8 doesn’t disappoint in this regard. The 50MP main lens on the Pixel 8a is likely to be comparable to the 48MP shooter on the Pixel 9a, with similar apertures. The Pixel 8’s main camera is simply excellent, one of the best we tested in 2024, and though the wide-angle lens disappoints, it doesn’t take away from what is an excellent camera setup. As a bonus, you get all of Google’s impressive AI editing features as well, meaning even the most disappointing shots can be made to shine. Enough about the cameras though, how does the rest of the phone hold up? Very well, as it turns out. The Pixel 8 is driven by the Google Tensor G3 processor. This flagship chip is powerful, as you’d expect, and though it still has some temperature issues, they’re nowhere near as bad as they once were, even if it still runs warmer than Qualcomm chips of the same era. The display is gorgeous, too, and has a dynamic 120Hz refresh rate like the Pixel 9a. The battery lasts around a day, though you can stretch far into two days with light use. Charging speed is on the slower side, with speeds tapping out at 27W for wired charging and 18W for wireless. That’s not the slowest charging we’ve seen recently, and largely on par with, for instance, most iPhones, but it’s far slower than you’ll get on a OnePlus smartphone. Like the Pixel 9a, you’ll get seven years of software updates, though keep in mind the Pixel 8 has already chewed through some of that. However, it still has a strong innings to go before it needs replacing, so that’s definitely not worth worrying about. The build quality is excellent too, and really shows off the flagship nature of this particular phone. Like the build, the Pixel 8 is solid all around, with little to detract from a very positive picture. While it began life at $699, with the release of the Pixel 9 it’s not uncommon to see this phone priced as well as $499, putting it bang on par with the Pixel 9a. At that price, the Pixel 8 is an absolute bargain. There aren’t many phones underneath the Pixel 9a’s $499 price that we’d recommend checking out, but the Moto G Stylus 5G (2024) is good enough to warrant your attention — plus, it has one thing that Google’s midrange phone does not: A stylus. Hidden away inside the phone when not in use, the stylus is just a basic stylus, so it doesn’t have a Bluetooth connection or any special tricks, like being used as a camera shutter, or pressure sensitivity. Instead, it’s just a srtlus for writing or doodling. it works well for this, though the device’s palm rejection is not great, and it doesn’t particularly feel natural when you use it. It feels like exactly what it is: Plastic dragging over glass. Still, you can get used to that, and it’s ideal if you find a stylus useful but don’t always have one on you. The design is a surprisingly high point for this phone. It’s made from plastic, but the vegan leather backplate feels great, and it feels solid despite the cheaper materials. The 6.7-inch OLED is also pretty good, sporting both a 1080p resolution and a 120Hz refresh. Heck, even the camera, usually a letdown on budget Motorola phones, is pretty good. It won’t beat any of other the phones on this list, but it won’t embarrass you either. The rest of this phone does, admittedly, feel like the budget offering it is. It’s powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 chip and 8GB of RAM, and while the G Stylus works fine, with only occasional stutters and slowdowns, it’s not up to the same standard as the flagship level chips in every other phone on this list. Water and dust-resistance tops out at IP52, behind everything else on this list — but there are some upsides too. Namely, a headphone jack and a microSD card slot. There’s one big downside to this phone though, and it’s one area where the Pixel has it beat hands-down. The Moto G Stylus was only ever going to get one software update — yes, you read that right, one — and considering that upgrade was going to be from Android 14 to 15, it’s likely already been and gone as you read this. So unlike the Pixel 9a, which has seven years of updates to look forward to, the Moto G Stylus has … none. That’s a big letdown. The Moto G Stylus 5G (2024) is available for $400, significantly cheaper than the Pixel 9a. It is showing its age a little, but it’s still a solid buy, and one of Motorola’s few good releases in a bad year. It’s decision time, folks. After much hype since it was announced, the iPhone 16e is now available in stores. The phone, which is now Apple’s budget phone, has a lot of great things going for it, assuming you fall into Apple’s demographic for the handset. And yet, if you plan on purchasing a new iPhone right now, there’s possibly a better phone you should buy instead, the iPhone 14. After Apple announced the iPhone 16e, it became clear that it shares more similarities with the iPhone 14 than with the iPhone SE 3, which many initially believed the rumored “iPhone SE 4” would replace. The iPhone 16e may turn out to be a much better device overall. Consequently, it’s not surprising that the introduction of the iPhone 16e has led to the discontinuation of both the iPhone SE 3 and the iPhone 14. Google is making it significantly harder for scammers to reach Pixel device owners. It plans to introduce new scam detection features for the Phone by Google and Google Messages apps in March, courtesy of AI. According to a post on the Google Store, the new feature identifies conversation patterns most likely associated with scammers. We’re less than a month away from the launch of Google’s next smartphone, the budget-friendly Pixel 9a. But what will this phone cost? We now have the answer, and it’s excellent news for anyone deciding between it and the recently announced Apple iPhone 16e. According to Android Headlines, the new Google phone costs $499 for the 128GB version and $599 for the 256GB version. This is the same price the company is charging for the Pixel 8a, which the Pixel 9a will soon replace.

Title: 6 Top Stocks To Buy Now For April 2025

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock Contributor. Software companies have an opportunity to shine in 2025. If nothing else, the stock market is full of surprises. 2025 began with investors feeling upbeat, with a new business-friendly president stepping into the White House. Now, a sell-off may be in the works as investors worry about tariffs and trade wars. Nodding to the tariff turmoil, here's a list of domestic services businesses as the top stocks for April. Since services are not subject to tariffs, these providers should be somewhat insulated from an escalating trade war. The top stocks below were identified by screening health care, technology and financial services businesses on these parameters: Mostly software companies passed this test, partly due to the margin requirement. The top six in terms of market capitalization were selected. The table below introduces six American companies that meet the criteria outlined above. Metrics are from stockanalysis.com and company earnings releases. For more investing ideas, see: best stocks for 2025 and best ETFs. Salesforce offers subscription customer relationship management (CRM) software that helps businesses manage and track customer interactions. The company has the leading market share in CRM, estimated at 29.2% by Apps Run The World. Salesforce also launched an agentic AI solution called Agentforce in 2024. Agentic AI supports complex conversations without human intervention. Salesforce has a strong balance sheet and a leading market position in CRM. The company also has a track record of revenue growth, though the growth rate has slowed in recent years. Offsetting the revenue trend has been a dramatic rise in operating margin from below 6% in fiscal 2023 to over 20% in fiscal 2025. Cash flow has gained also—the company’s free cash flow margin was nearly 33% last year, up from 20% two years ago. The latest results from Salesforce show momentum in data cloud and AI solutions, where revenue is up 120% from the prior year. The company also closed 5,000 Agentforce deals last year. These newer solutions enhance the company’s growth opportunity and complement its dominant position in customer relationship management software. Salesforce pays annual dividends of $1.60 per share, for a yield of 0.57%. If you're looking for a higher dividend yield, see this list of best dividend stocks. Intuit develops and supports software for personal and business tax reporting, business accounting and consumer credit management. The company also owns the small business email service provider Mailchimp. Intuit is building AI capabilities into its solutions and the strategy is paying off. In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, Intuit reported 17% revenue growth driven by increases in its Global Business Solutions Group, Credit Karma and Consumer Group. GAAP operating income also rose 61% and GAAP diluted EPS shot up 26%. Management expects 12% to 13% revenue growth for fiscal year 2025. As Zacks Investment Research notes, the company has single-digit penetration in its addressable market valued at $300 billion—meaning the growth opportunity is significant. The company also maintains a strong financial position, with $2.5 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet. Intuit pays annual dividends of $4.16 per share, for a yield of 0.69%. The company also actively repurchases shares, investing $721 million in the second quarter. Adobe provides a suite of creative applications through subscriptions to corporate marketing departments, graphic designers, video editors and photographers. The company also provides analytics and publishing solutions. Investors have not been kind to ADBE. The stock lost 20% in 2024 and is down nearly 9% in 2025. Impatience has prompted these losses. Adobe has devoted resources to developing and launching AI tools, but the monetization has been disappointing. In the company’s last earnings call, CEO Shantanu Narayen said the team is focused on using AI to drive new, engaged subscription customers, rather than selling standalone AI products. This makes Adobe a longer-term play. The current stock price represents a reasonable value on a company that should continue growing revenue and earnings by 10% or more annually. Adobe does not pay a dividend but has a buyback yield of 2.86%. Autodesk provides subscription-based software for 3-D modeling, drafting, design, collaboration and production management. Customers include architects, engineers, product designers and media and entertainment companies. Autodesk reported consensus-beating revenue and earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. The company also provided a fiscal 2026 guidance above expectations. Still, the stock is down about 9% year to date. The story is like Adobe’s. Investors want to see stronger growth in Autodesk's cloud and AI offerings. However, the company is focusing on margins first. In the latest earnings release, Autodesk announced a restructuring plan that will terminate 1,350 employees. The savings will fund further cloud and AI investment. Autodesk expects to deliver industry-leading GAAP margins and fiscal 2026 revenue growth of 12.4% to 13.6%. PTC makes subscription-based software that helps teams design, engineer and optimize products and manufacturing systems. The company serves aerospace, defense, automotive, electronics, industrial equipment and health care businesses. PTC has a good record of growth in annual recurring revenue (ARR) and cash flow, demonstrating low customer churn and a productive business model. In its first quarter 2025 earnings release, PTC reported 11% ARR growth on a constant currency basis and 29% free cash flow growth. Both numbers are relative to the prior-year quarter. Operating margin declined somewhat to 20% from 22%. The company also spent $75 million on share repurchases. PTC is also reshaping its go-to-market strategy to be more targeted. This should enhance the growth opportunity for a business model that already has high visibility and resilience. Manhattan Associates offers cloud-enabled supply chain and inventory management software to retail, consumer goods, technology, life sciences, government and industrial customers. The company sells its applications on a subscription basis. Manhattan Associates has beaten consensus revenue and EPS estimates for at least eight consecutive quarters. In 2024, the company delivered over $1 billion in revenue for the first time and increased its cloud subscription revenue by $83 million. GAAP diluted EPS rose 24% to $3.51. The company also spent $241.6 million on share repurchases. The bad news is twofold. Manhattan Associates had a slow fourth quarter for services revenue and President and CEO Eddie Capel recently retired. Investors quickly repriced the stock, which has dipped 39.7% since the earnings release. The pullback creates upside for the company, which is expected to deliver 32% EPS growth in 2025. Bottom Line Software companies have an opportunity to shine in 2025. Growth prospects look especially strong for providers that are transitioning to AI-driven solutions. And, the escalating trade war—a potential lag for goods exporters—may signal it's time to increase your exposure to technology services stocks.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, March 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Merck & Co., Inc. (“Merck” or the “Company”) (NYSE: MRK) and reminds investors of the April 14, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that Merck’s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck’s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil’s growth in China. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Gardasil’s demand in China; notably, that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor, Zhifei. Such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Merck’s securities at artificially inflated prices. On February 4, 2025, before the market opened, Merck filed a current report on Form 8-K with the SEC. In the current report, Merck announced their fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 financial results, in which it stated that “GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 [s]ales [d]eclined 3% to $8.6 Billion.” In addition, the current report stated Merck’s “decision to temporarily pause shipments of GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 into China beginning February 2025 through at least mid-year.” On this news, Merck’s stock price fell $9.05 per share, or 9.1%, to close at $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Merck’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

(“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RKLB) and reminds investors of the April 28, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member.

Title: Google ignored Android XR at GDC 2025, and indie VR devs are concerned

One Quest gaming dev told us that "Google is treading the same path towards failure" as Stadia and Daydream by shutting smaller devs out.

Combined with social media reports that most top-selling Quest devs were "rejected" from Google's Android XR boot camps, it's painting a worrying picture about what to expect from Android-based headsets like Project Moohan. Google loves GDC; it has a huge presence there every year. This year, its panel on real-world AI applications in game development filled up 45 minutes before it started. It had several Android gaming panels and a large Play Store exhibition in the West hall, and it partnered with Samsung on another Galaxy panel. GDC is well-known for its private hotel demos off the show floor. Perhaps Google made an Android XR push behind closed doors with larger VR publishers. But Google's decision not to court indie VR devs publicly with panels or demos — at the same conference where Meta pushed its new passthrough tech and reassured devs how profitable their store is — seems pretty telling. It's all but guaranteed that the Google I/O 2025 program in May will have workshops on Android XR — to court 2D app devs. Gaming rarely comes up at I/O, and this platform is public, so it's not as though Google needs to wait for some big reveal. Will Google have the same disdainful approach to VR gaming that Apple does with the Apple Vision Pro? At least one VR gaming dev we spoke to thinks that Android XR is already heading in the wrong direction by spurning the people who made Quest headsets so popular. The Quest Store is flooded with meme games, social multiplayer targeting teens, and indie content you'd typically see on Steam. It turns off many VR elites and frustrates VR devs making "serious" content, but these games strike a chord and keep people returning to the Quest 3S headsets more regularly to spend money. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Android XR is compatible with Unity, OpenXR, and WebXR, with controller support built into the UI. During our press preview, they suggested that headsets like Samsung's Project Moohan "support gaming use cases." They said that "hopefully" this universal compatibility "will lead to incentives for people to port over to Android." You'd think the owner of the Play Store would recognize the power of smaller developers to strike it big and reach out to those developers to give Android XR greater visibility. Instead, according to developer RJ White at Soaring Roc Studio, "9/10 top devs for the Quest platform" have been rejected from Android XR coding boot camps, and he sees this as a premature death knell for the platform. I've seen 9/10 top devs for the Quest platform rejected for @GoogleARVR's bootcamps for Android XR now. I'm talking about devs / people with games that were in the top 5 top selling. Google is so quick to repeat their mistakes from Daydream, see y'all on @killedbygoogle soon pic.twitter.com/JOH2AJ7gwiFebruary 20, 2025 "Google is treading the same path towards failure that they did with Stadia and Daydream. By shutting out some of the most experienced and smaller studios and developers, they're showing they've learned zero lessons with how to manage or grow a modern software platform," said White in a discussion with Android Central senior editor Nick Sutrich. White, whose indie studio has made several Quest titles like Spiders and FireZone, says that studios and games from "humble origins" power huge successes from major platforms. However, he believes Google is "too focused on trying to force a polished diamond out of a large team as quickly as possible" instead of "cultivating an environment that lets those smaller teams thrive and carve a gem out on their own." "XR developers aren't just game developers; they're 3D interaction experts," says White. However, by rejecting them and prioritizing the same "just make things flat" approach as Apple, Android XR will be "2D dependent to a fault." White's thoughts don't prove Android XR is bound to fail, and we don't have evidence that Google is fully ignoring Quest developers beyond word of mouth. Rather, it reflects a perspective among some VR developers that without overtures from Google, it's hard to know how much stock to put into Android XR — or whether Google knows what it needs to do to make it successful. Big Tech wants to make productivity XR headsets the new alternative to laptops, but none of the big-name consumer products have sold at a massive scale. Apple allegedly sold 500,000 Vision Pros, and Samsung wants to sell 100,000 Moohan headsets. VR gaming remains the one definitive use case that has attracted millions of users. So, is there a reason why Google wouldn't prioritize it? Samsung's Project Infinity headset is rumored to have Sony-made micro-OLED displays with 13.64 million pixels per eye, arriving in the second half of 2025 with a hefty price tag. Beyond that, other announced Android XR devices include a Sony enterprise headset that'll cost almost $5,000, Xreal AR glasses, and an unconfirmed Lynx XR headset that may trend toward the pricey side. So perhaps Google wants to focus its outreach to the enterprise and productivity app creators because it knows people won't spend thousands of dollars to play Gorilla Tag when the Quest 3 is already here. It needs a "killer app" to justify its existence, and Google must assume that app won't be a game. Maybe Google truly believes that gaming developers don't need an Android XR boot camp because they can easily port over OpenXR games without much effort. Perhaps, as White suggests, they're underestimating these XR developers' ability to do more than gaming software and create useful 3D app content, whether for headsets or AR glasses. We know Android XR will have similar camera tech to the Quest's new passthrough API, but Google didn't come to GDC to appeal to XR devs as Meta did. Or maybe Google is following the lead of its hardware partners, who don't care as much about gaming. If Samsung decides to make a Quest rival, then Google could prioritize gaming, right? Frankly, whatever Google's reasoning, I'm not a fan of Google potentially downplaying the importance of gaming for the future of Android XR. It should be building up momentum now so that devs are ready to overload Project Moohan with content by the end of the year. Hopefully, by Google I/O in May, VR gaming devs will have more reason for optimism that Android XR is a viable new platform for them.

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone Contributor. The decline in stock prices combined with plunging consumer sentiment and uncertainty surrounding ... More tariffs has uncreased uncertainty about future economic growth. Since stock prices ultimately depend on earnings, the pace of economic growth is crucial input to future stock performance. After briefly hitting correction territory in the previous week, which is defined as a 10% decline from an earlier high, stocks had a modest rebound last week. The S&P 500 sits 7.6% below its mid-February high. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has faired worse with a drubbing of 18.5% since mid-December. The pressure on stocks stems from an economic growth scare and policy uncertainty surrounding tariffs. Market Returns With the S&P 500 closing over 10% below its February 19 high on Thursday, March 13, stocks officially entered a correction. In the twenty-one U.S. stock market corrections since 1980, the average return in the 12 months following was 13.4%, which on the surface would lead to significant optimism regarding future returns. If the data is sorted between periods when the U.S. economy entered recession within those 12 months after the correction, the results are less compelling at a 1.9% average gain. Of course, if an economic downturn is avoided, the results have been spectacular on average at 19.1%. Average Stock Returns After S&P 500 Correction The strong bond between avoiding recession and better returns following a stock correction makes monitoring the economy's health even more critical. Economists' consensus estimate of 2025 economic growth has dipped slightly to 2.2%, nowhere near recessionary levels. Unfortunately, economists have a poor track record of accurately predicting economic growth with enough lead time, and consensus estimates tend to lag behind real-time data. Consensus U.S. Economic Growth Forecasts Economic models attempting to forecast the current quarter of GDP growth were developed to address the challenges associated with consensus estimates. These estimates adapt to the most recent economic releases to predict growth. This methodology has its challenges but adds additional color to the economic backdrop. The Atlanta Fed model points to a contraction in economic activity in the first quarter, which is probably overstated because much of that downward estimate comes from a marked increase in imports to avoid future tariffs. The St. Louis Fed’s model remains in positive territory. The forecast difference between the two is vast for their first-quarter GDP estimate. After last week's Federal Reserve meeting, the committee noted that “uncertainty around the economy outlook has increased.” Estimated Frist-Quarter U.S. Economic Growth While accurately forecasting an economic downturn in advance with any accuracy is exceptionally challenging, monitoring some high-frequency data can help get an early warning about increased recession risks. These indicators were chosen because they are updated weekly or daily and have shown a strong correlation with economic activity. Indeed, other indicators are crucial, but they are typically only available monthly, sometimes with a significant time lag. The labor market is probably the most crucial part of the economy since consumer spending eventually wanes without wages to fund the purchases. Initial claims for unemployment benefits are reported weekly, but the four-week moving average of claims is used here to reduce volatility. While initial claims are above the lows, the level is not exhibiting a strong uptrend or at a level consistent with economic woes. Initial Jobless Claims The other weekly job data is ongoing claims for unemployment benefits, which are also off its lows and show a slow uptrend. This indicates that it is taking longer for those losing their jobs to find a new one. Remember that the number of employees in the U.S. has more than doubled since 1970, so even though the current roster of those receiving unemployment benefits is as high as it was during the 1969-1970 recession, the numbers aren’t comparable. The bottom line is that the labor market is softening but has not yet reached recessionary levels. Continuing Claims The corporate bond market should undoubtedly be part of the mosaic to monitor the economy’s health. Baa corporate bond data has a long history and arguably provides a look at the “typical” credit quality of companies, as Baa credit rating is the lowest level of investment-grade bonds. The spread is the yield investors demand beyond U.S. Treasury bond rates to compensate for the default risk from buying corporate bonds. These spreads expand when investors worry that more bond defaults could be on the horizon, typically driven by deteriorating economic conditions. While the spreads on Baa corporate debt are above recent lows, the increase seems insufficient to trigger substantial fear of any impending economic downturn. Corporate Bond Spreads The Chicago Fed produces the National Financial Conditions Index weekly. It looks at 105 measures across three categories, risk, credit, and leverage, to create a measure of financial conditions. According to the Chicago Fed, “Positive values of the NFCI have been historically associated with tighter-than-average financial conditions, while negative values have been historically associated with looser-than-average financial conditions.” The chart shows that these periods of tighter-than-normal financial conditions have often been associated with recession. Like the previous measures, financial conditions have worsened but remain below warning levels. Financial Conditions The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have recently been underperforming the less economically sensitive defensive stocks. This suggests that an economic growth scare is one cause of the recent stock weakness. While it should continue to be monitored, the relative weakness of cyclical stocks has improved off its most recent lows and isn’t at the level seen before past recessions. Performance Of Cyclical Stocks The 10-year Treasury minus 2-year yield is probably the most well-known predictor of recession. Historically, when the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury falls below the 2-year yield, also called yield curve inverting, a recession is coming. Since the 1970s, a yield curve inversion has occurred before every recession. The only blemishes on its record are the 1998 and mid-2022 inversions, which produced no subsequent economic recessions. The U.S. economy did see a significant slowdown in the first half of 2022 but rebounded in the second half. Unfortunately, even when the signal is correct, it has variable lead and lag times. The yield curve still has a better prediction track record than the economists and is used in about every Federal Reserve model, so it is worth watching despite its warts. The curve is not currently inverted, so this model forecasts no recession. The Yield Curve & Recessions The economic calendar releases for the week are not of the highest importance. The two most notable are February durable goods orders on Wednesday and personal income and spending on Friday. Last week, the Federal Reserve left its projected rate cuts at two but increased the inflation and unemployment forecasts. In addition, the median forecast for GDP growth was lowered. Markets saw this as a somewhat dovish signal and pushed expectations closer to three cuts for 2025, with the first in June. Number Of Fed Rate Cuts Expected Correctly forecasting a recession is challenging in the best of times, but the post-COVID-19 period, with its irregular economic cycles, makes it even more perilous. These high-frequency indicators should provide a reasonable early warning system for a sizable economic contraction. Currently, the odds point to an economic slowdown rather than a recession, which bodes well for reasonable returns from the correction bottom. As always, there are no easy calls when it comes to forecasting the short-term movement of stocks or the economy, especially in a period of increased uncertainty around the severity of the tariffs. For example, though most are rightly concerned about the downside risk from tariffs, there is an upside if somehow this pressure results in better trade terms for U.S. companies. There is always uncertainty. So, investors should have a portfolio with enough cash and bonds to cover short-term expenses. This cushion can help moderate the impact of stock declines on a portfolio and allow one to withstand the inevitable stock declines to experience the benefits of long-term ownership. Within the stock portion, focus should be paid to companies that can weather economic dislocations and perhaps even take advantage of them, regardless of their stock price movement.

Title: Trump hints at 'flexibility' for China even as he plows ahead with global tariff plans

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Markets whipsawed further Friday in response to President Donald Trump’s latest comments on tariffs, with stocks briefly turning higher after he hinted that there may be “flexibility” in his plan to impose blanket tariffs on most U.S. trading partners next month before retreating back into the red. In remarks in the Oval Office, Trump said he was not interested in making exceptions to the broad “fair and reciprocal” duties he’d foreshadowed in February that he now says will be imposed April 2. But he nevertheless offered some daylight. “I don’t change. But the word flexibility is an important word,” Trump said. “Sometimes it’s flexibility. So there’ll be flexibility, but basically it’s reciprocal.” The president singled out China, saying there would be room for “talk” on trade issues with the country while adding he hoped to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the near term. Despite that bit of give, it has become clear that the Trump administration is not backing down on its plan to establish sweeping trade levies, even as those efforts have sharply curbed near-term U.S. growth expectations while putting pressure on global GDP. “Every member of the Trump administration is aligned on finally levelling the playing field for American industries and workers,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to NBC News this week. “President Trump has assembled the best and brightest trade team in modern American history to reignite American Greatness, and they are hard at work following the same playbook — President Trump’s playbook — to deliver for the American people.” Even as stocks have firmly entered correction territory — declining more than 10% from their recent highs — Trump and other administration officials have also not pushed back on the idea that the U.S. economy could be in for a rough patch as a result of its tariff policy. Asked by Fox News host Maria Bartiromo if he was expecting a recession this year, Trump replied, “I hate to predict things like that.” Amid all of the developments around the Trump administration’s economic policy, the S&P 500 stock benchmark was set for its fifth-straight week without gains, finishing at levels last seen in September, while forecasters across the board reduced their outlooks for gross domestic product (GDP), the standard measure for a country or region’s growth. The rest of the world is starting to adjust. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has revised its U.S. GDP forecasts down from 2.4% to 2.2% for 2025 and from 2.1% to 1.6% for 2026. Global GDP was also revised lower, from 3.3% to 3.1% in 2025 and 3.3% to 3.0% in 2026. “Higher trade barriers in several G20 economies and increased geopolitical and policy uncertainty [is] weighing on investment and household spending,” the OECD said. And while the European Union announced this week it was delaying its retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods to allow for “additional time for discussions with the U.S. administration,” it was not seeking to “diminish the impact of our response,” it said, “in particular as the EU continues to prepare for retaliation of up to EUR 26 billion.” “This approach allows us to deliver a firm, proportionate, robust and well-calibrated response to the U.S. measures, while minimising potential negative impacts on EU producers and consumers,” an E.U. spokesperson said. Earlier this week, the Federal Reserve warned Trump’s tariffs could impose “transitory” price increases on consumers and businesses in the U.S. “Some near-term measures of inflation expectations have recently moved up,” Fed Chair Jay Powell said Wednesday. “We see this in both market- and survey-based measures, and survey respondents, both consumers and businesses, are mentioning tariffs as a driving factor.” He added that the on-again, off-again tariffs had ramped up overall uncertainty in the economy. Despite an avalanche of threats, Trump has so far only implemented a global 25% tariff on steel and aluminum alongside additional levies on China totaling 20% on top of pre-existing ones. The president has twice suspended 25% duties on most goods coming from Canada and Mexico, while also threatening — but not implementing — 200% duties on Champagne and wine imports from the European Union. But on Friday, Trump suggested the biggest global trade shake-up of all was coming in less than two weeks. On April 2, the U.S. will seek to impose massive trade duties on any and all nations that have imposed duties on U.S. exports — part of a move Trump has said is designed to level an uneven playing field for U.S. goods that contributes to America’s large annual trade deficit. “April 2nd is Liberation Day in America!!!” he wrote on Truth Social. “For DECADES we have been ripped off and abused by every nation in the World, both friend and foe. Now it is finally time for the Good Ol’ USA to get some of that MONEY, and RESPECT, BACK. GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!” In a new note, Gregory Daco, chief economist for the EY-Parthenon consultancy, said that while economic fundamentals “have been and remain disinflationary,” looking ahead, “tariffs, confusion around trade policy and tighter immigration policy mean the risks to inflation are tilted to the upside.” “Not long ago, US exceptionalism dominated the narrative — now, the mood has turned sharply pessimistic. What changed?” Daco said. Private-sector surveys, he said, have turned negative in recent weeks “due to broad based policy uncertainty & tariffs implementation.” “Consumer sentiment has plunged, small business uncertainty is near record highs, purchasing managers are increasingly downbeat, and consumer inflation expectations are surging.” The upshot? There is now “rising stagflation risk” with both price growth and unemployment potentially trending higher, he said.

Baa corporate bond data has a long history and arguably provides a look at the “typical” credit quality of companies, as Baa credit rating is the lowest level of investment-grade bonds. The spread is the yield investors demand beyond U.S. Treasury bond rates to compensate for the default risk from buying corporate bonds. These spreads expand when investors worry that more bond defaults could be on the horizon, typically driven by deteriorating economic conditions. While the spreads on Baa corporate debt are above recent lows, the increase seems insufficient to trigger substantial fear of any impending economic downturn. Corporate Bond Spreads The Chicago Fed produces the National Financial Conditions Index weekly. It looks at 105 measures across three categories, risk, credit, and leverage, to create a measure of financial conditions. According to the Chicago Fed, “Positive values of the NFCI have been historically associated with tighter-than-average financial conditions, while negative values have been historically associated with looser-than-average financial conditions.” The chart shows that these periods of tighter-than-normal financial conditions have often been associated with recession. Like the previous measures, financial conditions have worsened but remain below warning levels. Financial Conditions The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have recently been underperforming the less economically sensitive defensive stocks. This suggests that an economic growth scare is one cause of the recent stock weakness. While it should continue to be monitored, the relative weakness of cyclical stocks has improved off its most recent lows and isn’t at the level seen before past recessions. Performance Of Cyclical Stocks The 10-year Treasury minus 2-year yield is probably the most well-known predictor of recession. Historically, when the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury falls below the 2-year yield, also called yield curve inverting, a recession is coming. Since the 1970s, a yield curve inversion has occurred before every recession. The only blemishes on its record are the 1998 and mid-2022 inversions, which produced no subsequent economic recessions. The U.S. economy did see a significant slowdown in the first half of 2022 but rebounded in the second half. Unfortunately, even when the signal is correct, it has variable lead and lag times. The yield curve still has a better prediction track record than the economists and is used in about every Federal Reserve model, so it is worth watching despite its warts. The curve is not currently inverted, so this model forecasts no recession. The Yield Curve & Recessions The economic calendar releases for the week are not of the highest importance. The two most notable are February durable goods orders on Wednesday and personal income and spending on Friday. Last week, the Federal Reserve left its projected rate cuts at two but increased the inflation and unemployment forecasts. In addition, the median forecast for GDP growth was lowered. Markets saw this as a somewhat dovish signal and pushed expectations closer to three cuts for 2025, with the first in June. Number Of Fed Rate Cuts Expected Correctly forecasting a recession is challenging in the best of times, but the post-COVID-19 period, with its irregular economic cycles, makes it even more perilous. These high-frequency indicators should provide a reasonable early warning system for a sizable economic contraction. Currently, the odds point to an economic slowdown rather than a recession, which bodes well for reasonable returns from the correction bottom. As always, there are no easy calls when it comes to forecasting the short-term movement of stocks or the economy, especially in a period of increased uncertainty around the severity of the tariffs. For example, though most are rightly concerned about the downside risk from tariffs, there is an upside if somehow this pressure results in better trade terms for U.S. companies. There is always uncertainty. So, investors should have a portfolio with enough cash and bonds to cover short-term expenses. This cushion can help moderate the impact of stock declines on a portfolio and allow one to withstand the inevitable stock declines to experience the benefits of long-term ownership. Within the stock portion, focus should be paid to companies that can weather economic dislocations and perhaps even take advantage of them, regardless of their stock price movement.

Title: How to invest in this market sell-off, according to a top fund that's survived every crash since 1929

Full Content:
In the last 96 years, the Vanguard Wellington Fund (VWELX) has been through it all. Three months after its inception, what's now the third-longest-active mutual fund got rocked by the Wall Street crash of 1929, which effectively marked the start of the Great Depression. And in the decades after that disaster, it faced a litany of wars, recessions, and the financial crisis. Needless to say, portfolio managers Loren Moran and Daniel Pozen are undaunted by this latest stock-market correction. They're confident in their time-tested investing strategy, which has lifted the $113 billion fund past 92% of its competitors in the last 15 years, according to Morningstar. However, while many bottom-up investors simply block out the noise, Moran and Pozen think a tunnel-vision approach to investing is misguided. Instead, they go on the hunt during selloffs. "Where there's volatility, and there may be perceived weaknesses in companies that we disagree with, it certainly is a good hunting ground in terms of finding ideas and an opportunity to add alpha as well," Moran said in a recent interview. Being opportunistic doesn't mean becoming a day trader. Pozen stressed to Business Insider the importance of patience and maintaining a long-term perspective. He said he's focused on how his investments and fund fare over several years instead of sweating quarterly swings. Investors have been anxious about a lot lately. US stocks have gotten slammed in the last month as President Donald Trump's tariffs on key trade partners raise the risk of trade wars that may cause either a recession or stagflation, which is marked by weak growth and higher prices. Add in the market's elevated valuation, and it's clear why many are cutting equity exposure. In this momentum-driven market, these headlines can cause people to jump to conclusions, Moran said. So while it's smart to stay attuned to what's happening, she and Pozen are wary of overreacting to any narrative, including that economic growth is increasingly likely to fall flat. Successful stock selection is what separates mutual funds from the pack, and Pozen said choosing quality companies at a discount becomes much easier during down markets. "Cyclical companies that are perceived to have lots of exposure to that environment — if they're sold off as a result, then we will look at that company and see to what extent the stock price reflects too negative an outlook or skew, in terms of the range of outcomes for the business," Pozen said. In other words, when investors race to one side of the metaphorical boat — whether it's by chasing the same stocks or sectors — Pozen is comfortable with taking the other side. That said, a quick glance at the Vanguard Wellington Fund shows that its five largest holdings are all mega-cap growth stocks: Microsoft, Nvidia, Apple, Alphabet, and Amazon. Pozen said that he had to have some exposure to those names to keep pace with the S&P 500, as is his mandate. Going forward, he said he doubts they'll keep rising as much as they have. "It is an objective fact that seven stocks have been the primary driver of the whole market's returns over the last number of years," Pozen said of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks. "Now, there is a reasonable case to be made that the path forward for these companies will be more divergent than it has been in the past." However, Pozen and Moran adhering to their fund's strategy is different from following the crowd. A few years ago, the classic 60-40 stock-bond portfolio came under immense pressure, leading some to write obituaries for that once-widely accepted investing strategy. But the fund managers held to their 65-35 stock-bond split, in part because Moran noted that her predecessors made a mistake 50 years ago by bending to asset allocation shifts instead of holding fast and trusting the fund's decades-long track record. "There was a slight move in the early '70s where the asset allocation shifted more towards stocks, and that was actually a period of much more challenging equity returns as well," Moran said. "And so the shareholders really did not benefit from that more aggressive equity-fixed income mix." Studying prior selloffs can yield lessons about the present, the fund managers said, and they hope to capitalize on that knowledge now. When asked where investors should put fresh money to work, Pozen had a clear answer: large-cap banks. He also specifically highlighted Wells Fargo (WFC), which is his largest position on a relative basis, after the mega-cap stocks he needs to keep pace with the index. And it's a few spots ahead of financial giant JPMorgan (JPM), which fits this thesis he outlined. Since the financial crisis, the financial sector has been under tremendous regulatory pressure, and banks have borne the brunt of that scrutiny, Pozen said. "The regulators have really put their thumb on the scale," Pozen said, noting the liquidity ratios and capital requirements large banks had to comply with. "And that has resulted in suppressing returns on equity and growth rates for the sector with good positive outcomes, which are soundness and safety of the sector and economic stability." That overhang is likely to either lift or be lessened during Trump's second term, Pozen noted. He remarked that regulatory pressure "may or may not get better, but it's at least plateauing." In response, Pozen loves large banks that are well capitalized and have the scale and technology investments necessary to take even more market share and ward off fintech rivals. Plus, valuations for many financial firms are dirt-cheap relative to the broader market, especially in Wells Fargo's case. The San Francisco-based bank took tons of heat in the late 2010s for its risk management and sales practices. However, Pozen is confident in CEO Charlie Scharf's leadership in recent years, and the stock has responded accordingly, with shares up 46% since the start of 2024 after a yearslong slump. He's looking forward to seeing what Wells Fargo can do once it's unburdened by excess liquidity and heightened operational costs that come with the regulatory scrutiny it's faced. "As you see regulatory pressure ease for the industry — doubly or triply true for the company — it should be a great opportunity for Wells Fargo to finally realize the potential of the brand and the potential of the business as they get out from some of those pressures," Pozen said.

For startup employees wanting to rant about their bosses or run a digital reconnaissance on a company before joining it, Grapevine has been a go-to platform for the past few years, allowing it to amass a significant number of users. Now, Grapevine and other similar platforms just a few years in existence are nursing grander ambitions—to transform into a LinkedIn for startups. Grapevine, which was incorporated as Watercooler Chat Pvt. Ltd in 2023 and has raised about $2.6 million from PeakXV Partners and Riverwalk Holdings, plans to launch a job board shortly. “We want to give companies 10 good candidates every time they ask for one and do it faster than LinkedIn," said co-founder and chief executive Saumil Tripathi. That said, Grapevine hasn’t yet figured how it will monetise its job board. Medial, a networking platform for startup founders, investors and employees, is preparing to launch a marketplace for freelance or gig work. About “30% of our posts are people looking for someone to do some work for them," Medial co-founder and CEO Niket Raj Dwivedi said. This freelance marketplace will be locked behind Medial’s premium subscription plan, which costs $22 a year. Medial currently has 700 paying subscribers, who get access to a curated job board, a startup showcase, curated startups-related news, and a tracker featuring venture capital investors, government grants for startup founders, and a list of accelerator and incubator programmes. Peerlist, a platform for users to showcase their portfolios and side projects, also has a job board that charges companies $29 per listing. “We have planned a very straight path to monetisation for this year and the next," said Yogini Bende, co-founder and chief technology officer of Peerlist, which in 2023 raised $1.1 million from angel investors including Hubspot co-founder Dharmesh Shah.

For one, LinkedIn dominates the space, and recorded a 9% year-on-year growth in revenue to $392 million in the December quarter. In comparison, Medial has a monthly recurring revenue from subscribers of about ₹3 lakh, with a re-subscription rate of 70%, according to the company. Full-year financials for Grapevine, Medial and Peerlist weren’t immediately available. Also, the total addressable market for a professional networking platform focused on startup employees may not have much headroom for growth. India currently has nearly 160,000 startups, which created about 1.66 million direct jobs between 2016 and October 2024, according to the Union commerce ministry’s department of promotion of industry and internal trade. “Targeting niche networks is a better proposition than taking on large social media platforms. However, even then, you need to have 15-18% of the community actively engaging on these platforms," said Raghav Anand, partner and leader–media, digital and convergence, at EY-Parthenon. “Ability to drive multiple revenue streams and thereby a larger LTV are key to being sustainable."

These numbers fall short of Anand’s benchmark for an engaged active community that can drive multiple revenue streams, and, according to him, are also too small for advertisers to see any decent return on investment. “The bottom line here is that you either play in the 100 million userbase segment and get advertising, or if you are in the 5-8 million segment, then get subscriptions," Anand said. “But if your community is under 1 million, you need to have some very high lifetime value mechanisms."

Peerlist, which was founded in 2021, hasn’t yet spent any money on marketing, relying instead on word-of-mouth to reach new users, according to the company. “Right now, 40% of our audience comes from India and 60% from around the globe," co-founder Bende said.
