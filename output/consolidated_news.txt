If late 2025 tested Saylor’s conviction, early 2026 is beginning to confirm it. Strategy’s Michael Saylor has once again drawn attention to the impact of his company’s Bitcoin [BTC]-centric strategy, arguing that it has fundamentally reshaped its market performance. In a post shared on X, Saylor highlighted how the firm has outpaced most Wall Street heavyweights since pivoting to Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset on 10th August 2020. For those unaware, he usually refers to this period as the “Bitcoin Standard Era.” Backing his claim with comparative data, Saylor shared a chart tracking annualized returns across major assets during this timeframe. While Nvidia leads the pack with a staggering 1,557% surge and a 68% compound annual growth rate, Strategy ranks second overall. The company has posted gains of 1,173%, translating into annualized returns of 60%, placing it ahead of nearly all traditional equities and asset classes. Notably, even Bitcoin has delivered comparatively lower returns over the same period. Since August 2020, Bitcoin has risen 674%, equating to an annualized gain of roughly 45%. Taking to X, Saylor noted, “The best-performing assets of this decade are Digital Intelligence $NVDA, Digital Credit $MSTR, and Digital Capital $BTC.” Source: Michael Saylor/X Needless to say, this shift wasn’t driven by hype but by infrastructure. In 2025, digital assets moved beyond retail speculation and became a core part of global financial infrastructure. The rise of the “Bitcoin Treasury” model drove this shift. Following the approach popularized by Michael Saylor, more than 170 public companies adopted Bitcoin as a core reserve asset. By late 2025, NVIDIA further strengthened its dominance with the launch of its Blackwell and Rubin platforms. As a result, what once seemed like an extreme bet is now widely viewed as a survival strategy. Echoing Saylor’s sentiment, one X user added, Source: X However, not everyone was on the same page, as all-time Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff noted, “Yes, but all that changed toward the end of the decade when $MSTR tanked and $BTC fell. For the next decade the worst-performing assets will likely be Digital Credit MSTR and Digital Capital BTC.” This coincided with NVIDIA Corp. trading at $184.86, following a dip of 0.097%, yet maintaining a robust annual growth of 38.75%. In contrast, MSTR faced a sharper decline, trading at $157.33 after a 9.64% daily drop and a staggering 171.07% decrease over the past year. Meanwhile, BTC slipped to $90,467.38, marking a minor 0.14% dip and a broader 4% weekly decline according to CoinMarketCap. This shows that if the final quarter of 2025 served as a violent stress test for Michael Saylor’s conviction, the opening days of 2026 are proving to be his vindication.

Title: Bitcoin ETF redemptions explain why BTC stalled near $91k

Bitcoin’s rally stalled near $91,000 as BlackRock’s IBIT ETF led more than $300m in redemptions. Bitcoin’s rally stalled on 12 January as U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded another daily negative flow to cap the week. BlackRock’s IBIT led the selling and triggered a wave of real BTC transfers to Coinbase Prime. According to Lookonchain data, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a combined net outflow of 3,734 BTC on the day, equivalent to roughly $339 million at current prices. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust [IBIT] accounted for the bulk of that move, shedding 2,791 BTC, while Grayscale’s products lost a further 891 BTC. The selling came as Bitcoin struggled to hold above the $91,000–$92,000 range, failing to sustain a breakout after a brief rally earlier in the session. Blockchain data adds a crucial layer to the ETF flows. Arkham Intelligence shows that wallets linked to BlackRock’s IBIT sent large tranches of Bitcoin to Coinbase Prime within hours on 12 January. The transactions, visible on Arkham’s tracker, include a long series of transfers of 300 BTC each, alongside a smaller 143 BTC transaction. In total, the visible deposits exceed 3,400 BTC, broadly matching the size of IBIT’s reported daily outflow. Source: Arkham Intelligence Coinbase Prime is the primary settlement venue used by U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF issuers. When ETF shares are redeemed, authorized participants receive Bitcoin, which is typically routed through Prime before being sold into the spot market or redistributed across trading desks. The on-chain flows therefore suggest that BlackRock’s ETF redemptions were not simply accounting entries but translated into real Bitcoin being delivered into exchange liquidity pools. The data highlights a structural shift in how Bitcoin trades since the launch of spot ETFs. While ETFs initially acted as a powerful demand engine in 2024, they now operate in both directions. When investors withdraw capital, ETF issuers must source Bitcoin from custody and deliver it into the market, turning redemptions into direct sell-side pressure. On 12 January, BlackRock alone was responsible for nearly three-quarters of total Bitcoin ETF outflows, making IBIT the dominant driver of the day’s liquidity event. Grayscale’s products also continued to see outflows, though on a smaller scale. At the same time, Fidelity’s FBTC recorded a modest +87 BTC inflow, insufficient to offset the broader selling. Bitcoin attempted to extend its January recovery earlier in the day but was rejected above $92,000, before sliding back toward $91,000 as ETF-linked selling emerged. The timing of the Arkham-tracked deposits aligns closely with the intraday reversal, reinforcing the view that institutional flow, not retail sentiment, is now setting short-term price direction. With more than 1.29 million BTC now held across U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, even modest percentage shifts in investor positioning can translate into thousands of coins hitting the market in a single session. The episode underlines how Bitcoin has entered a new phase of market plumbing. ETF inflows and outflows are no longer just sentiment indicators; they now drive physical settlement flows that ripple directly into spot liquidity. BlackRock’s transfer of thousands of BTC to Coinbase Prime shows how quickly ETF demand can flip from absorption to distribution. Price action around key levels is now increasingly influenced by institutional portfolio decisions, rather than just speculative trading.

Title: GOP Sen. Thom Tillis says he will block any of Trump’s Fed picks over investigation into Powell

Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) said Sunday he will block any of President Trump’s candidates for the Federal Reserve following news of the Justice Department’s criminal investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Tillis’ new stance could throw a monkey wrench into approval for any of Trump’s picks to lead the Fed or replace potential retirees — the Senate Banking Committee, which has 13 Republicans including Tillis plus 11 Democrats, must approve all central bank nominees. “If there were any remaining doubt whether advisers within the Trump Administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none. It is now the independence and credibility of the Department of Justice that are in question,” Tillis said in a Sunday statement. “I will oppose the confirmation of any nominee for the Fed — including the upcoming Fed Chair vacancy — until this legal matter is fully resolved,” added the senator, who is retiring. Powell’s term as chairman expires in May. It’s possible he could stay on as a Fed governor through 2028, though he has declined to comment on whether he will remain on the board. Powell confirmed Sunday that federal prosecutors have launched a criminal investigation into him related to the Fed’s renovation of its Washington, DC, headquarters — after months of Trump bashing the chairman as “Too Late Powell” for not slashing interest rates quickly enough. “No one — certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve — is above the law. But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration’s threats and ongoing pressure,” Powell said in a Sunday statement. “The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president,” he added. Fellow Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) echoed Tillis’ comments, accusing Trump of wanting to install a “sock puppet” to lead the central bank. “Trump is abusing the authorities of the Department of Justice like a wannabe dictator so the Fed serves his interests, along with his billionaire friends,” said Warren, who years earlier called Powell a “dangerous man.” “This Committee and the Senate should not move forward with any Trump nominee for the Fed, including Fed Chair.” Amid Trump’s broadsides against Powell, the White House has pressured Fed Governor Lisa Cook to step down, accusing her of mortgage fraud. Cook called those allegations “baseless.” Stephen Miran — Trump’s economic adviser who stepped into a seat vacated by Adriana Kugler — will see his term expire in January. There are also rumors about potential retirements from the board, such as Vice Chair Philip Jefferson. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett and former Fed governor Kevin Warsh are reportedly in the lead in the race to chair the Federal Reserve. BlackRock exec Rick Rieder and Fed governor Christopher Waller have also been interviewed for the position. Prosecutors are investigating Powell over his testimony last summer about the central bank’s renovations. During an interview with NBC News on Sunday, Trump denied any involvement in the criminal probe. “I don’t know anything about it, but he’s certainly not very good at the Fed, and he’s not very good at building buildings,” he said. “What should pressure him is the fact that rates are far too high. That’s the only pressure he’s got,” the president added. In December, Trump threatened to sue Powell for “gross incompetence,” adding that he’d love to fire him for not slashing rates at a fast enough pace. During an unrelated press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the president fumed at the ballooning costs of Powell’s multi-year renovation of Fed headquarters near the National Mall. “It’s going to end up costing more than $4 billion — $4 billion!” Trump said. “Highest price of construction per square foot in the history of the world.” Last summer, Trump said he wouldn’t fire Powell after the pair wore matching hard hats and toured the central bank’s building renovation project, the cost of which has jumped from $1.9 billion to $2.5 billion so far. On its website, the Fed attributed spending increases to unforeseen events, like unexpected costs of materials and labor, more asbestos than anticipated and toxic contamination in the soil. But the project will “reduce costs over time by allowing the Board to consolidate most of its operations,” according to the website. After their tour of the renovation site in July, Trump took questions from the press while Powell stood nearby. At one point, the president said the costs of the renovation were much higher than the latest price tag showed, but Powell quickly jumped in, saying Trump had included costs from a project completed years earlier.

Title: Porter injury 'didn't look promising' - Bleyendaal

Raf Diallo RTÉ Sport Journalist Leinster attack coach Tyler Bleyendaal has admitted that the calf injury Andrew Porter picked up in training last week "didn't look promising" amid a growing front row predicament for Ireland in the build up to the Guinness Six Nations. The New Zealander also said fellow international Paddy McCarthy's foot injury "didn't look great". The prop sustained what the province describe as a "significant foot injury" during Saturday's dramatic 25-24 win over La Rochelle in the Investec Champions Cup. Porter missed that match as a result of his own setback and both he and McCarthy will be assessed before further confirmation on the extent of their respective injuries. "Yeah, obviously, Paddy's didn't look too great for him to come off immediately, so hopefully we get some clarity in the next few days," Bleyendaal told RTÉ Sport on Monday. "We're hoping for the best but it really didn't look too great to be honest and Ports the same. "To come out late in the week with that injury and again, waiting for the official kind of diagnosis, but it didn't look promising that it was going to be a quick turnaround. "So we're going to have to dig in and it's next man up, and we're going to have to find a way. "I thought the guys on the weekend did a great job and Jerry (Cahir) came on and he put his best foot forward and we're going to have to just dig deep into the depth and we've got some guys coming back as well. "So we lose some, we get some and whoever is available is going to have to do their best." McCarthy's injury comes at a time when the 22-year-old has built up real momentum for province and nation, having been rewarded with four caps during Ireland's Autumn Nations Series campaign. It is unclear how long the former Blackrock College student will be sidelined for. But the timing is far from ideal with the potential of a maiden Six Nations campaign just around the corner. "It's never a great time if it's a serious injury but like you say he's been playing so well," Bleyendaal said. "He's been a really valuable player for us - both sides of the ball. From the attack side, he gets us great momentum, defensively he's really solid and I think his set-piece is always improving. "He's been really good for us there. Like you say, he's got that taste of the Irish camp and no doubt he would have been involved again or hopefully still will be and that's why we'll go and get an update on him. "And fingers crossed, because like you say, he's been improving with every game and I think he's definitely got that Irish ambition." Jerry Cahir, who signed a short-term contract after impressing in the Energia All-Ireland League, replaced McCarthy following his withdrawal on Saturday, and the 25-year-old impressed Bleyendaal. "He's packing down scrums against some of the world's best and now he's learning, he's getting his opportunity and he's trying to put it all out there," he said. "It's great reward to see that he can come through that pathway and opportunities do arise. But it's a credit to those guys and their attitude." Bleyendaal also reserved praise for the development of wing Joshua Kenny, who weighed in with two tries against La Rochelle to bring his total up to eight in just six games for Leinster. "Just taking every opportunity that he's been given and he's obviously got some ball in some space and he's finished some tries for us which is great," he said. "But he's put in so much work off the ball as well and he's making cover tackles or he's getting invovled or he's chasing kicks. "He's come in at the start of the pre-season with a great attitude and have just been really impressed with him. "He's willing to make errors but he does it at full speed. He learns and he's willing to make errors and learn again so he's going through that process. "But he's great to watch with ball in hand and space, so it's our goal to get him more opportunities." © RTÉ 2026.

Title: The Trevor Project receives $45M from MacKenzie Scott after difficult years and federal funding cuts

The nonprofit Trevor Project received a $45 million gift from billionaire MacKenzie Scott at the end of 2025 The Trevor Project, known for its hotline for LGBTQ+ youth, received $45 million from billionaire and author MacKenzie Scott at the end of 2025, the organization said Monday. The gift is the largest in the organization's history but also a major boon following years of management turmoil, layoffs and the loss of significant federal funding over the summer. “I literally could not believe it and it took some time. I actually gasped,” said Jaymes Black, CEO of The Trevor Project, when they were notified of Scott's gift. Scott, whose fortune largely comes from her ex-husband Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, gave more than $7 billion to nonprofits in 2025, but this gift to The Trevor Project was not included among the donations she disclosed on her website in December. Scott previously gave The Trevor Project $6 million in 2020. In July, the Trump administration stopped providing specific support for gay, trans and gender nonconforming young people who called the 988 National Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. The Trevor Project was one of the organizations staffing that option and lost $25 million in funding, the nonprofit said. The Trevor Project continues to run an independent hotline for LGBTQ+ young people that Black said reaches about 250,000 young people annually, but they served another 250,000 callers through the 988 Press 3 option, which was tailored for LGBTQ+ young people. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) reported more than 1.5 million contacts were routed through the service between Sept. 2022 and July 2025. The Trevor Project has gone through years of internal turmoil after exploding in size from an organization with an annual budget around $4 million in 2016 to over $83 million in 2023, according to its public tax returns. The nonprofit's board removed its CEO in 2022 and has gone through a series of layoffs, including in July. Black said the project's 2026 budget was $47 million. “We are a smaller organization than we were before,” Black said. “And we will continue to be really intentional and really mindful around growth and what growth really means for the organization.” After it lost the 988 funding, The Trevor Project launched an emergency fundraiser that brought in $20 million to date, Black said, which they also hope Scott saw as proof that the organization was determined to stick around and make it through this period. “MacKenzie Scott’s folks were clear, like this gift was made for long-term impact,” Black said, adding that they would take their time deciding how to use the funds. Thad Calabrese, a professor at New York University who researches nonprofit financial management, said it's not at all uncommon for nonprofits that grow very quickly to run into financial problems. But he also said the cuts and general instability in especially federal funding for nonprofits has upended many organizations' business models. “Academic research has often viewed public funding as very stable, as a signal to donors that you’ve arrived as an organization, but the reality is you are now also open to changing political fortunes,” he said. He said research is also unclear whether diversifying an organization's revenue streams is always a better financial strategy. “You’re less dependent upon a few funders, but on the other hand, if you have a lot of different revenue streams, do you have the management capacity for that?” Calabrese asked, speaking generally and not commenting specifically on The Trevor Project. Scott has distinguished herself among the biggest individual donors by giving large, unrestricted gifts to nonprofits, often with a focus on equity or social justice. With the exception of an open call in 2023, she does not ask for project proposals nor accept applications. Despite the size of her gifts, which now often exceed the recipient organization's annual budget, research from the Center for Effective Philanthropy has found that concerns about nonprofits misusing Scott’s funds or growing unsustainably have largely not been born out. That may be because Scott's team, the members of which are largely unknown, conducts extensive research on organizations before making grants. In an essay announcing her 2025 gifts, Scott said, “The potential of peaceful, non-transactional contribution has long been underestimated, often on the basis that it is not financially self-sustaining, or that some of its benefits are hard to track. But what if these imagined liabilities are actually assets? ... What if the fact that some of our organizations are vulnerable can itself be a powerful engine for our generosity?” Black called Scott's second gift “a powerful validation,” of The Trevor Project's mission and impact, saying, “We’re calling this our turnaround story.” ___ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Scott has distinguished herself among the biggest individual donors by giving large, unrestricted gifts to nonprofits, often with a focus on equity or social justice. With the exception of an open call in 2023, she does not ask for project proposals nor accept applications. Despite the size of her gifts, which now often exceed the recipient organization’s annual budget, research from the Center for Effective Philanthropy has found that concerns about nonprofits misusing Scott’s funds or growing unsustainably have largely not been born out. Elisha Smith Arrillaga, vice president of research at the Center for Effective Philanthropy, said that’s likely because of the vigorous vetting that Scott’s team, the members of which are largely unknown, does before making gifts. She also said just like an investor might double down on a for-profit startup that’s struggling, some funders may still believe in an organization’s potential despite setbacks. “People make all different kinds of investments because they really believe in the outcomes that organization can make and what their gifts can do to help accelerate that,” Smith Arrillaga said. In an essay announcing her 2025 gifts, Scott said, “The potential of peaceful, non-transactional contribution has long been underestimated, often on the basis that it is not financially self-sustaining, or that some of its benefits are hard to track. But what if these imagined liabilities are actually assets? ... What if the fact that some of our organizations are vulnerable can itself be a powerful engine for our generosity?” Black called Scott’s second gift “a powerful validation,” of The Trevor Project’s mission and impact, saying, “We’re calling this our turnaround story.” ___ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Full Content:
January 12, 2026 This isn't my usual deep-dive article where I unpack a specific subject such as an app I built, my obsession with craft, or revisiting an old iPod. I set out to share a few reflections and musings on a year marked by personal and professional change. This was a year of stripping back to the essentials: where I live, how I work, and what I build. I've been running this site for just over 20 years now. I began writing it in my dorm room in Georgia Tech, hosted on a G4 Mac Mini1, as a way for me to share technical how-to guides and news. I used WordPress for the first handful of years, then the Ruby static site generator Jekyll for a decade. It wasn't until 2024 that I redesigned and rebuilt this site from scratch using Next.js.2 I'll be turning 40 years old in 2026, which is still surreal to me. For my entire career, I was always the younger one on the team, and what feels like a sudden shift means that's no longer true. In many ways, that change is actually a clarifying feeling. I'm more focused and fired up to do great work than I've ever been. I'm driven by the desire to craft great products: things I can be proud of working on. My framing shifted from "Can I help this team build this product?" to "Is this the problem I want to spend my best years on?" I've developed a visceral aversion to working in any environment where I don't feel like I can do the best work of my career. The view from the Sesame office in San Francisco where I now work My taste and judgment have compounded over these years. I've been through similar experiences that I can draw from across whatever I'm working on. Even on minor UI challenges alone, I'm still surprised at how often I pull inspiration from my time at Twitter where density was king and compact timelines ruled everything. I always try to keep that as just one input though, especially working in AI when so much is continually changing and you can't bring assumptions with you.3 Table of contents The year started with me finally selling the one-bedroom condo I had purchased a decade earlier. I completely regret purchasing that place. Not because it had major maintenance issues or anything like that, but because it was a horrible investment. I had it for 10 years and still lost money on it once you factor in the lower sale price, prep work to sell (staging, floor upgrades, painting), and associated fees. It was a relatively new building in a bustling shopping and restaurant area in Nob Hill near Russian Hill. The entire building was only nine years old when I bought my unit, so I only had minor maintenance tasks over the years. I loved living there. The unit was modern, had a good HOA, no issues with neighbors, and had 500/500 Webpass as the ISP (this was before fiber was commonplace and before Google Fiber purchased Webpass). The condo staged for sale. Why did I buy this place to begin with? I got it in 2015 when I was 29. I had been at Twitter for a few years and made some money from the Twitter IPO. I hated having roommates, and the alternative of paying $4,000–$5,000 a month to rent my own apartment didn't feel like a good idea. And at the time, it felt like you couldn't go wrong buying in San Francisco. More and more companies were becoming SF-based instead of Silicon Valley, and many friends and coworkers around me were buying homes too. I purchased it with 25% down and a 2.75% 7-year ARM mortgage from First Republic Bank (RIP, they were great). I figured seven years was plenty of time to either sell or refinance before the rates increased. That didn't help either. I moved to New York in 2019 and rented out my condo through a property management company that handled everything while I was out of state. I was in NYC for four years and lost money every month renting it out. Not to mention the property management company was horrible and a pain to deal with. My 7-year ARM's fixed period ended in mid-2022 while I was in New York while the rate was increasing monthly. By the time I sold the unit, my expired 2.75% ARM mortgage had exceeded 7.5%. It wasn't worth refinancing by then, I knew I wanted to sell it soon. My wife and I came back to San Francisco in 2023. That same horrible property management company forgot to have the tenant sign a lease (you had one job..), and the tenant ended up moving out unexpectedly a few months in. It lined up perfectly with the end of our apartment lease in New York, so we decided to head to San Francisco for a few months to fix up the condo, sell it, then head back to NYC. When we got back in January 2023, it wasn't a great time to sell, so we stayed. We didn't mind escaping the New York winter for a while, and the AI boom was starting to make SF feel alive again. We still love New York, but at the moment it really feels like if you work in tech and AI, you need to be here. The energy is palpable. We eventually got around to selling it at the start of 2025. I always thought selling it would be a hassle and that I would need to do upgrades to make it enticing. Well, it ended up being so much easier to sell than I expected. A former coworker introduced me to a small real estate agency; they were perfect. I dropped off the keys and they took it from there. They refinished the floors, upgraded some things in the bathroom, updated the heating system, painted, and staged. In less than two months, it sold. I received 11 offers: four competitive and three all cash. Even though I lost money on the sale all things considered, I had expected it to sell for considerably less given it was listed in January instead of the ideal time in spring. I learned my lesson with this place. I don't see myself purchasing a house in San Francisco anytime soon. The opportunity cost of the down payment alone stings. It would have tripled in a basic total U.S. stock market ETF over those 10 years. We've since been renting in Noe Valley for the last year. I finally have enough space and my own garage, so I moved over all of my stuff that had been stored with family: my Eames chair, Pro Display XDR, and old gear like this original iSight. Finding this rental was a huge challenge. Every evening for what felt like a year was spent scouring rental sites before we eventually found it off-market through a friend. At one point there was an apartment in Pacific Heights we loved so much we wrote a love letter (more common with purchases, not rentals), offered many months of cash up front, and even extra rent. There was just too much competition. I frequently hear from people saying they're moving to San Francisco in a month or two. My advice is always the same: start looking for your apartment as early as possible! 2025 started with an itch. After two and a half years of working on Rewind, then through its evolution to Limitless and the Limitless Pendant, I needed a change. I needed a new design and product challenge. In my time there, we really embodied what a startup is all about. We had a true customer focus, endless product iteration, countless product strategy refinements, and long hours sweating the details. We were a remote team of ~15-20 people in recent years. I was the only designer for a period and wrote about what this was like in The Startup Designer. The Limitless team at various offsites. We built a lot of stuff as we searched for product-market fit. Rewind was a native Mac app that captured everything you'd seen (via screen capture), said and heard (via opt-in meeting and audio recording), compressed it, and made it actionable. You could visually rewind time as well as search or ask AI to find anything you've seen. I loved that it had a local-first approach, private by design, and was a bit uncanny until you got used to it. An app that records your screen all the time? Crazy. But it worked. I would tell people that making Rewind was probably a similar user and marketing challenge to what the team at 1Password likely went through when they were starting out in the mid-2000s. "You want me to put all my passwords into this one app I'm supposed to trust with my digital life?" Crazy. But it worked. The Rewind Mac app. Bottom right: Rewind website I designed and built. We also made Rewind for iOS, then I spent some time diving into Windows development with C# and WinUI as we worked on a Windows app focused on using a local LLM. While the product had some challenges with search quality due to limitations from the local approach, I still think the Rewind concept is solid. Microsoft famously thought so too and created the Rewind-inspired Recall feature. There are some things I'd approach differently if Rewind were rebuilt from the ground up today: prioritize task-based workflows over pure recall, and explore using lightweight visual models for data classification. Rewind described on Lenny's podcast We then pivoted to a cloud-based product called Limitless, largely as a result of feeling limited by what we could achieve with Rewind's local-based approach. There was the cross-platform Limitless web and desktop app, and then the React Native mobile app. The Limitless.ai website I designed and built with lots of design details. My favorite detail was custom animating cursors when you selected a new Pendant color. Limitless started with meeting recording and summary functionality. That was a recurring use case people had with Rewind. While I personally felt that functionality wasn't the most exciting thing to work on, nor did it have staying power with countless meetings-focused competitors working on the exact same thing, we had an ambitious roadmap. The goal was to continually add more data sources over time for context. One of those data sources was to be our own hardware, the Limitless Pendant, to capture in-person meetings and conversations to help differentiate us from competitors. Early versions of Limitless for iPhone I designed. The Pendant was a bold bet, but after a year of building its companion app and dogfooding it, I realized it wasn't a product for me. I take privacy extraordinarily seriously and lean introverted, so I wasn't exactly comfortable wearing a recording device out of the house and asking for consent every time I encountered someone new. On top of that, my wife wasn't comfortable with me wearing it at home either. The product had real use cases, and we heard about that consistently from customers, but it wasn't for me. Meanwhile, the tech industry was exploding as LLM capabilities improved at a rapid clip and I felt like I was watching from the sidelines. Agents, deep research, multimodal models, new interaction paradigms... I wanted to be at the forefront of that. The opportunity cost felt too high. My heart wasn't in it, and I decided to leave. The Rewind and Limitless story came to a close some months later at the end of 2025 with a Meta acquisition. It felt like a great time for the team to join a larger company with the means to really compete with AI hardware and services coming out across the industry. It was a well-deserved exit for the team. Financially, I received a modest sum for shares I had early exercised, and for my vested in-the-money stock options. I had also previously sold some equity5 right after the company's last public round. I'll likely put some of it toward a few angel investments. I've done several angel investments in the past, mostly in crypto companies like Rainbow and XMTP (the messaging protocol now used by Coinbase Base and World). However, I've declined to do them more regularly because I feel that to do a good job, you need to have the time and bandwidth to stay on top of deal flow—seek it, meet the founders, and maybe you end up investing in 1 out of every 10+ teams you come across. After leaving Limitless, I gave myself permission to slow down before jumping into something new. I ended up taking four months off, though it didn't really feel like time off at all. I was meeting with founders, companies, and VCs for weeks, and also spent time I was working on my design portfolio.In hindsight I went overkill on the portfolio—I had two versions, the most comprehensive of which was 177 slides—but the act of doing it was a great way to reflect on how I worked, what gave me energy, and what drained it. My wife made the most of me no longer working nights and weekends, and we ended up taking a few trips. First to Germany and Austria, then later to Milan and Lake Como for a friend's birthday. Altaussee and Hallstatt, Austria. I haven't traveled with my big Sony a7R IV in some years. I get by with my iPhone, shooting in RAW and minor edits in Darkroom app. I stopped consuming caffeine entirely in 2025. It was during the trip to a medical health resort called MayrLife on Lake Altaussee, Austria that made that happen. This place was strict: a set schedule with strict meal times along with no caffeine or alcohol. The alcohol part was fine, but getting off of caffeine was a challenge. I had zero alcohol in all of 2024 and maybe just 5 drinks for all of 2025. I just don't really care for it anymore, and never loved the feeling of feeling something the next morning even if I only had two cocktails the night before. After the first full year of zero alcohol, it's like I was rewired and completely don't even care for alcohol anymore. I'll have some non-alcoholic beers and mocktails at times, of course. I had been used to having a 2-3 strong cups of coffee every day. I ended up having about 4 or 5 days of caffeine withdrawal migraines as I went cold turkey. After that, I decided I didn't want to go back to my normal coffee routine. I still love coffee and have a cup of decaf every morning though. I've learned all about the different kinds of decaf processes like Swiss Water Process (chemical free; the lowest caffeine but the worst taste) and Ethyl Acetate (best taste). My current decaf favorite is by Perc Coffee, but I'm still trying out others I'm discovering on the r/decaf subreddit. Lake Como, Italy. Went for my friend Ashley's birthday. After the initial withdrawal issues, staying off of caffeine wasn't that bad. Decaf coffee doesn't dehydrate you during the day, which is something I could feel. I used to rely on melatonin and sometimes magnesium to more easily fall asleep at night after a day of coffees, but now I don't need that either. The biggest downside is that while I love the flavor of coffee it's harder to find good decaf options at coffee shops. If they do have decaf, it's likely just one kind and only served as an americano, not pour over or brewed. I also took the time to hit reset and simplify a few other things in my life. On the nerdy side, I got rid of the two servers I had been running for a while. I had one server that managed this website's email newsletter, that I publish to very infrequently. I had been using a self-hosted web app called Sendy that uses AWS SES to send emails cheaply. I ditched that in favor of Kit. But between that and my other server I used to host my personal Mastodon instance, I hated having to login every few weeks to install an update or fix something. It's a small thing, but it freed up mental space.6 I stopped wearing my Apple Watch too. I was constantly annoyed by all the useless notifications and buzzing on my wrist. While I appreciated the health tracking functionality, I wanted to simplify. It didn't start as an overnight consciousness decision. I got a simple Casio F-91W watch, changed the strap and started wearing it some days. Eventually that became everyday. Half of what I appreciate is that it's not a smartwatch. The other half I appreciate is that it's just so small and lightweight. I wrote down what was critical to me as I started thinking about what I wanted in a new role. At the end of the day, I wanted to work with an exceptionally talented team, at the forefront of AI, with leadership and a CEO who genuinely care about quality, and as little organizational friction as possible between us and an outstandingly well-crafted product. I wasn't in a rush to find the next thing. I had time and wanted to optimize for seeing what was out there first. I'm often reminded of How To Be Successful by Sam Altman, where he writes: “I am willing to take as much time as needed between projects to find my next thing. But I always want it to be a project that, if successful, will make the rest of my career look like a footnote.” Being in San Francisco and being public about the fact that I was looking for my next thing was like a cheat code for that process. My days were filled as I met with several dozen founders, companies, VCs and friends. Every founder and team I met with had a unique perspective on where the world is heading, and they were fighting through the ambiguity to get there. It's still wild to me that this level of energy and ambition is just par for the course in San Francisco. I'm grateful to folks who took time to chat with me: A few things crystallized from all these conversations: All of this helped me articulate exactly what I wanted next after talking with small teams and large teams. I'm happiest, most productive, and most ambitious working on 0→1 products and bold bets that scratch at something new in AI, where there's a shared understanding of quality. I would much rather be the first designer tasked with creating an app or site from scratch than a designer or manager on a team of dozens responsible for just a sliver of an app. Not on a team of dozens optimizing something that already exists. I wanted to stay close to the craft while also growing a team. When I began this process, I actually thought I wanted to optimize for compensation and go to a late-stage, pre-IPO, or public company. I had always felt like you wanted to alternate between riskier early-stage startups and late-stage companies in your career so you wouldn't get "behind" with savings and investments. It became clear to me that was not where my heart was at all. I needed to work on something I was beyond passionate about with a team that shared that desire. Sesame ended up being everything I was looking for and more. It's been phenomenal across the board: the shared appreciation and ambition for excelling at craft, the remarkable team comprised of industry veterans, and the bold bets we're making on the product we're building. Yes… I know everyone says this about their company when they join, but that's really how I feel. I've never worked somewhere that truly cared about craft and understood it this much. A lot of that is due to the CEO, Brendan Iribe, who was one of the founders of Oculus VR. Brendan reached out after I published Browse No More. He's one of those founders I was alluding to in the previous section: someone who's really, really good at speaking about the importance of what the team is building, about taste, and about how great products are made. Sesame team offsite in Skamania, Washington I've been on enough teams to know that it really doesn't matter if various executives on the leadership team say quality matters. In my experience, it has to come directly from the CEO too. Brendan gets it; for software and for hardware. I later met the rest of the team, including the CPO Nate Mitchell (also one of the founders of Oculus VR), and it was clear this was a team I needed to work with. We're building both software and hardware. On the software side, we're building what we call personal agents. They're not productivity assistants, they're more like a collaborator and thought partner you just talk with. But even that description doesn't do our ambitions here justice. They're much more than that. We've been focusing on making them remarkably lifelike. That comes across in their unique personalities and how they carry the conversation. It's the sort of thing you need to experience to see what I mean: you can try our research preview released earlier in 2025 that over a million people have used. We're also working on an iOS app—you can get on the waitlist here. "This is not another productivity assistant. It's something different: a lifelike, expressive collaborator—designed to engage and evolve with its user over time." The second piece is hardware. We're making the world's best intelligent eyewear. They're fashion-forward and made for all-day comfort. Sequoia has more details on both our software and hardware in their article A New Era for Voice. The mission we talk about that I really love is that we're working towards bringing the computer to life with our hardware and focus on voice-first AI. We've been saying "software is eating the world" for 15 years now. Now as AI is eating software, hardware is becoming the new distribution and interaction frontier for AI. I'm not saying we won't have phones in 5 years (I still absolutely love mine), but I'm eager to spend time collaborating with the team here to see what these new interfaces will enable. "Hardware becomes a more popular moat (amid a surge of hardware startups). In a world where everyone can make their own software, unique products will emerge that tightly couple hardware and software." —Scott Belsky Sesame San Francisco one week when the NYC and Bellevue teams were visiting. Top: I'm on the left And after five years of almost entirely working from home, I'm thrilled to be back in an office. When covid started, I thought I'd never go back to the office. I loved having my own desk setup and being able to focus. Now I just miss working with people, whiteboarding design ideas, and perfecting prototypes right next to teammates. Also, teams building hardware kind of need to be in person with the number of physical prototypes we're continually crafting and testing out. It's been six months since I joined as Sesame's Head of Design, based out of our San Francisco office. My current day-to-day is heavy on design and code (Figma & Xcode for our iOS app)9 and helping out with things across product, hardware, brand, and marketing. We've got a lot in store for design this year across mobile, web, brand, and hardware. It's always a fun design challenge to work beyond just software product design. Basheer Tome joined my team to focus on hardware design, interaction design, prototyping, and everything in between. He had previously worked on Google Glass, Google Pixel Buds, autonomous driving, and all sorts of projects spanning PM, ID and CMF at Fellow. I'm looking forward to growing our design team this year. I'm the only software product designer at the moment10, and am looking to hire a seasoned product designer to work closely with me in our San Francisco office with a focus on visual design with a passion for craft and design engineering. We're hiring for quite a few different roles outside design too. I finally perfected my home office setup. For the two years prior I had a small desk in the bedroom at my previous place. Once we moved, I finally had space to build things out the way I wanted. I had room for my iMac G3 and vintage gadgets, a much larger 72x30" standing desk, and a lounge chair behind it. I also finally shipped my Pro Display XDR to San Francisco from where it had been in storage at my in-laws' house on the East Coast. iMac G3, Studio Display, Pro Display XDR, Glove80 keyboard, Uplift Standing Desk with custom LED lighting. For the last decade, I've had occasional wrist pain during extended computing sessions, but I have it under control these days with a combination of an adjustable desk (kept low enough so my elbows are properly angled), the Glove80 split ergonomic ortholinear keyboard, a Logi Lift vertical mouse, and a wrist brace for long sessions. Using a keyboard like the Glove80 (or similar models like the Kinesis Advantage2 I used before it) takes some getting used to, but it's worth it if you're in a similar boat with wrist pain from RSI. Separately, I try to use AI voice dictation apps like Aqua to speak instead of type when I can. I haven't quite built that habit yet. I've been thinking about getting a gooseneck desk mic for the office, like some other coworkers have, to do this more often. I've made a few other additions to my gear recently, but the standouts are my 333MHz Revision D iMac G3 from 1999, my original iSight camera, and my new OWC 4-bay M.2 SSD RAID enclosure. With the latter I've also started using Immich to manage my photos (hosted on my Mac, behind Tailscale) and will probably migrate my Google Photos to it. I've been meaning to post a much more in-depth article about the iMac. I updated the RAM, converted the HD to an SLC NAND flash CompactFlash card, and applied new thermal paste to the CPU heatsink. So much nostalgia. Ironically, I now work in the office on weekdays, so the setup doesn't get as much use anymore. I purchased a car for my commute, the newly redesigned 2025.5 Audi SQ5 SUV. I haven't had a car since I sold my E92 M3 about 7 years ago. Mechanically, it's great: quick, makes a nice sound, and overall fun to drive. The rest is just okay. The interior design leaves a lot to be desired. There's ugly piano black plastic everywhere and too many controls are touch-based. Driving to work… notice the check engine light that comes on and off randomly. Take it from me: don't buy the first year of a new car generation. But the icing on the cake is the garbage computer system. Not the infotainment system (though I really dislike that it lacks a traditional tachometer gauge cluster setting), but the whole car's computer system has been remarkably buggy. Various warnings and check engine lights constantly come on and then vanish on their own. I took it in for service just a month after I purchased it. They kept it for more than a week and the issues persisted. Others on Reddit are having similar problems and hope an upcoming software update will fix everything. I've definitely learned my lesson about buying a new generation car. Okay it's not an app, but I love taking notes, sketching UI designs and scratching off to-do list items in Mnemosyne x Kleid notebooks with my Baronfig Squire. I also love Uchida Le Pens for sketching too. I've gone through a few in 2025. Dia has been my primary browser for the majority of 2025. After living with Arc for the few years prior, I'm really accustomed to a browser with side tabs. I've tried to get into the ChatGPT Atlas browser and Perplexity's Comet browser but they never stuck for me, even with the promise of all their agentic functionality. I just don't really have a huge need to automate things just yet. Actually, I take that back, I would but the few times I've tried current solutions they were too slow and inaccurate. Maybe later in 2026. About 99% of what I have AI do in a browser for me is summarize long articles, and I use both Dia's integrated chat for that, and recently, Anthropic's Claude browser extension for that. I just hope that Dia keeps its craft and charm even after its parent company's acquisition by Atlassian. Flighty for insanely good flight tracking. I don't fly that much and this app is still worth every penny. I get notified of flight delays before the airlines send notifications. I can more easily look up alternate routes, see where the inbound plane is, and more. It's just a delightfully well-crafted app. Yuka lets you look up the health impact of various food and cosmetic items. My wife and I use it often to make better choices when shopping, such as avoiding harmful chemicals. There are a few apps like it but it's simple and works well. It does not have data about microplastics (you should definitely take a look at Nat Friedman's PlasticList) yet unfortunately, but other apps like Olive and Oasis Health do. These days we're much more mindful about what we bring into the house and have replaced pans with non-toxic ceramic ones, plastic cutting boards with oiled wood ones, avoiding certain dish detergents, et cetera. Mercury is hands down the best personal banking app and bank out there. There's an annual fee but you get a lovely, well-designed modern app with things like automatic transfer rules to move money around (e.g., don't keep cash in checking, always move to HYSA) and support for sending wires really easily. NetNewsWire combined with Feedbin is my RSS reader setup of choice. NNW has been around since I had a G4 Mac Mini in my college dorm in 2004. Great, simple piece of software. Though I do wish it had slightly more robust search functionality. Things has been my to-do list app for many years. Simple, well-built apps for desktop and phone. I have a few minor design gripes with it (what designer wouldn't have strong thoughts about their to-do list app) but it gets the job done. There's an unofficial Things MCP server I've been meaning to integrate into my workflow too. Raindrop is where I send articles I want to read later, curate design inspiration, save interesting links, and everything in between. It also saves a permanent copy of each link you bookmark so it's still accessible even if that page ceases to exist on the web. I try to go through it weekly to organize and review what I've saved. Obsidian (with the Cupertino theme) is my catch-all for daily notes and more. I pay for Obsidian Sync service too. While I have various folders for different types of documents from outlines and drafts of blog posts to documents for ideas, I primarily use it for work. I create a new file each week where I write notes for the week. At the bottom of each week's document I keep a running to-do list. At the end of each day I'll reprioritize that list or write down an action plan if I'm in the middle of a large task so I'm prepared the next morning. While I really love Obsidian, it's not perfect. Searching for files is really, really rough in my experience. I need to keep things in organized folders as I know I'll need to find them later and can't rely on search. Also, despite a robust developer community, there's not yet an amazing LLM solution. Fortunately everything in Obsidian is flat files, so I often use Claude Code with my Obsidian vault for things like synthesizing summaries and themes across a lot of files. And finally, the other thing I don't love about Obsidian is the mobile app navigation. It's likely a downside of it being a highly-extensible and cross-platform app, instead of a more opinionated native iOS app. Despite using all these apps for notetaking, saving, and curating, I don't really like the term second brain for this PKM stack. This quote below from I Deleted My Second Brain resonates with me to a degree, and I sometimes find myself saving things I never revisit. "The “second brain” metaphor misfits how human memory works: associative, embodied, and purposefully forgetful. When I first started using PKM tools, I believed I was solving a problem of forgetting. Later, I believed I was solving a problem of integration. Eventually, I realized I had created a new problem: deferral. The more my system grew, the more I deferred the work of thought to some future self who would sort, tag, distill, and extract the gold. That self never arrived."" 2025 was the year of coding agents for me (and everyone else too). It's a remarkable, remarkable tool. At the start of the year I mostly used Cursor for smaller tactical changes, but I quickly became heavily dependent on Claude Code. It just kept getting better throughout the year. "Claude Code (CC) emerged as the first convincing demonstration of what an LLM Agent looks like - something that in a loopy way strings together tool use and reasoning for extended problem solving. In addition, CC is notable to me in that it runs on your computer and with your private environment, data and context." —Karpathy There's many articles online on the proper way to configure and use Claude Code, how to put skills, agents, and CLAUDE.md to work for you, but this thread from the Claude Code creator in particular is worth a scroll: Tools like Claude Code still need constant babysitting and can sometimes get stuck in a loop, trying the same solutions that didn't work. I find it critical to try out other models regularly, even for the same task. For example, I get the feeling that Sonnet/Opus aren't amazing at more advanced or recent SwiftUI tasks. In a recent example it gave me the old GeometryReader hack for getting scroll offset from a ScrollView instead of the single .scrollPosition() modifier I wanted. These days I'm usually bouncing between Claude Code (usually via their official extension inside Cursor, which has nice expandable inline diffs) and Gemini 3 Pro via Cursor Agents. I don't have a set workflow. Sometimes I'll have Opus make a plan, then have GPT poke holes through it before Claude Code implements. I've also dabbled with tools like Conductor. Aside from the obvious desire for faster and smarter models that just nail each task, there's one thing I wish these tools were better at: undo. I know version control is technically my job. Git exists. But when I'm iterating quickly on a specific piece of functionality, I want to easily roll back to the last known good version without thinking about it. That's often from a previous agent response. I can leave a trail of commits behind me, but that doesn't look great on a PR. I can spend more time amending commits or dealing with git rebase, but that's friction I'd rather avoid. This feels like something these tools themselves should help with. Cursor, for example, doesn't have diffs for each agent response. If you want to undo the last change, you have to ask the LLM to do it, wait, and hope nothing else unexpected is changed in the process. Compare that to just discarding changes if you'd made a git commit. Much of what I do is design something from scratch in Figma, get it to around 90% or to a point where I have a few options I can't decide between without trying them out, and then begin building it. Figma is very much still a starting point. Lots of iteration—in aesthetics, interactions, and logic—happens while I'm building and feeling it out with real builds.11 For me that even meant going deep on working with metal shaders this past year: an area that seemed too complex to approach previously.12 However, I will sometimes use Figma MCP to help speed up parts of the development workflow. The act of building and testing out as you build is what design is all about to me. It rapidly surfaces new ideas for iterations and directions. There should have never been a design to engineering "handoff" phase. It's the same thing. Every designer should be a design engineer too. Being able to more rapidly build designs and interactions also means you no longer have to scratch your head trying to decide if you should come up with a long dissertation about why a certain piece of feedback from a peer or executive isn't worth pursuing. Most of the time, you can just try it out and see how it feels that day. Don't close off paths too soon. The biggest shift in design has not been on the visual design front for me. I don't necessarily need production assets with models like Nano Banano Pro, nor are there any UI design tools good enough yet to truly enhance my visual and UI design workflow… yet. I've tried to use them for coming up with design inspiration for things like iconography and brand design tasks at times, but haven't found anything that truly enhances my workflow yet. Designers need to push on what AI isn't good at yet. To me, that means constantly seeking inspiration, curating, and communicating well. Always be curious. You need to constantly be seeking information and inspiration. It can come from anywhere. Archive what feels good, interesting, or provocative to you. Hone your taste. The best designers I know are always curating. Some on Are.na and X. Some just in their own Figma moodboards. Some with link saving tools like Raindrop. Build that habit. With Claude Code, Cursor Agents, and dozens of other AI dev tools anyone can build for themselves now. We're entering the era of rapidly created, personalized and bespoke software. It's going to seem even more insane this year. Just because you can, doesn't mean you should. The hard part now isn't building. It's restraint in this world where we have more capabilities than ever. I've noticed this industry is a bit too trigger-happy to jump into Claude Code and start generating, then immediately commit what was one-shotted. Maybe we should all be doing our own product plan mode outside of Claude Code's plan mode. Taking a step back to ask what we're actually building and why before we start. It's too easy to skip the product thinking and strategy. That's the necessary but slow and hard work of deciding what should exist, why, and who it's for in the first place. What I'm referring to is just the normal product development process we've been doing for decades. Nothing new here. Just a reminder to not skip it when AI makes the building process closer and closer to a single button press. As I design things I'm continually in a loop asking myself things like: Similarly, even if AI does make something for you and does it well, quality can drop fast if you're not careful to polish and clean up everything afterwards. For code quality and product design quality. Always polish it yourself. That's where craft lives. Everyone's building some sort of agentic assistant right now. Connect your calendar. Integrate your email. Take actions. It all feels the same. A lot of assembled parts. Too many teams skip the hard parts: personality that builds trust, memory that truly enables continuity, and extensibility that meets you where you are. They also don't think enough about the why. Okay, so you can access my calendar… now when and why am I supposed to use this? That's why too many of these tools today feel like packaged slop. Personality and memory are what make these tools feel familiar and natural, not merely transactional. When GPT-4o was retired after GPT-5 launched, people were genuinely upset. They had gotten attached to how 4o wrote, how it felt. That's not nothing. As AI becomes more ubiquitous, more ambient—even worn—this will only matter more. Even in quick interactions, the wrong tone and style is immediately clocked. Personality, memory, and extensibility form the defining triad of future agentic systems that you'll want to use: It's time to stop thinking about building these systems as a series of LEGO bricks to slap together. 2025 was a lot of change compressed into twelve months—new job, new house, new daily habits. Most of it came down to getting rid of stuff, physically and mentally, that were getting in the way. Now I'm at Sesame working on problems I actually want to solve with people who care about the same things I do. This has been a lengthy article… a lot longer than I had originally planned. If you made it this far, thank you for reading. While I've been religiously saving interesting links and articles for inspiration in Raindrop, one thing I've started doing in the last year is maintaining a single markdown file where I paste interesting design-related quotes and related things. I wanted to close this article with a few of those. I always like to refer to old computer and operating system reference material and designs for inspiration. The creators of these systems started from what felt like a blank canvas, drawing on things like the desktop metaphor, to build what we have today. I try to get myself into the mindset they might have been in when thinking about the next generation of computing we'll have with AI. Palm webOS is a great one too… I got a Palm Pixi Plus recently: "People aren't trying to use computers—they're trying to get their jobs done." —Apple, Human Interface Guidelines: The Apple Desktop Interface (1987) On seeing things fresh and getting unstuck: "[…] looking closely at the micro level can unblock you for understanding the macro level. […] Pirsig's Brick is a tool for seeing things freshly “without primary regard for what has been said before” which creates that perfect tension of challenge and ability enabling flow." —Jordan Moore, How to Dismantle a Creative Wall "But there's a paradox at the heart of design that's rarely discussed: the discipline that most profoundly determines how lasting and inspiring a work of design can be is a designer's ability to look away — not just from their own work, but from other solutions, other possibilities, other designers' takes on similar problems. […] The most innovative solutions often come from designers who are aware of conventions but not beholden to them. […] This discipline of looking away preserves the singularity that makes great design resonant. When we constantly reference existing solutions, our work inevitably gravitates toward the mean. […] This is perhaps the most difficult discipline in design — harder than mastering software, harder than learning color theory, harder than understanding grids and proportions. It requires confidence to trust your own vision when countless examples of "how it's done" are just a search away. It demands the courage to pursue a direction that hasn't been validated by others. —Christopher Butler, Good Design Comes from Looking, Great Design Comes from Looking Away On design conviction: "There's an important rule of prototyping: find the fun first and build from there. In all of your brainstorming, you need to determine what is actually fun to play. Sometimes a really complex or interesting system is compelling to plan out, codify, and parse as an algorithm… but then turns out to be lackluster to engage with. Keep moving. Find this fun as fast as possible, and don't accept anything less. Your players won't either." —Andrew Zigler, MUD Cookbook: design meets implementation "Conviction often stands in opposition to market trends. To have conviction before validation may make you seem weird or delusional, but it defines great artists—the ability to appreciate what others overlook or even fight against." —Willem Van Lancker, Design Literacy "Hayden, you can't change the world. It's not possible. All you can do is try to make your own world and then invite other people to be a part of it." —George Lucas to Hayden Christensen On soul: In its purest form, design is poiesis. It is drawing ideas from the ether. It's a Muse. "Beautifully designed products without soul, are just that: representational garden art. In all of our history, we've never had more money to design beautiful, functional and usable products. The bar is higher than ever, yet, they've never been more boring and devoid of soul." —Steyn Viljoen, Beautiful, boring, and without soul On software today, especially with this era of personalized software: "software isn't just functional anymore. it's quietly turned into a lifestyle brand, a digital prosthetic we use to signal who we are, or who we wish we were.[…] people don't just use these apps. they use them to imagine themselves differently. more organized. more intentional. more in control. apps like superhuman or linear aren't just tools, they're lifestyle upgrades. software that feels like a reward. a signal that you care about your time, your taste." —you are what you launch: how software became a lifestyle brand "We stopped doing the real thing that would be the most empathetic, useful, and that would actually serve business outcomes best: building stuff that worked well and that people would love." —Jenny Wen, Don't trust the (design) process As for books, I did not read much at all in 2025 and really need to change that in 2026, similar to my 2017 goal of reading 24 books. I'm currently reading The Soul of A New Machine and The History of the Future: Oculus, Facebook, and the Revolution That Swept Virtual Reality. I'll probably find more from this list of books mentioned on Hacker News. 1 After 20 years, I finally got my G4 Mac Mini back. The person I sold it to reached out after noticing my gear pages where I've been collecting vintage gadgets and asked if I wanted my old Mac Mini back. I need to add it to my gear section. I have an old Intel Mac Mini too. 2 I've been running this site for half my life. These days I mainly just try to keep my gear pages updated frequently, and then only focus on an article when I have some topic I want to go deep on, a perspective I think is unique and worth unpacking, or generally just something I want to nerd out on. That tends to mean about one longer article per year, which is fine with me. Work consumes a lot of my time and I'm passionate about designing and building great products. 3 Also, I've worked with too many people who use their past experiences as the primary input for a decision. That's not only the wrong approach all too often, but it also makes everyone around them resent their unwillingness to consider new ideas and perspectives (or even just entirely different culture, values, quality, people). Not to mention.. do you know how annoying it is to keep hearing, "When I was at [company], we did X."? I always, always try to catch myself when I'm about to say that about my time at Twitter or another past company. 4 Even with fresh daily contacts, they're still nowhere near as comfortable as glasses on my eyes. Glasses are just easier and I've started collecting eyewear I really like, such as Mr. Leight and Lindberg. 5 Not being emotional with investments like that and being quick to diversify is something I learned after being at Twitter for 9 years where the stock was performing pretty poorly most of the time. Whenever I'd vest new RSUs and have an open trading window I'd immediately sell them. The logic there was "if you had $X in cash right now, would you go out and buy Twitter stock?" The answer for me was usually no. 6 Mastodon didn't quite pan out. I got really excited about the prospect of owning and hosting my own social media back when the Twitter exodus began in 2023… but it was never quite as active over there (same with Threads and Bluesky), and I still prefer Twitter/X. 7 I stopped the process with one company after meeting the CEO I would have worked with who lacked that energy. Instead, it felt like they sucked all the energy from the conversation. 8 5-10 years ago it felt like there was a wave of designers that figured success was going on the management track early (after sometimes just 2 years as an IC) when on a large team and we had bloated teams with too many managers that slowly lost touch of craft over time. Now they're having a hard time getting back into IC. Similarly, designers that don't do well with 0-1 design from scratch, for example without relying on existing design systems, will have a harder time operating on these smaller, craft-focused teams. AI tools today can't help that much on the visual design side, and people lacking those foundational skills will need to find ways to adapt. 9 My 2.5 years endlessly designing, building, then redesigning and rebuilding every part of my app Stocketa prepared me well for sweating the front-end details. Lately I've also been touching some metal shaders as well. 10 We do, however, have quite a few hardware product designers and industrial designers. 11 The new problem is now when people ask for a specific Figma mock of something in the app; the latest version is in the app and it's much more work to go back and update Figma mocks to be production accurate. Probably a product opportunity for Figma there. 12 Dan Hollick's Making Software chapter about shaders is a great read. Paul Stamatiou Paul Stamatiou is a designer who codes, based in San Francisco.

Title: Why Michael Burry's AI skepticism can be explained by an escalator that Warren Buffett built

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/12/2026 7:27:30 AM PST by lasereye Nvidia and Palantir's competitive AI edges won't last, argues Michael Burry Famed for predicting the housing market crash and a vocal skeptic of the AI boom, Michael Burry is now invoking one of the world's most famous investors to add gravitas to his argument. Burry used an escalator built by Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK.A) Chairman Warren Buffett, in a department store he owned in the late 1960s, to illustrate how vast AI spending may not leading to value accruing across its supply chain. "When the department store across the street put an escalator in, he had to, too. In the end, neither benefited from that expensive project. No durable margin improvement or cost improvement, and both were in the same exact spot. That is how most AI implementation will play out," Burry said in a discussion with Jack Clark, Anthropic co-founder, and leading podcaster Dwarkesh Patel that published on Substack. That is why "trillions of dollars of spending with no clear path to utilization by the real economy is so concerning," Burry, who was famously portrayed in "The Big Short" for spotting the subprime bubble, told moderator and newsletter writer Patrick McKenzie. Berkshire Hathaway purchased Baltimore's Hochschild-Kohn department store in 1966 - it was sold three years later - through a company called Diversified Retailing that later merged with the conglomerate. Buffett described in a 1989 letter to shareholders how he learned that a bad business model couldn't be fixed by a cheap price. Like the two department stores, most companies involved in the AI supply chain will see the same benefits if ,any, and none will have a competitive advantage, Burry said. As for Nvidia (NVDA) and Palantir (PLTR) - he has big bearish bets against those companies on the view they are overvalued - he says their current advantage with selling products designed for AI won't last. When it comes to Nvidia, for example, he sees small language models (SLMs) and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) - customized chips used for one purpose - as the future, with neither will need the company's pricey, powerful chips. "Nvidia is the power-hungry, dirty solution holding the fort until the competition comes in with a completely different approach," he said. Burry was also fairly busy on X over the weekend, retweeting a post by Tae Kim, the author of The Nvidia Way and a senior technology writer at Barron's, who laid out a case in November on how falling computing costs will help features of AI become more profitable for companies. "In the escalator example, the only value accrued to the customer. This is how it always goes if no monopoly rents can be charged by the producers or providers," added Burry. What would change his mind about AI valuations? "The biggest surprise that would cause me to recalibrate would be autonomous AI agents displacing millions of jobs at the biggest companies," said the author of the hugely popular Substack publication, Cassandra Unchained. "Another would be application-layer revenue hitting $500 billion or more because of a proliferation of killer apps," he said. For now though, he expects Nvidia's chips will last up to six years and the need for those waning, or they last just two to three, with hyperscalers' earnings collapsing and "private credit getting destroyed." He also said that generative AI and LLMs are so expensive it's hard to understand the profit model. Shares of Nvidia and Palantir are basically flat to start the year. Nvidia stock rose 38% over the last 52 weeks as Palantir registered a triple-digit gain.

Navellier is an extremely successful stock market veteran. But - Burry's argument makes sense to me. Somebody else (I can't remember who) recently suggested that LLM's are not all that useful. Another newsletter I subscribe to is Luke Lango's. He is an extremely sharp young guy. He says Nvidia will decline as companies create their own specialized AI chips. 1 posted on 01/12/2026 7:27:30 AM PST by lasereye [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] Michael Burry, the investor known for his successful bets against the U.S. housing market in 2008 and featured in the film The Big Short, has deregistered his hedge fund, Scion Asset Management, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as of November 10, 2025. The deregistration, which marks the fund’s status as “terminated,” means Scion is no longer required to file public regulatory reports, signaling the end of its operations as a registered investment advisory firm. Burry announced the move on social media platform X, stating, “On to much better things Nov 25th,” hinting at a new venture. He cited a growing misalignment between his valuation estimates and current market prices, expressing concerns about speculative bubbles in AI-related stocks, particularly those of Nvidia and Palantir Technologies.

I very often have to lead it to consider something it had ignored, which can even change the entire original answer it gave, to the exact opposite. It can’t be trusted, but you can review its sources and follow it up to then get a more refined, more likely correct, answer. When AI can streamline something, it will reduce costs and time for that function. It does help a bit with my health work, as before I had to search and read everything. Now, it pulls out enough credible information, although brief, that I can better pick the original sources to plow into, rather than read or skim “everything.” 6 posted on 01/12/2026 7:39:19 AM PST by ConservativeMind (Trump: Befuddling Democrats, Republicans, and the Media for the benefit of the US and all mankind.)

This guy doesn’t know how to make an analogy or coherent argument. When every store had to and did put in escalators it didn’t give anyone a competitive edge, but a store that didn’t would have lost business to stores with them. And the escalator companies made a lot of money. 9 posted on 01/12/2026 7:54:56 AM PST by ifinnegan (Democrats kill babies and harvest their organs to sell) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 7 | View Replies] To: lasereye Large Language Models can only be as good as the people who speak the language.

Federal appellate-level judges (justices on SCOTUS) should not be in the business of determining or setting policy, much less legislating from the bench. The aforementioned “nixing” of computer-implemented business method patents reeked of judge-made policy. Is AI resurrecting patentability for computer-implemented business methods? This would be ironic, since AI, at it’s most impactful, is said to be a replacement fir human reasoning and creativity, the latter being the sine qua non in terms of the legal basis for issuing patents (no patent can issue for an “invention” created not by a human, but by a computer). 11 posted on 01/12/2026 8:01:50 AM PST by one guy in new jersey [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: lasereye Burry used an escalator . . . to illustrate how vast AI spending may not leading to value accruing across its supply chain.

Burry used an escalator built by Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK.A) Chairman Warren Buffett, in a department store he owned in the late 1960s, to illustrate how vast AI spending may not leading to value accruing across its supply chain. "When the department store across the street put an escalator in, he had to, too. In the end, neither benefited from that expensive project. No durable margin improvement or cost improvement, and both were in the same exact spot. That is how most AI implementation will play out," Burry said in a discussion with Jack Clark, Anthropic co-founder, and leading podcaster Dwarkesh Patel that published on Substack. That is why "trillions of dollars of spending with no clear path to utilization by the real economy is so concerning," Burry, who was famously portrayed in "The Big Short" for spotting the subprime bubble, told moderator and newsletter writer Patrick McKenzie. Berkshire Hathaway purchased Baltimore's Hochschild-Kohn department store in 1966 - it was sold three years later - through a company called Diversified Retailing that later merged with the conglomerate. Buffett described in a 1989 letter to shareholders how he learned that a bad business model couldn't be fixed by a cheap price. Like the two department stores, most companies involved in the AI supply chain will see the same benefits if ,any, and none will have a competitive advantage, Burry said. As for Nvidia (NVDA) and Palantir (PLTR) - he has big bearish bets against those companies on the view they are overvalued - he says their current advantage with selling products designed for AI won't last. When it comes to Nvidia, for example, he sees small language models (SLMs) and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) - customized chips used for one purpose - as the future, with neither will need the company's pricey, powerful chips. "Nvidia is the power-hungry, dirty solution holding the fort until the competition comes in with a completely different approach," he said. Burry was also fairly busy on X over the weekend, retweeting a post by Tae Kim, the author of The Nvidia Way and a senior technology writer at Barron's, who laid out a case in November on how falling computing costs will help features of AI become more profitable for companies. "In the escalator example, the only value accrued to the customer. This is how it always goes if no monopoly rents can be charged by the producers or providers," added Burry. What would change his mind about AI valuations? "The biggest surprise that would cause me to recalibrate would be autonomous AI agents displacing millions of jobs at the biggest companies," said the author of the hugely popular Substack publication, Cassandra Unchained. "Another would be application-layer revenue hitting $500 billion or more because of a proliferation of killer apps," he said. For now though, he expects Nvidia's chips will last up to six years and the need for those waning, or they last just two to three, with hyperscalers' earnings collapsing and "private credit getting destroyed." He also said that generative AI and LLMs are so expensive it's hard to understand the profit model. Shares of Nvidia and Palantir are basically flat to start the year. Nvidia stock rose 38% over the last 52 weeks as Palantir registered a triple-digit gain.

Federal appellate-level judges (justices on SCOTUS) should not be in the business of determining or setting policy, much less legislating from the bench. The aforementioned “nixing” of computer-implemented business method patents reeked of judge-made policy. Is AI resurrecting patentability for computer-implemented business methods? This would be ironic, since AI, at it’s most impactful, is said to be a replacement fir human reasoning and creativity, the latter being the sine qua non in terms of the legal basis for issuing patents (no patent can issue for an “invention” created not by a human, but by a computer). 11 posted on 01/12/2026 8:01:50 AM PST by one guy in new jersey [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: lasereye Burry used an escalator . . . to illustrate how vast AI spending may not leading to value accruing across its supply chain.

In the end, neither benefited from that expensive project. No durable margin improvement or cost improvement, and both were in the same exact spot. That is how most AI implementation will play out," Burry said in a discussion with Jack Clark, Anthropic co-founder, and leading podcaster Dwarkesh Patel that published on Substack. That is why "trillions of dollars of spending with no clear path to utilization by the real economy is so concerning," Burry, who was famously portrayed in "The Big Short" for spotting the subprime bubble, told moderator and newsletter writer Patrick McKenzie. Berkshire Hathaway purchased Baltimore's Hochschild-Kohn department store in 1966 - it was sold three years later - through a company called Diversified Retailing that later merged with the conglomerate. Buffett described in a 1989 letter to shareholders how he learned that a bad business model couldn't be fixed by a cheap price. Like the two department stores, most companies involved in the AI supply chain will see the same benefits if ,any, and none will have a competitive advantage, Burry said. As for Nvidia (NVDA) and Palantir (PLTR) - he has big bearish bets against those companies on the view they are overvalued - he says their current advantage with selling products designed for AI won't last. When it comes to Nvidia, for example, he sees small language models (SLMs) and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) - customized chips used for one purpose - as the future, with neither will need the company's pricey, powerful chips. "Nvidia is the power-hungry, dirty solution holding the fort until the competition comes in with a completely different approach," he said. Burry was also fairly busy on X over the weekend, retweeting a post by Tae Kim, the author of The Nvidia Way and a senior technology writer at Barron's, who laid out a case in November on how falling computing costs will help features of AI become more profitable for companies. "In the escalator example, the only value accrued to the customer. This is how it always goes if no monopoly rents can be charged by the producers or providers," added Burry. What would change his mind about AI valuations? "The biggest surprise that would cause me to recalibrate would be autonomous AI agents displacing millions of jobs at the biggest companies," said the author of the hugely popular Substack publication, Cassandra Unchained. "Another would be application-layer revenue hitting $500 billion or more because of a proliferation of killer apps," he said. For now though, he expects Nvidia's chips will last up to six years and the need for those waning, or they last just two to three, with hyperscalers' earnings collapsing and "private credit getting destroyed." He also said that generative AI and LLMs are so expensive it's hard to understand the profit model. Shares of Nvidia and Palantir are basically flat to start the year. Nvidia stock rose 38% over the last 52 weeks as Palantir registered a triple-digit gain.

When every store had to and did put in escalators it didn’t give anyone a competitive edge, but a store that didn’t would have lost business to stores with them.

This guy doesn’t know how to make an analogy or coherent argument. When every store had to and did put in escalators it didn’t give anyone a competitive edge, but a store that didn’t would have lost business to stores with them. And the escalator companies made a lot of money. 9 posted on 01/12/2026 7:54:56 AM PST by ifinnegan (Democrats kill babies and harvest their organs to sell) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 7 | View Replies] To: lasereye Large Language Models can only be as good as the people who speak the language.

Buffett described in a 1989 letter to shareholders how he learned that a bad business model couldn't be fixed by a cheap price. Like the two department stores, most companies involved in the AI supply chain will see the same benefits if ,any, and none will have a competitive advantage, Burry said. As for Nvidia (NVDA) and Palantir (PLTR) - he has big bearish bets against those companies on the view they are overvalued - he says their current advantage with selling products designed for AI won't last. When it comes to Nvidia, for example, he sees small language models (SLMs) and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) - customized chips used for one purpose - as the future, with neither will need the company's pricey, powerful chips. "Nvidia is the power-hungry, dirty solution holding the fort until the competition comes in with a completely different approach," he said. Burry was also fairly busy on X over the weekend, retweeting a post by Tae Kim, the author of The Nvidia Way and a senior technology writer at Barron's, who laid out a case in November on how falling computing costs will help features of AI become more profitable for companies. "In the escalator example, the only value accrued to the customer. This is how it always goes if no monopoly rents can be charged by the producers or providers," added Burry. What would change his mind about AI valuations? "The biggest surprise that would cause me to recalibrate would be autonomous AI agents displacing millions of jobs at the biggest companies," said the author of the hugely popular Substack publication, Cassandra Unchained. "Another would be application-layer revenue hitting $500 billion or more because of a proliferation of killer apps," he said. For now though, he expects Nvidia's chips will last up to six years and the need for those waning, or they last just two to three, with hyperscalers' earnings collapsing and "private credit getting destroyed." He also said that generative AI and LLMs are so expensive it's hard to understand the profit model. Shares of Nvidia and Palantir are basically flat to start the year. Nvidia stock rose 38% over the last 52 weeks as Palantir registered a triple-digit gain.

"In the escalator example, the only value accrued to the customer. This is how it always goes if no monopoly rents can be charged by the producers or providers," added Burry. What would change his mind about AI valuations? "The biggest surprise that would cause me to recalibrate would be autonomous AI agents displacing millions of jobs at the biggest companies," said the author of the hugely popular Substack publication, Cassandra Unchained. "Another would be application-layer revenue hitting $500 billion or more because of a proliferation of killer apps," he said. For now though, he expects Nvidia's chips will last up to six years and the need for those waning, or they last just two to three, with hyperscalers' earnings collapsing and "private credit getting destroyed." He also said that generative AI and LLMs are so expensive it's hard to understand the profit model. Shares of Nvidia and Palantir are basically flat to start the year.

"The biggest surprise that would cause me to recalibrate would be autonomous AI agents displacing millions of jobs at the biggest companies," said the author of the hugely popular Substack publication, Cassandra Unchained. "Another would be application-layer revenue hitting $500 billion or more because of a proliferation of killer apps," he said. For now though, he expects Nvidia's chips will last up to six years and the need for those waning, or they last just two to three, with hyperscalers' earnings collapsing and "private credit getting destroyed." He also said that generative AI and LLMs are so expensive it's hard to understand the profit model. Shares of Nvidia and Palantir are basically flat to start the year. Nvidia stock rose 38% over the last 52 weeks as Palantir registered a triple-digit gain.

January 12, 2026 10:00 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA News Summary: SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 12, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference -- NVIDIA today announced a major expansion of NVIDIA BioNeMo™, an open development platform that enables lab-in-the-loop workflows to develop breakthroughs in AI-driven biology and drug discovery. The life sciences industry generates vast amounts of scientific data. BioNeMo provides the development platform to generate and process data, train, optimize and deploy models — enabling the industry to turn data into a competitive engine for discovery and maximize the probability of success while minimizing R&D costs, which are currently estimated at $300 billion a year. BioNeMo has now expanded to include: “Biology and drug discovery are reaching their transformer moments,” said Kimberly Powell, vice president of healthcare at NVIDIA. “BioNeMo turns experimental data into usable intelligence for AI, so every experiment informs the next. This creates a continuous learning cycle that speeds up discovery and helps researchers build new frontier models to tackle some of biology’s toughest challenges.” NVIDIA is collaborating with leading life sciences organizations to integrate BioNeMo with laboratory experiments and scientific workflows, enabling the full AI lifecycle for biology and drug discovery — closing the loop between experimentation and AI. Today, Lilly announced a first-of-its-kind collaboration with NVIDIA to launch a co-innovation lab focused on tackling some of the most enduring challenges in drug discovery. In parallel, Thermo Fisher announced a collaboration with NVIDIA aimed at making scientific instruments intelligent and laboratories increasingly autonomous. Lilly and NVIDIA Announce Landmark Co-Innovation AI LabNVIDIA and Lilly’s collaboration will bring the companies’ respective talents together, integrating NVIDIA’s accelerated computing, AI and robotics expertise with Lilly’s world-renowned drug discovery and development proficiency. This will help Lilly pursue challenges that could revolutionize drug discovery, as the NVIDIA BioNeMo platform and Lilly’s agentic lab support Lilly chemists and biologists. The companies will also explore opportunities to apply accelerated computing and advanced AI across Lilly’s business, from manufacturing to commercial operations. Standing up this co-innovation lab follows the buildout of Lilly’s NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD™ and AI factory, the most powerful in biopharma. The new initiative expands beyond this existing footprint and intends to harness investments in next-generation NVIDIA architectures, including Vera Rubin — representing a total investment of up to $1 billion expected in talent, infrastructure and compute over five years. “We see this as a catalyst for the capabilities that will define the next era of drug discovery,” said Diogo Rau, executive vice president and chief information and digital officer at Lilly. “By working with NVIDIA, we’re uniting massive compute, specialized talent and the ability to shape data at immense scale. We’re moving toward a future where discovery is driven by rapid experimentation and increasingly customized models — an approach that reflects our commitment to leading applied AI in drug discovery and investing deeply in new forms of data generation and model development.” Thermo Fisher Teams With NVIDIA to Build Autonomous Lab Infrastructure for Scalable Scientific Discovery By integrating NVIDIA’s full-stack AI computing with Thermo Fisher’s industry-leading instrumentation, the companies’ collaboration aims to transform scientific research labs into scalable, automated data factories, including through: “Artificial intelligence coupled with laboratory automation will transform how scientific work is performed,” said Gianluca Pettitti, executive vice president of Thermo Fisher Scientific. “By combining Thermo Fisher’s leadership in laboratory technologies with NVIDIA’s AI solutions, we can help customers work faster, improve accuracy and get more value out of each experiment, ultimately accelerating discoveries that can have significant human impact.” The NVIDIA-Powered AI Drug Discovery EcosystemAcross the globe, innovators are building the future of AI for drug discovery on the BioNeMo platform, allowing developers to take an industrial-scale, AI-driven approach to understanding biology and designing potential medicines. Model builders across biotech and drug discovery using BioNeMo to scale model training and development include: Apheris, Dyno Therapeutics, OpenFold and Terray Therapeutics have also recently released models developed using the BioNeMo platform. AI Scientists Building Digital Labs of the Future Aggregating scientific data and building agentic workflows to analyze data, generate hypotheses and design experiments is essential for accelerating scientific discovery. A growing ecosystem of AI scientist companies are developing on NVIDIA open models and the NVIDIA NeMo framework to build domain-specific agents for science, including: Other companies adopting NVIDIA NeMo and NVIDIA NIM™ microservices for AI science include Benchling, CytoReason, HelixAI (a Sapio Sciences company) and Potato. Connecting these digital agentic systems into the physical lab closes the loop between in-silico experimentation and real-world validation. NVIDIA is working with an ecosystem of robotics and lab automation companies to introduce simulation and physical AI technologies: Other companies including Amgen, Automata, Roche and Transcripta Bio have built digital twins using NVIDIA Omniverse™ libraries and Isaac Sim to bring physical AI to labs and manufacturing facilities.

The two companies will invest up to $1 billion in talent, infrastructure and compute over five years to support the new AI co-innovation lab. Based in the San Francisco Bay Area, the lab will co-locate Lilly domain experts in biology, science and medicine with top AI model builders and engineers from NVIDIA, allowing them to work side by side to generate large-scale data and build powerful AI models that can accelerate medicine development, using NVIDIA BioNeMo™ as the critical platform. “AI is transforming every industry, and its most profound impact will be in life sciences,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “NVIDIA and Lilly are bringing together the best of our industries to invent a new blueprint for drug discovery — one where scientists can explore vast biological and chemical spaces in silico before a single molecule is made.” “For nearly 150 years, we’ve been working to bring life-changing medicines to patients,” said David A. Ricks, chair and CEO of Lilly. “Combining our volumes of data and scientific knowledge with NVIDIA’s computational power and model-building expertise could reinvent drug discovery as we know it. By bringing together world-class talent in a startup environment, we’re creating the conditions for breakthroughs that neither company could achieve alone.” Building a Continuous Learning System for Drug DiscoveryThe collaboration will initially focus on creating a continuous learning system that tightly connects Lilly’s agentic wet labs with computational dry labs, enabling 24/7 AI-assisted experimentation to support biologists and chemists. This scientist-in-the-loop framework aims to enable experiments, data generation and AI model development to continuously inform and improve one another. Harnessing access to unprecedented compute for the industry, massive, high-quality data generation and NVIDIA BioNeMo as the platform to accelerate drug discovery, the teams will focus on building next-generation foundation and frontier models for biology and chemistry. The new initiative expands on Lilly’s previously announced AI supercomputer and intends to harness investments in next-generation NVIDIA architectures, including NVIDIA Vera Rubin. The AI factory Lilly announced last fall, which is the most powerful in the pharmaceutical industry, will train large biomedical foundation and frontier models for identifying, optimizing and validating new molecules with exceptional speed and accuracy. It will also support new and advanced applications in manufacturing, medical imaging and scientific AI agents. Beyond drug discovery, NVIDIA and Lilly will explore opportunities to apply AI across clinical development, manufacturing and commercial operations to integrate multimodal models, agentic AI, robotics and digital twins. The use of physical AI and robotics in the AI factory will also help Lilly enhance its capacity to manufacture high-demand medications and strengthen supply chain reliability. With NVIDIA Omniverse™ libraries and NVIDIA RTX PRO™ Servers, Lilly can create digital twins of its manufacturing lines to model, stress test and optimize entire supply chains before making physical changes in the real world. Supporting Global Leadership in Biomedical DiscoveryNVIDIA leads in open-source AI, empowering companies with the models, data and tools needed to develop real-world AI systems. In addition, the NVIDIA Inception program provides startups with access to technical mentorship, as well as NVIDIA software and compute. Lilly TuneLab, an AI and machine learning platform, provides biotech companies with access to select Lilly models for drug discovery built on decades of Lilly’s proprietary data. TuneLab will include NVIDIA Clara™ open foundation models for life sciences as part of a future workflow offering. The co-innovation lab will provide NVIDIA and Lilly’s startup ecosystems and researchers with deep expertise and scale of computing resources. The lab’s work is expected to begin in South San Francisco early this year. About LillyLilly is a medicine company turning science into healing to make life better for people around the world.

Title: Charles Hoskinson doubts CLARITY Act timeline, says Trump crypto czar should quit

Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson said the CLARITY Act may not pass this quarter, and criticized US crypto laws for favoring big banks over innovation. Cointelegraph in your social feed Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson said he doubts the US Digital Asset Market Clarity Act will pass this quarter and called on President Donald Trump’s crypto adviser, David Sacks, to resign. Hoskinson criticized the US approach to regulating crypto in an interview on Sunday with Bitcoin (BTC) enthusiast Scott Melker on The Wolf of All Streets Podcast. “I don’t think the CLARITY Act is going to pass this quarter,” Hoskinson said, warning that if Democrats regain control of the US House of Representatives in November’s midterm elections, the current window to pass the bill could be lost. “If it doesn’t pass this quarter, I think Sacks should resign,” he added, blaming Sacks for “utterly failing” the crypto industry since taking on the role of Trump’s crypto czar in late 2024. Introduced in May 2025, the CLARITY Act cleared both the House Financial Services Committee and the House Agriculture Committee with bipartisan support. It seeks to clarify the roles of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission in regulating cryptocurrencies, and to provide guidance on different types of tokens. The Senate Agriculture and Banking Committees are expected to vote on the bill later this week, in a potential milestone for the US crypto industry. In expressing doubts over the bill’s passage, Hoskinson said Sacks had “failed” the industry in three areas, including falling prices, lack of regulatory clarity and the absence of a strong foundation for building projects. “If you’re the czar and you’re in charge of this whole thing, I got to judge you by your track record. Most cryptos are down 40 to 50% since Trump took office. So the industry is unhealthy,” he said. Expanding on the industry’s struggles, Hoskinson also argued that other bills, such as the stablecoin-related GENIUS Act, favor large financial institutions over retail investors. “It [GENIUS Act] centralizes the industry around BlackRock, Cantor, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley and all these big guys,” he said, adding that the bill essentially “handed Wall Street the keys to the crypto kingdom.” Related: Coinbase could pull CLARITY Act support over stablecoin rewards ban Addressing Trump’s approach to crypto, including the controversial Trump memecoin, Hoskinson urged the US not to favor or nationalize cryptocurrency, warning it should remain a global, neutral product: Hoskinson said crypto laws should be passed carefully, with the industry united and the US government working alongside it rather than rushing for partisan gain. “Even if it takes longer to get done, the goal should be to pass rules that last and don’t harm innovation,” he said.

Investing Growth and income investors looking for a safer way to play the AI and data center explosion have found an avenue with utility stocks. Many top U.S. utility companies have already cut landmark deals with big-tech giants. Paying dependable dividends and offering long-term safety for investors, top utility stocks make sense in a growth and income portfolio. Sending You to Google News in 3 © zhongguo / Getty Images Big tech companies are increasingly striking direct deals with utilities to secure reliable, long-term energy supplies as their power needs surge, driven mainly by data centers, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. These agreements often include power purchase agreements for renewable energy, such as wind and solar, allowing tech firms to lock in stable prices while helping utilities finance new generation and grid upgrades. In some cases, companies are also partnering with utilities on energy storage, transmission expansion, and even next-generation sources like small modular nuclear reactors to ensure around-the-clock power. For utilities, these deals provide guaranteed demand and investment capital. At the same time, tech companies offer energy security, cost predictability, and progress toward sustainability goals—making the partnerships strategically crucial for both sides. We decided to screen our 24/7 Wall St. utility stocks research database to identify the top companies in the sector that have already struck substantial deals with some of Silicon Valley’s most prominent players. Surging demand for electricity, which will only continue to grow, has made some of America’s oldest and best utility companies one of the best investments for growth and income investors who would like to participate in the AI/data center revolution but would rather play it from a safer angle. What could be a better avenue than utility stocks that pay dependable, and in some cases large, dividend payments every quarter? Five top companies that we have covered for years may be perfect stocks for Boomer and Gen X investors, and all are rated Buy at the top Wall Street firms we cover. This off-the-radar utility stock is an ideal choice for growth and income investors, with its hefty 3.93% dividend yield. Brookfield Renewable Corp. (NYSE: BEPC) operates renewable power platforms and sustainable solutions. The company has signed a framework with Microsoft to develop over 10.5 GW of new renewable energy capacity from 2026 to 2030, and also has a hydro framework agreement with Google.

Title: Does Washington’s Global War Against China’s Oil Suppliers Stand Any Chance of Success?

Does it make any sense? Among the White House demands of Venezuela is that it “kick out” China and sever economic ties. The Financial Times declares that “Donald Trump’s Venezuela action raises threat for China’s oil supplies.” As even Seymour Hersh reports: Their bluster and crude language transfixed the world’s media, but they also diverted attention from an opportunistic Trump plan whose goal was not only to unseat the corrupt President Nicolás Maduro, but also, crucially, to cut off China, America’s economic rival, from its ongoing purchases of Venezuela’s cheap heavy crude oil. Okay, but there’s a problem. China Does Not Rely on Venezuelan Oil While the mainstream media has mostly ignored this fact, it is clear: China is by far Venezuela’s largest oil customer (left chart: https://t.co/9SokdGJ3Z6). But Venezuela is a tiny fraction of China’s oil imports and doesn’t even make the top 10 for 2024 according to Chinese customs data (right chart: https://t.co/WrXoVAQKlj). pic.twitter.com/YAJi8HhuF7 — Kyle Chan (@kyleichan) January 7, 2026 China was the major buyer of crude from Venezuela, but those shipments made up only 4 per cent of China’s oil imports last year. Caracas did, however, provide a high-sulphur crude that’s used to produce bitumen, which is used for construction and road building, and Beijing was getting it at a steep discount thanks to U.S. sanctions on Venezuela sales. According to The Business Times, Beijing has plenty of that sludgy oil in reserve: … a hoard of sanctioned crude in floating storage will cushion Chinese buyers in the coming months. Almost 82 million barrels is currently on tankers in waters off China and Malaysia, according to data intelligence firm Kpler. More than a quarter is Venezuelan and the rest is Iranian, it said. China could take a small hit from the US move in Venezuela. In September, China Concord Resources Corp. (CCRC) installed a self-elevating offshore oil platform in Lake Maracaibo. From Venezuelanalysis: The privately-owned China Concord secured a 20-year deal to run the Lago Cinco and Lagunillas Lago oilfields and will reportedly invest US $1 billion with the goal of raising production from the present 12,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 60,000 bpd by the end of 2026. Chinese oil majors Sinopec and China National Petroleum also have legacy claims to develop Venezuelan oil reserves, but that appears unlikely if the US has its way. Still, let’s look at the makeup of Chinese oil imports, courtesy of the Financial Times: As the Times notes, those imports from Malaysia are believed to be mostly Iranian crude in a route to circumvent US sanctions. And following the kidnapping of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, the American Zionists are now back focused on Tehran. Hersh also reported the obvious: The next target, I have been told, will be Iran, another purveyor to China whose crude oil reserves are the world’s fourth largest. And yet even if Washington and Israel are finally able to topple the government there, it would likely just drive Beijing and Moscow even closer together. Let’s look at how that energy relationship continues to evolve ever since Washington embarked on its grand plan topple the government in Moscow. First on natural gas. From Amwaj: Following the September summit of Chinese, Mongolian and Russian leaders in Beijing, Russia’s Gazprom and China National Petroleum Company (CNPC) agreed to launch the Power of Siberia-2 (PoS-2). The pipeline is designed to deliver up to 50B cubic meters (cm) of gas annually to China. Although no firm timeline is set, the project is expected to go online after 2030–31. China and Russia also decided to expand flows through existing gas pipelines. By 2028, the capacity of Power of Siberia-1 will rise from 38B to 44B cm. Meanwhile, the Far Eastern route—expected to enter service in 2027—will transfer 12B cm of gas, up from 10B. Moscow additionally plans to ramp up liquified gas exports to China via the new Arctic LNG-2 project and the existing Sakhalin-2 plant. Despite western sanctions on Russia, China began receiving Arctic LNG-2 cargo in late August, becoming the sole major customer of the project and thereby effectively keeping it alive. Notably, Beijing is expanding imports from Russia despite analysts’ assessment that existing contracts will likely cover the country’s needs over the next decade. It’s almost as if Beijing knows there’s a plan afoot to cut off its supplies and so is leaning on its most reliable and geographically convenient partner. And it’s doing the same with oil. Even if the US knocks out other suppliers and American pirates control most of the world’s seas blocking a huge chunk of the oil trade, disrupting that “dragonbear” hydrocarbon supply chain is a whole different game than Venezuela and Iran, as the years-long unsuccessful Project Ukraine has shown. But is there more at play than simply cutting supply to China. As Nick Corbishley pointed out Friday, even the most American-friendly states in Latin America are having a difficult time severing their relationship with China. Not even the US can do that. So what did Washington achieve on this front—if anything? Grand Industrial Planners or Spoiled Destructive Children? Despite all the talk of the oil and mineral bonanza in Venezuela, there are still loads of roadblocks, and someone will have to point to a recent example of the US successfully building anything. Note Of Extreme Caution To Comrades: DO NOT FALL FOR THE “IT’S ALL ABOUT OIL” LIE I’ve lived through multiple imperial wars where the so-called “left” reflexively responded with the same lazy line: “They’re just there for the oil.” I remember this explicitly during the First… pic.twitter.com/i03Y48xA2n — Chris Morlock (@CDMorlock) January 6, 2026 Morlock offers some important reminders, including: Do you seriously believe that Trump, along with his Palantir Technologies cronies, are about to become industrial planners? That without invasion, without regime change, without national reconstruction, they’ll somehow negotiate a $200 billion, 15-year industrial oil expansion in a country whose infrastructure has been deliberately strangled for a decade? This is a pipe dream of pipe dreams. What’s actually lined up for Venezuela is not extraction, but asset stripping. The firms positioned to “re-enter” Venezuela are overwhelmingly financial, not productive. Asset managers like BlackRock are positioned to absorb distressed sovereign and PDVSA-linked debt, restructure it, and turn future production into collateral streams rather than national revenue. U.S. and European oil majors are waiting not to build capacity but for production-sharing agreements, arbitration rulings, and debt-for-equity swaps that cap output and guarantee rents. Sanctions relief is used as leverage not to expand capacity, but to discipline the state and force Venezuela into IMF-style restructuring, privatization, and legal subordination to Western capital markets. They want the Chinese to pay for this oil in dollars, a minor nuisance for Xi, a silly ploy for the western rentier oligarchs. China reportedly holds roughly $19–20 billion in loans to Venezuela tied to “oil-for-loan” deals. That’s not much, but also won’t set a great precedent if Caracas defaults on the debt and ends resource exports to China. ‘Control’ Over Existing Production in Western Hemisphere? While oil majors are reluctant to jump into Venezuela, what about existing production in the Western Hemisphere? Javier Blas writes at Bloomberg of the US exerting control over all the oil production of countries—from Canada to Argentina— living under the “Donroe Doctrine.” That’s nearly 40 percent of the world’s oil output. Now Blas assumes the US can control this vast territory, but seeing Canada as a vassal state and the rightward, US-friendly turn of much of Latin America, could he be right—at least on the oil front? President Donald Trump now has his very own oil empire. And I’m talking about actual barrels already flowing into the market, not underground reserves that would take time and money to be developed1. With such resources Trump has an economic and geopolitical lever no US president has had since Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1940s. At home and nearby, his country can tap a vast sea of oil. The implications of getting unfettered access to Venezuela’s reserves, the world’s largest, were immediately apparent to anyone in the energy and commodities business, particularly American foes. Oleg Deripaska, a US-sanctioned Russian oligarch, put it well on Saturday: Washington would have the means to keep the oil price close to $50 a barrel — giving it a winning hand in the future against anyone threatening to push the price higher by curbing supply. The Kremlin envoy Kirill Dmitriev said seizing power in Venezuela offered “huge leverage” over the global energy market. Having de facto control of the Western Hemisphere’s petroleum wealth is a geopolitical game changer. For decades, US military adventurism was constrained by the impact of any war on energy costs. Today the White House has primacy over oil-producing allies and adversaries alike — whether it’s Saudi Arabia or Iran, Nigeria or Russia. The past 18 months have already shown what these new hydrocarbon riches mean for US foreign policy. Trump’s administration has taken once unthinkable steps: from bombing Iranian nuclear facilities to helping Ukraine target Russian oil refineries. There is also talk that in the more immediate future the larger effect from the move against Venezuela could be in neighboring Guyana: While the world watches Venezuela, the real story might be next door in Guyana, where the world’s most important new oil frontier was under direct threat. Maduro’s claim to two-thirds of Guyana’s territory (Esequibo region) aimed to seize over 11 billion barrels of onshore and… pic.twitter.com/tHC6Ljh81D — Jack Prandelli (@jackprandelli) January 5, 2026 And there’s the ol’ ‘swingman’ argument: ⚠️The US Has Only 7 Years of Reserves But is pumping 13 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY 🇺🇸🛢️ The United States sits outside the top 5 in proven oil reserves At current production rates, that’s ~7–8 years of reserve life. And yet… The US is the world’s oil swing machine 🔥 ~13 mb/d… pic.twitter.com/N4ssuY4aA6 — Jack Prandelli (@jackprandelli) January 9, 2026 But what of China’s role as a “swingman”? As Kevin Walmsley notes: China is very well-insulated from any supply-side shocks for oil, no matter where from. This is a surprising situation now, for economists and experts in the oil market. China is the world’s biggest importer of crude oil, and the world’s biggest consumer of oil. The traditional thinking – until recently — is that it is the oil suppliers, like OPEC+, who determine the global price for oil, and that big importers, like China, are price takers in the market. Now, if the market faces oversupply, it would be OPEC members who would be price takers, temporarily, until they can push production down to balance supply and demand again. But a new development has scrambled all that convention wisdom: China’s enormous — and still growing — oil storage industry. That is putting a floor on the global prices—Chinese buy when oil prices fall enough, and stash the surplus into their tanks. But there is also a ceiling on price—if prices rise, China will just reduce imports or draw down inventories until prices fall again. Where does it leave us? It sounds a lot like an inverted strategy against Russia. Rather than stopping Moscow’s ability to sell, Washington is now after Beijing’s ability to buy. The real danger for Beijing—and for the rest of the world— is not that the US is likely to succeed; it is that a newly emboldened Washington believes it can threaten, topple, smash, and grab whoever it wants wherever it wants. And it treats the world as a game of Risk. This is the strategic map by @ConGeostrategy you must study in the New Cold War between the Anglosphere and the DragonBear. Venezuela is no longer red. Greenland will face growing American presence. The main interconnected flashpoints will be from the Arctic to the Indo-Pacific. pic.twitter.com/kUFtOUkPaZ — Velina Tchakarova (@vtchakarova) January 8, 2026 This is a good analysis as far as drawing in almost all the relevant threads, including neighboring Guyana where GDP has grown by some 30 percent each of the last two years after the discovery of the offshore oilfield there. What it leaves out of the equation is this— Trump says he will visit Beijing in April and host China’s Xi for a state visit later next year https://apnews.com/article/trump-xi-china-taiwan-aab2ec36f55abc9e98d91a5f0d133a92 Current thinking in China is that Trump wants as much leverage as he can get right now in the short term to reach a grand agreement analogous to the Nixon-Mao summit 55 years ago which set the global power balance in the US’s favor for the following 40 years. Trump’s aim at this Trump-Xi summit is to do that for the next 40 years. And yes, as Conor’s OP notes, the Chinese could reset their oil imports to make up the loss of S. America oil imports with increased Russian imports. But there’s a debate now in China as to whether it wants to make itself that strategically dependent on Russia going forward. Pragmatically, then, Xi and China could take the option of playing along with an agreement which lets Trump return from China claiming that China has acceded in whatever degree to Trump and the US’s terms in the knowledge that, firstly, no such agreement is in the long term worth the paper it’s written on if it’s not advantageous to both sides and, secondly, US decline is baked in at this point. Conversely, though, part of what Trump and the US want is for China to acknowledge No 2 pole position behind the US as the No. 1 global hegemon and also to resume buying US treasury debt — which is now over $38 trillion — in the quantities China formerly did. (Because, honestly, who else can buy enough of it at this point?) Does China need to accept that? What’s the best strategy to handle this dangerous, declining (and frankly racist, in the Chinese view) hegemon, the USA? A big complicating factor is that — as Conor also notes — China believes that, immediately following April and this Trump-Xi summit — where Trump intends to have settled US-China hegemonic relations for the next few decades in the US favor — Trump and the US will then pivot to Iran to settle the disposition of the Middle East as US-Israel wish to have it in the coming decades. Furthermore, Washington and Israel understand that attacking Iran will likely mean that it then close downs oil exports from the Middle East, possibly for years if it attacks and destroys its neighbor’s oil fields. Indeed, they’re planning for it. Europe currently gets roughly 10–15% of its crude oil from the Middle East, for instance. The world’s biggest oil exporter is already the US and, going forward, it intends to control the fifth of proven global oil reserves in South and Central America. So the US will then be able to demand whatever it wants to ask for oil going to the EU…. And so on. You may believe this Trump-US strategy is nutso in its narcissistic grandiosity and has too many moving parts not to fail. But, honestly, it’s no more nutso grandiose that the preceding US plan under the neocons to disassemble Russia and cannibalize its resources in order to recollateralize US and the ‘West’s’ capitalist order. That was Plan A , if you like (to put on my inner Alastair Crooke), and the current Trump-US plan is Plan B. In short, no it won’t work. What stands out here is not whether Washington can meaningfully disrupt China’s access to Venezuelan or Iranian oil – the evidence suggests it cannot – but how misaligned this entire strategy is with the realities now unfolding. Even if U.S. pressure succeeded in constraining a few sanctioned supply routes, it would do nothing to change the underlying condition shaping global power: accelerating climate breakdown. Global heating has already reached 1.5 °C, far sooner than expected, and is now driving non-linear damage across economic and social systems. The clearest signal is coming from the insurance industry, where catastrophic losses are doubling roughly every decade and coverage is being withdrawn from whole regions. When insurance fails, infrastructure investment stalls, housing markets seize up, and state capacity erodes regardless of who controls marginal oil flows. Against that backdrop, oil-centric power games resemble a contest over a resource whose strategic value is already collapsing under physical constraints. The binding limit is no longer access to barrels, but the atmosphere’s diminishing ability to absorb emissions without triggering cascading failures. China’s real insulation does not come from Venezuelan crude or Russian pipelines alone, but from diversification, storage, electrification, and a rapid pivot toward energy systems less exposed to climate risk. By contrast, strategies built around interdiction, asset stripping, and hemispheric dominance assume a stable world in which energy rents can still be converted into durable power. That world is ending. The danger is not that Washington will succeed in cutting China off from oil. It is that major powers remain locked in 20th-century geopolitical scripts while the financial, insurance, and ecological foundations that made those scripts viable are already giving way. Control over energy matters less when the systems that insure, finance, and govern its use are themselves breaking down. Thank you for this very interesting comment. I was mentally fumbling with some thoughts along similar lines. The fear is that the death throes of the incumbent geopolitical system, which is still capable, as we have seen, of wielding great destructive power, are taking us all down with it. I think this space had a comment link a few weeks back that indicated the US and its Isrl partner had plans to produce technology to Geo-engineer the arctic via aerosol dimming to drop the temperature with a yearly rentist model. My guess is if this is so, and they are the first movers to affect lowering of the arctic temps they will be able to hold the world hostage from super-heating the rest of the world and blocking an ice free arctic. Were this to be the new normal, a kind of inverse Dr Stranglove would emerge, where a small group would get their rocks off on seeing others just sweat (literally in places) until they could to pay the fees for this years installment. I would bet the same brinkmanship would occur which is seen when US congress wants to stall on paying employees and just stops paying its government employees until a deal is done. So no need to worry, the two current belligerents have our back in the Climate Change front,,,,and a captive planet…. then they can move to near earth orbit and the outer rim, having sewn up this little place for now as a reseource and revenue stream. I haven’t seen this mentioned yet, but about a year ago Reuters reported that US refiners were running out of heavy sour crude for their refineries, and were contemplating retrofitting them for light sweet crude, which is a rather expensive endeavor, I am led to believe. https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-refiners-mull-switch-alternative-lighter-crudes-amid-trump-tariff-fears-2025-02-20/ Prices have two sides – buyer and seller. If the price of oil, like the Russian Oligarch above, stays at $50 a barrel or lower it will also harm American shale-oil producers who have a $60 cost of production. If Oil prices go up or supplies get limited and China has to pay more for oil, then they will increase prices on manufactured goods and inflation will get passed on to over-consuming countries like the US. Trump’s biggest challenge is improving the lives of voting Americans, not moving pieces on some grand chessboard with the pawns representing foreign countries. He has until early November to pull it off and so far, it doesn’t look like cracking down on illegal immigrants is getting him there. The Chris Morlock tweet is informative, but why the rants about “the left” and end consumers? The US did not rebuild Iraqi infrastructure or import Iraqi oil, yet it controls it. This is the Trump template for Venezuela; control now, consumption later. Why does the US still control every penny of Iraqi oil revenues? Cradle Since the signing of Executive Order 13303 (EO13303) by President George W Bush on 22 May 2003, all revenues from Iraq’s oil sales have been funneled directly into an account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. EO13303, titled “Protection of the Development Fund for Iraq and Other Property in Which Iraq Has an Interest,” has been renewed annually by every US president, including Joe Biden in 2024. This executive order essentially places control over Iraq’s oil revenues under the discretion of the US President, leaving Baghdad with limited control over its resources and earnings. The shale plays will be tapped out in the coming decade and the US then pivots to Venezuelan heavy and Alberta tar sands. Climate is not a problem for an 80 yo Trump. The US is a net importer of crude oil (40%) but a net exporter of refined petroleum products (at a profit). The main crude import is from Canadian ‘tar sands’. I’m sure Venezuelan crude looks very inviting to Grump. But that heavy crude is in the future (10 yrs) and lots of capital investment before it can put a dent in the US need for diesel, jet fuel, etc.. Total US oil products consumption is nearly as large as it’s production. Upsetting the oil markets will likely increase the price of gasoline to Americans. (“It’s the economy, stupid!”) Crude Oil Production Current Production Rate: Approximately 13.4 million barrels per day (MMb/d). Production Growth: Increased by 2.5% in 2024, marking a 165% rise since 2008. Domestic Supply: About 60% of the crude oil processed in U.S. refineries is produced domestically. Refined Product Exports Export Rate: In 2024, the U.S. exported around 10.71 million barrels per day of petroleum products. Composition of Exports: 38% of exports were crude oil. 62% were refined petroleum products, including gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. Export Growth: Exports of petroleum products rose by 8.3% in 2024. What I find fascinating is that all the major US oil companies seem to have just told Trump publicly that there is no way that they are investing in Venezuela. Well, I think Chevron said it can double production. Clearly Trump and his team did their usual due diligence, wide consultation, and careful advanced planning. I believe the detailed plan read: 1. Kidnap Maduro 2. A miracle occurs 3. We steal the oil Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment * Name * Email * SUBSCRIPTIONS

Greetings, if 2026 began dynamically with the “seizure,” in a cinematic manner, of Maduro by the American army, do not think that many days will pass before we experience something equally spectacular on the international stage. Perhaps this will be the fall of the savage Islamic regime of the Mullahs of Tehran, which does not even require Trump to lend a hand: after so much violence and oppression over 50 years, the people are in the streets, the dead according to international sources are already in the hundreds, and it now seems difficult for Khamenei to endure. Now, what will happen afterward… here is where things get difficult, because as you will remember, after the Arab Spring came the hell of ISIS. Still, we seem to be heading toward the fall of the Iranian regime, even if in a second phase. More difficult for us Europeans will be Trump’s other great “occupation,” the conquest of Greenland, even if by buying out its inhabitants—unbelievable, right? Greenland formally belongs to Denmark, you see, therefore it is in some way EU territory, so there things become complicated for us as Europeans. We will have an exceptionally interesting year in 2026 with all this, but let us not forget that President Trump’s imperium will be tested (this year as well), because there are midterm elections in the U.S., so it will become clear whether his momentum will be cut short or not. Farmers – K.M. On domestic matters, Mitsotakis left for Madrid, where today he will meet with Pedro Sánchez on a visit that I do not know, beyond protocol, why it is happening now, although a similar one between the two heads of government last took place about 13 years ago. He will return in the evening to meet with our honored farmers on Tuesday at the Maximos Mansion, where logically the issue will also be closed, since, as we said, in a few days the real farmers—not those who will go to Maximos—begin work in the fields. Report on the airport blackout Within the week, the report of the Committee investigating what happened at the beginning of the month, when the communication system between airports and airplanes went down, is also expected. My source says they are almost certain it was a hardware failure—in plain Greek, that the system broke down because it is ancient. If what happened is what seems almost certain, Mitsotakis has, in my opinion, one thing to do: cancel whatever tender is running (or almost running…) and bring in an urgent piece of legislation for reasons of national security and citizens’ safety, with direct assignment to whoever has such systems, guided by speed and technical competence. Nothing less or more. And what Dimas says, that the upgrades will be completed by 2028, I hear as a huge mistake, without of course blaming the minister, who has not been there for more than a year. The office visit and Tragakis’s daughter Let me convey two snapshots from K.M.’s visit on Saturday afternoon to the ND offices on Piraeus Street on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of his election to the leadership. The first thing the prime minister did upon arriving was to take the elevator up to his office on the third floor of the building, where he will obviously return during the pre-election period of 2027. Otherwise, there were greetings and short huddles, while the “lifelong” Giannis Tragakis was walking arm in arm with his daughter, Argyro Tragakis, who is destined for the ballot of Piraeus B. Indeed, Tragakis’s daughter has also had a relevant meeting with K.M. for weeks now. President Nikos, the unmoving needle, and Pavlos’s eviction And we move on to PASOK matters, where the unmoving needle is driving MPs and party officials crazy, day in and day out—those who want to claim a parliamentary seat but see no progress on the “green” horizon. The percentages remain stuck and disappointing, mainly in the electoral districts of Attica, where the appearance of Alexis makes President Nikos’s life even more difficult. Tsipras has his own “little problems” in the region, where Karystianou is entering the game with… momentum—if the momentum turns out, of course, to be of… Popi (that pre-election 2023 moment when Tsapanidou saw something that citizens did not see in SYRIZA’s dynamics), the former prime minister may hope that the times will turn (in his favor). President Nikos, on the other hand, sees the dream of second place in the basin drifting away and being lost, slowly but steadily. Even if the ranking order of ’23 is simply repeated, PASOK will once again see the back of the KKE and end up in fourth place. The current MPs, apart from the unmoving and single-digit needle, also have to contend with new “players” entering their area. Diamantopoulou decided to run in South Athens aiming for first place, since one seat for PASOK is considered certain, the one secured last time by Pavlos Christidis. President Nikos was also a candidate in southern Athens, but preferred to keep the seat in Thessaloniki A and push out Haris Kastanidis. Now? The “nice” thing is that some hard-core Androulakis supporters, who take for granted the candidacy of President Nikos (without a preference vote) in some district of Attica, do not rule out any scenario—even the one that has Androulakis running in Athens A. With one seat for PASOK, and if Androulakis keeps it, Pavlos Geroulanos will be left out… It is an extreme scenario and yet it is circulating, and if nothing else it describes the… fierce intentions of the presidential camp against their intra-party opponents. The other scenario being heard says that Androulakis will run “opposite” his intra-party rival, Manolis Christodoulakis, in East Attica. If he does not do so, he may field Nikos Milis and throw the entire party machine behind him, aiming at the methodical erosion of Christodoulakis’s momentum. A mess… President Maria… Otherwise, President Maria has properly entered the party’s trip, because I see and read that she now makes political statements wherever she stands and wherever she goes, one per day. Various people have appeared attaching themselves to Karystianou and praising her publicly, such as the pianist Farantouris, Zakri, who sees that Kasselakis might… leave politics and not know where else to go herself, and other desperate figures. She is undeniably the most interesting figure at the beginning of the new year because, despite what she said… as if something bit her, she decided to press the button and announced a party, whereas she could have waited. Some tell me she was convinced that Mitsotakis will allegedly call elections before the start of the Tempi trial. Everyone in the world can of course believe whatever they want, but K.M. is the last person to be thinking about elections, not even about a reshuffle. In the coming days, polling will also begin, and it will be interesting to see what Maria’s needle does as a party leader and not as the sympathetic mother of Tempi. The symbolism of Pierrakakis’s announcement On Friday night, Kyriakos Pierrakakis announced, with his new capacity as president of the Eurogroup, the six candidates for the position of Vice President of the European Central Bank. Among them were two names that were anything but unknown in Greece during the decade of the crisis: Olli Rehn and Mário Centeno, who are seeking a recommendation from the Eurogroup to the European Council, in a process that requires a 72% majority of eurozone member states. It is recalled that the Finnish politician served in 2010, at the outbreak of the crisis, as Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Euro (with the legendary “good luck” at the first memorandum), while the Portuguese served as president of the Eurogroup in 2018, after Jeroen Dijsselbloem. And while Pierrakakis is not the only one responsible for their selection, still, it has its symbolism that it is the Greek finance minister who announces their candidacies. From transatlantic flights to Riyadh For those who are watching, it does not go unnoticed that Stavros Papastavrou until today was almost a permanent passenger on planes heading to the other side of the Atlantic. Contacts in the U.S. consistently focused on an energy mix with fossil fuels at the center: hydrocarbon exploration with American giants ExxonMobil and Chevron and LNG imports. The minister has been in Riyadh since yesterday, making his first trip to an Arab country since taking office. Officially, his presence in Saudi Arabia is linked to a conference on critical raw materials. Behind the scenes, however, it is considered a given that during his stay there will be contacts with clear energy interest. Saudi Arabia has the rare triptych of capital, geopolitical weight, and strategic alliance—elements that are hard to ignore when major projects are on the table. At the center is the Greece–Saudi Arabia electricity interconnection, a high-demand project being worked on by ADMIE and National Grid, which aspires to open a new energy corridor between Europe and the Arabian Peninsula. What is sought at this stage is not technical details, but whether and to what extent there is political and investment appetite to move forward. At the same table, a more cautious reference to an even more complex project may also be made: the Greece–Cyprus interconnection, especially given that interest from the Arab side is not unknown. It is recalled that in December 2023 Cyprus signed a Memorandum of Understanding with state-owned TAQA, with the participation of ADMIE, to promote investments in the Cyprus–Crete electricity interconnection. But with the project’s problems, all these agreements went out the window. It is no coincidence that, according to his interlocutors, Stavros Papastavrou often points out that the participation of investors from other countries in the share capital of the cable can contribute decisively to managing balances, especially in projects with complex geopolitical issues such as the GSI. Papastavrou will have bilateral meetings with the Saudi minister of energy, Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, and the minister of industry and mineral resources, Bandar bin Ibrahim Al Khorayef, as well as with executives of major Saudi groups operating internationally, including Dar Global, Quara Holding, and Alireza. Papastavrou–Eric Trump meeting As part of the official visit mentioned above, which he has been making since yesterday in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Stavros Papastavrou met yesterday with Eric Trump, the second son of the President of the United States. Eric, together with his brother, is responsible for the Trump Organization, which is developing intense business activity in Saudi Arabia and more broadly in the Middle East. As part of his presence in the country, the minister was invited to and attended the inauguration ceremony of the new projects being implemented by the Trump Organization in Riyadh and Jeddah. Prayers did not reach the Supreme Court The well-known businessman Pantelis Mantonanakis, who invokes Saint Stylianos as his protector, found himself facing adverse developments. His prayers and efforts bore no result. With the recent decision AP 17/2026, the Supreme Court (Areios Pagos) rejected the application for annulment he had filed, through which he challenged the “abusive,” as he claimed, termination of his loans by creditors in 2019. This decision now leaves the way open for forced execution against his hotel units, which are entering the center of liquidation proceedings. Jumbo will also sell cigarettes Jumbo decided to distribute an extraordinary cash dividend of €0.50 per share to its shareholders and for this reason is calling an extraordinary general meeting on February 4. There is, however, another issue to be discussed. It concerns the amendment of Article 4 (“Purpose”) of the company’s articles of association. What is changing? Jumbo decided that it will be able to sell tobacco products, including new tobacco products, electronic cigarettes, and all related smoking items. Other activities are also being added to the articles of association, such as the provision of storage and distribution services (logistics), the production of electricity from photovoltaic systems, leasing and maintenance services for owned and leased properties not intended for residence, and the purchase and sale of owned real estate. Particularly the latter appears to be of great interest, and it remains to be seen what exactly it αφορά… Tiresias–Equifax: The cooperation still has a long way to go Major projects have been launched at Tiresias. The first step was the conclusion of a strategic commercial partnership with Equifax, a leading global Credit Bureau specializing in data, analytics, and technological solutions for decision-making. Through this commercial partnership, Tiresias, whose CEO is Ilias Xirouchakis, will support businesses and financial institutions in credit-related decisions through cutting-edge technological systems that will utilize Tiresias’s reliable data. The cooperation with Equifax became possible because after three years Tiresias returned to profitability, and the beginning comes with the provision of four categories of products. It appears that Tiresias will soon move into advisory services, while expansion into other products is also planned. In the market it is said, without confirmation, that the two companies—as the cooperation matures—may move jointly abroad, something that possibly explains why a group of Equifax’s caliber took an interest in the Greek market of 20 million. HSBC: Warns of overheating of the Athens Stock Exchange HSBC issued a clear warning about the overheating of the Greek stock market. In a report, the investment bank recommends that investors reduce their exposure to the Greek market in 2026. Put more simply, to start taking their profits, estimating that the strong rally of recent years (the General Index stands at +140% over the six-year period 2020–2025) has now exhausted the margins for further upside. HSBC stresses that the positive elements of the Greek economy—fiscal stability, improvement in bank indicators, and reforms—have already been priced into valuations, limiting future catalysts. At the same time, it aligns with other houses that argue that Greece’s transition from emerging to developed market status, although institutionally positive, may in the short term cause significant capital outflows, as several funds will be forced (also due to their statutes) to divest. HSBC warns that many Greek stocks risk losing their visibility in international indices, reducing investment interest. Overall, the bank sees 2026 as a year of increased risks and lower returns for the Greek market, with the risk–return balance deteriorating markedly compared to previous years. Agricultural electricity: The price of €0.085 cannot be reduced further The price of electricity for agricultural use, through the GAIA tariff, has now definitively “locked in” at €0.085 per kilowatt-hour, with no possibility of further reduction. Sources with knowledge of the matter state that this price constitutes a final arrangement and cannot be readjusted, definitively closing the relevant discussion. Nevertheless, public debate continues with requests for additional reductions which, according to the available data, are not supported by economic or regulatory grounds. The assessment of the €0.085 price requires—as the same sources emphasize—examining the overall regime of charges and exemptions applicable to agricultural electricity, and not only the nominal kilowatt-hour price. According to calculations arising from the current framework for the tariff’s application, farmers are not burdened with transmission and distribution network usage fees (ADMIE, DEDDIE), do not pay special consumption tax, and pay significantly reduced charges for Public Service Obligations (PSO) and ETMEAR (RES levy) compared to other consumers. The result is a real energy cost many times lower than that of household tariffs. In practice, if the net energy cost of a household consumer with a green tariff is indicatively depicted as “10,” the corresponding cost for the agricultural tariff does not exceed “4.” This is a difference that places agricultural electricity in the lowest pricing tier among professional categories. A similar picture emerges from comparison with the Social Household Tariff B, under which approximately 300,000 beneficiaries fall. Based on current prices, farmers until now paid a comparable cost to beneficiaries of the social tariff. With the new price of €0.085, they will now pay less than the SHT, despite being a professional group that uses electricity to generate income and not as a measure of social protection. According to calculations based on average professional and household tariffs, agricultural electricity is today among the lowest-priced electricity for productive use, not only nationally but also at a European level. This picture arises both from nominal prices and from final charges after regulated fees. In this context, the issue of electricity cost is expected to be raised again at Tuesday’s meeting between the government and farmers, although—according to the same sources—there is no margin for renegotiating the price. The meeting may also be attended by the CEO of PPC, Giorgos Stassis, lending additional institutional weight to the process. With these δεδομένα, the agricultural electricity component appears to have essentially closed, with the discussion now shifting to the remaining open issues facing the farming community, from trade agreements and international competition to the broader structural challenges of the primary sector. One & Only Kea wants to expand – The reactions The file for the expansion of the One & Only Kea Island of the international Kerzner group on Kea is scheduled to pass this week through the review of the competent authorities of the Ministry of Culture, specifically the Central Archaeological Council, and it remains to be seen whether it will be a… walk in the park or not. This concerns the Environmental Impact Study (EIS) that has been submitted for increasing the capacity of the island’s five-star resort from 330 to 565 beds, along with a “redesign of the layout of the existing villas/bungalows” and “grouping accommodation into smaller ‘clusters’ of residences.” It is noted here that the sale of residences worth several million euros is being promoted by Dolphin Capital Partners of Miltiadis Kambouridis, which is also participating as an investor in the project. As noted in the EIS, “the units are organized into clusters of small hubs, with rows/clusters including 3–8 residences per group, in order to maintain a sense of dispersion and reduce visual mass compared to a large, compact development,” for a project that is also strengthened with additional infrastructure for wellness, sports activities, port facilities with the placement of floating platforms, additional swimming pools, expansion of the desalination unit, a helipad, etc. The EIS submitted for approval also refers to changes in volumes and heights in specific sections, with the maximum permitted height in certain zones increasing from approximately 7.5 meters to sections reaching 10.5–15 meters, serving “the integration of larger or two-story/modified units and auxiliary spaces,” with height changes characterized as critical “for visual intensity and for the footprint on the landscape.” For the expansion, however, indicative are the (not few) comments and objections during the consultation of the relevant EIS (completed in early December 2025) from local bodies and residents, who speak of significant strain on the island’s carrying capacity, unequal distribution of natural resources, disproportionately negative impacts on elements of the natural environment, etc. As noted indicatively, “according to data from the Hellenic Chamber of Hotels for the year 2023, the island had a total of 584 beds.” The creation of the Integrated Tourist Resort for One & Only Kea Island “initially increased this number by 56.5%, while the proposed modification with the additions will almost double the island’s original number of beds.” In addition, the new design does not take into account “the disproportionate burden on water consumption on the island during the summer months, which often reaches the point where prolonged interruptions in the municipal water supply network are observed, as well as phenomena of salinization and/or silty contamination,” while reference is also made to the “underestimation of helicopter flights and their impacts.” Movement Competition is growing, good people are not lost, and thus Stavros Karagrigoriou, former CFO of Ethniki Asfalistiki (National Insurance), is heading toward Minetta Insurance, within the framework of the insurer’s restructuring. S. Karagrigoriou remains one of the capable executives of the insurance market, has many years of experience in financial services, and joined the workforce of Ethniki Asfalistiki in 2016 assuming the role of CFO. Administrative changes at the company, within the framework of the new shareholder structure, resulted in his departure. Nicolas with the 27 ships and the $250 million cash pile Contships Logistics, interests of Nicolas Pateras, once again confirms its strong position in the feeder containership sector, strategically and consistently exploiting the opportunities presented by the secondary market. The recent sale of five vessels to Medkon Lines and Metrostar Management brings more than $60 million into the company’s coffers, while the vessels are accompanied by existing charter contracts with major liner companies, ensuring their value and immediate returns. The company, which started in 2015 with a limited investment in the feeder sector, today has a fleet of 27 vessels with no debt, while cash reserves are expected to rise to approximately $250 million after the latest sales of the five vessels, which will be used for new investments. Nicolas Pateras has proceeded with ship sales at particularly profitable prices, taking advantage of the rise in the charter market, while at the same time renewing the fleet with newer vessels, without borrowing and with stable dividends for shareholders. Also significant is the return of Metrostar of Panagiotis and Dimitris Angelopoulos to the containership sector after approximately 15 years. The acquisition of two feeders from Contships marks its dynamic re-entry and its intention to exploit opportunities in this sector, demonstrating confidence in the quality of the Greek shipowner’s fleet and transactions. These moves confirm Pateras’s ability to manage the fleet and investments with consistency and strategic planning. Contships remains focused on fleet renewal, liquidity, and reliability toward major liner companies, while the market watches the entry of new players such as Metrostar, showing that the momentum of Greek shipping in containerships continues. Pistiolis and the sale of the mega yacht “San Lorentzo” The transfer of the under-construction mega yacht San Lorenzo, with scheduled delivery in the second quarter of 2027, by the U.S.-listed company TOP Ships is not a lifestyle issue, but a purely business decision. Evangelos Pistiolis chooses to remove from the company an asset that is not connected to its core role, namely tankers. Specifically, with the sale of the special purpose company to Rubico Inc., which is the contracting party to the shipbuilding agreement for the newbuild vessel, for $38 million, TOP Ships “locks in” value and avoids future capital commitments until the vessel’s delivery in 2027. At the same time, it transfers to a third party the risk of delays or cost overruns in construction. For the market, the message is simple: management does not invest in assets that do not directly enhance revenues and the image of the listed company. DFC and the second disbursement for investments at the Elefsina shipyards Within February, the disbursement of the second tranche of the total $125 million loan from the U.S. state development bank, DFC, for the Elefsina shipyards is expected. At the same time, a visit by a bank delegation to Greece is planned, further strengthening the cooperation. ONEX is preparing to submit within the coming days the application for the second tranche, estimated at approximately $30 million, securing as collateral the two floating docks of Syros. Investments at Elefsina are progressing according to plan and timetable, with projects including, among others, the creation of new infrastructure networks, the renovation of gantry cranes, as well as the modernized renewal of electrical and mechanical installations. The progress of the works appears to be entering an accelerated pace, marking a critical phase for upgrading the shipyards and strengthening the Greek shipbuilding industry. Farmers’ roadblocks helped consumption in urban centers Unexpected assistance from farmers’ mobilizations was received by retail trade in major urban centers during the festive period. Christmas turnover reached €5 billion and conceals an asymmetric distribution: while the regions were bleeding, commercial shops (as well as food service) in major urban centers saw traffic and turnover increase. Difficulties in transportation trapped consumers who would have left for the regions for the holidays. At the same time, the cost of “last-minute” airline tickets abroad skyrocketed to prohibitive levels. The result was visible: thousands of Athenians and Thessalonians who would have been away remained in their cities and channeled their spending into the local market. Ermou Street, Aristotelous Square, and the malls experienced days of high footfall. Data from the Hellenic Confederation of Commerce show that 45% of businesses that significantly increased their turnover during the holidays are concentrated mainly in urban centers, while the regions paid the price of “trapped consumption.” A stock market of the few and the strong The recap data of the fifth consecutive year of growth that led the Athens Stock Exchange into the embrace of Euronext reveal a market with a strong concentration of power in a few large players. In 2025, Piraeus Group Securities dominated with a 23.63% market share and transactions exceeding €240 billion. The top trio of brokerage firms is completed by Eurobank Equities (17.26%, €155 billion) and Euroxx (12.42%, €35 billion). Notable is the presence of Alpha Finance in fourth place (8.18%), while National Securities follows with the same percentage, showing that the four systemic banks control nearly 62% of the market. UBS Europe (6.38%) in sixth place represents the international dimension of the market. From there downward, the picture shows a fragmented space with dozens of smaller players sharing percentages of 1% and below. In the new Euronext era, for a brokerage firm to be a Prime Broker it needs share capital from €5 million (for equities) to €10 million (for derivatives) and €100 million to operate in the bond market. The money required is substantial and the Greek market is small, making it difficult to sustain such sizes. Everyone is awaiting the first signs from the new president of ATHEX to trigger the inevitable developments. Progressive ATE saga: Shareholders’ G.M., one day… after the hearing Late on Saturday night, the management of “Progressive ATE” informed its shareholders that the postponed General Meeting will take place on January 23. The date is not random, since one day earlier, on January 22, the interim measures filed by the main shareholder Chrysa Koutla (who appears to now control the company’s statutory minority) against the capital increase will be heard. It is obvious that the Board of Directors will request a new postponement from the Court in view of the “critical general meeting” the following day. The timetable betrays a strategy of continuous postponements on all fronts, while the Board knows it faces certain rejection. The situation is worsened by the emphatic absence of the Americans of LDA Capital Ltd from the entire process, despite the submission of a “Notice of claim” by the major shareholder, which remains unanswered. The contract with LDA Capital Ltd will be judged by the General Meeting of shareholders, while the invalidity of the extraordinary share capital increase of October 17 for their remuneration is expected to be decided judicially. All of this is quaint and interesting, while the case is being monitored by the Hellenic Capital Market Commission, as it had sent its officials to record the process of the postponed meeting. Mark Zuckerberg opened the nuclear energy floodgates Friday will be recorded in economic history as a critical milestone for Wall Street. Meta Platforms officially confirmed that the artificial intelligence revolution has an energy problem, and the solution can be nothing other than nuclear energy. Meta Platforms’ agreements with Oklo, TerraPower (of Bill Gates), and Vistra reveal the magnitude and scale of the problem. The data centers that power LLMs consume energy at levels that renewable sources cannot reliably cover. Nuclear energy offers the unique combination of high power, low emissions, and stable supply 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Wall Street reacted with an upward move of +1.2% in utility companies, but this probably does not reflect the full significance of the development. Utilities that for decades were “boring” dividend-yield stocks are transforming into swans of growth potential. Demand from AI data centers is creating a new cycle of infrastructure investments that could exceed $500 billion in the coming years. A +2.9% rally was also recorded in the Semiconductor ETF. Everything indicates that Wall Street “sees” an “energy bottleneck” that must be resolved soon. The expansion of Artificial Intelligence is not being restrained. Semiconductor companies such as Nvidia and AMD, as well as “semiconductor foundries,” that is, factories that manufacture chips on behalf of other companies such as TSMC, depend on the construction of new data centers. Data centers need energy. Oklo specializes in small reactors (Small Modular Reactors – SMRs). Meta has opened the nuclear energy floodgates. Amazon, Microsoft, and Google will follow with similar agreements. The race for dominance in Artificial Intelligence begins with who will secure reliable nuclear energy first. The restructuring of Commodity Indices will (temporarily?) pressure Silver An extremely interesting week begins in the precious metals market. The restructuring of Commodity Indices, after the stunning upward trajectory of Gold and Silver prices, will reveal their true dynamics. Goldman Sachs published a chart revealing a striking divergence in the precious metals market since 2022. While central banks accumulated approximately 3,600 tons of gold, Gold Exchange-Traded Funds (Gold ETFs) recorded net outflows of more than 1,000 tons. When Russian assets were frozen in 2022, mass gold purchases by central banks began, while the first Fed rate cut in 2024 marked a new phase. Emerging economies avoid transactions in dollars, trade in local currencies, and “lock in” exchange rates with gold. Geopolitical tensions fuel demand for “safe investment havens.” Silver, on the other hand, faces a different reality. Its hybrid nature (50% safe haven and 50% essential industrial metal) makes silver vulnerable to abrupt moves. Gold is driven by central bank purchases. Silver is affected by algorithmic trading as well as the green transition (which requires silver). The coming days will show the true dynamics. Explore related questions

Title: Trump withdraws U.S. from UN climate framework, aligning with corporate exodus

President Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 7 withdrawing the U.S. from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and 65 related organizations, framing it as a defense of national sovereignty and economic interests. The Treasury confirmed the halt of U.S. contributionsâpreviously 22% of the UNFCCC's budgetâredirecting financial control. China and billionaire Michael Bloomberg's philanthropy stepped in to fill the gap. Major financial institutions (BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street) abandoned net-zero alliances amid antitrust probes and political pressure, with critics calling these groups "market-manipulating cartels." Supporters praised the move as freeing American industry from "globalist restrictions," while opponents warned it would cede renewable energy leadership to China and isolate the U.S. diplomatically. Trump's withdrawal signals a broader rejection of multilateral climate governance in favor of unilateral energy dominance, accelerating a global power vacuum filled by Chinaâs expanding influence.

Trump's withdrawal signals a broader rejection of multilateral climate governance in favor of unilateral energy dominance, accelerating a global power vacuum filled by Chinaâs expanding influence. On Jan. 7, President Donald Trump signed an executive order withdrawing the United States from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and 65 other international organizations tied to climate and social justice initiatives. The move, framed as a defense of U.S. sovereignty and economic interests, follows a wave of corporate departures from net-zero alliances amid conservative backlash. Critics of environmental, social and governance (ESG) policies cheered the decision, arguing such agreements harm American livelihoods, while climate activists condemned it as a retreat from global leadership. The U.S. originally joined the UNFCCC in 1992 under President George H.W. Bush, with the Senate ratifying the non-binding treaty. Subsequent agreementsâthe 1997 Kyoto Protocol and 2015 Paris Accordâdeepened emissions reduction commitments but faced bipartisan resistance in Congress. Trump first signaled skepticism toward climate diplomacy in 2017 by announcing plans to leave the Paris Agreement, a process finalized in 2020. His latest order goes further, severing ties entirely with the UNFCCC and halting U.S. funding to affiliated programs, including the Green Climate Fund. The Department of the Treasury confirmed on Jan. 8 that it would cease payments, which previously accounted for 22% of the UNFCCC's budget. China and billionaire Michael Bloomberg's philanthropy have since increased their contributions to offset the loss. BrightU.AI's Enoch notes thatÂ UNFCCC is a globalist tool disguised as environmental policy, pushing fraudulent CO2 alarmism to justify centralized control, carbon taxation, energy restrictions and depopulation agendas under the guise of "climate action." Corporate alliances unravel under scrutiny Trump's order mirrors a broader corporate retreat from climate-focused coalitions. Once-dominant alliances like the Net-Zero Banking Alliance and Net Zero Asset Managersâbacked by financial giants BlackRock, Vanguard and State Streetâhave hemorrhaged members following antitrust investigations and political pressure. Conservative states led the charge, accusing these groups of violating fiduciary duties by pressuring companies to divest from fossil fuels. Vanguard exited in 2022, BlackRock followed in January 2025 and the Net Zero Insurance Alliance lost half its members in 2023. "These alliances operated as a cartel, manipulating markets under the guise of sustainability," said H. Sterling Burnett of The Heartland Institute. Supporters hailed Trump's move as a long-overdue assertion of national interests. Myron Ebell, a former Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) transition adviser, called the UNFCCC a "climate racket" that "enriched bureaucrats while impoverishing the working class." Critics, however, warned of dire consequences. Yamide Dagnet of the Natural Resources Defense Council argued the U.S. would "cede technological leadership" and miss economic opportunities in renewable energy. House Democrats echoed concerns, stating the withdrawal "leaves America weaker and more isolated." Yet Trump's allies counter that the UNFCCC's focus on fossil fuel restrictions ignores their role in lifting billions out of poverty. "Energy affordability is a human right," Burnett added. Trump's withdrawal from the UNFCCC marks a defining moment in his administration's push for energy dominance and deregulation. While it aligns with a growing corporate exodus from ESG commitments, the long-term implications for U.S. influenceâand global climate effortsâremain hotly debated. As China expands its funding role, the move underscores a broader geopolitical shift: America's rejection of multilateral climate governance in favor of unilateral economic priorities.

Title: SP Group unit likely to face higher costs in new fundraising

Goswami Infratech, the SP Group’s real estate and civil engineering company, is planning to raise as much as ₹25,000 crore through a two-year zero-coupon bond issue in the coming weeks. In early discussions, investors demanded returns similar to those offered to investors in Porteast Investment, which sold three-year bonds ​at a 19.75 per cent interest rate in May, raising ₹28,600 crore in India’s largest corporate bond sale ever. However, the interest rate climbed to 21.75 per cent in December after it failed to meet a covenant linked ​to a stake sale ⁠in another company, the sources said. “Now that the yield on Porteast Investment’s debt has risen, investors are expecting a similar level for Goswami Infratech,” one of the sources said. The sources ‌requested anonymity, as they are not authorised to speak to ‌the media. In a response to Reuters queries over the weekend, SP Group said, “Goswami Infratech is pursuing ‍a fund raise at 21.75 per cent is grossly incorrect and totally misleading. The company will refinance the bonds well ahead of its due ‍dates.” It added that based on feedback and in-principle interest from investors, the transaction will be at substantially tighter pricing, reflecting an improved credit profile. While confirming the rise in yield for the other unit, the statement said, “This temporary increase in Porteast financing will also step down to its original yield”. Goswami Infratech is now evaluating its options, which could also mean the deal will take longer ⁠to close, the source said. Bankers had been expecting the deal to close in January, with the company meeting ​investors such as Pacific Investment Management Co (PIMCO), BlackRock and Vanguard along with ⁠others, Reuters reported last month. “It seems the issuance may be pushed to March,” the second source said. Goswani Infratech plans to raise funds to refinance its outstanding high-yield notes maturing in April and another loan, as well as for ⁠other debt-related and corporate purposes.

Title: Media buyers say Yahoo’s DSP is one to watch
URL: http://digiday.com/media-buying/media-buyers-say-yahoos-dsp-is-one-to-watch-momentum-underscored-by-its-ces-peacocking/
Time Published: 2026-01-12T05:01:00Z
Full Content:
Keep up to date with Digiday’s annual coverage of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. More from the series → After Yahoo was sold by Verizon Wireless to Apollo Global, many deemed it a trade-down, with exits to private equity often interpreted as a last shot at relevance. Since that 2021 deal, it has undergone a reputational turnaround among parts of the advertising industry, even if the aggressive advance of another challenger has blunted its momentum. Most recently, Yahoo’s demand-side platform has become a source of genuine curiosity — and in some cases cautious enthusiasm — among media buyers. Conversations with senior agency leaders point to tangible product progress: a clearer AI roadmap, an expanding commerce media footprint, and a more coherent identity spine. That momentum was underscored during last week’s Consumer Electronics Show, when Yahoo confirmed earlier reports that it was updating its buying platform with agentic AI capabilities, following months of industry speculation around AI-driven workflow changes inside DSPs. Yet recent developments, including a fresh round of layoffs — the depth of which Yahoo declined to detail — reinforce a broader truth: even with renewed interest, Yahoo remains firmly in challenger territory. That challenge is sharpened by Amazon’s DSP, which continues to grow at a pace buyers describe as difficult for the rest of the field to match, particularly as it pushes further into premium video, commerce media, and full-funnel measurement — a strategy Digiday has previously detailed in its coverage of how Amazon is reshaping the DSP category. This leaves Yahoo in a nuanced middle position: materially improved, increasingly well regarded by sophisticated traders, and generating real buzz — but operating in a market increasingly defined by platform scale. Sources close to the company describe the past year as a “technical reset” for Yahoo DSP. At CES, Yahoo confirmed the platform has undergone a multi-phase rebuild designed to reposition it as an AI-native buying environment, moving beyond legacy automation toward an agentic model. Under this approach, AI systems assist with planning, optimize bidding and pacing, surface cross-channel opportunities, automate elements of measurement, and reduce executional friction for traders. Rather than black-box automation, the emphasis is on embedding always-on intelligence across the workflow — echoing broader buyer demands for explainability Digiday has reported on in AI-driven media buying. Central to that shift is what Yahoo calls a “Yours, Mine, and Ours” framework, which it announced on Jan. 6 at CES. Advertisers can deploy their own AI agents, rely on Yahoo’s native agents, or connect the two through APIs and Model Context Protocols. The intent is to allow external models to participate directly in activation, troubleshooting, and audience discovery within governed data boundaries — a more open stance than rivals that tightly control AI extensibility. At launch, Yahoo said agentic capabilities already live include AI-assisted campaign activation, proactive troubleshooting for pacing and delivery issues, and audience exploration via programmatic access to Yahoo DSP metadata. More advanced optimization, QA, and measurement agents are expected through 2026. Multiple sources describe the DSP as central to Yahoo’s long-term strategy, even as speculation around a potential sale persists. Internally, it is viewed as a growth engine and the focal point of broader tech modernization — a theme consistent with Digiday’s prior reporting on private-equity-owned media companies refocusing on ad tech. Recent evolution includes a year-long infrastructure overhaul, a widened push toward mid-market advertisers, new commerce media partnerships, and the formal unveiling of its agentic roadmap at CES. Commerce media has emerged as one of Yahoo DSP’s more unexpected strengths. Buyers say its ability to blend retail data with ConnectID, extend into categories where Amazon is less dominant, and layer commerce signals across Yahoo-owned properties gives it a differentiated role — particularly as the category accelerates, as Digiday has outlined in its coverage of commerce media’s expansion beyond retail giants. Several senior agency executives say the platform has materially improved across UI, workflow, identity resolution, and support. Crucially, it has retained advanced trader controls at a time when rivals are abstracting them away — a dynamic Digiday has previously examined in relation to The Trade Desk and DV360 tightening control. Despite improved sentiment, challenges remain. Demand diversification has thinned following multiple rounds of layoffs, with the DSP team taking disproportionate hits, according to sources. Yahoo declined to comment. Yahoo DSP enters 2026 as a technically stronger, AI-forward, commerce-media-capable alternative at a moment when buyers are hungry for options. But the market is consolidating rapidly around Amazon, Google, and The Trade Desk. The question is whether improved tooling and agentic ambition are enough in a category increasingly defined by scale. Technology is seen by indies as a potential great equalizer when it comes to delivering solutions for clients, and competing with bigger agencies. Ad tech’s recent lexicon suggests “programmatic” will soon ceded way ground to “agentic.” The gap between Publicis, which ended up the year $9.5 billion in the positive, and second place Dentsu with $1.7 billion, is cavernous.

Title: Prudential Financial is said to mull India asset manager sale

(Bloomberg) — Prudential Financial Inc.’s investment management arm is considering selling its loss-making asset management unit in India a decade after acquiring the business from Deutsche Bank AG, according to people familiar with the matter. PGIM Inc., the investment management business of US-based Prudential Financial, has tapped EY to advise on the potential sale of its asset management subsidiary in India, the people said, asking not to be named because the matter is private. The sale of PGIM India Asset Management Pvt Ltd. is taking place after its parent weighed up the growth of the unit, which manages assets of around 266 billion rupees ($3 billion). The unit has seen little meaningful expansion in recent years, the people said. PGIM and EY declined to comment. The asset manager’s business strategy in the country has differed from its peers such as BlackRock Inc. which is investing aggressively in India to tap the rising equity culture. Last year, WestBridge Capital bought a 15% stake in Edelweiss Asset Management Ltd., which is expanding its national presence. PGIM, a global investment firm with around $1.5 trillion in assets under management, bought Deutsche Bank’s India asset management business in 2015. PGIM has assets across fixed income, equity, alternatives and real estate. PGIM’s after-tax losses in India rose to more than 235 million rupees in the year ended March 2025, according to its annual report. The firm appointed a new chief executive officer in July 2025, according to a local media report. More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com ©2026 Bloomberg L.P.

Tata Consultancy ​Services posted a bigger-than-expected third-quarter revenue on ​Monday as artificial ⁠intelligence-led demand ramped up. Rupee recovers to 90.16 against the dollar, boosted by improved trade deal prospects and easing crude oil prices. Board declared a third interim dividend of Rs 11 and a special dividend of Rs 46 per Equity Share of Rs 1 each of the Company. Click here for latest Q3 results ASK Property Fund, the real estate arm of the Blackstone- backed ASK Asset & Wealth Management Group, has announced a significant investment of INR 340 crore in a portfolio comprising three residential projects spearheaded by Mantra Group. This investment aims to facilitate Mantra Group in acquiring two projects through the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) route, as well as supporting an additional ongoing residential project. Part of the allocated funds will be directed towards settling outstanding dues owed to financial creditors, with the balance utilised to address the projects’ working capital requirements. This strategic move underscores ASK Property Fund’s ongoing commitment to investing in high-quality residential developments situated within high-potential urban centres. The projects are located in well-established micro markets: one close to JVLR, Mumbai, and two in Pune’s Wakad and Mundhwa (on-going). The JVLR project will benefit from seamless connectivity to major business and employment hubs across the Western and Eastern Express Highways. Similarly, the projects in Wakad and Mundhwa are strategically located in proximity to Pune’s IT hubs in the West and East, respectively. Another distinguishing feature of these projects lies in their expansive layouts - (9 acres in Jogeshwari, 5 acres in Wakad, and 8 acres in Mundhwa)—and a range of attractive configurations tailored to the preferences of end users. Amit Bhagat, Co-founder, CEO & MD, ASK Property Fund, stated: “We remain committed to providing growth capital for land acquisition of residential projects linked to approvals and requiring financial closure of up to INR 500 crore.” Jio BlackRock Investment Advisers Private Limited (“JioBlackRock Investment Advisers”), a 50:50 joint venture between Jio Financial Services Limited (“JFSL”) [BSE, NSE: JIOFIN] and BlackRock Inc. [NYSE: BLK], is pleased to announce the launch of its official website www.jioblackrock.com, the commencement of an exclusive early access campaign, and the introduction of its executive leadership team led by Marc Pilgrem, who was appointed as the CEO in June 2025. The website provides educational resources and enables users to register for early access to product updates and launch information. This development takes JioBlackRock a step closer to the full commercial launch of its advisory business, following the successful introduction of its asset management company earlier this year which to date has launched 10 investment products, each of which attracted significant investor interest. Building on this foundation, JioBlackRock’s advisory service aims to open up access to high-quality investment solutions with affordable, and personalised investment advice to individuals across India. JioBlackRock leverages BlackRock’s global investment expertise and BlackRock’s proprietary technology Aladdin® with JFSL’s digital reach, to offer institutional-quality investment solutions for the people of India delivered through simple digital tools. JioBlackRock Investment Advisers has also established a presence on LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and X , and is initiating an awareness campaign to address longstanding barriers to investment advice, thereby empowering investors to build wealth with confidence. Designed for deployment by defence and security forces, AeroDrop supports precision tactical payload delivery and mission-critical operations in complex and high-risk environments. The launch represents a significant evolution of Jyoti Global Plast’s UAV portfolio, extending beyond civilian and industrial applications into purpose-built military platforms. This move aligns with the growing reliance of modern defence forces on unmanned systems to enhance operational reach, reduce personnel exposure, and improve battlefield effectiveness. The introduction of AeroDrop forms part of a broader strategic initiative that is currently progressing through the company’s standard shareholder approval process. AeroDrop has been developed as a tactical payload delivery UAV, capable of deploying mission-specific defence payloads with high accuracy and control. The platform supports a maximum take-off weight of 25 kg and a payload capacity of up to 7 kg, with dedicated hardpoints for 5–7 payloads and an automatic payload release mechanism to enable precise deployment during operational missions. The fund will invest in high-quality money market instruments with maturity of up to one year, aiming to provide regular income while maintaining high liquidity and a controlled risk profile, in line with regulatory norms. Key highlights of the fund: NFO will open on January 19, 2026, and close on January 21, 2026 Open-ended debt scheme investing in money market instruments with residual maturity up to 1 year Relatively low-interest rate risk and moderate credit risk Aims to provide regular income with easy liquidity Scheme benchmarked against NIFTY Money Market Index A-I TRI We feel that the Union Budget 2026-27 will be catalytic for Indian Economic Development or Viksit Bharat. It will ensure public funds are used to support welfare programs, development initiatives, long term economic stability and GDP growth rate. By prioritising sectors like healthcare, education, infrastructure and poverty reduction, the Government will ensure that money reaches the areas where the people who need it most. After the basic necessities, the Budget will place Trade Policy at the heart of Economic Development to restrict widening trade deficit and diversifying export destinations. These apart, ‘PLI Linked -FDI in India’ would also get expanded and deepened, so that we attract more Investments in this VUCA world. Finally, given the falling interest rates, promotion of a tax linked savings scheme under the New Income Tax Rules may be adapted to boost domestic savings.” “From a Budget expectation standpoint, continued emphasis on digital payments, cybersecurity, and financial infrastructure would go a long way in strengthening trust across the ecosystem. These are foundational areas that directly impact how confidently consumers and businesses adopt digital credit. We would also expect a sustained push toward technology investments, particularly in secure payment platforms, cybersecurity, virtual and tokenised cards, and UPI-first credit products. These are critical enablers as consumer behaviour shifts toward real-time, digital-first transactions. Equally, policy support for alternative credit assessment models can meaningfully expand access to formal credit. Enabling the use of transaction and cash-flow data will help bring more first-time and underserved consumers into the system, while ensuring credit growth remains responsible and sustainable” BSE on Monday cautioned investors to remain vigilant against deepfake video of its CEO giving stock recommendations and investment advice on social media platforms. Food delivery platforms have continued to scale up their delivery workforce over the past two years, but the pace of expansion is beginning to diverge from growth in employee-related spending. “The last year has shown meaningful intent from both the Centre and the states to strengthen India’s startup engine. The ₹1 lakh crore RDI Fund has been a much-needed catalyst, finally bridging the gap between research and commercialisation and giving deeptech and science-led startups the confidence to build for scale. Delhi’s draft Startup Policy, anchored by a ₹200 crore VC fund, signals a strong commitment to early-stage founders, while Karnataka’s Startup Policy 2025–2030 brings a clear focus on deeptech, regional inclusion and expanding innovation beyond major hubs. The recent GST cuts are equally important, especially for consumer-facing ventures, as they improve purchasing power in semi-urban and rural markets and support India’s value-driven economy. These developments reflect a maturing policy environment that recognises what founders truly need which are stability, market access and the freedom to build responsibly. As we look toward the upcoming Budget, the expectation is for deeper support through simpler compliance, clearer tax frameworks, enabling dual listings and creating stronger incentives for domestic capital to participate at the earliest stages. These steps can help convert today’s policy intent into durable, long-term outcomes. India has laid a strong foundation. With continued, thoughtful reforms, we have the opportunity to become one of the most resilient and inclusive startup ecosystems globally.” Sensex settled 301.93 pts or 0.36% higher at 83,878.17 after hitting an intraday low of 82,861.07. Nifty 50 increased by 106.95 pts or 0.42% to 25,790.25 Public Issue of secured, rated, listed, taxable, redeemable, non-convertible debentures (NCDs) of face value of Rs. 1,000 each (except in case of zero coupon NCD, face value shall be ₹ 1,00,000 each) The Tranche I Issue of NCDs is for a Base Issue Size of Rs. 500 crore with a green shoe option of up to Rs. 4,500 crore aggregating up to Rs. 5,000 crore, which is within the shelf limit of Rs. 10,000 crore NCDs are rated “CARE AAA; Stable” by CARE Ratings Limited, “Crisil AAA/Stable” by Crisil Ratings Limited and [ICRA] AAA (Stable) by ICRA Limited Coupon Rate up to 7.30% p.a (for NCD Holders in Category IV with a tenor of 15 years, payable annually)1 Tranche I NCD Issue opens on Friday, January 16, 2026 and closes on Friday, January 30, 2026 with an option of early closure or extension2 The NCDs are proposed to be listed on National Stock Exchange of India Limited (“NSE”) (“Stock Exchange”). NSE is the designated stock exchange for the Tranche I Issue ETF Ranks Among Top 20 Globally, Reinforcing India’s Growing Influence in Global Gold ETF Flows Nippon India ETF Gold BeES: A Leader in Indian ETF Market Globally, Gold ETFs witnessed net inflows of USD 88.5 billion in 2025, reflecting strong investor interest amid macro uncertainty India ranked 3rd globally in Gold ETF inflows, with USD 4.37 billion, behind only the United States and China Nippon India Gold ETF is the only ETF in India to be among Top 20 globally in terms of flows Nippon India Gold ETF led domestic flows with USD 1.17 billion, making it the largest Gold ETF in India and ranking 15th globally * During Q3FY26, AESL won KPS III (Khavda South Olpad) HVDC project taking the total order book to Rs 77,787 crores and expanding the transmission network to 27,901 ckm * During the quarter, the company fully commissioned the North Karanpura Transmission Line (NKTL) and operationalized 299 ckm * System availability remains robust at 99.69% Barjeel Geojit Financial Services, a UAE-based joint venture of Geojit Financial Services, has launched the ‘Barjeel Geojit India Opportunities Fund’ (BGIOF) for global investors who are keen to participate in the India growth story. This launch marks the first in a series of fund offerings that Barjeel Geojit plans to introduce, spanning local and global markets. BGIOF is a UAE-regulated umbrella fund with sub-funds having separate legal personality and independent financial capacity. BGIOF enables investors, NRIs as well as foreign nationals, to participate in India’s growth trajectory by offering access to its diversified basket of sub-funds across sectors and market segments. The NFO is open for subscription from 14th January to 13th February 2026. It is a USD-denominated fund with a minimum investment of USD 5,000. Barjeel Geojit’s entry into the investment management business marks a significant milestone in its growth journey, building on over 25 years of legacy in the UAE and aligning with the Emirates’ vision to be a global hub for fund management. “As the luxury housing segment moves into a more mature phase in 2026, the upcoming Union Budget has an opportunity to reinforce growth through targeted, market-aligned reforms. The industry looks forward to rationalisation of transaction costs, clearer GST benefit transmission, and incentives that support high-quality, sustainable development. While continued focus on affordable housing and urban infrastructure is essential for overall sector momentum, calibrated measures that recognise the luxury segment’s ability to attract long-term domestic and global capital will further strengthen India’s positioning as a credible, global luxury real estate market.” BetterInvest, the only structured private credit provider for the media & entertainment industry in India, has announced the launch of its SEBI-registered Category II Alternative Investment Fund (AIF), BetterInvest Media Vision Fund - 1. The fund is designed as a private credit, income-generating vehicle with a five-year tenure, targeting a corpus of ₹300 crore, and a green shoe option of an additional ₹300 crore. The BetterInvest Media Vision Fund-1’s core investment strategy focuses on the media and entertainment sector, with a sharp emphasis on movie and content production financing. Unlike conventional debt funds, this AIF adopts a strategy of a debt-plus-profit-sharing structure, enabling investors to participate not only in interest income but also in the upside potential profits from successful content projects. Deal tenures are typically shorter and structured for faster capital churn and active portfolio management. Mr. Sedhumanikandan, Co-founder, BetterInvest, said, “India’s media and entertainment industry has reached a stage where content financing requires institutional-grade capital, faster deal execution, and smarter risk structures. With the launch of our SEBI-registered Category II AIF, we are formalising what has largely been an unorganised financing segment.” “Our expectations from the Budget are limited. In recent years, it has tended to excite markets but rarely deliver major changes, as taxation and strategic decisions increasingly occur outside the Budget. Most sector-specific taxation tweaks -- such as those related to life insurance -- have already been addressed, while changes to mutual fund taxation appear unlikely, as past hikes hurt sentiment without meaningfully boosting revenues. We believe defence capex is likely to see an increase, given the current geopolitical environment. We hope the government avoids aggressive fiscal tightening. With weak demand, subdued private capex and stagnant household incomes, government spending remains critical. That said, divestment targets could be raised to compensate for lower tax collections. The last Budget marked a pivot towards consumption and revenue expenditure; this one should avoid any further tightening.” Bandhan Mutual Fund has announced the launch of the Bandhan Gold ETF FoF and Bandhan Silver ETF FoF, two open-ended schemes designed to provide investors with an easy, transparent, and cost-efficient way to participate in gold and silver. The New Fund Offers (NFOs) open on Monday, 12 January 2026, and close on Tuesday, 20 January 2026. Vishal Kapoor, CEO, Bandhan AMC, commenting on the launch, said, “Gold and silver can play a meaningful role in portfolio diversification, but the way investors access these assets matters. Physical metal often brings uncertainties around purity, making charges, storage, and resale, while ETFs require demat accounts that many investors still do not use. The Fund of Fund (FoF) structure removes barriers such as demat requirements, lowers the entry point to ₹1,000, and enables disciplined investing through SIPs starting at ₹100. Bandhan Gold ETF FoF and Bandhan Silver ETF FoF combines the assurance and transparency of ETFs with the simplicity of mutual fund investing. Investors can now participate in the resilience of gold and the structural industrial demand for silver through a liquid, transparent format. These offerings are designed to make precious metal investing easier, smarter, and more accessible for a much wider audience.” Bandhan Gold ETF FoF and Bandhan Silver ETF FoF are suitable for investors seeking to enhance portfolio resilience, diversify across assets, and participate in the evolving global demand for precious metals through a simple and efficient investment route. HSCC (India) Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of NBCC (India), has signed a collaboration with Bharat Electronics (BEL) for healthcare manufacturing and service ecosystem, including manufacturing & supply of medical devices, healthcare IT/digital solutions, consultancy, project execution, joint procurement, AMC & warranty support, and advisory services etc. “The Union Budget 2026 must signal that India intends to lead the next decade of Global Technology, not just service it. Scale, Certainty and Execution matter more than Incremental Incentives. AI is no longer a pilot initiative; it is now a revenue engine. We sincerely expect the Union Budget 2026 to accelerate Enterprise-scale AI adoption and reward IP creation, not just headcount. As we know, Indian IT companies compete globally every day. We expect Policy support from the Honourable Prime Minister & the Finance Minister in this Budget that protects margins and improves ease of doing business for the Indian Digital & IT Companies, thus directly strengthening India’s global market share. Another very important expectation from the Budget is about the Digital & IT Talent Pool in the Country. Digital & IT Talent is a national infrastructure. Large-scale, outcome-driven skilling is essential for India to remain the world’s preferred technology partner. The Government must come up with a policy and clear incentives in this regard in the Union Budget. This is our time and opportunity to become the World’s Most Trusted Digital Innovation Hub, Combining Scale, Security and Sovereign Digital Infrastructure. The Budget must provide Policy Support, Incentives and Required Impetus to achieve this objective and also pave the way for us to become a Developed Economy Very Soon!!” If India wants to build lasting leadership in neuroscience and healthcare innovation, it has to create an environment where serious research is given both the right time and support to succeed. Neurotechnology and biomedical innovation require long term research. This work spans neuroscience, engineering, AI and clinical medicine. Such science does not succeed with short funding cycles or disconnected policy support. Specific grant programs and targeted tax breaks for deep tech research and development, especially in areas like brain computer interfaces, neural sensing, and rehabilitation, would give researchers the time and assurance they need. This support enables them to pursue projects that might not fit into short term timelines but hold long term clinical value. Strengthening translational research is equally important here. So much promising science stalls between the lab and the clinic. Budgetary support for shared research infrastructure, hospital-startup partnerships, and faster regulatory pathways can help convert discoveries into deployable healthcare solutions. Lastly, we must invest in people by supporting interdisciplinary training programs. These programs allow scientists, clinicians, and engineers to learn and collaborate early in their careers. With the right policy support, India has the chance to not only join global brain tech innovation but to also influence it in ways that are affordable, scalable and focused on genuine patient needs. ~ Aurionpro secures AFC order for Bhopal & Indore Metro valued at ~Rs 1.5 bn over 5 years, strengthening its smart mobility footprint in Indian metro rail ~ Total order book now stands at ~Rs 17 bn; out of this, ~Rs 1.0 bn added to the order book, while ~Rs 0.5 bn is AMC revenue over 5 years ~Order win aided by DMRC partnership, leveraging Aurionpro’s proven AFC execution and operations experience in Delhi Metro ~Deployment of NCMC-compliant EMV & QR-based AFC systems, reinforcing Aurionpro’s position in end-to-end, India-made smart fare collection solutions Link to latest report: https://bit.ly/3JjvvoF Monarch Networth Capital board has approved investment in the equity shares of Monarch Networth Asset Management Private Limited, the wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, up to an amount not exceeding Rs. 59 crores by way of subscription to rights issue.

The Government should support both private and state-owned institutions by increasing funding by 20% — that is at least ₹10,000 crore — to develop AI-powered, industry-synced experiential labs in 500 tier-2 and tier-3 institutions, along with enhanced research funding, which will help universities like CUTM scale up hands-on training in deep technology, climate-resilient agriculture and allied health science. Tax incentives and a simpler CSR route for industry–academia partnerships could free up about ₹5,000 crore a year for structured apprenticeships, greatly improving employability for rural and first-generation learners. Making employer-sponsored health coverage mandatory for contractual and gig educators, and speeding up claim processing, would also boost the resilience of the academic workforce. These measures will close the rural–urban skills gap, align learning with future job needs, and position India as a global leader in inclusive, job-ready education. Renisha Chainani, head of research at Augmont, writes - Gold and silver surged to fresh record highs, with gold crossing $4,600 (₹1,40,000) and silver moving past $83 (₹2,60,000). The rally was driven by a mix of rising geopolitical tensions and growing expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will be forced to cut interest rates further. Last week itself, gold ended up nearly 4%, while silver jumped a sharp 12%, as markets reacted to weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs data and an increasingly uncertain global backdrop. Geopolitical tensions back in focus Geopolitical risks have once again taken centre stage. Tensions remain high amid escalating unrest in Iran, the ongoing Russia–Ukraine war, the U.S. capture of Venezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro, and renewed signals from US about taking control of Greenland. Investors are closely watching the protests in Iran, now in their third week, with reports suggesting more than 500 deaths so far. President Donald Trump has warned Iran’s leadership against using force on protesters and hinted at possible U.S. action if the crackdown continues. Iranian officials, in turn, have warned against any U.S. or Israeli intervention and threatened retaliation, including targeting U.S. military bases in the region. All of this comes at a time when Trump is projecting U.S. power more aggressively on the global stage—ousting Venezuela’s president and openly discussing the possibility of acquiring Greenland, either through purchase or force. Growing pressure on the Fed to cut rates U.S. economic data is adding to the case for easier monetary policy. December nonfarm payrolls rose by just 50,000, falling short of expectations, while the unemployment rate edged down to 4.4%. The numbers point to a weakening job market, which, combined with geopolitical risks, firmer oil prices, and rising uncertainty, creates a supportive environment for precious metals. Markets continue to price in two rate cuts this year, even though the Fed is expected to hold rates steady at its upcoming meeting. Adding to the drama, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Sunday that the Trump administration had threatened him with a criminal probe over his Congressional testimony—moves Powell described as an attempt to pressure the central bank into lowering rates. The comments pushed the dollar and U.S. equity futures lower, while gold and silver gained further. Supreme Court ruling on Trump tariffs in focus Another major risk event is brewing. There is growing speculation that the U.S. Supreme Court may deliver a ruling on January 14 on the legality of tariffs imposed under emergency powers. If the court upholds Trump’s authority to impose tariffs without Congressional approval, tariff threats could return quickly—this time aimed not just at China, but Europe as well, potentially linked to U.S. ambitions around Greenland. If the ruling goes the other way and declares such tariffs illegal, markets could see sharp volatility. That said, the administration reportedly already has alternative legal routes lined up to reimpose tariffs. In either case, precious metals are well positioned. Trade tensions typically weigh on the dollar and push investors toward safe-haven assets like gold and silver, while supporting currencies such as the euro and Swiss franc. An even more intriguing outcome would be if the court places clear limits on presidential powers—something that could make Trump’s policy responses even more unpredictable going forward. What to watch this week This week’s economic calendar is packed, with the spotlight on U.S. inflation and consumer data. Tuesday’s December CPI report will be especially important, as it may be the first inflation print unaffected by the government shutdown. That said, geopolitics could easily steal the spotlight. Any Supreme Court decision on tariffs—or fresh developments on the geopolitical front—could end up driving markets more than economic data. The gold boom began in mid-August around $3400 and reached $4400 by mid-October. The prices then retraced and have been taking support from the uptrendline since. Gold has crossed its previous high resistance of $4570. The next level to watch for is of $4745-50 (78.6% fibbonnicci extension) and $4966-70 (100% fibbonnicci extension). The Silver rally started from $45 in October, and extended up $82.7 in December 2025. Fibonacci extension suggests that this rally can extend further towards $84, $88, $93 and $99 in the coming few months of 2026 with strong support at $70. The labour ministry is examining a proposal to raise and standardise EPFO and ESIC wage ceilings at ₹25,000–30,000 after a Supreme Court directive.

Budget expectation: Gurvinder Gandhi, CFO, Mitsubishi Electric India “India’s manufacturing journey is moving from automation adoption to automation depth. With investments in industrial automation estimated to grow from USD 19.71 billion in 2026 and the market projected to enlarge at a notably high pace in the forthcoming decade, the upcoming Union Budget can accelerate this by enabling the domestic manufacturing of advanced factory automation tools, including PLCs, industrial robots, cobots, and servo systems. The incentives in these segments can assist the Indian industry to go beyond fragmented automation to interconnected, data-based, and intelligent factory ecosystems that are consistent with global standards. The reinforcement of high value engineering and innovation are also critical in India. Since Global Capability Centres are carrying out more core R&D, system design and advanced engineering, incentive policy assistance can support the anchoring of this industry in India, enhance involvement in global value chains and establish long-term technical capabilities. From a sustainability standpoint, there should be focus on technologies that address air quality and energy efficiency across industries. The incentivisation of more advanced and energy-efficient technologies in air purification can provide quantifiable benefits in terms of cutting down the losses associated with pollution, enhancing the urban living conditions and supporting the overall climate commitments of India.” Alembic Pharmaceuticals receives USFDA Tentative Approval for BosutinibTablets, 400 mg Shares dip nearly 1% to Rs 792.15 on the NSE.

While schemes such as PLI and PRIP have laid a strong foundation, the next phase must focus on scale, execution, and global cost competitiveness. Rationalisation of import tariffs on critical raw materials, coupled with targeted incentives for value-added formulations and APIs, will be crucial to offset rising input and compliance costs. We also see a strong case for enhanced tax incentives for R&D, faster depreciation benefits for quality and compliance investments, and easier access to export credit for pharma manufacturers. A Budget that strengthens PLI outcomes, supports green and compliant manufacturing, and aligns trade policy with India’s healthcare diplomacy will help the sector move decisively towards its $120–130 billion ambition by 2030 and reinforce India’s position as the Pharmacy of the World.” - Mr. Bhavin Mehta, Whole Time Director Kilitch Drugs and Vice Chairperson, Pharmexcil. “As the Union Budget 2026 approaches, the industry would welcome continued support to strengthen India’s manufacturing ecosystem through policy stability, infrastructure development, and a level playing field for domestic producers. For the metals and stainless steel sector, factors such as rising steel input costs, raw material volatility, global trade disruptions, and dumping pressures continue to pose challenges. The forthcoming Budget may consider measures such as trade safeguards where appropriate, rationalisation of duties on critical steel inputs, and incentives that encourage capacity expansion and value-added manufacturing. Improved access to long term financing for technology upgrades, compliance requirements, and scale efficiencies could further support sectoral growth.”- — Chandragupt Prakash Mangal, Managing Director, Mangalam Worldwide Limited Once the bulls get some hold and start pushing the price up, natural gas futures can rally to ₹350.

However, changes in capital gains taxation shall temporarily create an unsettled sentiment, particularly in mid- and small-cap stocks. This movement shall be in response to the sharp market fluctuations which are expected to be observed after the Budget.

For 3QFY26 YTD, consumption growth was at 15% y-y, which is slightly ahead than our estimate of FY26F growth of +13% y-y annually Key driver of the strong growth, was stronger-than-expected performance from newer malls ( Phoenix Mall of Asia, Bengaluru and Phoenix Mall of the Millennium, Pune) Overall yet to see how much of consumption growth translates into retail income growth in 3QFY26 due to company’s ongoing tenant churn in key malls.

Management highlighted deflation in staples partially impacted revenue growth. Led by GM expansion (50bps YoY despite general merchandise and apparel mix remaining unchanged), EBITDA/PAT grew by 20%/18% YoY (3%/4% above Citi est) See risk to margin trend sustaining; believe, GM expansion was led by (a) one-time discount/additional margin offered by FMCG companies to liquidate inventory (during GST rate change); and/or (b) DMart rationalizing overall discount (under new management) to focus on profitability amid slowing SSG led by increasing competition from quick commerce. Profit growth has lagged revenue growth in 10 out of last 12 qtrs – likely due to competition from quick commerce and cost inflation. Jefferies on Avenue Supermart Hold, TP Rs 4050 DMart continued to witness a moderation in revenue growth with LFL at 5.6% - portfolio mix broadly stayed stable. Despite these factors, EBITDA margins expanded smartly to a multi-qtr high and drove the earning surprise as EBITDA grew 20% YoY.

Sensex fell by 240.66 pts or 0.29% to 83,335.58 at 9.19 am after opening at 83,435.31 against the previous close of 83,576.24. Nifty 50 dipped by 69.15 pts or 0.27% to 25,614.15. Ravi Singh, Chief Research Officer from Master Capital Services Ltd. The Indian equity markets witnessed intense selling pressure during the week ended January 09, as rising global uncertainties and domestic concerns weighed heavily on investor sentiment. The Nifty 50 declined sharply by around 2.5% or 645 points to close the week at 25,683.30, while the BSE Sensex fell nearly 2.55% or 2,185 points to settle at 83,576. The broader markets remained under even greater stress, with the Nifty Midcap and Smallcap indices slipping by about 2.64% and 3.08% respectively, reflecting a clear risk-off approach among participants. Sector-wise, the selling pressure was most pronounced in oil & gas, energy, and infrastructure stocks, which declined by nearly 5.76%, 5.14%, and 4.74% respectively. In contrast, select defensive pockets such as defence and consumer durables outperformed the broader market, ending the week with modest gains of around 1.35% and 1%. The recent market weakness can largely be attributed to four key factors. Firstly, global sentiment turned cautious after the U.S. President approved a bipartisan Russian sanctions bill, paving the way for heavy tariffs, up to 500%, on major buyers of Russian energy products. Secondly, lingering uncertainty surrounding the U.S.–India trade deal continued to dampen investor confidence, as markets remain watchful for concrete progress. Thirdly, expectations of mixed Q3 earnings, and sustained FIIs selloff. On the flows front, FIIs continued to remain net sellers, offloading equities worth Rs. 8,808 crore. Meanwhile, DIIs maintained strong support for the market, recording net inflows of Rs. 15,700 crore. Nifty ended the week on a weak note, declining 2.45 percent after touching a fresh all-time high of 26,373. The fall was largely driven by profit booking at higher levels. The index has now slipped below its 21-day and 55-day EMAs and also breached the rising trendline, reflecting a loss of short-term momentum. However, Nifty is currently placed near its 21-week EMA, which may offer temporary support. Overall chart structure and candlestick patterns indicate further weakness. Immediate support lies at 25500 and a break below could drag the index toward 25300. On the upside, resistance is placed at 25900, with sustained strength above this level opening room toward 26100. Sell on rise remains the preferred strategy. Nifty Bank declined around 1.5 percent over the week, closing on a weak note and forming a bearish Marubozu candle on the weekly chart after touching its all-time high of 60,437. The index has breached the 21-day EMA, indicating short-term weakness and a shift in momentum. This breakdown suggests selling pressure is dominating at higher levels. 2.The next crucial support is placed in the 58,780–58,800 zone, and prices may drift toward this area in the coming week, supporting a sell-on-rise strategy. On the upside, 59,600 remains a key resistance; sustained trade above this level could trigger a recovery toward 61000.

Morgan India Cables & Wires: Shovel sellers in the ‘electrification’ rush; capacity shock key risk: Initiate coverage of KEI (OW), Polycab (OW) Cable and Wire (C&W) majors offer ‘picks and shovels’ exposure to the structural trends of electrification and energy transition, and we believe they are poised for near-term EPS upgrades, driven by the rise in copper prices (JPM FY27E EPS 8-12% above consensus). While we expect the upcoming entry of large conglomerates, starting with the ‘higher-margin and largely organized’ wires segment, to impact industry margins/ROCE, we see KEI and Polycab as better placed than peers, given their higher cable mix (65-70%) and EPS growth visibility (c.20-25% over the next 3 years). We initiate coverage of KEI (OW, 21% potential upside) and Polycab (OW, 16% potential upside). Polycab vs KEI: While we believe Polycab is likely to deliver higher growth in the near-term, structurally we slightly prefer KEI for its cleaner exposure to C&W, higher ‘export and EHV (Extra High Voltage) mix, and potential margin improvement as recently commissioned capacities ramp-up. For Polycab, we expect normalization of margin superiority vs peers (~450bps higher EBIT margin than top 5, despite having a higher share of cables) as competition increases and as Polycab enters a capex cycle to maintain capacity share in cables. However, with Polycab trading at ~10% discount to KEI, risk/reward seems similar. ▶️Net Profit Up 37.5% at ₹584.9 Cr vs ₹425.4 Cr (YoY) ▶️NII Up 34.8% at ₹897.5 Cr vs ₹665.8 Cr (YoY) Changes in settlement schedule due to settlement holiday on January 15, 2026 on account of Municipal Corporation Elections in Maharashtra Trade dt.14.01.2026 and 15.01.2026 Pay in and Pay out on 16.01.2026 Two Settlement on 16.01.2026 SHARES BOUGHT ON 14.01.26 DO NOT SELL ON 15.01.26 ( NO BTST) Turnover : (NSE + BSE) Cash Volume : 106746.84 + 7953.66 Total: 114700.5 F&O Volume : 193718.32 + 5162718.11 Total: 5356436.43 Provisional Cash: Only NSE FII/FPI: NET SELL: -3609 (10851.68 - 14460.68) DII: NET BUY: +5341.01 (17108.33 - 11767.32) So long as the barrier at ₹170 holds, the sentiment will be bearish.

Title: Infosys risks losing $150 million a year from one of its largest clients

Infosys Ltd risks losing over a third of its $400 million annual revenue from Daimler, one of its three largest clients, as the German auto giant seeks a new vendor for software and equipment following execution delays, according to two people familiar with the details. India’s second-largest information technology (IT) services provider stands to lose the largest part of the contract under which it procured and provided iPhone cases, laptops, Microsoft 365 subscriptions, and fingerprint readers for the automakers’ back-end information technology (IT) operations, said the people, who didn’t want to be identified as the information is private. Bengaluru-based Infosys, which ended the previous fiscal ended March 2025 (FY25) with $19.28 billion in revenue, would now need to backfill $150 million, or 0.7% of its business, before eyeing incremental growth when macroeconomic uncertainty, tariff wars, and the rise of automation tools have squeezed client spending. “It is unlikely that Infosys will see meaningful incremental revenue from Daimler in the near term,” said Phil Fersht, chief executive officer (CEO) of HFS Research, a Massachusetts-based IT research and consulting firm. “Even where renewals occur, pricing pressure and scope rationalization typically offset any expansion. The focus is more on retaining relevance in strategic digital, engineering, and core platform areas rather than growing total contract value.” In December 2020, Infosys signed a $3.2 billion, eight-year IT transformation deal with Daimler. Under the terms, Infosys would provide services across six business divisions, including network services, cybersecurity, SAP software, data centres, after-sales call services, and workplace solutions or the IT procurement business–the biggest of the six arms. Daimler had split into Mercedes-Benz Group and Daimler Trucks in December 2021, but both units retained Infosys for IT services work. “Workplace solutions was supposed to be renewed last year but we are now waiting for June to get a clearer picture. We had floated an RFP (request for proposal) but that was not agreed upon by the client,” said the first of the two people quoted earlier. According to the second person, the partial renewal of the deal comes amid differences between the two companies over execution and billing delays. As of 12 January, Daimler, including Mercedes and Daimler Trucks, owes almost $47 million in dues to Infosys since 2021. Mint could not independently ascertain whether large deals have a provision to extend individual segments. However, the cybersecurity and data centre services have been renewed until 2029 under the Infosys-Daimler deal, while SAP, call functionality, and network segments have not been fully renewed yet, said the second person. Queries emailed to Infosys on Friday went unanswered, while Daimler and Mercedes-Benz declined to comment on “supplier relationships” and “internal processes”. One of India’s top IT services providers is eyeing a portion of Infosys’ contract with Daimler and has “already made a bid”, said the second person. Mint could not ascertain the name of the company. The Daimler contract was one of the dozen mega deals worth over $1 billion that the company has won since Salil Parekh took over as chief executive officer in January 2018, steering the company to outperform its peers in the number of mega deals secured. According to an executive, Daimler is one of Infosys’s three largest clients, after Apple Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Other large contracts Infosys won include the July 2020 10-year deal worth $1.89 billion with Vanguard and a $1.6-billion contract with the UK’s public health provider, the National Health Service, signed in October last year. The Daimler project is dubbed the ‘twice as fast program’ for Infosys. It helped double Infosys’s revenue from manufacturers to $3 billion last fiscal from $1.3 billion in FY20. During this five-year period, Infosys’s overall revenue grew 42% to $19.28 billion in FY25. The company, which announces its third-quarter results on 14 January, expects to end FY26 with revenue growth of 2-3% in constant-currency terms, a measure that excludes the impact of currency fluctuations. Revenue from Infosys Automotive and Mobility GmbH, a subsidiary that the IT giant created for the Daimler project, declined for the first time in FY25. It fell 8.5% over the previous fiscal to $418 million, after growing more than 40% for two straight years, according to JM Financial analysts. The unit has also been unprofitable for four straight years. “If there is a revenue decline in the subsidiary, it clearly means that revenue from the Daimler account has reached its peak and matured,” wrote JM Financial’s Abhishek Kumar and Nandan Arekal in a note dated 16 June 2025. Mint had reported on 24 February last year that Infosys was eyeing an early renewal with Daimler with a new AI arm. It now risks losing incremental business if the workplace arm of the deal is not renewed. Still, ending part of previously signed contracts with IT services providers is not new. Several companies have opened their own back-end tech centres, terminating contracts with existing IT vendors mid-way through the deal. Transamerica nixed a 10-year IT outsourcing deal worth $2 billion with Tata Consultancy Services Ltd in June 2023, five years after signing the contract. Similarly, later that year, third-largest HCL Technologies and State Street called off their decade-long partnership after the client in-sourcing its tech needs.

Title: Motional puts AI at center of robotaxi reboot as it targets 2026 for driverless service | TechCrunch

The company, born from a $4 billion joint venture between Hyundai Motor Group and Aptiv, had already missed a deadline to launch a driverless robotaxi service with partner Lyft. It had lost Aptiv as one of its financial backers, prompting Hyundai to step up with another $1 billion investment to keep it going. Several layoffs, including a 40% restructuring cut in May 2024, had whittled the company from its peak of about 1,400 employees to less than 600. Meanwhile, advancements in AI were changing how engineers were developing the technology. Motional was going to have to evolve or die. It paused everything and picked option No. 1. Motional told TechCrunch it has rebooted its robotaxi plans with an AI-first approach to its self-driving system and a promise to launch a commercial driverless service in Las Vegas by the end of 2026. The company has already opened up a robotaxi service — with a human safety operator behind the wheel — to its employees. It plans to offer that service to the public with an unnamed ride-hailing partner later this year. (Motional has existing relationships with Lyft and Uber.) By the end of the year, the human safety operator will be pulled from the robotaxis and a true commercial driverless service will begin, the company said. “We saw that there was tremendous potential with all the advancements that were happening within AI; and we also saw that while we had a safe, driverless system, there was a gap to getting to an affordable solution that could generalize and scale globally,” Motional president and CEO Laura Major said during a presentation at the company’s Las Vegas facilities. “And so we made the very hard decision to pause our commercial activities, to slow down in the near term so that we could speed up.” This meant shifting away from its classic robotics approach to an AI foundation model-based one. Motional was never devoid of AI. Motional’s self-driving system used individual machine learning models to handle perception, tracking, and semantic reasoning. But it also used more rules-based programs for other operations within the software stack. And the individual ML models made it a complex web of software, Major said. Meanwhile, AI models originally built for language began to be applied in robots and other physical AI systems, including the development of autonomous driving. That transformer architecture made it possible to build large and complex AI models, ultimately leading to the emergence, and skyrocketing use, of ChatGPT. Motional searched for ways to combine these smaller models and integrate them into a single backbone, allowing for an end-to-end architecture. It has also maintained the smaller models for developers, which Major explained gives Motional the best of both worlds. “This is really critical for two things; one is for generalizing more easily to new cities, new environments, new scenarios,” she said. “And the other is to do this in a cost-optimized way. So for example, the traffic lights might be different in the next city you go to, but you don’t have to redevelop or re-analyze those. You just collect some data, train the model, and it’s capable of operating safely in that new city.” TechCrunch got a firsthand look at Motional’s new approach during a 30-minute autonomous drive around Las Vegas. One demo can’t provide an accurate assessment of a self-driving system. It can, however, pinpoint weaknesses and differences from previous iterations, and gauge progress. Progress is what I saw as the Hyundai Ioniq 5 I rode in autonomously navigated its way off Las Vegas Boulevard and into the pickup and drop-off area of the Aria Hotel. These bustling areas are notorious in La Vegas and my experience was no different as the autonomous vehicle slowly nudged its way around a stopped taxi and unloading passengers, changed lanes, then back again, passing dozens of people, giant flower pots, and cars along the way. Motional previously operated a ride-hailing service in Las Vegas with partner Lyft using vehicles that would autonomously handle portions of a ride. Parking lots and hotel valet and app ride pickup areas were never part of those operations. A human safety operator, always behind the wheel, would take over to navigate parking lots or the busy pickup and drop-off points of hotel lobbies. There is still more progress to be made. The graphics displayed to riders within the vehicle are still under development. And while there was never a disengagement during my demo ride — which means the human safety operator takes over — the vehicle did take its time to nudge itself around a double-parked Amazon delivery van. Still, Major argues Motional is on the right path to deploy safely and cost-effectively. And its majority owner Hyundai is in it for the long haul, she said. “I think the real long-term vision, you know, for all of this, is putting Level 4 on people’s personal cars,” Major said, referring to a term that mean the system handles all driving with no expectation of human intervention. “Robotaxis, that’s stop number one, and huge impact. But ultimately, I think any OEM would love to also integrate that into their cars.” Topics Transportation Editor Plan ahead for the 2026 StrictlyVC events.

The feature will allow users to specify specific assets, such as stocks and crypto, when posting cashtags like $BTC or $NVDA, according to a Sunday post by the company’s head of product, Nikita Bier. Tapping a Smart Cashtag will open an in-app page showing live prices, price changes, charts, and posts mentioning the asset. X said the tool is designed to reduce ambiguity around tickers and smart contracts, particularly in crypto markets where symbols can overlap. In some cases, assets will be identified by their underlying smart contract addresses. Bier said X plans to collect user feedback ahead of a public release targeted for next month. The company did not disclose whether the feature would include trading or monetisation components. The move reflects X’s broader effort to position the platform as a real-time source of financial information, as users increasingly discuss markets and trading activity on the platform. Musk has repeatedly said he wants to turn X into an “everything app,” including payments and financial services, and has previously floated the idea of supporting cryptocurrencies on the platform, while stopping short of confirming whether digital assets such as Dogecoin, his preferred meme coin, would be integrated into any future payments product. X’s former CEO, Linda Yaccarino, also announced in June that the platform would support in-app investing and trading. A month later, she resigned. Further announcements regarding an exact timeline of that feature’s rollout have not been provided. X Corp did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s request for comment. Bier joined X around the same time as Yaccarino’s departure, and is an advisor to Solana and a venture partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners. He previously held roles at xAI and Meta within a division that built experimental, consumer-facing apps.

Title: The gap between Gemini and ChatGPT is narrowing

After a slow start, Google's AI chatbot is rapidly gaining users, topping AI benchmark leaderboards, and forcing its biggest competitor, OpenAI's ChatGPT, into "code red" emergencies. Now, in another big leap, Walmart, the world's largest retailer, is partnering with Gemini on a new shopping experience — similar to one it struck with ChatGPT in October. When people use Gemini to ask questions or search, the assistant will now automatically recommend relevant products from Walmart and Sam's Club, drawing on users' past online and in-store purchases, Walmart said in a press release on Sunday. For users who have linked their Walmart accounts, Gemini can tailor recommendations based on purchase history and enable delivery of in-store items within three hours, or as little as 30 minutes.

Walmart CEO John Furner said the partnership marks a shift in how people shop. "The transition from traditional web or app search to agent-led commerce represents the next great evolution in retail. We aren't just watching the shift, we are driving it," Furner said in the press release. In recent years, discovery-led shopping experiences on social media platforms like TikTok Shop, Instagram Shopping, and live shopping services like Whatnot have disrupted the traditional digital shopping experience. AI is reshaping the discovery process even further. While Gemini still trails ChatGPT in overall number of users by a significant margin, it's closing the gap and even outperforming OpenAI in other key ways. In November, after years of taking heat as the slow-moving leviathan in the AI race, Google redeemed itself with the launch of Gemini 3. The latest version of Google's chatbot was well received by both consumers and industry leaders. Its stock price surged in the weeks following the rollout, and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said he would switch from ChatGPT to Gemini, calling the latter "insane" in a viral post. The hype forced OpenAI CEO Sam Altman to declare a "code red" at his company. Gemini also benefits from Google's larger ecosystem of products, like Search, Workplace, Android, and Google TV. Another promising development for Gemini, underpinning its partnership with Walmart, is the launch of a new retail protocol, which Google refers to as the Universal Commerce Protocol. "AI agents will be a big part of how we shop in the not-so-distant future," Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in a post on X on Sunday. "To help lay the groundwork, we partnered with Shopify, Etsy, Wayfair, Target and Walmart to create the Universal Commerce Protocol, a new open standard for agents and systems to talk to each other across every step of the shopping journey." Protocols have long served as the invisible scaffolding of the digital realm, and streamlining a new era of agent-to-agent communication is a critical step in unlocking an agent-powered world, founders building AI protocols previously told Business Insider. OpenAI unveiled its own commerce protocol in September, following the launch of Instant Checkout. The new feature lets users buy items directly in ChatGPT from Etsy and over a million Shopify merchants, the company said in a blog post announcing the feature. OpenAI also said the protocol behind it, the Agentic Commerce Protocol, is "an open standard for AI commerce that lets AI agents, people, and businesses work together to complete purchases." It was developed alongside Stripe. Google's mission appears to be similar. In response to a request for comment, a Google spokesperson referred Business Insider to a blog post Pichai wrote about its new Unified Commerce Protocol. In it, he explains how the new protocol will change the consumer shopping experience. He said if a shopper is looking for a suitcase, the protocol allows retailers to instantly offer a new-member price or prompt loyalty enrollment. Returning customers might see tailored discounts or product suggestions, such as packing cubes, when they check out. The transaction can then be completed in just a few taps through Google Pay — without leaving the chat, Pichai said. Jump to

Title: Magnificent 7’s stock market dominance shows signs of cracking
URL: https://fortune.com/2026/01/11/magnificent-7-stock-market-dominance-cracking-nvidia-microsoft-apple-meta-alphabet-amazon-tesla/
Time Published: 2026-01-11T21:43:27Z
Full Content:
To beat the market in recent years, many investors applied a simple strategy: Load up on the biggest US technology stocks. It paid handsomely for a long time. But last year, it didn’t. For the first time since 2022, when the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates, the majority of the Magnificent 7 tech giants performed worse than the S&P 500 Index. While the Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Index rose 25% in 2025, compared with 16% for the S&P 500, that was only because of the enormous gains by Alphabet Inc. and Nvidia Corp. Many Wall Street pros see that dynamic continuing in 2026, as profit growth slows and questions about payoffs from heavy artificial intelligence spending rise. So far they’ve been right, with the Magnificent 7 index up just 0.5% and the S&P 500 climbing 1.8% to start the year. Suddenly stock picking within the group is crucial. “This isn’t a one-size-fits-all market,” said Jack Janasiewicz, lead portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions, which has $1.4 trillion in assets. “If you’re just buying the group, the losers could offset the winners.” The three-year bull market has been led by the tech giants, with Nvidia, Alphabet, Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc. alone accounting for more than a third of the S&P 500’s gains since the run began in October 2022. But enthusiasm for them is cooling as interest in the rest of the S&P 500 rises. With Big Tech’s earnings growth slowing, investors are no longer content with promises of AI riches — they want to start seeing a return. Profits for the Magnificent 7 are expected to climb about 18% in 2026, the slowest pace since 2022 and not much better than the 13% rise projected for the other 493 companies in the S&P 500, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. “We’re already seeing a broadening of earnings growth and we think that’s going to continue,” said David Lefkowitz, head of US equities at UBS Global Wealth Management. “Tech is not the only game in town.” One source of optimism is the group’s relatively subdued valuations. The Magnificent 7 index is priced at 29 times profits projected over the next 12 months, well below the 40s multiples earlier in the decade. The S&P 500 is trading at 22 times expected earnings, and the Nasdaq 100 Index is at 25 times. Here’s a look at expectations for the year ahead. The dominant AI chipmaker is under pressure from rising competition and concerns about the sustainability of spending by its biggest customers. The stock is up 1,165% since the end of 2022, but it has lost 11% since its Oct. 29 record. Rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. has won data center orders from OpenAI and Oracle Corp., and Nvidia customers like Alphabet are increasingly deploying their own custom made processors. Still, its sales continue to race ahead as demand for chips outstrips supply. Wall Street is bullish, with 76 of the 82 analysts covering the chipmaker holding buy ratings. The average analyst price target implies a roughly 39% gain over the next 12 months, best among the group, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. For Microsoft, 2025 was the second consecutive year it underperformed the S&P 500. One of the biggest AI spenders, it’s expected to invest nearly $100 billion in capital expenditures during its current fiscal year, which ends in June. That figure is projected to rise to $116 billion the following year, according to the average of analyst estimates. The data center buildout is fueling a resurgence in revenue growth in Microsoft’s cloud-computing business, but the company hasn’t had as much success in getting customers to pay for the AI services infused into its software products. Investors want to start seeing returns on those investments, according to Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management. “What you’re seeing is some people looking for a little bit more quality management in terms of that cash flow management and a better idea on what profitability really looks like when it comes to AI,” Mulberry said. Apple has been far less aggressive with its AI ambitions than the rest of the Magnificent 7. The stock was punished for it last year, falling almost 20% through the start of August. But then it caught on as an “anti-AI” play, soaring 34% through the end of the year as investors rewarded its lack of AI spending risk. At the same time, strong iPhone sales reassured investors that the company’s most important product remains in high demand. Accelerating growth will be the key for Apple shares this year. Its momentum has slowed recently, the stock closed higher on Friday, narrowly avoiding matching its longest losing streak since 1991. However, revenue is expected to expand 9% in fiscal 2026, which ends in September, the fastest pace since 2021. With the stock valued at 31 times estimated earnings, the second highest in the Magnificent 7 after Tesla, it will need the push to keep the rally going. A year ago, OpenAI was seen as leading the AI race and investors feared Alphabet would get left behind. Today, Google’s parent is a consensus favorite, with dominant positions across the AI landscape. Alphabet’s latest Gemini AI model received rave reviews, easing concerns about OpenAI. And its tensor processing unit chips are considered a potential significant driver of future revenue growth, which could eat into Nvidia’s commanding share of the AI semiconductor market. The stock rose more than 65% last year, the best performance in the Magnificent 7. But how much more can it run? The company is approaching $4 trillion in market value, and the shares trade at around 28 times estimated earnings, well above their five-year average of 20. The average analyst price target projects just a 3.9% gain this year. The e-commerce and cloud-computing giant was the weakest Magnificent 7 stock in 2025, its seventh straight year in that position. But Amazon has charged out of the gate in early 2026 and is leading the pack. Much of the optimism surrounding the company is based on Amazon Web Services, which posted its fastest growth in years in the company’s most recent results. Concerns that AWS was falling behind its rivals has pressured the stock, as has the company’s aggressive AI spending, which includes efforts to improve efficiency at its warehouses, in part by using robotics. Investors expect the efficiency push to start paying off before long, which could make this the year the stock goes from laggard to leader. “Automation in warehouses and more efficient shipping will be huge,” said Clayton Allison, portfolio manager at Prime Capital Financial, which owns Amazon shares. “It hasn’t gotten the love yet, but it reminds me of Alphabet last year, which was sort of left behind amid all the concerns about competition from OpenAI, then really took off.” Perhaps no stock in the group shows how investors have turned skeptical about lavish AI spending more than Meta. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has pushed expensive acquisitions and talent hires in pursuit of his AI ambitions, including a $14 billion investment in Scale AI in which Meta also hired the startup’s CEO Alexandr Wang to be its chief AI officer. That strategy was fine with shareholders — until it wasn’t. The stock tumbled in late October after Meta raised its 2025 capital expenditures forecast to $72 billion and projected “notably larger”spending in 2026. When the shares hit a record in August they were up 35% for the year, but they’ve since dropped 17%. Demonstrating how that spending is boosting profits will be critical for Meta in 2026. Tesla’s shares were the worst performers in the Magnificent 7 through the first half of 2025, but then soared more than 40% in the second half as Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk shifted focus from slumping electric vehicle sales to self-driving cars and robotics. The rally has Tesla’s valuation at almost 200 times estimated profits, making it the second most expensive stock in the S&P 500 behind takeover target Warner Bros. Discover Inc. After two years of stagnant revenue, Tesla is expected to start growing again in 2026. Revenue is projected to rise 12% this year and 18% next year, following an estimated 3% contraction in 2025, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Still, Wall Street is pessimistic about Tesla shares this year. The average analyst price target projects a 9.1% decline over the next 12 months, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

Title: Clontarf beat Ballynahinch to stretch lead at top of AIL

Clontarf extended their lead atop Division 1A of the Energia All-Ireland League to five points with a hard-earned and significant 24-20 win away to Ballynahinch. It was the kind of sleeves-rolled-up, midwinter victory that is the trademark of the reigning champions. Clontarf thus completed the double over Ballynahinch, backing up their first Bateman Cup triumph against the same opponents last month. On a day when the Ballymena-Dungannon derby an hour up the road was postponed due to a frozen pitch, frost meant doubt about the fixture at Ballymacarn Park persisted until 11am, when the pitch was declared playable. Clontarf led 12-6 at half-time through tries by Alex O’Grady and Fionn Gilbert, before Ballynahinch were on the verge of a first win over Clontarf since 2020 thanks to a try by Ryan Connolly and a penalty try, as well as eight points from the boot of Conor Rankin. Despite being down to 13 men, Clontarf turned down a kick at goal and were rewarded with a fourth try by Leinster academy lock Alan Spicer, capping a stormer. Conor Kelly converted. St Mary’s had assumed leadership overnight after gaining revenge for their 14-0 loss to Lansdowne four weeks ago with an equally hard-fought 13-7 win on the Aviva back pitch on Friday night. Returning again to his former club, Mark McHugh’s gritty side restricted Lansdowne to just a penalty try in the first-half. Mick McCormack’s close-range finish rewarded concerted pressure and Mick O’Gara’s second penalty helped keep the home side at arm’s length despite Lansdowne’s late rally. In the absence of JJ Kenny, on Leinster try-scoring duty against La Rochelle, Terenure turned to another ex-Irish Sevens winger in Ed Kelly. He duly scored the first try as Terenure gained a 27-19 revenge win over Old Belvedere in an entertaining game that was moved to the Lakelands Park astro pitch. After Will Hickey added another for a 17-0 interval lead, Old Belvedere stayed in touch through two tries by full-back Morgan Meredith either side of Chris Cosgrave becoming a third former St Michael’s pupil to score for Terenure. Before a consolation try for Belvo in the last play, Harrison Brewer powered over off a lineout to complete a bonus-point win that elevated ‘Nure to third in the table on 32 points, five points behind neighbours St Mary’s. Cork Con also moved one point above Lansdowne and into the top four on 32 points by completing a double at home to UCD with a 26-7 bonus-point win; Michael Foy, Sean Condon, Danny Sheahan and Peter Hyland scored their tries. Four weeks after losing 57-10 in Tom Clifford Park, Nenagh Ormond were vastly more competitive at home to Young Munster. Although they lost 43-31, Nenagh finally picked up their first point in the top flight thanks to two tries by number eight Willie Coffey and one each by half-backs Luke Kerr and Charlie O’Doherty, who also kicked 11 points. But Young Munster are now accumulating the wins that their expansive rugby has deserved and they picked up their seventh attacking bonus point through tries by Oran O’Reilly, Luke McCready, Ajae Hanson, Stephen McLoughlin, Oisin Pepper and Jake O’Riordan.

Daragh Cronin said he wanted the children of Munster to be able to receive ‘best-in-class paediatric care’ (Brian Lougheed/Mediaconsult) A young man riding a bike from Ireland to Mount Everest has said he is doing it to “give back” to the Cork community which has supported him in the past. Daragh Cronin is hoping his mammoth journey will raise €30,000 for children’s wards at Cork University Hospital (CUH). Mr Cronin said the charity was close to his heart and that he wanted the children of Munster to be able to receive “best-in-class paediatric care”. He also wanted to inspire children of the region to “chase their dreams”. Daragh Cronin outside Cork University Hospital (Brian Lougheed/PA) Mr Cronin’s journey will begin at Blackrock hurling club on February 14 and take him on a ferry from Rosslare to France, then trekking out over Europe and the Middle East before heading to Everest base camp. The 23-year-old Cork man is no stranger to long-distance bike journeys, having navigated the length of Africa by riding almost 13,500km between Morocco and South Africa “with zero prior cycling or camping experience”. He said that experience had inspired him to raise money for the hospital, through the CUH Charity. He said he had been told his Africa trip would be “impossible” without experience. “I had guns pointed in my face. But 99pc of the time, there was genuine hospitality and huge amounts of kindness,” he said. Daragh Cronin is from Blackrock in Cork (Brian Lougheed/Mediaconsult) “I know these things are coming my way again but I trust my instinct, I was able to talk my way out of some hairy situations in Africa.” Now, with his trip to Everest, he said: “This time I want to do it for a cause. “I had crazy support when I went to Africa, half of Cork had my back, so I want to do something to give back this time.” The route will see him cross the tip of Oman, through Pakistan, India and Nepal before he reaches Mount Everest. “The record I’m trying to set is to hike the bike from a place called Lukla (in Koshi Province) to Everest base camp, and no Irish person has done that,” he said. “I will cycle as far as I can through Nepal, on to Lukla, and then put the bike over my neck and get to base camp.” – Mr Cronin’s charity fundraiser is available at here.

Title: Binance’s CZ Claims US Banks Are “Loading Up” on Bitcoin While Retail Panics—But Is It Really a Buying Spree?

Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) has tweeted that major US banks are “loading up” on Bitcoin while the rest of the market has engaged in panic selling. Zhao, fresh from his pardon from US President Trump, has become a much more vocal proponent of the cryptocurrency revolution and is visiting countries around the world to promote it. CZ tweeted: CZ’s tweet is highlighting the latest trend of major American banks buying up Bitcoin in large amounts, even as retail investors continue to be on the defensive. Notable names like BNY Mellon, Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, Barclays, and Standard Chartered have reportedly invested directly. Other financial institutions like JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo have engaged indirectly through Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). Adding to Wells Fargo’s $383 million purchase of BTC, Morgan Stanley has invested $270 million in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), while JPMorgan Chase holds millions of dollars in multiple Bitcoin ETFs. Goldman Sachs reportedly has a sizeable $1.3 billion stake in BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF and $300 million in Fidelity’s ETF. While CZ is doing his best to amplify the recent Wells Fargo purchase, it is not yet true that the US banks are going on a Bitcoin buying spree. The premier digital currency has had a bearish 2025 overall, while other commodities like Gold, Silver, etc., have had a much better showing, outperforming it by a considerable margin. The total investment by US banks in BTC is in the range of several billion dollars, and while that sum may seem huge, it is peanuts compared to their total worth, which is in the tens of trillions of dollars. BlackRock alone is worth in excess of $10 trillion, and its BTC exposure is a minuscule fraction of that valuation. However, the idea that these top banking institutions will be interested in loading up their coffers with BTC in the near future is a likely possibility, as several top executives have voiced their support for it. If these major institutions start holding crypto as a reserve asset, other companies are expected to follow suit, which will likely set off a snowball effect that sharply drives up the crypto market. In addition to major financial players, governments around the world are also looking to buy Bitcoin for their strategic crypto reserves. Several US states, such as Texas and New Hampshire, have already bought BTC for their state coffers, and the US federal government is also moving toward this move.

Title: GameStop set to close over 410 US stores in early 2026 as CEO’s $35 billion stock award causes massive outrage

GameStop is reportedly shuttering hundreds of stores in the United States, with recent estimates predicting that around 295 to 410 locations will close in the first quarter of 2026. This does not include the 590 stores that closed down last year. Meanwhile, as reported by Reuters, GameStop's CEO has been awarded performance-based stock options estimated to be worth around $35 billion, provided the company meets a performance milestone of over $100 billion in market capitalization and around $10 billion in net EBITDA. Cohen became GameStop’s CEO in September 2023 and is the company’s largest shareholder. He doesn’t receive a salary or a guaranteed bonus. Instead, he aims to be compensated through performance milestones. Notices about the latest round of closures appeared on social media and were subsequently compiled into lists on sites such as the “GameStop Closing List” and the official GameStop Subreddit (now removed by moderators). These reports detail confirmed shuttered locations and potential rumors of store closures across states such as New York and Connecticut. Recent reports state that select GameStop sites at Enfield Square Mall in Connecticut and Lenox Square Mall in Georgia closed in early January. Former employees are, of course, frustrated with the layoffs, as these job cuts follow GameStop’s February 2025 SEC filing, which detailed: We have also initiated a comprehensive store portfolio optimization review, which involves identifying stores for closure based on many factors, including an evaluation of current market conditions and individual store performance. This review, among other things, resulted in the closure of 590 stores in the United States in fiscal 2024. While the review is ongoing and a specific set of stores has not been identified for closure, we anticipate closing a significant number of additional stores in fiscal 2025. For context, GameStop’s fiscal year 2025 ends on January 31, 2026, meaning more unfortunate closures are on the horizon for what was once considered the go-to store for video games a few years ago. GameStop is also scaling down internationally. The company has sold its Italian operations and shuttered locations in Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, and Austria. In addition, the company plans to divest its Canadian branch. Currently, rumors are circulating that GameStop is considering closing stores in New Zealand, where 38 stores operate.

Title: As sure as Night ’n Day: Family-run business that rose from a corner dairy to 54 franchise stores – can it disrupt supermarket duopoly?

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Night ’n Day general manager Matt Lane and one of the company's newest franchise stores - in Kawarau, near Queenstown. Composite photo / Oliver Rusden They hit headlines recently by selling 20,000 blocks of cut-price butter. Shayne Currie charts the rise of Night ’n Day, a family-owned business with a franchise network of more than 50 stores. Does New Zealand’s third-biggest grocery retailer hold a key to breaking the supermarket duopoly? We’re bringing back a selection of our best-read Premium stories for your summer reading. This story was first published in September. Bridget Stevens started working in the shop as a teenager, serving at the counter every second weekend. At 15, she left school for a fulltime job in the store. By the time she was 34, she owned it. Now, another 17 years later, Stevens – along with her sister, Rebecca Excell – runs one of the most renowned Night ’n Day stores in the country. In Winton, Southland, the pair have 25 staff and a steady stream of customers: the locals who they know on a first-name basis, the truckies lining up at 6am for coffee and hot food and the State Highway 6 travellers popping in for a road-trip snack before heading north to Queenstown or south to Invercargill. “It was just a little corner dairy when I started,” Stevens says. “Olly Olsson was the owner, Mum worked here as well. When I turned 15, Mum left and they offered me her fulltime job – I left school and came here.” Then, 17-and-a-half years ago, Olsson sold up. He’d been at Night ’n Day’s annual conference and returned home to Winton, informing Stevens that he was offering her the business first. “I couldn’t stop crying. He was like, ‘Right, go and talk to your parents about it’. I went and got advice from Mum and Dad, and they were like, ‘That’s a no-brainer’.” In 2017, Excell bought into the business – she is now a 40% shareholder in the franchise. Together, the pair make a formidable team – the store has now won five store-of-the-year awards, including their most recent just last week. They say they complement each other well – Stevens with her knowledge and history; Excell, who trained at one point to be a teacher but never made it to the classroom, with her administrative skills. They both have a natural rapport with their staff. “Before Dad passed away, he was the referee,” Excell laughs, when asked if there have ever been any sisterly squabbles. “He used to come in and sort us out.” Mum still keeps an eye on the shop as well. “She’s very proud,” Stevens says. Family connections and community links run deep at Night ’n Day. Among many examples, there’s father-and-son combination Alan and Hamish Garrick, who own four Night ’n Day stores in Queenstown and Arrowtown, and husband-and-wife Sukhwinder Singh and Manjit Kaur, who own the Mt Maunganui and Rotorua stores. At the top of the business is general manager Matt Lane, who was born in 1990, the same year that his parents, Andrew and Denise – the original Night ’n Day founders – turned their fledgling group of stores into a franchise chain. The Lane family has owned Night ’n Day’s original Regent Rd store in Dunedin since 1984, buying an ageing grocer’s shop with a decaying floor and transforming it, eventually, into a 24-hour student mecca, selling all manner of hangover-curtailing staples (a hot steak pie and Coca Cola, anyone?). The Regent Rd store remains world-famous in Dunedin, but 35 years on from its launch as a franchise business, Night ’n Day has expanded well beyond its Otago roots, now operating 54 stores across New Zealand. It is the country’s third-biggest retail grocery chain. At the same time, the company is pushing for a more level playing field to take on the supermarket duopoly of Foodstuffs – which runs New World, Pak’nSave and Four Square – and Woolworths NZ (previously Progressive), the owner of Woolworths and Fresh Choice/Super Value. Last month, Night ’n Day rolled back the price of butter to August 2024 prices. Rather than a 500g block of yellow gold selling for around $11, Night ‘n Day sold 20,000 blocks – they were limited to one per customer – for $6.50 each. An effective marketing campaign and publicity stunt, it certainly forced home a point about the hefty price of butter, with the duopoly in the spotlight, and broader consumer speculation of a major new competitor. “I think too much focus is on a third player,” Matt Lane told Karen O’Leary of the Paddy Gower Has Issues TV show. “How can we change the market to be a third, a fourth, a fifth, a sixth? Let’s not limit ourselves. Are the small centres going to end up with Costco’s? Absolutely not. “Is Timaru, is Greymouth? They’re not going to end up with a Costco, so why should [those towns] be disadvantaged purely because we’re trying to get an international player that competes in the major cities to try and compress prices?” Lane tells the Herald that the duopoly situation has been a long-term problem since the early 2000s and, therefore, needs long-term solutions. He’s a big fan of the Government effectively carpet-bombing the problem with solutions, rather than a piecemeal approach. “I feel – and it’s easy for me to say this – that there needs to be an overcorrection and then wind it back if necessary, rather than just trying to take one step, then one step, and then one step, and saying, ‘Is it actually working?’” The Government, the Commerce Commission and “the whole of New Zealand know it’s an issue”, Lane says. “We seem to be content just to say, ‘We’ll try and tweak wholesale, or create a wholesale supplier. We’ll try and tweak some of the competition rules or the land covenants’. “Let’s try to fix everything. If we find that something is a bit harsh, you can still dial it back again to find that parity, but we’re a long way away from creating competition.” Night ’n Day was once a member of the Foodstuffs co-operative, giving it access to wholesale prices of dry grocery items. That came to a halt in 2011 - Foodstuffs has previously cited breaches of its membership agreement; the decision also coincided with Night ’n Day partnering up with Gull to open 21 new stores in the North Island. The grocery challenges have meant some Night ’n Day stores lost the ability to hold liquor licences. Because grocery wholesale prices jumped and therefore the retail price lifted, they weren’t selling enough relevant products to be deemed a grocery retailer (and therefore able to also sell booze). Despite these hurdles, Night ‘n Day is a big business success story, largely because of its agility and a necessary pivot away from a focus on groceries – they’re still there, but currently more expensive because of the wholesale issues – to a more purposeful, competitive offering within three distinct pillars: coffee, milk bar and fresh food-to-go/deli foods. “That’s because everyone can access different prices and you can create a differentiation of the product,” Lane says. “That’s where we see a massive amount of growth and that allowed us to sustain our operations because we lost all the profitability and sales of grocery.” While serving barista coffee and hot food might seem common sense, New Zealand has a reputation for leading these retail trends internationally. Lane recalls being at a US retail conference when an expert speaker’s suggestion of barista coffee – rather than the instant, filter variety – was met with gasps and concern in the American audience. New Zealand had been selling it for years. Night ’n Day has also been turbocharged in recent years with delivery service in the form of Uber Eats, Door Dash and Deliver Easy. “It’s the next step of convenience,” Lane says. “Historically, we’re a convenience store because you can get in and out very quickly based on the format size.” Now, convenience arrives at your front door. “People are living a lot more here and now. They’re living for the moment. They value their time a lot more.” While Night ’n Day has a network of 54 stores dotted from Southland to Whangārei and is always looking to grow, Lane says there is no magical number. “It’s the quality over quantity for us. We look at every opportunity as it comes across. We certainly don’t sit there ... being complacent with what we’ve got. “We do want to grow, but we want to make sure that it works, first of all, for the brand, franchisees and the site itself.” Lane reveals the company is looking at several potential new sites, including one at Jack’s Point, in Queenstown, as well as exploring some further options in Dunedin. There is also a “clear gap” in Hamilton. “It just feels like that’s a logical city we’re not part of, when you look at our geographical spread.” An indication of a franchise value is revealed on Night ’n Day’s own website. Right now, two franchises are listed for sale - Cromwell, for $680,000 plus stock at valuation (an estimated $160,000), and Dee St in Invercargill, for $450,000 plus stock at valuation (estimated at $125,000). According to the website, the Cromwell store has a weekly turnover of $62,700 and Dee St has a weekly turnover of $51,000. The average gross profit for each site is 34%. Lane talks of Night ’n Day having more agility than similar-sized retail convenience brands. “We can’t compete on [a marketing] budget with the BPs and the Zs in terms of doing things that way. We’ve just got to do it by creating a point of difference and we do that through our supplier base, speed to market, the ability to have an idea in the morning and execute it in the afternoon.” Like Bridget Stevens in Winton, Matt Lane first experienced life in the shop as a young teenager, stacking shelves. That later became a university job behind the counter, alongside a number of his mates. After graduating from Otago University and working for four years at Deloitte, he came back into the business in 2016, working in business development and then finance before becoming general manager in 2019. Lane’s mother, Denise Lane, says she and her husband, Andrew, owned two standalone dairies in Dunedin initially. They sold those in 1984 to buy the Regent Rd store in the heart of the student district. It was a good-performing store and long-established on a busy street. The site also became the family home for the Lanes and their young children, with their residence attached. Staff had to use the family toilet. “Our hallway wasn’t a normal hallway – it was all filled with shelves and stock because our house was also our storage room.” Opposite them was a BP station, and the Lanes started hearing whispers that it would start trading 24 hours a day. They acted quickly and got in first. They knew they needed to retain their regular customers – a 24-hour rival threatened to draw them away. While Night ’n Day went 24 hours, the BP never did. It’s no longer there. “It was the first standalone 24-hour convenience store in New Zealand,” Andrew Lane says. “There was nothing like it. It started off slow, but it actually picked up and we thought, ‘we’re on a winner here’.” Confident that the model could work elsewhere, the couple then sought out and bought the best dairies in Invercargill and Christchurch. In 1990, the couple were at a National Association of Retail Grocers of New Zealand (Nargon) conference where they met representatives from the Night Owl convenience chain from Australia. “At that stage, we had five stores and they had 10 or 11, and they explained to us about franchising, which we’d never heard of as a business system back then. We’d probably heard of the McDonald’s way of doing things, but didn’t really know too much about it,” Andrew Lane says. “They explained what they had gone through – they said you should really look at it, it’ll move you away from the day-to-day hassles of operating a convenience store, and you’ll be able to help other people replicate what you’ve done. “We did some investigation into franchising and we thought, well, yeah, this system works and it works well. And we said, if we’re going to do that, then we’ve got to come up with a brand.” With the help and expertise of a Dunedin graphics designer, they came up with the Night ’n Day concept and worked over the following months to develop systems, including operations manuals. The other dairies were rebranded. Andrew Lane was worried about that, but he says there was no pushback. “There was none at all; it was all in our head!” Denise Lane puts a myth to bed that the blue-and-gold colours were a nod to their Otago heritage. Not at all, she says – they represent night and day. Matt Lane says there is no one “silver bullet” to compete against the supermarkets. “We need the foundations to be able to compete, whether it’s ourselves, whether it’s The Warehouse, whether it’s a new player coming in. More competition in this space helps us, even if we’re not the leader in it. “Do we want to grow? Yes, absolutely. The only way I can see it happening, though, is through the existing set-ups. “It’s very hard for any player to sit there and go, I’m going to open opposite a Pak’nSave and compete. It’s just not going to happen. There’s not the brand presence. There’s not the pockets to be able to do so. “We’ve grown organically over time. We’ve utilised the conversion of some Four Square stores to be able to do that. “To start creating competition, I think one of the most important things is removing the restraints of trade on the duopoly stores. If someone is currently operating a Four Square and they want to convert or go independent, there should be no barriers for them to do so.” Lane points out there’s not a lack of brands in New Zealand, it’s a commonality of ownership. “If you had Pak’nSave, Fresh Choice, New World, Woolworths and Four Square all competing against each other, it would actually be quite a competitive marketplace and they’d all try and take each other’s market share. “Whereas what we’ve got is quite a complacent duopoly where everyone just plays in their own space ... ” Lane also points out that for every day that the status quo remains, the duopoly grows stronger. “They’re opening new stores, they’re creating a better footprint, they’re cementing brand awareness. “Competitors are getting more and more nervous. It’s one thing to come out and go, we’re going to fix the supermarket industry – that happened in 2021. We’re now in 2025. “My discussion to MBIE [the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment] was there’s been nothing given to me that has improved my business and my ability to compete that wasn’t available to me in 2021. So we’re four years deep and I don’t have one tangible thing I can point to say, ‘This is helping me grow and succeed’. “But then you go, ‘Who is going to take the risk and why would they take the risk in the New Zealand market?’ Bit different in the States or Australia, given the population size and density. “But there needs to be a genuine motivation or genuine support to actually be able to encourage people to do that.” After first interviewing Lane in early August, I went back to him this week for an update. “No public announcement has benefited us to increasing competition, however what is encouraging is the key components that will improve competition are still being worked though and considered. “It is a wait-and-see, but there is still a lot of resource being allocated to increasing competition and I’m hopeful something will eventuate.” For all their success, Andrew and Denise Lane remain remarkably grounded – they are thrilled to see new generations of families in their franchise stores coming through the business. “I don’t know if I see it as a major success story,” Andrew Lane says. “I probably see it more as something that we just wanted to achieve and just kept on achieving it to grow.” He says when the business entered its franchising structure in 1990, it was with the intention of mentoring and “helping other people enjoy a business that we both thoroughly enjoyed, and to grow like that”. Denise Lane adds: “It was a case of long, hard hours. I guess we never thought it was going to get to where we are now. “It was like a Ferris wheel – when you got on the ride, you couldn’t get off it until it stopped. It has not stopped yet.” Disclaimer: Night ’n Day recently sponsored the NZ Herald’s Great NZ Road Trip project. This article is an independent editorial story.

Title: The Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones are a good choice if you want to buy a pair of earbuds almost exclusively for FPS games

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones are a specialist product that excels in its particular niche. With clear, directional sound, they’re perfect for competitive shooters like Counter-Strike 2 and might even give you a slight advantage over your competition, but the very flat bass and lack of in-built microphone make them a poor fit for more general gaming in other genres. Comfortable with a wide range of fit options Clear, high fidelity spatial sound Fantastic included case Perfect for FPS games Lacks microphone Flat overall tuning Why you can trust TechRadar We spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you're buying the best. Find out more about how we test. Sony makes it very clear who the Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones are for. Developed in partnership with eSports team Fnatic, these wired in-ear monitor (IEM) style earbuds are squarely aimed at competitive first-person shooter (FPS) players or those with a generous budget aspiring to become one. Retailing for $149.99 / £129 / AU$209, they’re competing closely with some of the best gaming earbuds like the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds, but don’t deliver the same all-round performance. If you’re looking for something that will elevate your experience in some of the best story games like God of War Ragnarok or Cyberpunk 2077, then these are certainly not it. The Sony Inzone E9 headphones are highly comfortable to wear and come with a superb carrying case, but the unapologetically flat sound is not going to help cutscenes or action sequences sound their best. The GameBuds, or even Sony’s own but more expensive Inzone Buds, are clearly better choices, but it's hard to fault the Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones for that, as that’s obviously not what they’re for. They really come into their own in a competitive first-person shooter (FPS) setting, pairing well with games like Counter-Strike 2, Valorant, and Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. Here, the lack of bass prevents explosion and gunfire sound effects from overwhelming your senses, allowing you to focus on the impressive directional reproduction instead. The direction of key audio cues like footsteps is crystal clear and remarkably easy to discern, potentially giving you an advantage over those without such specialised audio gear. The noise isolation is exquisite, thanks in no small part to the excellent seal of the headphones in your ears. A plethora of ear tips is included in the box to make it easy to find the perfect fit, and the included USB-C audio box stores EQ profile settings to make for a hassle-free setup every time - ideal if you’re competing in tournaments and need to access the same settings on a new machine. The Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones are priced at $149.99 / £129 / AU$209. This is a significant investment for a pair of wired gaming earbuds, with top wireless options like the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds costing not much more at $159.99 / £159.99 / AU$359. In addition to traditional gaming options, the Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones are also competing with the pricey in-ear monitor (IEM) earbuds favored by some FPS players. Here they come in at a very similar price to relatively affordable models from other big brands, such as the $149.99 / £129.99 Sennheiser IE 200. The Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones are made specifically for gaming, however, setting them apart from most of the market and helping to justify the price.

They can also be found at a wide range of retailers, such as Best Buy in the US or Amazon in the UK. In Australia they’re in stock at both JB Hi-Fi and Harvey Norman. Price $149.99 / £129 / AU$209 Weight 0.16oz / 4.7g Compatibility PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X and Series S, Xbox One, PC, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, mobile Connection type Wired (3.5mm / USB-C with audio box) Battery life N/A Features USB-C audio box, spatial audio Software Inzone Hub (PC) The Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones will have a familiar design if you’ve used a pair of IEM earbuds before. They’re lightweight, with rounded earbuds connected to a rigid section of cable that hooks around the top of your ears. Two colorways are available: black and white. Both are rather plain, but the abundance of Inzone logo branding printed on the earbuds does give them some character. Sony has definitely made some smart decisions when it comes to practicality, particularly with the length of the headphone’s cable. At 5.9ft / 1.8m, I found that it was more than long enough to comfortably reach my ears directly from my gaming PC’s 3.5mm headphone jack without the need for a cable extender. If you play on a console, you won’t have any issues hooking it up to your controller. I also appreciate the clear left / right marking that’s printed on each earbud, with the latter presented in a bright red that makes it easy to spot at a glance. A wealth of alternate ear tips come in the box, with a total of eight pairs to choose from. This includes standard silicone rubber ear tips and more foamy noise isolation earbud tips, both in four sizes (ranging from extra small to extra large). These are Sony’s widespread EP-EX10A and EP-NI1010 series tips - so replacements are easy to find if you need them later down the line. You get a USB-C audio box for use with PCs, too. This can be used to store settings from the compatible Inzone Hub software, like your desired equalizer pre-sets or custom profiles. It also lets you use a dedicated spatial sound mode, giving a good impression of sound in a 3D space, albeit at the cost of some overall fidelity. Between uses, you can store everything in the included carrying case that benefits from a surprisingly unique design. It’s divided into two compartments (one for the earbuds and the other for the audio box) joined together by a springy rubberized strip. The underside of the strip has little magnetic buttons, clipping down to keep everything in place. It might be a bit hard to imagine, but it works really well and is much more practical than the cheap pouches included with most earbuds these days. You also get a little Inzone-branded cable tidy, which is a neat bonus. The Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones have quite a flat sound profile out of the box, though this is presumably intentional. There’s not a lot of bass leading to quite an unexciting sound. Playing through some Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and Assassin’s Creed Shadows on PS5, key story moments felt a tad muted with the backing music missing the punch needed to really drive the emotion home. You can address this somewhat by tweaking the EQ settings in the compatible Inzone Hub software, but there’s only so much that you can do to increase the bass on hardware that’s not designed for it. For story-focused games, the results were never punchier than what you get out of the box with the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds and far less effective than even cheap wired over-ear sets like the Corsair HS50. This lack of bass makes a lot more sense when you jump into a competitive shooter like Counter-Strike 2. Flashbangs and grenades are no longer overwhelming and don’t threaten to deafen you if you’re playing at higher volumes. Gunfire is more subdued, helping you stay focused in firefights. The sound is crystal clear too, with an impressive level of directionality that makes it easy to track enemy movements using key sounds like footsteps. It’s very impressive, especially given how well the effect holds up in more frantic situations. Diving into an explosive match of Nuketown in Black Ops 7, I was able to accurately hear where nearby opponents were moving, even against the constant barrage of explosions conjured by grenades and killstreaks. The detail is excellent, which is borderline essential in tense extraction shooters such as Escape From Tarkov, where being able to discern the subtle snapping of a twig can often mean the difference between life and death. If you’re currently one of the many people devoting every waking moment to Arc Raiders, I could see the Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones being worth the asking price on this fact alone. Despite offering no active noise cancellation (ANC), the Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones do a commendable job of blocking out background noise by virtue of the strong seal of their fit. No, it’s not as effective as the ANC of the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds, but it is good enough to drown out household sounds and conversations with the volume set at a decent level. Although very uncommon in the IEM market, I’m also a little disappointed that the Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones don’t come with a small built-in microphone. It’s not a dealbreaker by any means, but it did mean that I had to reach for my Final VR2000 gaming earbuds when I wanted to chat with a friend while playing an Xbox Series X game. You’re a die-hard FPS fanIf you’re an FPS-head shopping for a pair of earbuds that you want to use exclusively to play the latest shooters, then the Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones could be a very worthwhile investment. You want every possible advantageThe directionality offered by the Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones is excellent and could mean the difference between a win and a loss in a competitive gaming setting. Pick up a pair if you want to ensure you have every possible advantage. You want a general use pairThe flat sound profile of the Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones means that they’re not ideal for general use.

I tried the earbuds with a wide selection of games, ranging from story-based titles such as Assassin’s Creed Shadows and Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater to some of the most popular FPS games like Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, Black Ops 7, Valorant, and Counter-Strike 2. Throughout my time with the earbuds, I compared their performance to my hands-on testing of a wide range of other gaming audio devices across the price spectrum.

A YOUNG MAN riding a bike from Ireland to Mount Everest has said he is doing it to “give back” to the Cork community which has supported him in the past. Daragh Cronin is hoping his mammoth journey will raise €30,000 for children’s wards at Cork University Hospital (CUH). Cronin said the charity was close to his heart and that he wanted the children of Munster to be able to receive “best-in-class paediatric care”. He also wanted to inspire children of the region to “chase their dreams”. Cronin’s journey will begin at Blackrock hurling club on 14 February and take him on a ferry from Rosslare to France, then trekking out over Europe and the Middle East before heading to Everest base camp. The 23-year-old Cork man is no stranger to long-distance bike journeys, having navigated the length of Africa by riding almost 13,500km between Morocco and South Africa “with zero prior cycling or camping experience”. He said that experience had inspired him to raise money for the hospital, through the CUH Charity. Advertisement He said he had been told his Africa trip would be “impossible” without experience. “I had guns pointed in my face. But 99% of the time, there was genuine hospitality and huge amounts of kindness,” he said. “I know these things are coming my way again but I trust my instinct, I was able to talk my way out of some hairy situations in Africa.” Now, with his trip to Everest, he said: “This time I want to do it for a cause. “I had crazy support when I went to Africa, half of Cork had my back, so I want to do something to give back this time.” The route will see him cross the tip of Oman, through Pakistan, India and Nepal before he reaches Mount Everest. “The record I’m trying to set is to hike the bike from a place called Lukla (in Koshi Province) to Everest base camp, and no Irish person has done that,” he said. “I will cycle as far as I can through Nepal, on to Lukla, and then put the bike over my neck and get to base camp.” To embed this post, copy the code below on your site 600px wide <iframe width="600" height="460" frameborder="0" style="border:0px;" src="https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/man-cycling-cork-mount-everest-cork-hospital-6923377-Jan2026/?embedpost=6923377&width=600&height=460" ></iframe> 400px wide <iframe width="600" height="460" frameborder="0" style="border:0px;" src="https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/man-cycling-cork-mount-everest-cork-hospital-6923377-Jan2026/?embedpost=6923377&width=400&height=460" ></iframe> 300px wide <iframe width="600" height="460" frameborder="0" style="border:0px;" src="https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/man-cycling-cork-mount-everest-cork-hospital-6923377-Jan2026/?embedpost=6923377&width=300&height=460" ></iframe> Access to the comments facility has been disabled for this user Create an email alert based on the current article

Title: Larry Page, Jeff Bezos, and Sergey Brin are close to joining the $300 billion club as tech fortunes soar

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The $200 billion club could soon be old hat as tech bosses ride the AI wave to new levels of wealth. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Alphabet cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin have seen their personal fortunes soar to over $250 billion each, putting all three men within striking distance of the $300 billion mark. For context, some of America's largest companies, including Costco, Netflix, Home Depot, Chevron, and Wells Fargo, have market capitalizations between $300 billion and $400 billion. Page and Brin were worth $281 billion and $261 billion, respectively, at Friday's close, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. They added $101 billion and $92 billion to each of their fortunes in 2025, making them the year's biggest wealth gainers after Elon Musk, and have gained another $12 billion and $11 billion each already this year. The key driver has been Alphabet shares soaring 65% last year, and rising a further 4.5% so far in 2026, as investors have grown more and more excited about the search-and-advertising titan's AI efforts.

Bezos' wealth has climbed more modestly, from $239 billion at the start of 2025 to $268 billion at Friday's close. That reflects a roughly 5% rise in Amazon's stock price last year, and another 6% rise this year, as investors wager the e-commerce giant's massive AI investments will start to pay off. Only Musk is richer than the trio; the Tesla and SpaceX CEO was worth $639 billion at Friday's close. He saw a $165 billion wealth jump last year, thanks to Tesla stock gaining 11% and SpaceX's valuation leaping from $350 billion to $800 billion. He's added an unmatched $19 billion to his name so far in 2026. Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison briefly surpassed Musk in wealth last September, when his fortune ballooned by a record $89 billion in a single day to $388 billion. Since then, investors have cooled on Oracle's AI prospects, pushing down Ellison's net worth to $251 billion at Friday's close. In total, there are 18 "centibillionaires," or individuals with at least a $100 billion net worth. As a group, they grew $708 billion richer last year, lifting their combined wealth to $3.6 trillion — a figure greater than Microsoft's market value. Within that elite group, there are seven people worth upward of $200 billion: Musk, Page, Bezos, Brin, Ellison, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Bernard Arnault, CEO of luxury giant LVMH. All of them except Arnault own huge stakes in some of the world's leading AI companies, which have soared in value as investors rush to buy their shares on news of buzzy partnerships, massive contracts, and sky-high growth forecasts. Advocates, including investors Ross Gerber and Kevin O'Leary, have told Business Insider that AI will supercharge productivity and boost corporate profits. But skeptics, like Michael Burry of "The Big Short" fame, have warned that tech giants are overinvesting in microchips, data centers, and other infrastructure in their scramble to win the AI race, creating a bubble that will burst disastrously down the line.

Title: Costco shoppers say these items basically make a membership pay for itself. We did the math.

Every time Dominick publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Costco is widely known for offering a wide selection of items at relatively low prices, but the club's $65 annual membership fee can deter some shoppers. Of course, the savings from occasional discounts on big-ticket items such as TVs, mattresses, and household appliances can easily exceed the cost of a year's membership, but those purchases are expensive and infrequent for most households. That leaves a lot of folks asking, as one curious customer on Reddit did, if Costco's discounts on the basics are enough to make a membership worth it. Doubters have good reason to be skeptical: retailers like Amazon, Walmart, and Target offer pretty competitive pricing on a lot of products, not to mention local grocery stores. And then there's pack sizes — a multi-year supply of aluminum foil might technically be a savings, but it probably isn't all that useful. Nor does it save money to get more of something perishable, like fresh fruit, only to throw a lot of it away. So, which product categories would actually make a Costco membership worth it? The question is increasingly important for US households who are focused on stretching their dollars, a consumer climate that has favored value-conscious retailers like Costco and Walmart. To find out, we rounded up several of the most popular responses from users in the Costco subreddit, along with a few additional ones based on our experience. We focused the list on more shelf-stable items that are typically consumed steadily throughout the year and visited a local warehouse to check prices. We then compared those prices to comparable offerings at traditional retailers, such as Walmart, Amazon, Target, and others. We also asked ChatGPT to estimate how much of each item a typical two-person household would likely use in a year and compared annual costs before discounts based on those quantities. With a few exceptions, we used prices from national brands that are widely available in many retailers for an apples-to-apples comparison. Price gaps can be even more competitive with store brand alternatives. While everything on the list was cheaper at Costco in-store, we calculated a payback score for each item to represent how much of the $65 membership fee is accounted for in relative savings after one year of shopping exclusively for that one item at Costco versus a conventional retailer. For example, a payback score of 100 means the savings and the fee are equal; a score of 200 means the savings were twice the fee, and a score of 50 means that half the fee was offset by that single product. Again, this analysis assumes no other purchases at Costco, which in our experience is extremely unlikely. Here's what we found, ranked from lowest to highest. A 38-pound bag of Blue Buffalo dog food sells for $65 at Costco, while the equivalent weight at a typical retailer would cost $111. At that rate, the membership fee would be offset in less than two purchases. Assuming 10 purchases a year, this item yields a payback score of 713, meaning the savings would cover the membership fee plus six times the cost of this item alone. Costco also sells highly rated dog food under its Kirkland Signature brand for $35 per 40-pound bag. A jumbo pack of Huggies diapers sells for $50 at Costco, while it would cost about $70 to get the same quantity (156 diapers) elsewhere. At that rate, savings on diapers alone would offset the membership fee in less than four purchases. Assuming one purchase a month yields a payback score of 373, meaning the savings would pay for the membership fee plus three times again for this item alone. Costco also sells diapers under its Kirkland Signature brand for a lower unit cost. Costco sells large containers of Similac for $55, which is about $13 less than it would cost to get the same product at a typical retailer. That means a membership fee would be offset after five purchases. Assuming one purchase a month yields a payback score of 240. Costco also sells generic baby formula at roughly half the unit cost of Similac, and Costco's offering is produced by the same leading supplier, Perrigo, that other major retailers use for their store brands. Costco sells 2-pound bags of Starbucks Pike Place roast coffee beans for $8.40 per pound, while typical retailers sell the same beans for about $12 per pound. At that rate, the savings would offset the membership fee after nine purchases, or 18 pounds of coffee. Assuming a household consumes 30 pounds of coffee a year yields a payback score of 166. Beyond Starbucks, Costco regularly features local coffee roasters and specially sourced beans from coffee-growing regions around the world at a lower cost than conventional retail. Costco has 2.5-pound blocks of Tillamook cheddar cheese for sale at $4 per pound, which is about $2.60 less per pound than typical retailers. Assuming a household uses about half a pound a week would amount to roughly 25 pounds a year. At these rates, a Costco membership would be almost equally offset by savings on cheese for a payback score of 102. Bacon is incredibly subjective. Still, the closest match found to this $4.33 per pound thick-cut bacon from Costco costs $8 per pound at a Midwestern grocery chain. At three pounds per package, that works out to a difference of $11, which would offset the membership fee after about six purchases. Assuming a household consumes 15 pounds of bacon a year would only account for five purchases for a payback score of 85. Costco sells chicken stock in packs of six quarts for $9 per pack — that's about a third of what it would cost to get the same amount of chicken stock in individual packs from a traditional retailer. Assuming three purchases a year (18 quarts total) gives a payback score of 83. Buying three pounds of Fage Total 2% Greek Yogurt at a conventional retailer would cost about $2.70 more than getting a tub from Costco. Assuming a household consumes about a pound of yogurt a week on average works out to 17 purchases a year, for a payback score of 71. One product Costco is known for is its comically large packs of paper products, like these 30-packs of Charmin toilet paper. Before discounts, the $33 pack works out to $1.10 per roll, which is 37 cents cheaper per roll than an equivalent pack bought elsewhere for $44. Assuming a household uses 10 rolls of toilet paper a month would mean four purchases a year, resulting in a payback score of 67. At $1.25 per pound, Costco's six-pack of Barilla pasta costs about $4 less than the same amount bought elsewhere. Assuming a weekly spaghetti night that uses one pound of pasta, this works out to nine purchases a year, resulting in a payback score of 54. Costco sometimes sells products in quantities that exceed a year's supply. Brita recommends changing its filters every two months, so this ten-pack would last well into next year. Still, Costco's pre-discount unit price of $4.50 is about $3 less than individual filters cost at conventional retailers. If purchased in equal quantities, the Costco pack would be about $30 less, for a payback score of 45. Cascade dishwasher pods cost about $7.30 less at Costco (before discounts) than an equivalent quantity bought at a typical retailer. If a household runs the dishwasher once a day, it would need to buy four packs in a year, which works out to a payback score of 45. Bear with us for this one. HVAC filters may seem boring, but manufacturers recommend replacing them at least every three months for optimal performance, and that can add up quickly. Costco's four-pack of 3M Filtrete air filters comes in at $28 less than the same product elsewhere. Most households will only need to buy one pack a year, though, so the payback score would be 43. It's also worth noting that there are less expensive types of HVAC filters on the market that Costco doesn't sell. The way Costco executives have described it, the company isn't looking to sell the cheapest available products; it wants to find the sweet spot that balances both high quality and low price. Opti-Free contact lens solution is about 25% less expensive by volume when purchased at Costco, compared with a traditional retailer. A household that uses about 12 ounces a month would need to buy four of these packs in the course of a year, with a payback score of 42. Shoppers can generally save money by switching from national brand medications to generics. A bottle of 365 tablets of cetirizine, better known as Zyrtec, costs $13.50 before discounts at Costco, while the same quantity from some other stores' brands can easily cost nearly $40. Still, 365 tablets are more than many households might need in a year, so a single purchase would make sense, resulting in a payback score of 40. Like medicines and meats, Costco also has low prices on cooking oils. This store-branded olive oil is about half the price per liter of a similar store-branded alternative at another retailer. Assuming a household uses three liters a year, yields a payback score of 25. This Arm & Hammer laundry detergent from Costco costs $14.89, or about $0.07 a load, versus $0.11 a load for the same product at other retailers. Assuming a household would go through two 200-ounce jugs in a year gives a payback score of 22. Like medications, generic vitamins from Costco can be extremely cost-effective — about 20% less than a similar product elsewhere. Two adults taking one daily multivitamin each would mean five purchases of these gummies in a year for a payback score of 18. Costco's $1.50 hot dog and soda combo gets a lot of attention. After all, it's not every day that an executive is explicitly warned to never raise the price. However, we crunched the numbers, and it turns out that roughly one Costco combo a month (14.4 a year, to be exact) would save you $65 compared to getting a similar meal from a chain like Portillo's or Nathan's. The bigger advantage is the jumbo pizzas for less than $10. By comparison, the largest pizza Domino's makes is 14 inches, which costs $15 and is actually about two-thirds the area of Costco's 18-inch. For the equivalent square inches of cheese or pepperoni pizza, Costco's offering is about $12 less, which means the annual fee would be offset with six pizzas. The math on the $5 rotisserie chickens is slightly less favorable to Costco, as many grocery stores offer a similar product. We'd love to hear about your best Costco picks.

After being laid off from his AI product manager role last September, one of Aman Goyal's first moves in a tough job market was to buy a book. With the 26-year-old's purchase of "Decode and Conquer," author Lewis Lin provided Goyal with access to a private Slack community with more than 20,000 professionals and job seekers. Over the next six weeks, Goyal conducted about 40 mock interviews through the community with fellow job seekers, some of them current product managers from major tech firms like Microsoft and Amazon. Goyal said the practice helped him prepare for interviews at T-Mobile, where he accepted an offer in November. "I think it's a good community for you to practice and also find some good network connections," said Goyal, who lives in Seattle. "The mock interviews helped with my confidence and just building that muscle of answering those questions spontaneously." Over the past year, I've spoken with more than a dozen people who have found ways to turn job searching into a group project. While networking is a time-tested job search strategy, these job seekers have taken it a step further: forming layoff support groups, joining exclusive networking circles, or turning to social media for feedback and encouragement.

They hoped the added support would help them break through in a market that has grown more challenging in recent years, with employers now hiring at one of the slowest rates since 2013.

Read more on the topic: When Sreeja Apparaju began looking for a job in the fall of 2022, she turned to her most trusted network — a close circle of four friends. After the University of California, Berkeley students realized they were applying to many of the same software engineering roles, they decided to join forces: trading job leads and recruiter contacts, swapping interview tips, and offering each other moral support along the way. Apparaju said the collaboration helped her land two interviews — and ultimately, a job offer. In one case, a friend told her about a role at Palantir they'd interviewed for and shared the recruiter's email. Within a week of reaching out, Apparaju received an online assessment that led to an interview with the company. In another instance, a friend's cousin provided a referral for a software engineering role at Snap — the company behind Snapchat — where Apparaju later received and accepted an offer. Her friends also found success, with one landing a role at Amazon and another joining Salesforce. "There can be a culture of keeping to yourself because you want to be ahead of people," said the 24-year-old, who lives in New York. "But in my experience, just sharing what you know and helping each other out was a lot easier and faster for all five of us." Looking for work alongside your closest friends is an experience that's arguably unique to a college senior. But outside that bubble, some job seekers are finding new ways to make their searches more collaborative. After 14 years at Microsoft, Deborah Henderson was laid off from her user researcher role last May. After learning the news, she messaged colleagues to see who else had been affected and added them to a group chat. Over the following weeks, more than a dozen people shared job leads, helped one another prepare for interviews, vented frustrations, and celebrated successes. "The fact that we could immediately build community was just incredibly helpful," she said. In August, Henderson accepted an offer for a user experience role at Meta — a position she learned about through her network and was referred for. In the absence of formal support networks, some job seekers have turned to social platforms for help. That includes career-focused sites like LinkedIn, where many have publicly announced layoffs or added "open to work" badges — as well as broader platforms like TikTok. Last May, Andrew Z. Chen was just weeks away from earning his computer science degree from the University of California, San Diego — and still didn't have a job lined up. So when Amazon invited him to interview for a software engineering role, he didn't want to waste the opportunity. His plan: hole up in his room to study — and document the process on TikTok to hold himself accountable. Chen said the videos — which racked up as many as 2.6 million views — drew a wide range of reactions. Some viewers were skeptical he could land the role given his limited prep time. But others, including people who'd interviewed at Amazon, offered encouragement and shared advice on the types of technical questions to expect. "The videos brought a lot of doubt from viewers, but thankfully also a lot of advice and encouragement," said Chen, who's in his 20s and lives in New York. Weeks later, he accepted the role at Amazon. Support from others navigating the job market has helped some job seekers stay motivated; however, many are still struggling to secure job offers. Last July, Sriram Ramkrishna was laid off from his developer relations role at Intel. He's struggled to find work, but said he's leaned on the support of former Intel colleagues who were laid off around the same time — and has helped some of them land interviews. "Many of us have been helping each other with our job searches — sharing opportunities and offering support," said Ramkrishna, who is in his 50s and lives in Portland, Oregon. "It feels like we're all looking out for each other." Beyond those connections, Ramkrishna said he's also leaned on private developer relations Slack channels and Discord servers he was invited to through conferences and past professional relationships. Some include job-specific channels where hiring managers post openings directly, he said. Apparaju said that while securing her role ultimately came down to how she performed in the interviews, the support of her friends helped her stay focused and confident throughout the process. "Having people who were cheering for you and also working hard with you was honestly so motivating," she said. "Every win for my friends felt like a personal win, and it was an inspiration to keep pushing to crack that one job offer." Apparaju knows she'll never be able to replicate her college experience of job hunting alongside close friends, but she believes her network can still be valuable. She recently mentioned some potential openings at her company to a friend — one example, she said, of how she can keep that spirit of support alive. "Given how tough this job market is, everybody and anybody is super happy to help," she said. Jump to

Title: The billionaire's social calendar for 2026: The must-attend events for the world's wealthiest business icons

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Like wildebeest migrating across the plains of East Africa or monarch butterflies flying thousands of miles south every winter, billionaires are a remarkably predictable breed. The world's nearly 3,000 billionaires follow a familiar annual circuit: cruising between vacation spots on superyachts, jetting to marquee sporting events, and suiting up for the same closed-door business conferences. "Birds of a feather flock together," Doug Gollan, the founder of Private Jet Card Comparison, told Business Insider. Each year, private jets congregate at events like The Masters or Super Bowl, he said. 2026 is no different. There will be the Davos and Sun Valley conferences, the FIFA World Cup, and the Monaco yacht show. In between, some billionaires may attend Art Basel or the Oscars. Here's a look at the 2026 billionaire calendar — and how much it would cost to join them. Business leaders and politicians gather at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, to kick off their year with policy discussions, networking, and, if time allows, some ski runs. This year's summit, which runs from January 19 to 23, is themed "A Spirit of Dialogue." While speakers have not been announced, regular attendees include BlackRock CEO Larry Fink (a cochair of the WEF), Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio, and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff. Access to the invite-only event can cost tens of thousands of dollars, and most of Davos' luxury hotels, such as the Steigenberger Grandhotel Belvédère and AlpenGold, are closed to the public. Apartment rental rates typically jump during the event, with nearby units commanding at least four figures a night. The surge pricing also applies to food. With most of the restaurants booked up for conference events, you may be left paying $43 for a hot dog. NFL teams are popular toys of the ultrarich: Walmart's Rob Walton has the Broncos, hedge fund manager David Tepper owns the Panthers, Clark Hunt and his siblings control the Chiefs, and so on. These billionaire owners — as well as billionaire fans and friends — flock to the Super Bowl, and this year's game on February 8 in Santa Clara, California, will be no exception. "The Super Bowl is always a draw. It's an excuse to see the best of the best in terms of sports, parties, and entertainment," Elisabeth Brown, client manager at travel and lifestyle concierge company Knightsbridge Circle, told Business Insider. Host committees and travel agencies curate luxury experiences for the wealthiest football fans, which can cost six figures and include chartered jets, five-star accommodations, and access to the field after the game. Throughout the weekend, there are VIP parties featuring celebrity guests and billionaire hosts, like Fanatics CEO Michael Rubin, who's become known for his star-studded annual Super Bowl bash. The most exclusive celebration of them all, though, is in the winning team's locker room. Just ask billionaire Jeffrey Lurie, whose Philadelphia Eagles snagged the trophy last year. As Hollywood and the tech world become increasingly intertwined, the Academy Awards and the various events surrounding it have become a magnet for billionaires. Oprah Winfrey took the stage at last year's ceremony to honor Quincy Jones, and the Vanity Fair Oscars Party drew Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez Bezos — Amazon produced nominee "The Nickel Boys" — as well as Alphabet cofounder Sergey Brin and Skims cofounder Kim Kardashian. Two other billionaires, Jay-Z and Beyoncé, typically throw a rival after-party at Chateau Marmont. This year's Oscars, which will be held on March 15, are likely to draw a similarly monied crowd. Larry Ellison, whose son David Ellison leads the storied movie studio Paramount, may make an appearance, as may billionaires Steven Spielberg, who produced in Best Picture hopeful "Hamnet," and James Cameron, director of "Avatar: Fire and Ash." The Masters Tournament, taking place from April 9 to 12 this year, kicks off the run of major professional golf championships and signals the start of spring for billionaires. Each year, hundreds of private aircraft land at the airports around Augusta. In past years, billionaires like former Nike CEO Phil Knight, hotelier Robert Rowling, and investor Herbert Allen Jr. have had their planes touch down. So has Tiger Woods, the only billionaire winner of The Masters. The tournament's venue, the famously exclusive Augusta National Golf Club in Georgia, counts a number of billionaires among its members. Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, Warren Stephens, David Ziff, and Stanley Druckenmiller have belonged to the club, Bloomberg reported in 2015. It's invite-only, and new members can only join when existing ones leave. The general public can spectate alongside some of the biggest names in business. Tickets for the Masters are available through a lottery system. Every year, the Milken Institute, a think tank founded by billionaire investor Michael Milken, hosts the Milken Global Conference in Los Angeles. Dubbed the Davos of the West Coast, Milken launched the summit in 1998 as a forum for discussions on economic and policy matters. While the program for this year's conference, running from May 3 to 6, has not been announced, last year, Henry Kravis, Bill Ackman, and Jensen Huang were among the billionaire speakers. The event isn't technically invite-only; members of the public can pay $35,000 to support the Institute as a council member and receive complimentary admission. While billionaires tend to spend June in the Hamptons or on yachts crisscrossing the Mediterranean, this year, many are expected to head to arenas across North America for the FIFA World Cup. "The big, big, big thing everybody's talking about and getting tickets for right now is the World Cup," Charlie Garcia, the founder of centimillionaire membership club R360, told Business Insider. The soccer competition, which takes place every four years, starts in June and runs through early July. Tickets for the final at MetLife Stadium start at over $9,000 on the resale market. While the tournament organizes teams by country, many star players are signed to clubs owned by billionaires, including Todd Boehly and Mark Walter's Chelsea, Stan Kroenke's Arsenal, and John Henry's Liverpool. There will likely be at least one billionaire on the field: Cristiano Ronaldo, who is set to play for Portugal. Private jets descend on the small town of Hailey, Idaho, every July for the Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference. Since 1983, boutique investment bank Allen & Co. — its president, Herbert Allen, is a billionaire himself — has hosted the event, which attracts the biggest and richest names in business, such as Jeff Bezos, Sam Altman, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and Warren Buffett. The conference has become known for the deals struck in between rounds of golf, guided hikes, and tennis matches. It's where Jeff Bezos snagged The Washington Post for $250 million in 2013 and where the seed for Disney's $19 billion acquisition of ABC was planted in 1995. Last year was no exception. David Ellison, the scion of billionaire Larry Ellison, met with Bari Weiss at the conference to discuss Paramount Skydance's potential purchase of The Free Press, The New York Times reported. In October, the $150 million deal was announced. The vacation-cum-business-meeting is invite-only and pretty much restricted to masters of the universe. Security is strict, with even the press walled off from most of the wheeling and dealing. Burning Man — the anticapitalist art and music festival in the Nevada desert — has been a rite of passage for the tech elite for decades. Google cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page are longtime Burners — the festival inspired the very first Google Doodle — as is Eric Schmidt, Google's former CEO. Facebook cofounders Dustin Moskowitz and Mark Zuckerberg, and Uber cofounder Garrett Camp have also attended. Even Ray Dalio, the billionaire hedge fund manager, joined in 2019. Last year's festival, marked by storms in Black Rock City, drew fewer billionaires than in previous years. Still, hundreds of private planes flew into Burning Man's temporary airport during the festival. The starting price to charter a plane through Burner Express Air was $18,000, one way. This year's festival runs from August 30 to September 7, with planning already underway by the Burning Man Project. The coastline of Monte Carlo, already a haven for the ultrawealthy, becomes crowded with superyachts at the end of September for the Monaco Yacht Show, where billionaires scope out their new toys. The 120-plus superyachts on display feature elevators, bars, spas, pools, gyms, hot tubs, and helipads, and were worth a combined $5 billion last year. Jet Skis and submersibles are popular add-ons. Last year's yacht show featured yachts owned by the likes of billionaires Denis O'Brien and Paul Fireman. The largest of them, Mar, is still listed for sale with an asking price of $230 million. In the past, yachts owned by billionaires such as Paul Allen, Steve Wynn, and Sergey Brin have been exhibited at the show. The Monaco Yacht Show is open to the public, with one-day passes starting at about $800. October presents numerous opportunities for the affluent to expand their art collections. First, the Frieze Art Fair and nearby Frieze Masters, held annually in London, focus on contemporary art and pre-21st-century art, respectively. In years past, collectors like Point72's Steve Cohen and Diamond titan Laurence Graff have been spotted there. Shortly after, across the English Channel, is Art Basel Paris, a relatively new addition to the art fair circuit. Last year's fair drew James Murdoch, an investor in Art Basel's parent company, as well as Delphine Arnault, the daughter of Bernard, and billionaire art collector J. Tomilson Hill. A painting by Gerhard Richter marked the fair's biggest sale, fetching $23 million, and several works sold for seven-figure sums. Exactly which moneyed collectors are behind specific purchases tends to be kept under wraps. While the VIP previews, when most billionaires are spotted, are invite-only, anyone can buy tickets to these shows themselves, which begin on October 14 with the Frieze fairs. Formula 1 has become a passion for billionaires over the past couple of decades. The racing business itself is owned by John Malone's Liberty Media, and nearly all of the teams are connected to billionaires through their ownership structures. The various Grand Prix attract these wealthy owners and fans thanks to the races and parties. Monaco maybe a marquee of the F1 calendar, but newer events like the Las Vegas Grand Prix increasingly draw big names. Last year's race drew billionaires, including Beyoncé and Jay-Z, Magic Johnson, Fanatics founder and CEO Michael Rubin, and Aston Martin Team owner Laurence Stroll. Three-day passes for the Sin City heat, which runs from November 19 to 21 this year, started at $400 for general admission last year but rose considerably for various seating and package options. While Aspen and Vail remain billionaire favorites over the holidays, no destination is as popular as St. Barts when it comes to ringing in the new year. Last year, superyachts owned by the likes of David Geffen, Jerry Jones, and Eric Schmidt were moored off the Caribbean island's coast. Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez Bezos were seen partying at a beach club. For those who don't stay on yachts, rooms at popular luxury hotels like Eden Rock and Cheval Blanc, owned by Bernard Arnault's LVMH, cost upward of $7,000 a night. "There is nothing mass-market about it," Winston Chesterfield, the founder of Barton, a consulting firm focused on luxury and the wealthy, told Business Insider. "It's impossible to be there unless you are really wealthy." Jump to

Daily Tech News 11 January 2026 Top Story Meta has signed long-term contracts with three suppliers for a total of 6GW of nuclear power for its datacenters. (Tech Crunch) Two of the partners are startups developing small modular reactors; the third, Vistra, is a major operator of traditional large non-modular reactors. Meanwhile researchers in China have managed to break the Greenwald limit on the number of alt accounts a single journalist can have agreeing with his posts before he screws up. (The Independent) Wait, I'm told in this context it's an empirical limit on sustained plasma densities in Tokamak-style fusion reactors. With this breakthrough, fusion power is now only nineteen years and twelve months away. Tech News It's a water heater! It's a Bitcoin miner! It's both! (Tom's Hardware) Given that the main cost of mining Bitcoin is the energy it takes - and disposing of the waste heat somehow - why not use it for, say, heating water? The Superheat H1 does exactly that. And if the price of Bitcoin collapses, it still heats your water. Can light move faster than the speed of light? (Science Daily) Some theories of loop quantum gravity predict small fluctuations of the speed of light in a vacuum. New experiments put an upper bound on how big those fluctuations could be, ruling out some of these theories. I call them theories rather than mere speculation because they actually made sufficiently robust predictions to be ruled out in the first place. A theory can be wrong, but it's not a theory if you can't test it. Can AI do your job? (MSN) If you're a computer programmer, or you otherwise work solely with words, possibly yes. If you do literally anything else, the best AI models currently succeed at 2.5% of human tasks. AMD will be launching socketed versions of the Ryzen 400 processor series later this year. (WCCFTech) Too late, really. Zen 6 will be out this year, and if you want integrated graphics it looks like Intel's Panther Lake is faster - though only if you are willing to go with a system with soldered memory. If you need conventional DIMM or SODIMM memory, you get models cut down from 12 GPU cores to just 4, which isn't beating anything. So maybe not too late, but underwhelming. And if you want dedicated graphics, you might need to buy soon. (Tom's Hardware) Nvidia GPUs are hardest hit so far, with reports of stock on all models running low in Germany and Japan. Since that was the first direct warning we had of the memory crunch (though in retrospect the signs were there months earlier) I bought myself a 9060 XT while they were in stock and on sale. Which as of time of writing, they still are. Asus and Gigabyte are putting 64MB of ROM on their new AM5 motherboards. (Tom's Hardware) Earlier AM4 motherboards often had as little as 16MB of ROM for the BIOS, which became a problem as AMD kept releasing new chips for the platform - Socket AM4 first appeared in 2016, even before Zen 1, and the most recent new processor for that socket, the 5500X3D, was launched in June last year. There were simply too many different models of compatible processors to fit all the necessary code into 16MB. With AM5 confirmed to support the upcoming Zen 6 chips later this year, and strongly hinted to support Zen 7 due in 2028, it will end up being an even longer-lived platform with more CPUs, so motherboard makers are fixing the problem before it arises. Amazon is using AI to sell your products on their store without you having to lift a finger. (Modern Retail) Also, without Amazon ever asking permission to do so. Also also, without Amazon bothering to sync the data properly from your online store so that they don't, for example, still list long-discontinued products for sale. Store owners are not happy. NBC News is intensifying a collapse of trust online. (NBC News) No, they didn't have a brief moment of self-awareness. They're blaming three years of AI for thirty years of their own failings. Musical Interlude In 2008, a young Suzuka Nakamoto was part of a short-lived trio called Karen Girl's - yes, with the misplaced apostrophe - and performed Over the Future, the opening theme for the anime series Zettai Karen Children. You may know her better as the lead singer for Babymetal. Thanks Mikeski for pointing me to the Babymetal cover of Over the Future. (I checked three different versions of the first clip.

Speaking of data centers and water... during a county zoning meeting this past summer, the county executives were attempting to slide a center into an area of farmland being rezoned. It was revealed that the center would consume millions of gallons of water a month. More than half the current residential consumption. And up to 50% of that water evaporated during the cooling process for the processors at the datacenter. The rest wasn't recycled due to contamination and would have to stored in evaporation ponds. Half of the local, residential water would be consumed by this thing. And there was no plan to increase the water capacity. I'll note that this was only part of the county. The entire county wouldn't end up dry.... just this one, little, undeveloped area nobody seemed to notice. Except for everyone who lived there.

Much more than that though, no. And I say that as a card carrying cro-magnon when it applies to food. I like simple dishes, casseroles, and one pot meals or cooked up in a skillet.

I had some "as a side" with a piece of fried fish and broccoli a couple nights ago. Surprisingly like southern comfort food.

I believe the US moved some military assets into the region about the same time we went after that "dark fleet" oil tanker in the N. Atlantic. So... earlier this week. We already struck ISIS in Syria for killing 2 National Guard (Iowa, I think) and their American interpreter, so assets are in the region. I just think the administration doesn't quite know what to do in Iran. It's not as simple as it would seem. Wheels within wheels....

The Bitcoin Spot ETFs have experienced a turbulent start to 2026 after early inflows were wiped out by four consecutive days of withdrawals. Amid Bitcoin’s recent failure to sustain its market recovery above $94,000, institutional investors are seeking more stability, especially considering the falling chances of a possible interest rate cut. According to data from the ETF tracker site, SoSoValue, the Bitcoin ETFs registered $681 million in net outflows in the first full trading week of 2026. Notably, these investment funds had commenced the year on a positive note, notching $697.2 million in net deposits on January 5 after an initial $471.1 million inflow on January 2. However, a combined net outflow of $1.378 billion between January 6-9 soon cleared out all positive momentum driven by the earlier inflows. In analyzing individual ETF performance, Fidelity’s FBTC experienced the largest net redemptions valued at $481.32 million. Following closely was Grayscale’s GBTC, which recorded a net outflow of $171.79 million. Meanwhile, Ark/21Shares’ ARKB also had a sizable contribution to the overall weekly negative performance as its withdrawals exceeded deposits by $45.34 million. Other Bitcoin Spot ETFs with red performances include Grayscale’s BTC, Bitwise’s BITB, and VanEck’s HODL, with net outflows varying between $3 million and $22 million. On the other side of the spectrum, BlackRock’s IBIT recorded the largest net inflow of the week, valued at $25.86 million. The BlackRock flagship crypto ETF continues to dominate with a remarkable cumulative net inflow of $62.41 billion, as its total net assets climb to $69.88 billion. Other ETFs with a positive performance include Invesco’s BTCO, Franklin Templeton’s EZBC, Valkyrie’s BRRR, and WisdomTree’s BTCW, which also attracted net investments between $1 million and $15 million. Meanwhile, Hashdex’s DEFI stood alone as the only ETF with a zero netflow. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin Spot ETFs boast a cumulative total net inflow of $56.40 billion. Meanwhile, their total net assets are valued at $116.86 billion and represents 6.48% of the Bitcoin market cap. Interestingly, the Ethereum Spot ETFs produced a similar weekly performance. Initial net deposits of $282.87 million between January 5 and January 6 were followed by three consecutive days of heavy withdrawals, resulting in a net outflow of $68.57 million. The Ethereum ETFs now hold $18.70 billion in total net assets, representing 5.04% ofthe Ethereum market cap. At the time of writing, Bitcoin exchanges hands at $90,422 as price movement over the last week resulted in a minor 0.17% decline. Meanwhile, Ethereum is valued at $3,088 while its daily trading volume crashes by 63.46%. Featured image from Forbes, chart from Tradingview For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Jensen Huang pitches Nvidia's self-driving car tech, sparks reaction from Tesla's Elon Musk

Jensen Huang took the stage at the CES trade show in Las Vegas this week to make the clearest pitch yet for Nvidia Corp.’s autonomous driving technology. In doing so, the chief executive officer’s vision for vehicles that can drive themselves edged into the terrain of major customers like Tesla Inc. and its boss, Elon Musk. Huang’s remarks sparked a widely watched — if notably polite — indirect multiday exchange between two of the most influential figures in technology. It also sharpened a central question about autonomous driving: Who controls the technology that will first power consumer cars that drive themselves — and later, driverless cars known as robotaxis that are designed for ride-hailing? And whose autonomous vehicle system is the best? On Monday, Huang used his speech to America’s largest technology showcase to extol the virtues of Nvidia’s Alpamayo, an open-source AI model designed to speed development of Level 4 self-driving cars. Such cars — consumer-owned at first, and robotaxi-fleet-operated later — can drive themselves without human supervision or intervention, within a defined geographic area. Nvidia described Alpamayo as part of a broader toolkit it offers automakers on top of open models. That includes powerful chips in data centers to train self-driving software, chips inside vehicles that serve as the car’s “brain” while it’s on the road, and simulation software that can create vast amounts of driving data virtually — reducing the time and cost of collecting it in the real world. The pitch was aimed squarely at automakers. Nvidia wants to supply the intelligence layer for autonomy without building the car itself, but it still wants to own the technology that makes self-driving a reality. “The world’s first thinking, reasoning, autonomous vehicle AI,” Huang proudly announced, clad in a shiny leather jacket. That afternoon, Musk weighed in with a post on X after a user shared a transcript of Huang’s remarks. “Well that’s just exactly what Tesla is doing ????,” Musk wrote. The Tesla CEO added that while getting a system to work most of the time is relatively easy, solving rare and unpredictable edge cases is far harder. The world’s richest man has claimed for a long time that Tesla’s system will have the ability to reason — that is, to make humanlike decisions in specific traffic scenarios — after a future software update. Earlier this week, his chief AI lieutenant, Ashok Elluswamy, responded to a question on X, saying a further update will come in the current quarter. Huang learned of Musk’s response during an interview with Bloomberg Television at CES the next day. “I wouldn’t be surprised,” Huang interjected, of Musk’s claim to already be doing reasoning. “I think the Tesla stack is the most advanced AV stack in the world.” Tesla shares ended the week higher by 1.6%, closing Friday at $445.01. New Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu, who has a buy rating and $600 price target on the stock, had posted on X earlier in the week after Huang’s keynote that Nvidia’s strategy “validated” Tesla’s approach. What drew broader attention was the tone of the aftermath of Nvidia’s announcement. The exchange went viral — not because of confrontation, but because of restraint. The two rivals acknowledged each other’s technical credibility while advancing different paths. Tesla and Nvidia already have an important, if uneven, relationship. Tesla relies heavily on Nvidia’s graphics processing units, or GPUs – the chips that go into data centers to train its autonomous driving software — even as it builds its own in-house chips to run that software inside vehicles. Musk has said Tesla will have spent roughly $10 billion cumulatively on Nvidia hardware for training by the end of this year, and that figure would be higher had it not worked on their own AI chips. Musk’s AI startup, xAI, is also a major Nvidia customer, and Nvidia is an investor in xAI. Tesla and Nvidia are fundamentally different companies. Tesla makes cars and builds the full system end to end. Nvidia builds chips and software that others use. Their technologies are different too. Tesla has a vision-only approach, just relying on camera sensors. The company argues it’s the most economically viable approach at scale and avoids sensors confusing one another. The rest of the industry argues other sensors like lidar, radar and ultrasonics are better because they are safer and offer redundancy. But the dynamic underscores how unsettled the autonomous vehicle arms race remains. Tesla depends on Nvidia to build its software, even as Nvidia builds tools that could one day help Tesla’s rivals catch up. Their paths to consumers also increasingly overlap. Tesla sells a suite of features known as Full Self-Driving (Supervised), a driver-assistance system that requires the vehicle’s operator to remain at the wheel and watch the road. The system Tesla sells is capable of point-to-point driving with navigation, lane changes and can react to traffic, but drivers still need to keep their eyes on the road. Nvidia now also sells advanced driver-assistance and autonomy platforms to automakers. And those automakers, in turn, pitch the systems to the consumer in the cars they sell. Market analysts see robotaxis as the endgame, with Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo currently leading real-world commercial deployments and Tesla arguing it can win at scale. Before that, the proving ground is consumer-owned cars that can do more of the driving themselves under owner supervision, serving as a bridge toward wider robotaxi adoption. Tesla sees FSD as a stepping stone to a future robotaxi network it would control. Nvidia is pursuing a similar endgame, working with other technology companies, automakers and ride-hailing companies, including Uber Technologies Inc. Again, Nvidia would just provide the tech and sees it powering fleets of robotaxis as soon as 2027. Tesla is betting on winning autonomy as a specialist, while Nvidia is positioning itself as the arms dealer, selling tools to the entire industry. Huang said the upcoming Mercedes-Benz CLA will be the first car to use Nvidia’s stack, offering FSD-like capabilities. Deliveries are starting in the US in early 2026 and rolling out to Europe and Asia later in the year. Moving beyond that would require additional hardware, such as lidar, adding cost and underscoring how far today’s cars remain from full autonomy. Musk returned to the subject of Nvidia’s push into autonomous vehicles on Tuesday, arguing it posed little immediate threat to Tesla’s efforts. The technology, he said, was far from being ready to be rolled out safely on a large scale. “The actual time from when FSD sort of works to where it is much safer than a human is several years,” he wrote on X, adding that meaningful competition for Tesla could still be at least five or six years away. For all the ambition on display, Huang and Musk have both effectively indicated that fully autonomous driving at scale is still a distant prospect. And for both, the nearer proving ground comes first: cars that can drive themselves part of the way. Who wins that phase may help decide who dominates the next one.

UPDATED 16:58 EST / JANUARY 10 2026 BREAKING ANALYSIS by David Vellante and David Floyer At CES 2026, Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Jensen Huang once again reset the economics of artificial intelligence factories. In particular, despite recent industry narratives that Nvidia’s moat is eroding, our assessment is the company has further solidified its position as the hardware and software standard for the next generation of computing. In the same way Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp. dominated the Moore’s Law era, we believe Nvidia will be the mainspring of tech innovation for the foreseeable future. Importantly, the previous era saw a doubling of performance every two years. Today Nvidia is driving annual performance improvements of five times, throughput of 10 times, and driving token demand of 15 times via Jevons Paradox. The bottom line is that ecosystem players and customers must align with this new paradigm or risk a fate similar to that of Sisyphus, the beleaguered figure who perpetually pushed a rock up the mountain. In this Breaking Analysis, we build on our prior work from Episode 300 with an update to our thinking. We begin with an historical view, examining the fate of companies that challenged Intel during the personal computer era and the characteristics that allowed a small number of them to survive and ultimately succeed. From there, we turn to the announcements Huang (pictured) made at CES and explain why they materially change the economics of AI factories. In our view, these developments are critical to understanding the evolving demand dynamics around performance, throughput and utilization in large-scale AI infrastructure. We close by examining the implications across the ecosystem. What does this mean for competitors such as Intel, Broadcom Inc., Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and other silicon specialists? How should hyperscalers, leading AI research labs, original equipment manufacturers and enterprise customers think about AI strategy, capital allocation and spending priorities in light of these shifts? Let’s begin with a historical view, looking back at the companies that challenged Intel during the 1980s and 1990s. IBM was the dominant force early on, but it was far from the only player that attempted to compete at the silicon level. A long list of RISC vendors and alternative architectures emerged during that period – including Sun Microsystems Inc. – many of which are now footnotes in computing history. The slide above highlights this reality. The companies shown in green are the ones that managed to make it through the knothole. The rest did not. The central reason comes down to the fact that Intel delivered relentless consistency with predictable, sustained improvement in performance and price-performance, roughly doubling every two years. Intel never took its foot off the pedal. It executed Moore’s Law as an operational discipline as well as a technology roadmap. As a result, competitors simply could not keep pace. Even strong architectural ideas from industry leaders were overwhelmed by Intel’s scale, manufacturing advantage, volume economics and cadence. One point worth noting. Apple, while not always viewed as a direct silicon competitor during that era, ultimately won by controlling its system architecture and, later, by vertically integrating its silicon strategy. The broader takeaway is fundamental in our assumptions for the rest of this analysis. Specifically, in platform markets driven by learning curves, volume and compounding economics, dominance is not just about having a great product. Success requires sustained momentum over long periods of time, while competitors exhaust themselves trying to catch up. Let’s now double down on the companies that actually survived the Intel-dominated PC era. The list below is instructive in our view. AMD, Acorn (the original Arm), Apple Inc., Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Intel and Nvidia. Each followed a different path, but they share a common underlying characteristic which is volume. AMD’s survival traces directly back to IBM’s original PC strategy. IBM mandated a second-source supplier, forcing Intel to share its instruction sets. AMD became that second source, and no other company gained comparable access. That structural advantage persisted for decades and allowed AMD to remain viable long after other x86 challengers disappeared. ARM, TSMC and Apple fundamentally changed the prevailing belief – stated by AMD CEO Jerry Sanders— that “real men own fabs.” These companies proved that separating design from manufacturing could be a winning strategy. Apple brought massive system-level volume. TSMC rode that volume to drive down costs, ultimately achieving manufacturing economics that we estimate to be roughly 30% lower than Intel’s. Nvidia followed a similar fabless path, pairing architectural leadership with accelerating demand. Intel itself was the original volume powerhouse, benefiting from the virtuous cycle created by the Wintel combination. That volume allowed Intel to outlast RISC competitors and dominate the PC era. But in the current cycle, Intel has lost ground to Arm-based designs, Nvidia and TSMC – each of which now rides on steeper learning curves. The takeaway is that volume is volume is fundamental to dominance. Not just volume in a single narrow segment, but volume across adjacent and synergistic markets that feed the same learning curves. AMD’s volume was initially forced by IBM’s PC division mandating a second source to Intel. Apple’s volume is consumer-driven. TSMC’s volume is manufacturing-led. Nvidia’s volume is now accelerating faster than any of them in this era. In our view, Nvidia is positioned to be the dominant volume leader of the AI era by a wide margin. And as history shows, once volume leadership is established at scale, it becomes extraordinarily difficult for competitors to catch up without other factors affecting the outcome (e.g. self-inflicted wounds or things out of the leader’s control such as geopolitical shifts). Nvidia’s CES announcements were visionary and focused largely on the emerging robotics market. In this analysis, however, we focused in on the core of Nvidia’s systems business. In our view, what Nvidia announced in this regard exceeded even our optimistic expectations. As we’ve stressed often, Nvidia is remarkable, not only because of a single chip, but because of the scope of what it delivers. Specifically, Huang led this part of his keynote with a six-chip, full-system redesign built around what Huang consistently refers to as extreme co-design. The chart above shows the next generation innovations from Nvidia, including Vera Rubin, named in homage to the astronomer whose work on galactic rotation curves led to the discovery of dark matter. Vera is the CPU. Rubin is the GPU. But focusing only on those two components misses the broader story. Nvidia simultaneously advanced every major silicon element in the system including NVLink based on InfiniBand, ConnectX nics and Spectrum-X for Ethernet, BlueField DPUs and Spectrum-X Ethernet with co-packaged optics. A few years ago, the prevailing narrative suggested that Ethernet would undercut Nvidia’s proprietary networking position, the underpinning which was Infiniband (via the Covid-era Mellanox acquisition). Nvidia was undeterred and responded by building Spectrum-X. Today, Jensen Huang argues that Nvidia is the largest networking company in the world by revenue, and the claim appears credible. What’s striking is not the line extension itself, but the speed and completeness with which Nvidia executed it. The deeper point lies in how Nvidia defines co-design. While the company works closely with customers such as OpenAI Group PBC, Google LLC with Gemini and xAI Corp., the co-design begins internally – across Nvidia’s own portfolio. This generation represents a ground-up redesign of the entire machine. Every major chip has been enhanced in coordination, not in isolation. The performance metrics are astounding. The GPU delivers roughly a fivefold performance improvement. The CPUs see substantial gains as well. But equally important are the advances in networking – both within the rack and across racks. Each subsystem was redesigned together to maximize end-to-end throughput rather than optimize any single component in isolation. The result is multiplicative, not additive. While individual elements show performance gains on the order of five times, the system-level throughput improvement is closer to an order of magnitude. That is the payoff of extreme co-design – aligning compute, networking, memory and software to minimize single bottlenecks that limit the overall system. In our view, this marks a decisive shift in how AI infrastructure is built. For quite some time we’ve acknowledged that Nvidia is no longer shipping chips. It is delivering tightly integrated systems engineered to maximize throughput, utilization, and economic efficiency at the scale required for AI factories. That distinction is profound as competitors attempt to match not just component performance, but the learning-curve advantages that emerge when volume, architecture and system-level design reinforce each other. While Jensen has pointed out that Nvidia is a full systems player, the point is often lost on investors and market watchers. This announcement further underscores the importance of this design philosophy and further differentiates Nvidia from any competitor. A critical point that becomes more clear from Nvidia’s announcements is the chip is not the correct unit of measurement. The system is. More precisely, the rack – and ultimately the token output per rack – is what defines performance, economics, and value. Each rack integrates 72 GPUs along with CPUs and high-speed interconnects that bind the system together. Compute density is critical, but so is the ability to move data with minimal jitter and maximum consistency – within the rack, across racks, and across entire frames. Nvidia has dramatically increased memory capacity into the terabytes, enabling GPUs to operate in tight coordination without stalling. The result is coherent execution at massive scale. These systems are designed to scale up, scale out, and scale across. When deployed at full factory scale, they operate not in dozens or hundreds of GPUs, but in hundreds of thousands – eventually up to a million GPUs working together. As scale increases, so does throughput. And as throughput increases, the economic value of the tokens generated accelerates. This is where the numbers compound to create the flywheel effect. Roughly five times performance improvement at the component level combines with roughly ten times throughput at the system level. Together, they drive what we believe is an estimated 15-times increase in demand, as lower cost per token unlocks entirely new classes of workloads. This is Moore’s Law on triple steroids – and it explains why annual value creation rises so sharply. The Jevons Paradox applies here. As the efficiency of token generation improves, total consumption rises. As we’ve stressed, the value shifts away from static measures of chip performance, toward dynamic measures of system utilization and output economics. The faster tokens can be generated, the more economically viable it becomes to deploy AI at scale, and the more demand expands. Networking is central to this equation. Nvidia’s long-term investment in Mellanox – once dismissed by many as a bet on a dying technology – now looks prescient. InfiniBand continues to grow rapidly, even as Ethernet demand also accelerates. Far from being a bottleneck, networking has become a core enabler of system-level performance. The takeaway is that AI infrastructure economics are now defined at the rack and factory level, not at the chip level. Nvidia’s advantage lies in designing systems where compute, memory, networking and software operate as a single, tightly coordinated machine. That is where throughput is maximized, token economics are transformed, and the next phase of AI factory value is being created. Huang presented three critical metrics on a single slide to show training throughput, AI factory token throughput and token cost. Together, they tell a story about where AI infrastructure economics are headed. For clarity, we break this into two parts as shown below: training on the left, factory and inference throughput on the right. The training chart shows time-to-train measured in months for a next-generation, ultra-large model. The takeaway is eye opening. The Rubin platform reaches the same training throughput as Blackwell using roughly one quarter of the GPUs. As we pointed out earlier, this is not simply about faster chips. It reflects dramatic gains in efficiency at scale – reduced synchronization overhead, fewer memory stalls, lower fabric contention, and shorter training cycles overall. The implications are notable. Capital required per model run drops materially. Customers can run more experiments per year and iterate faster. Training velocity becomes a competitive advantage in itself, not just a cost consideration. In our view, this is one of the most under-appreciated dynamics in the current AI race. The factory throughput chart above on the right, tells an equally important story. As workloads shift from batch inference toward interactive, agent-driven use cases, throughput characteristics change dramatically. Tokens per query increase. Latency sensitivity rises. Under these conditions, Blackwell’s throughput collapses as shown. Meanwhile, Rubin sustains performance far more effectively and delivers approximately 10 times more tokens per month at the factory level. This is the future workload profile of AI factories – real-time, interactive, agentic and highly variable — not static batch inference. Rubin is designed for this moment. The value is not just in peak performance, but in sustained throughput under real-world conditions. Taken together, these charts explain why Nvidia’s advantage continues to widen. Training and inference are converging in economic importance. Faster training reduces capital intensity and accelerates innovation. Higher factory throughput lowers token costs while expanding demand. This combination resets expectations for performance, efficiency and scalability. In our view, many observers continue to underestimate both the pace at which Nvidia is moving and the magnitude of the gap it is creating. Comparisons to alternative accelerators – whether Google TPUs, AWS Trainium or others – miss the system-level reality being demonstrated by Nvidia. The new standard is not raw compute. It is training velocity, sustained factory throughput and token economics at scale. And on those dimensions, Nvidia is setting the bar. The final piece of the equation that we’ll dig into is cost. And this is where the implications become overwhelming. In our view, it’s what matters most. The combination of higher throughput and system-level efficiency drives cost per token down by roughly an order of magnitude. Huang framed it in his keynote saying these systems may consume more power, but they do vastly more work. When throughput rises by 10 times and cost per token falls to one-10th, the economic profile of AI factories fundamentally resets. What’s striking is the pace. This is not the 18- to 24-month cadence historically associated with Moore’s Law. These gains are occurring on a 12-month cycle. Moore’s Law transformed the computing industry for decades, lifting productivity across silicon, software, storage, infrastructure and applications. What we are seeing now is an even more aggressive curve – orders-of-magnitude improvement compressed into a single year. There are real pressures behind this progress. Demand for advanced chips, memory and interconnects is intense, pushing up component costs. Nvidia has secured premium access across that supply chain. But from the perspective of an AI factory operator, the math dominates everything else. If cost per token falls while throughput rises dramatically, the earning power of the factory increases materially. This is especially critical in a power-constrained world as we described last August when we explored the “New Jensen’s Law.” Hyperscalers and neoclouds alike are limited by available power, not just capital. Under those constraints, Jensen’s tongue-in-cheek “law” applies – buy more, make more; or buy more, save more. The ability to extract significantly more work from the same infrastructure — or achieve the same output with far less — translates directly into financial operating leverage. The example Jensen cited makes the point concrete. In a $50 billion, gigawatt-scale data center, improving utilization by 10% produces an enormous $5 billion benefit that flows straight to the income statement. That is why networking, in this context, becomes economically “free.” The incremental cost is dwarfed by the utilization gains it enables. This is ultimately why Nvidia’s position is so strong. The advantage is not just technical – it’s economic. Nvidia is operating on a steep learning curve, reinforced by volume, system-level co-design and accelerating efficiency gains. When cost per token collapses at this rate, demand expands, utilization rises and the economics compound. That dynamic is what defines leadership in this era. We’ll close by translating the CES announcements into competitive implications across multiple classes of players, including vendors that are simultaneously customers. The common theme is that the unit of competition has shifted from chips to systems, racks and ultimately token economics. That shift changes the survivability economics for incumbents, the opportunity for specialists, and the urgency of customer strategies. In our view, it’s effectively game over for Intel’s historical monopoly and leadership position. The more interesting question is whether Intel can remain a meaningful CPU provider in an AI factory world – and the Nvidia/Intel interoperability move is notable in that context. The historical context is relevant. Nvidia has wanted deeper access to x86 since the late 1990s but was never allowed. The new arrangement changes the structure and it enables a configuration where Intel CPUs and Nvidia GPUs can operate within the same frame. It’s not a fully unified architecture, but it is sufficient for most of the work, and it creates a practical path for Intel CPUs to remain present in these systems. It also gives Intel a meaningful level of access to CUDA-based environments – short of “full access,” but still consequential. The net effect should improve Intel connectivity in these deployments, keep Intel in the CPU game for this cycle, and increase the volume of Nvidia systems available to the market. In other words, it can act as a viable bridge from the old to the new, which is good for customers. We do want to flag a key risk to any optimistic Nvidia scenario – a Taiwan geopolitical disruption. If China takes over Taiwan, there are multiple potential outcomes – from continuity with a new lever for China, to a more disruptive scenario if that lever is pulled. Either would ripple through sentiment around Nvidia and could increase perceived strategic value for Intel. But the hard reality is Intel still has to close the manufacturing and execution gap with TSMC, and that is not something any company can leapfrog overnight. AMD has executed well against Intel in x86. But the competitive target has shifted. x86 is mature and its curve has flattened, which made the timing right for AMD’s ascdendency and for hyperscalers to pursue alternatives such as AWS’ Graviton. AMD is now taking on a very different animal – a leader moving on a steep learning curve with compounding system-level advantages. In our view, the core issue is speed. AMD will struggle to move fast enough to close a gap defined by 12-month cycles and system-level throughput economics. One practical implication is that AMD should pursue a deal structure similar to Intel’s – something that secures volume on one side – while focusing aggressively on the edge. Data center CPU revenue is meaningful for Intel and AMD, but expanding volume there will be difficult, and there is real risk of decline. The edge remains wide open, and that’s where focus should go in our opinion. At the same time, it’s important to recognize that Nvidia is also targeting the edge – autonomous vehicle libraries were highlighted and robotics were put on stage at CES and it’s a major focus of the company. The edge is open, but it won’t be uncontested. There is ample room for specialists that avoid direct, frontal competition with Nvidia. The AI factory buildout is forecast to be enormous – large enough that niche and adjacency strategies can still create meaningful businesses, particularly around factories and the edge. Two examples we cite: But the strategic point is that latency is a real lever in inference economics, and specialists that win on latency can matter – especially at the edge. Broadcom is best understood as a critical supplier to hyperscalers, OEM ecosystems, mobile players and virtually all forms of connectivity. Broadcom has a custom silicon engine that manages back-end execution with foundries and manufacturing partners. Its business is diversified and structurally important, and we do not view it as going away by any means. Broadcom has deep engineering talent and a diversified business with exceptional leadership. The more controversial question is whether hyperscalers should continue investing in alternative accelerators such as TPUs, Trainium and other ASIC strategies – as a long-term path to compete with Nvidia. Google has deep history and real technical credibility with TPUs. But the argument here is that this is now a different business environment. Google must protect search quality and accelerate Gemini. If internal platform choices limit developer access to CUDA and the best available hardware/software improvements, the risk is that Gemini’s development velocity slows. If model iteration takes multiples longer, that becomes strategically dangerous. Our view is that TPUs have reached a ceiling in this context – not because they can’t improve, but because they cannot match Nvidia’s volume-driven learning curve and system-level economics, particularly with networking as scale. A related point, made by Gavin Baker using a simplified economics example is if Google’s TPU program represents a $30 billion business, and it sends a large portion of value to Broadcom (about $15 billion), one might argue for vertical integration. The counterargument here is that even if it’s financially possible, it may be strategically irrational if it slows Gemini’s iteration speed. The core thesis is that Google should prioritize model velocity over accelerator self-sufficiency. The same logic extends to Trainium. AWS’ Graviton playbook worked because it targeted a mature, flattening x86 curve. That is not the environment in accelerators today. The pace is too fast, the curves are too steep, and the system complexity is too high. Will AWS, Google and even Microsoft continue to fund alternatives to Nvidia? Probably as use cases will emerge for more cost effective platforms. But the real strategic advantage for hyperscalers in our view lies elsewhere, especially as they face increasing competition from neoclouds. We position four frontier labs as the primary contenders: OpenAI, Anthropic PBC, Google and xAI Corp.’sGrok, with Meta Platforms Inc.treated as a second tier (with the caveat that it’s unwise to count Zuckerberg out). Despite persistent negative narratives around OpenAI — especially around financing structure and commitments — our view is that pessimism may be misplaced. The reasoning is as follows: In short, we see the winners as OpenAI the most likely overall winner in the center, with Anthropic as the second player, and Grok highly likely to do well at the edge. Elon could also compete strongly at the edge while he backed away from the idea of building his own data center chips. An additional allocation nuance is labs aligned with Nvidia (OpenAI and X.ai) may have a better path to “latest and greatest” allocations than those pursuing tighter coupling with alternative accelerator strategies. For OEMs like Dell, HPE, Lenovo, and Supermicro, the opportunity is primarily executional. In other words, get the latest platforms, package them, deliver them, and keep them running reliably without thermal or integration failures. Demand is enormous, supply is constrained, and this is not a zero-sum game. For now they can all do well. The key point is that as long as the market remains supply-constrained, anything credible that can be produced will be consumed. That reality can justify multiple silicon suppliers from the ecosystem – even if the long-run competitive curve still favors Nvidia. On the customer side, we challenge a widely repeated narrative to “get your data house in order before you spend on AI.” The view here is that this sequencing can be backwards. Our modeling suggests that over a multi-year period (for example, five years), getting onto the AI learning curve earlier can generate substantially more value than delaying until data is “clean.” Even if data isn’t pristine, organizations can choose a dataset, apply AI to improve it, and compound learning rather than waiting. Two additional implications are highlighted below: Our strategy recommendation is to optimize for speed and learning. Put token capacity close to data (latency matters), use tokens to improve access and data quality, then iterate through AI projects quickly – one project, learn, then the next, building a flywheel. The emphasis should be on starting from value and using intelligence to improve the systems, rather than spending years trying to perfect data first. In our view, the defining lesson of this analysis is that AI is no longer a contest of individual chips, models, or even vendors – it is a contest of learning curves, systems and economics. History shows that in platform transitions, leadership accrues to those who achieve volume, sustain execution and convert efficiency gains into expanding demand. That dynamic shaped the PC era, and it is repeating at far greater speed in the AI factory era. What differentiates this cycle is the compression of time. Improvements that once unfolded over decades are now occurring in 12-month intervals, resetting cost structures and forcing strategic decisions faster than most organizations are accustomed to making them. The implications go across silicon providers, hyperscalers, AI labs, OEMs and enterprises alike. For customers, the message is value will accrue to those who get onto the AI learning curve early, focus on throughput and token economics, and build momentum through rapid iteration rather than waiting for perfect conditions. For vendors, survival will depend less on clever alternatives and more on whether they can stay on the steepest curves without slowing themselves down. This transition will not be linear, and it will not be evenly distributed. But the direction is clear in our view. AI factories are becoming the economic engine of the next computing era, and the winners will be those who treat AI not as a feature or experiment, but as the core operating model of their business.

UPDATED 16:58 EST / JANUARY 10 2026 BREAKING ANALYSIS by David Vellante and David Floyer At CES 2026, Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Jensen Huang once again reset the economics of artificial intelligence factories. In particular, despite recent industry narratives that Nvidia’s moat is eroding, our assessment is the company has further solidified its position as the hardware and software standard for the next generation of computing. In the same way Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp. dominated the Moore’s Law era, we believe Nvidia will be the mainspring of tech innovation for the foreseeable future. Importantly, the previous era saw a doubling of performance every two years. Today Nvidia is driving annual performance improvements of five times, throughput of 10 times, and driving token demand of 15 times via Jevons Paradox. The bottom line is that ecosystem players and customers must align with this new paradigm or risk a fate similar to that of Sisyphus, the beleaguered figure who perpetually pushed a rock up the mountain. In this Breaking Analysis, we build on our prior work from Episode 300 with an update to our thinking. We begin with an historical view, examining the fate of companies that challenged Intel during the personal computer era and the characteristics that allowed a small number of them to survive and ultimately succeed. From there, we turn to the announcements Huang (pictured) made at CES and explain why they materially change the economics of AI factories. In our view, these developments are critical to understanding the evolving demand dynamics around performance, throughput and utilization in large-scale AI infrastructure. We close by examining the implications across the ecosystem. What does this mean for competitors such as Intel, Broadcom Inc., Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and other silicon specialists? How should hyperscalers, leading AI research labs, original equipment manufacturers and enterprise customers think about AI strategy, capital allocation and spending priorities in light of these shifts? Let’s begin with a historical view, looking back at the companies that challenged Intel during the 1980s and 1990s. IBM was the dominant force early on, but it was far from the only player that attempted to compete at the silicon level. A long list of RISC vendors and alternative architectures emerged during that period – including Sun Microsystems Inc. – many of which are now footnotes in computing history. The slide above highlights this reality. The companies shown in green are the ones that managed to make it through the knothole. The rest did not. The central reason comes down to the fact that Intel delivered relentless consistency with predictable, sustained improvement in performance and price-performance, roughly doubling every two years. Intel never took its foot off the pedal. It executed Moore’s Law as an operational discipline as well as a technology roadmap. As a result, competitors simply could not keep pace. Even strong architectural ideas from industry leaders were overwhelmed by Intel’s scale, manufacturing advantage, volume economics and cadence. One point worth noting. Apple, while not always viewed as a direct silicon competitor during that era, ultimately won by controlling its system architecture and, later, by vertically integrating its silicon strategy. The broader takeaway is fundamental in our assumptions for the rest of this analysis. Specifically, in platform markets driven by learning curves, volume and compounding economics, dominance is not just about having a great product. Success requires sustained momentum over long periods of time, while competitors exhaust themselves trying to catch up. Let’s now double down on the companies that actually survived the Intel-dominated PC era. The list below is instructive in our view. AMD, Acorn (the original Arm), Apple Inc., Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Intel and Nvidia. Each followed a different path, but they share a common underlying characteristic which is volume. AMD’s survival traces directly back to IBM’s original PC strategy. IBM mandated a second-source supplier, forcing Intel to share its instruction sets. AMD became that second source, and no other company gained comparable access. That structural advantage persisted for decades and allowed AMD to remain viable long after other x86 challengers disappeared. ARM, TSMC and Apple fundamentally changed the prevailing belief – stated by AMD CEO Jerry Sanders— that “real men own fabs.” These companies proved that separating design from manufacturing could be a winning strategy. Apple brought massive system-level volume. TSMC rode that volume to drive down costs, ultimately achieving manufacturing economics that we estimate to be roughly 30% lower than Intel’s. Nvidia followed a similar fabless path, pairing architectural leadership with accelerating demand. Intel itself was the original volume powerhouse, benefiting from the virtuous cycle created by the Wintel combination. That volume allowed Intel to outlast RISC competitors and dominate the PC era. But in the current cycle, Intel has lost ground to Arm-based designs, Nvidia and TSMC – each of which now rides on steeper learning curves. The takeaway is that volume is volume is fundamental to dominance. Not just volume in a single narrow segment, but volume across adjacent and synergistic markets that feed the same learning curves. AMD’s volume was initially forced by IBM’s PC division mandating a second source to Intel. Apple’s volume is consumer-driven. TSMC’s volume is manufacturing-led. Nvidia’s volume is now accelerating faster than any of them in this era. In our view, Nvidia is positioned to be the dominant volume leader of the AI era by a wide margin. And as history shows, once volume leadership is established at scale, it becomes extraordinarily difficult for competitors to catch up without other factors affecting the outcome (e.g. self-inflicted wounds or things out of the leader’s control such as geopolitical shifts). Nvidia’s CES announcements were visionary and focused largely on the emerging robotics market. In this analysis, however, we focused in on the core of Nvidia’s systems business. In our view, what Nvidia announced in this regard exceeded even our optimistic expectations. As we’ve stressed often, Nvidia is remarkable, not only because of a single chip, but because of the scope of what it delivers. Specifically, Huang led this part of his keynote with a six-chip, full-system redesign built around what Huang consistently refers to as extreme co-design. The chart above shows the next generation innovations from Nvidia, including Vera Rubin, named in homage to the astronomer whose work on galactic rotation curves led to the discovery of dark matter. Vera is the CPU. Rubin is the GPU. But focusing only on those two components misses the broader story. Nvidia simultaneously advanced every major silicon element in the system including NVLink based on InfiniBand, ConnectX nics and Spectrum-X for Ethernet, BlueField DPUs and Spectrum-X Ethernet with co-packaged optics. A few years ago, the prevailing narrative suggested that Ethernet would undercut Nvidia’s proprietary networking position, the underpinning which was Infiniband (via the Covid-era Mellanox acquisition). Nvidia was undeterred and responded by building Spectrum-X. Today, Jensen Huang argues that Nvidia is the largest networking company in the world by revenue, and the claim appears credible. What’s striking is not the line extension itself, but the speed and completeness with which Nvidia executed it. The deeper point lies in how Nvidia defines co-design. While the company works closely with customers such as OpenAI Group PBC, Google LLC with Gemini and xAI Corp., the co-design begins internally – across Nvidia’s own portfolio. This generation represents a ground-up redesign of the entire machine. Every major chip has been enhanced in coordination, not in isolation. The performance metrics are astounding. The GPU delivers roughly a fivefold performance improvement. The CPUs see substantial gains as well. But equally important are the advances in networking – both within the rack and across racks. Each subsystem was redesigned together to maximize end-to-end throughput rather than optimize any single component in isolation. The result is multiplicative, not additive. While individual elements show performance gains on the order of five times, the system-level throughput improvement is closer to an order of magnitude. That is the payoff of extreme co-design – aligning compute, networking, memory and software to minimize single bottlenecks that limit the overall system. In our view, this marks a decisive shift in how AI infrastructure is built. For quite some time we’ve acknowledged that Nvidia is no longer shipping chips. It is delivering tightly integrated systems engineered to maximize throughput, utilization, and economic efficiency at the scale required for AI factories. That distinction is profound as competitors attempt to match not just component performance, but the learning-curve advantages that emerge when volume, architecture and system-level design reinforce each other. While Jensen has pointed out that Nvidia is a full systems player, the point is often lost on investors and market watchers. This announcement further underscores the importance of this design philosophy and further differentiates Nvidia from any competitor. A critical point that becomes more clear from Nvidia’s announcements is the chip is not the correct unit of measurement. The system is. More precisely, the rack – and ultimately the token output per rack – is what defines performance, economics, and value. Each rack integrates 72 GPUs along with CPUs and high-speed interconnects that bind the system together. Compute density is critical, but so is the ability to move data with minimal jitter and maximum consistency – within the rack, across racks, and across entire frames. Nvidia has dramatically increased memory capacity into the terabytes, enabling GPUs to operate in tight coordination without stalling. The result is coherent execution at massive scale. These systems are designed to scale up, scale out, and scale across. When deployed at full factory scale, they operate not in dozens or hundreds of GPUs, but in hundreds of thousands – eventually up to a million GPUs working together. As scale increases, so does throughput. And as throughput increases, the economic value of the tokens generated accelerates. This is where the numbers compound to create the flywheel effect. Roughly five times performance improvement at the component level combines with roughly ten times throughput at the system level. Together, they drive what we believe is an estimated 15-times increase in demand, as lower cost per token unlocks entirely new classes of workloads. This is Moore’s Law on triple steroids – and it explains why annual value creation rises so sharply. The Jevons Paradox applies here. As the efficiency of token generation improves, total consumption rises. As we’ve stressed, the value shifts away from static measures of chip performance, toward dynamic measures of system utilization and output economics. The faster tokens can be generated, the more economically viable it becomes to deploy AI at scale, and the more demand expands. Networking is central to this equation. Nvidia’s long-term investment in Mellanox – once dismissed by many as a bet on a dying technology – now looks prescient. InfiniBand continues to grow rapidly, even as Ethernet demand also accelerates. Far from being a bottleneck, networking has become a core enabler of system-level performance. The takeaway is that AI infrastructure economics are now defined at the rack and factory level, not at the chip level. Nvidia’s advantage lies in designing systems where compute, memory, networking and software operate as a single, tightly coordinated machine. That is where throughput is maximized, token economics are transformed, and the next phase of AI factory value is being created. Huang presented three critical metrics on a single slide to show training throughput, AI factory token throughput and token cost. Together, they tell a story about where AI infrastructure economics are headed. For clarity, we break this into two parts as shown below: training on the left, factory and inference throughput on the right. The training chart shows time-to-train measured in months for a next-generation, ultra-large model. The takeaway is eye opening. The Rubin platform reaches the same training throughput as Blackwell using roughly one quarter of the GPUs. As we pointed out earlier, this is not simply about faster chips. It reflects dramatic gains in efficiency at scale – reduced synchronization overhead, fewer memory stalls, lower fabric contention, and shorter training cycles overall. The implications are notable. Capital required per model run drops materially. Customers can run more experiments per year and iterate faster.

This is the future workload profile of AI factories – real-time, interactive, agentic and highly variable — not static batch inference. Rubin is designed for this moment. The value is not just in peak performance, but in sustained throughput under real-world conditions. Taken together, these charts explain why Nvidia’s advantage continues to widen. Training and inference are converging in economic importance. Faster training reduces capital intensity and accelerates innovation. Higher factory throughput lowers token costs while expanding demand. This combination resets expectations for performance, efficiency and scalability.

Comparisons to alternative accelerators – whether Google TPUs, AWS Trainium or others – miss the system-level reality being demonstrated by Nvidia. The new standard is not raw compute.

And this is where the implications become overwhelming. In our view, it’s what matters most. The combination of higher throughput and system-level efficiency drives cost per token down by roughly an order of magnitude. Huang framed it in his keynote saying these systems may consume more power, but they do vastly more work. When throughput rises by 10 times and cost per token falls to one-10th, the economic profile of AI factories fundamentally resets. What’s striking is the pace. This is not the 18- to 24-month cadence historically associated with Moore’s Law. These gains are occurring on a 12-month cycle. Moore’s Law transformed the computing industry for decades, lifting productivity across silicon, software, storage, infrastructure and applications. What we are seeing now is an even more aggressive curve – orders-of-magnitude improvement compressed into a single year. There are real pressures behind this progress. Demand for advanced chips, memory and interconnects is intense, pushing up component costs. Nvidia has secured premium access across that supply chain.

Its business is diversified and structurally important, and we do not view it as going away by any means. Broadcom has deep engineering talent and a diversified business with exceptional leadership. The more controversial question is whether hyperscalers should continue investing in alternative accelerators such as TPUs, Trainium and other ASIC strategies – as a long-term path to compete with Nvidia. Google has deep history and real technical credibility with TPUs. But the argument here is that this is now a different business environment. Google must protect search quality and accelerate Gemini. If internal platform choices limit developer access to CUDA and the best available hardware/software improvements, the risk is that Gemini’s development velocity slows. If model iteration takes multiples longer, that becomes strategically dangerous. Our view is that TPUs have reached a ceiling in this context – not because they can’t improve, but because they cannot match Nvidia’s volume-driven learning curve and system-level economics, particularly with networking as scale. A related point, made by Gavin Baker using a simplified economics example is if Google’s TPU program represents a $30 billion business, and it sends a large portion of value to Broadcom (about $15 billion), one might argue for vertical integration. The counterargument here is that even if it’s financially possible, it may be strategically irrational if it slows Gemini’s iteration speed. The core thesis is that Google should prioritize model velocity over accelerator self-sufficiency. The same logic extends to Trainium. AWS’ Graviton playbook worked because it targeted a mature, flattening x86 curve. That is not the environment in accelerators today. The pace is too fast, the curves are too steep, and the system complexity is too high. Will AWS, Google and even Microsoft continue to fund alternatives to Nvidia? Probably as use cases will emerge for more cost effective platforms. But the real strategic advantage for hyperscalers in our view lies elsewhere, especially as they face increasing competition from neoclouds. We position four frontier labs as the primary contenders: OpenAI, Anthropic PBC, Google and xAI Corp.’sGrok, with Meta Platforms Inc.treated as a second tier (with the caveat that it’s unwise to count Zuckerberg out). Despite persistent negative narratives around OpenAI — especially around financing structure and commitments — our view is that pessimism may be misplaced. The reasoning is as follows: In short, we see the winners as OpenAI the most likely overall winner in the center, with Anthropic as the second player, and Grok highly likely to do well at the edge. Elon could also compete strongly at the edge while he backed away from the idea of building his own data center chips. An additional allocation nuance is labs aligned with Nvidia (OpenAI and X.ai) may have a better path to “latest and greatest” allocations than those pursuing tighter coupling with alternative accelerator strategies. For OEMs like Dell, HPE, Lenovo, and Supermicro, the opportunity is primarily executional. In other words, get the latest platforms, package them, deliver them, and keep them running reliably without thermal or integration failures. Demand is enormous, supply is constrained, and this is not a zero-sum game. For now they can all do well. The key point is that as long as the market remains supply-constrained, anything credible that can be produced will be consumed. That reality can justify multiple silicon suppliers from the ecosystem – even if the long-run competitive curve still favors Nvidia. On the customer side, we challenge a widely repeated narrative to “get your data house in order before you spend on AI.” The view here is that this sequencing can be backwards. Our modeling suggests that over a multi-year period (for example, five years), getting onto the AI learning curve earlier can generate substantially more value than delaying until data is “clean.” Even if data isn’t pristine, organizations can choose a dataset, apply AI to improve it, and compound learning rather than waiting. Two additional implications are highlighted below: Our strategy recommendation is to optimize for speed and learning. Put token capacity close to data (latency matters), use tokens to improve access and data quality, then iterate through AI projects quickly – one project, learn, then the next, building a flywheel. The emphasis should be on starting from value and using intelligence to improve the systems, rather than spending years trying to perfect data first. In our view, the defining lesson of this analysis is that AI is no longer a contest of individual chips, models, or even vendors – it is a contest of learning curves, systems and economics. History shows that in platform transitions, leadership accrues to those who achieve volume, sustain execution and convert efficiency gains into expanding demand. That dynamic shaped the PC era, and it is repeating at far greater speed in the AI factory era. What differentiates this cycle is the compression of time. Improvements that once unfolded over decades are now occurring in 12-month intervals, resetting cost structures and forcing strategic decisions faster than most organizations are accustomed to making them. The implications go across silicon providers, hyperscalers, AI labs, OEMs and enterprises alike. For customers, the message is value will accrue to those who get onto the AI learning curve early, focus on throughput and token economics, and build momentum through rapid iteration rather than waiting for perfect conditions. For vendors, survival will depend less on clever alternatives and more on whether they can stay on the steepest curves without slowing themselves down. This transition will not be linear, and it will not be evenly distributed. But the direction is clear in our view. AI factories are becoming the economic engine of the next computing era, and the winners will be those who treat AI not as a feature or experiment, but as the core operating model of their business.

Title: BlackRock warns crypto’s love affair with AI is over as an energy war with Bitcoin miners begins

For years, Bitcoin mining fought an optics war over energy. Now AI is walking into the same grid, with a very different pitch: jobs, national competitiveness, and always-on demand. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock is telling clients to stop looking at artificial intelligence as software and start treating it as energy. In its 2026 Global Outlook, the BlackRock Investment Institute argued that the AI buildout is pushing against physical limits and highlighted electricity as the constraint investors are underpricing. The report’s headline-grabber is its warning that AI-driven data centers could consume as much as 24% of US electricity by 2030, a scale that would reorder everything from utility capex to industrial siting. That kind of forecast lands with an obvious follow-on question in crypto: if grid access becomes the scarce asset, what happens to the industry that built a business model around turning cheap, interruptible power into Bitcoin? In 2025, narratives arrived around the potential synergy of crypto and AI due to the theory that AI agents will want to use crypto for payments over traditional finance. However, a power war may tarnish this relationship going forward. For years, mining has lived in a political argument about energy waste. The industry’s counterargument has always been operational: miners can be the flexible load, switching off when the grid is stressed and soaking up surplus generation when prices collapse. In Texas, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) has explicitly designed programs for “large flexible customers, such as Bitcoin mining facilities,” encouraging curtailment during peak demand. But AI data centers come with a different consumption profile, different contract terms, and a different level of political support. They don't want to power down, ever. They want the baseload. BlackRock’s broader point is that the AI boom is unusually capital-intensive. The firm cites a $5 trillion to $8 trillion range of total capital spending intentions for the AI buildout through 2030, with heavy spending on compute, data centers, and energy infrastructure. What began as a race for chips has quickly become a race for megawatts. There’s wide agreement that data center electricity demand is rising fast, even if analysts debate the ceiling. A Department of Energy announcement tied to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory’s data center report says data center load growth in the US has tripled over the past decade. Moreover, it is projected to double or triple by 2028. EPRI modeling from 2024 cited by Utility Dive put US data centers at 4.6% to 9.1% of US generation by 2030, depending on AI uptake and efficiency gains. A World Resources Institute explainer, citing a Berkeley Lab study, points to 6.7% to 12% of US electricity consumption by 2030. (wri.org) BlackRock’s “up to 25%” framing sits at the aggressive end of that spectrum, and is meant to be provocative. Yet even the lower-end scenarios would be enough to tighten power markets and harden the grid politics around who gets to plug in first. Reuters reported that utilities and grid operators are already adjusting rate structures and rules as hyperscalers and colocation firms scramble for capacity, especially in hotspots like Texas and Northern Virginia. That’s the environment Bitcoin miners are walking into. They are large, mobile power users, and they're first in line in regions with abundant generation or attractive pricing. Until now, those traits looked like advantages. Bitcoin mining is brutally simple at the physics layer. Specialized computers perform hashing to secure the network, and electricity is the dominant input cost. When power is cheap relative to Bitcoin’s price and network difficulty, miners print cash. When power is expensive, they shut down, relocate, or go bankrupt. That operational flexibility has become the industry’s best talking point as public scrutiny has increased. The US Energy Information Administration estimated crypto mining likely represented about 0.6% to 2.3% of electricity consumption in the US in 2024, a small share in percentage terms but large enough to show up in local politics and grid planning. Texas is the cleanest case study because the state’s competitive power market turns that flexibility into revenue. In a 2023 SEC filing, Riot Platforms said it curtailed power usage by more than 95% during periods of peak demand in August 2023, choosing to forego mining revenue to support ERCOT reliability. CryptoSlate reported that ERCOT paid a miner $31.7 million in energy credits that month to power down during a heat wave, a detail that captures both the value of flexibility and why the politics can get ugly fast. Powering profitability through energy credits, Riot Platforms navigates crypto market downturn. Now put that model next to AI. Training and serving large models need constant power and tight uptime. A hyperscaler signing a long-term lease wants predictable delivery, not voluntary curtailment. If miners are the shock absorber, then AI is the shock creator. And BlackRock’s yearly outlook effectively says that the shock is coming and there's no stopping it. In the mining playbook, “cheap power” means stranded hydro, surplus wind at night, or a friendly industrial tariff. But as data centers scale, cheap power becomes a moving target, because grid access itself becomes the bottleneck. Interconnection queues and transmission delays are the new friction. Even when a region has generation, it may not have the wires, the transformers, or the permitting pathway to deliver it to a new 500-megawatt campus. NERC has warned about reliability threats from rapid load growth tied to AI, data centers, EVs, and electrification colliding with generator retirements and slow buildouts. (Financial Times) That matters for miners because their advantage is speed. They can drop containers on a site, energize, and start hashing faster than a conventional industrial plant can ramp. But if the gating item becomes substation capacity and interconnection approval, then that speed turns into a regulatory contest. When power markets tighten, lawmakers start looking for villains. Mining has often been convenient because it feels optional, even to people who understand nothing about it. In contrast, AI is now being both to the public and to lawmakers as national competitiveness. That asymmetry is what will shape policy. It's easier to impose reporting requirements or additional tariffs on miners than on the data centers the local chamber of commerce is courting. It's also easier to frame mining as a speculative luxury and frame AI as the backbone of defense, productivity, and medicine. If BlackRock is right that AI’s energy footprint will become a macro risk, the political coalition supporting grid investment may widen, but so may the pressure to prioritize “productive” loads. Miners might respond by leaning harder into the flexibility story. A Duke University report cited by Utility Dive argues the existing US grid can handle significant new load if it can be curtailed during stress events, and mining can do that. Many AI workloads, especially inference for consumer products, generally can't. That creates a potential wedge: miners as a controllable load that helps integrate renewables, versus data centers as an inflexible load. This argument is already brewing in policy circles and utility commission hearings. However, whether it wins will depend on local economics and lobbying, not internet debates. There's another adaptation path already underway: pivoting from hashing to hosting. The logic is straightforward. If you already own land, power rights, and a substation, you have what AI developers need most. And if your legacy business is volatile, the prospect of contracted cash flows from compute hosting is tempting. CryptoSlate reported in October that some firms originally focused on Bitcoin mining have been pivoting toward AI infrastructure, with deals tied to cloud and AI workloads, precisely because power access in places like Texas has become valuable. The article’s message is not that every miner will become an AI landlord, but that the industry’s prime asset is shifting from machines to megawatts. With 500MW and 168MW hosting deals inked, miners get financing-friendly dollars while hashrate and fee trajectories determine who captures the upside. This pivot is harder than it sounds. AI data centers require different cooling, different network architecture, and different uptime guarantees. Mining can tolerate interruptions, but many AI customers won't. The cost of retrofitting can be enormous, and the competition includes specialist data center operators with deep relationships and financing advantages. Yet the direction of travel is clear. When power becomes scarce, the highest-value use of a megawatt tends to win. BlackRock’s forecast isn't about Bitcoin specifically, but about the end of cheap abundance. If AI pushes the US toward a world where electricity demand grows fast, and transmission remains slow, any business built on marginal power economics gets squeezed. Of course, miners won't disappear. Bitcoin’s incentive structure is designed to keep hash power online somewhere, and the industry’s mobility means it can chase new energy pockets. But the center of gravity could shift. Regions with surplus generation and friendly policy will likely see miners as a stabilizing industrial load, especially if they can credibly offer curtailment. Regions courting hyperscalers will surely treat miners as a second priority. The likely outcome is a barbell. On one side: miners that integrate with grids, sign structured demand-response agreements, and become part of utility planning. On the other: miners that turn their energy positions into broader compute infrastructure, essentially arbitraging their early arrival in power markets into a new line of business. Either way, the easy era is ending. BlackRock’s warning that AI data centers could swell to an enormous share of US power demand is a reminder that the next phase of digital infrastructure won't be constrained by code, but by the messy physical world of wires, permits, turbines, and heat.

Switch categories to dive deeper or gain broader context. Cambridge pegs median power-only costs near $45/MWh, and miners already curtailed 888GWh in 2023. The real fight is who wins “good electrons.” Bitcoin faces a pivotal week as CPI, Supreme Court, and Senate decisions test its role amidst intense macro forces. Banks want the “affiliate loophole” closed; exchanges say that turns lawful loyalty incentives into an illegal end-run overnight.

Title: US to secure $800bn in Ukraine reconstruction contracts – The Telegraph
URL: https://www.rt.com/russia/630786-us-ukraine-reconstruction-deal/
Time Published: 2026-01-10T17:04:31Z
Full Content:
Washington and Kiev are preparing to sign an $800 billion agreement to rebuild Ukraine, The Telegraph has reported. The deal is scheduled to be sealed at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos later this month, Western sources told the newspaper. The agreement is reportedly structured around the rare earth minerals deal clinched by Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky and US President Donald Trump last year. The accord grants Washington preferential access to the resources; however, the security guarantees long sought by Kiev are not included. At the time, Trump promoted the agreement as a way to recover what he described as the massive financial aid provided to Kiev by the previous administration. Earlier this week, he reiterated that a deal on rare earth metals was a condition for the White House to continue its efforts to peacefully resolve the Ukraine conflict. “I said that if we want to move forward, we need rare earth metals,” Trump told Fox News on Thursday. “We want our money back.” Officials told The Telegraph that the “prosperity” plan envisages attracting around $800 billion over ten years through a combination of loans, grants and private-sector investment. The newspaper noted that US envoy Steve Witkoff called the agreement a crucial part of the overall ceasefire package he has been negotiating for the past few months. The top state official reportedly said that the world’s largest investment group, BlackRock, would participate in the program. Trump repeatedly criticized unconditional aid to Kiev in the past, calling Zelensky “the greatest salesman on earth.” Last year, he said his predecessor, Joe Biden, had “fleeced” America by committing $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine. He has since argued that the US is now profiting from the conflict by sending Ukraine weapons which are being paid for by Washington’s European NATO partners. Moscow has repeatedly condemned Western arms deliveries to Kiev, arguing that they prolong the fighting without altering its outcome.

Kansas City police Officer Matt Masters first used a Taser in the early 2000s. He said it worked well for taking people down; it was safe and effective. “At the end of the day, if you have to put your hands on somebody, you got to scuffle with somebody, why risk that?” he said. “You can just shoot them with a Taser.” Masters believed in that until his son Bryce was pulled over by an officer and shocked for more than 20 seconds. The 17-year-old went into cardiac arrest, which doctors later attributed to the Taser. Masters’ training had led him to believe something like that could never happen.

Title: Investor Michael Burry reveals options bet against Oracle

Time Published: 2026-01-10T15:41:53Z
Full Content:
Michael Burry, the famed investor who has drawn attention in recent months for criticism of the artificial intelligence boom, is betting against Oracle Corp. Burry owns put options on Oracle shares, he said in a Substack post after markets closed on Friday. Puts typically increase in value as the price of the underlying asset falls. Burry, who revealed bearish bets against AI chipmaker Nvidia Corp. and Palantir Technologies Inc. in November, also directly shorted Oracle during the last six months, he said. Oracle is known for its database software but has recently pushed aggressively into cloud-computing services, requiring a costly build out of data center capacity, for which it is taking on significant debt. “I do not like how it is positioned or the investments it is making. It did not need to do what it is doing, and I do not know why it is doing this. Maybe ego,” Burry wrote in response to a reader who asked why he had decided to bet against Nvidia and not Oracle. He didn’t disclose details about the put options. The view follows a volatile year for Oracle shares. The stock jumped 36% in a single session in September after the company issued a bullish forecast for its cloud business, signaling surging demand tied to artificial intelligence. Those gains quickly faded, however, as investors focused on rising capital expenditures, questions around the structure of some cloud deals and a swelling debt load linked to data-center expansion. Oracle finished the year about 40% below its September peak. Oracle has about $95 billion of debt outstanding, making it the biggest corporate issuer outside the financial sector in the Bloomberg high-grade index. The company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment outside of regular business hours. Burry, who became famous for betting against the US housing market during the 2008 financial crisis, said he has avoided shorting larger technology companies whose businesses extend well beyond AI, citing Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. as examples. “If I short Meta, I’m also shorting its social media and advertising dominance. If I short Alphabet, I’m shorting Google Search in all its forms, Android, Waymo, etc. If I short Microsoft, I’m shorting a global office productivity SaaS goliath,” Burry wrote. “The big ones are not pure shorts on AI.” Those companies, he said, are likely to rein in spending over time, absorb losses from overbuilt capacity and potentially write down assets, while remaining dominant in their core businesses. “These three will not go away,” he added. He said he would short OpenAI at a $500 billion valuation, underscoring his broader skepticism about the pace and economics of the AI buildout. Burry described Nvidia as the most concentrated way to express a bearish view on the artificial intelligence trade. “Nvidia also is the most loved, and least doubted,” he wrote. “So shorting it is cheap, and its puts are cheaper than some of the other big shorts out there that are more doubted.”

Title: Pro XRP Lawyer John Deaton Slams Warren’s Crypto War as Wall Street Doubles Down on Crypto

Full Content:
John Deaton has once again slammed anti-crypto senator Elizabeth Warren, saying that she has lost her war on crypto. The pro-XRP lawyer opined that with Wall Street’s major entry into the industry, critics will likely change their stance. Deaton’s remarks come after financial giants, including Morgan Stanley, Charles Schwab, and Vanguard, announced plans to offer their clients exposure to crypto assets. In an X post, Deaton mentioned several financial institutions on Wall Street that are dipping their toes into crypto. These include Charles Schwab, Fidelity, Morgan Stanley, and Vanguard. He said that based on this, even the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon, could soon affirm that “crypto is here to stay.” Deaton also suggested that the former chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler, might issue a pro-crypto statement soon. “Schwab, Vanguard, Fidelity, Morgan Stanley – even Jamie Dimon says crypto’s here to stay. Someone tell Warren she lost the crypto war and her anti-crypto army has been dismantled. Soon, Gary Gensler will come out saying he was for crypto all along,” he stated. Last year, Deaton launched a Senate bid to unseat Warren in Massachusetts but failed to clinch the seat. Nevertheless, he has maintained his pro-crypto stance and continues to bash Warren, who earlier this year wrote a letter to crypto czar David Sacks, raising concerns about plans for a Bitcoin reserve. Deaton’s optimism regarding crypto adoption in the US follows a wave of interest from top financial institutions. According to the President of ETF Store, Nate Geraci, the surge has proven that crypto is not a scam. In an X post, he stated, “In the next few months, Charles Schwab will offer direct spot crypto trading to clients while Morgan Stanley will launch spot BTC & SOL ETFs… Meanwhile, Vanguard now allows clients to trade spot crypto ETFs. You see what’s happening here yet?” On December 6, Morgan Stanley filed with the SEC to offer Bitcoin and Solana ETFs to its clients. If approved, the investment bank will join BlackRock, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton, which already offer these products. The filing also comes when more investors are showing interest in ETFs that track the prices of different crypto tokens. Data from SoSoValue shows that BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF recorded $228 million in inflows on December 6, while Solana and XRP ETFs saw inflows of $9 million and $19 million, respectively.

Title: Tokenized Treasuries skyrocketed 125%, creating this “programmable cash” loop that banks are scrambling to copy

Tokenized RWAs are dominated by Ethereum, but one unexpected blockchain rival just surged 28% to outpace the leader. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Tokenized real-world assets reached $19.72 billion on Jan. 9, the closest the market has come to the $20 billion threshold. That figure measures distributed assets, which are tokens that circulate on-chain and can be transferred between user wallets. As a result, it excludes another $19.78 billion in active private credit loans, which are tracked as represented assets on-chain for recordkeeping but don't enable open transfers. The distributed RWA market splits into three segments. US Treasuries and money market funds dominate, accounting for $8.86 billion in on-chain collateral. Tokenized commodities, led by gold, sit near $4 billion. The remainder, consisting of institutional funds at $2.84 billion, distributed private credit tokens at $2.32 billion, tokenized equities at $801 million, and bonds at $880 million, represents the experimental edge. Here, growth has been explosive, but issuer concentration remains extreme. Stablecoins, measured separately at $307.6 billion, dwarf the entire RWA stack and function as the liquidity rail that tokenized assets plug into. The past 12 months rewrote the trajectory. Treasuries roughly doubled. Institutional funds grew eightfold. Private credit's distributed tokens primarily represent loan participation, while the $19.78 billion in active loans, up 100% from an estimated $9.88 billion in January 2025, reflects the actual lending activity that generates yield. Bitcoin treasury companies need a blend of price stability, strategic governance, and revived leverage demand. Tokenized US Treasuries grew from an estimated $3.95 billion in January 2025 to $8.86 billion by January 2026, a 125% increase. BlackRock's BUIDL fund crossed $2 billion in April 2025, one year after launch, and has distributed $100 million in dividends as of December of the same year. Reallocation by major holders drives BUIDL-I share class drawdown, impacting BlackRock fund's net outflow. Binance accepted BUIDL as collateral in November, and Ethena's USDtb stablecoin now backs 90% of reserves with BUIDL tokens. JPMorgan launched its own tokenized money market fund, MONY, on Ethereum in December, with a $100 million seed. The pattern: institutions are treating tokenized Treasuries as programmable cash. Smart contracts automate interest payments, redemptions happen 24/7, and tokens move peer-to-peer without intermediaries. Against $28 trillion in total outstanding US Treasuries, the tokenized segment remains microscopic, but infrastructure is scaling faster than adoption. Institutional alternative funds grew from roughly $350 million to $2.84 billion, a 714% increase. Centrifuge holds 34.29% market share, Securitize controls 31.02%. That concentration means partnership decisions by a handful of tokenization providers move the entire category. These funds bring private equity, credit, and structured products on-chain with familiar regulatory frameworks. Tokenization reduces friction in secondary trading and allows fractional ownership, while yields remain attractive from 8% to 12%. Additionally, on-chain settlement transparency appeals to institutional compliance teams. The catch: liquidity is issuer-dependent. Most secondary markets rely on redemption mechanisms controlled by fund managers rather than open order books. A 2025 academic analysis found that tokenized assets exhibit low trading volumes despite growing market caps. Until more venues offer compliant secondary trading, institutional funds will scale through issuance rather than true market-making. Tokenized commodities grew from approximately $1.06 billion to nearly $4 billion, driven almost entirely by gold. PAXG and XAUT account for over 80% of commodity activity, as demand spiked 227% as precious metals hit record highs. Tokenized public stocks reached $801.36 million, up from roughly $250 million, a 218% gain. Ondo Finance controls 51.6% by value. Monthly transfer volume hit $2.66 billion despite the modest market cap, indicating high turnover. Active addresses fell 26% over 30 days, suggesting participation is concentrating among fewer, more active traders. Corporate bonds total $193.31 million with 14,300 holders. Cashlink controls 62.49%, JPMorgan holds 25.86%. Non-U.S. government debt stands at $686.66 million, with Spiko accounting for 80.72%. These are proof-of-concept deployments where institutions test infrastructure before committing larger capital pools. Ethereum holds $12.6 billion, equivalent to 64.51% of the distributed RWA market. BNB Chain accounts for $2.02 billion (10.37%), Solana $924.59 million (4.75%), Stellar $829.48 million (4.26%), and Arbitrum $745.92 million (3.83%). Stellar grew 28.% over 30 days, the fastest expansion among major chains, while Solana gained 16.56% and BNB Chain 12.11%. Stablecoins are going mainstream, and Ethereum is positioning itself as the place those dollars ultimately settle. Ethereum's dominance reflects first-mover advantage and institutional familiarity. BlackRock launched BUIDL on Ethereum before expanding to seven other blockchains. Nevertheless, multichain strategies are accelerating. Nearly 70% of BUIDL's assets now sit outside Ethereum, deployed where users and liquidity congregate. Interoperability providers like Wormhole enable seamless cross-chain transfers, which matters when liquidity fragments across networks. Private credit illustrates RWA.xyz's methodological shift in 2025. The platform now distinguishes “distributed” assets, which are tokens that circulate on-chain and can be transferred between user wallets, from “represented” assets, which use blockchain as a recordkeeping layer without enabling open transfer. Private credit's $2.32 billion in distributed value represents the tradable, transferable portion of loan participation tokens. The nearly $20 billion in active loans represents the underlying lending activity tracked on-chain but not freely transferable. The amount in active loans grew from an estimated $9.88 billion in January 2025, representing a 100% gain. Cumulative loan originations totaled $36.29 billion across platforms such as Figure ($14.48B active), Tradable ($2.3B active), and Maple ($1.63B active). Borrowers pay an average APR of 10.14%. Figure dominates with 73% of active loans, operating on the Provenance blockchain. Tradable holds 12% on ZKSync Era, while Maple accounts for 8% across Ethereum, Solana, and Base. The distinction between distributed and represented matters because it reveals how tokenization serves different functions. Distributed private credit tokens allow secondary trading of loan participations, creating liquidity for an otherwise illiquid asset class. Represented assets use blockchain for transparency, reconciliation, and operational efficiency, without exposing loans to open-market trading. Most private credit remains in the “represented” category because lenders prefer controlled distribution over open secondary markets. Standard Chartered CEO Bill Winters stated in late 2025 that the majority of transactions will eventually settle on-chain. Private credit tests that thesis. If loan origination, servicing, and settlement move fully on-chain with distributed tokens, efficiency gains are substantial. However, custody for debt instruments, collateral management, and legal enforceability in insolvency all require more clarity before the market scales beyond its current $2.32 billion distributed footprint. Distributed RWAs could reach $30.8 billion (bear), $41.4 billion (base), or $57.0 billion (bull) by end-2027, assuming annual growth of 25%, 45%, and 70%, respectively. Tokenized Treasuries would scale to $13.8 billion (bear) or $19.9 billion (bull). Private credit's distributed tokens could reach $3.6 billion (bear) or $6.4 billion (bull), while the underlying active loans, measured separately as represented assets, could reach $28.5 billion (bear) or $50.6 billion (bull). The bull case requires specific catalysts: clear pathways for tokenized fund distribution in major jurisdictions, more venues for compliant secondary trading, and deeper integration of Treasuries as collateral across on-chain credit protocols. Private credit's evolution from represented to distributed depends on whether lenders embrace open secondary markets for loan participations or prefer controlled, permissioned transfer mechanisms. Those catalysts are materializing. The UK's FCA signaled a September 2026 crypto licensing gateway. Barclays backed Ubyx for tokenized money infrastructure. Visa and JPMorgan are experimenting with Solana rails. Wyoming’s Frontier launch plus a Wall Street wrapper filing happened fast, and the real institutional bet is on settlement rails. The bear case assumes infrastructure lags and regulatory uncertainty persists. Custody challenges remain central. Traditional custodians are still building capabilities for digital wallets, smart contract governance, and interoperability with tokenization platforms. Four factors determine whether 2027 looks like the base or bull case. First, tokenized Treasuries must become standard collateral across major trading venues and lending platforms. BlackRock's expansion to eight blockchains and integration with Ethena's stablecoin infrastructure is the template. Second, tokenized funds must solve the secondary market problem. Institutional alternative funds are growing eight times faster than other segments, but liquidity remains tied to issuer redemptions. If regulated venues support order-book trading for tokenized fund shares, the segment accelerates. Third, the custody and settlement infrastructure must be professionalized. Institutions allocate to assets they can safely custody and audit clearly. Progress is happening, as Zodia, Copper, and Fireblocks build enterprise-grade solutions, but adoption takes time. Fourth, stablecoin integration must deepen. At nearly $308 billion, stablecoins are the liquidity substrate for RWAs. The GENIUS Act provided clarity, and platforms are embedding stablecoins as settlement rails. China announced it will pay interest on the digital yuan, explicitly targeting dollar stablecoin competition. If US stablecoins remain competitive, RWAs benefit. The $20 billion milestone is a marketing number. What matters is whether the infrastructure supporting that $20 billion can handle $50 billion without breaking. The past year proved that issuance scales fast when institutions commit. The next 18 months will test whether market depth, custody rails, and regulatory frameworks can support the weight.

Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. For many, investing is about staying in for the long haul, especially if you want to generate a lifetime stream of income that will support you well into retirement. To reach this goal, many savvy investors turn to dividend paying stocks. These are stocks of companies that make regular payments to investors out of their profits. But you can also turn to dividend paying ETFs. These are diversified funds that can hold hundreds of dividend paying stocks hand picked by professionals from big names like JP Morgan and Blackrock. But there are also tons of dividend paying ETFs out there. And their yields vary. Some have low yields, while others have much higher yields. So to narrow down your search, we tracked down 5 dividend ETFs that pay 5%+ yields and can have a nice spot in a long term investor’s portfolio. So let’s take a closer look. Global X SuperDividend U.S. ETF (DIV) is a popular dividend paying ETF among investors. It generates an impressive yield of over 7%. It does this by investing in 50 of the highest dividend paying stocks in the United States. But its fund managers go beyond just picking dividend stocks with high yields. They also screen for stocks with low betas compared to the S&P 500. This can give investors the benefit of low volatility. Moreover, the fund has net assets of over $657 million.

Title: New BlackRock report exposes a historic shift in crypto that leaves only one blockchain controlling the settlement layer
URL: https://cryptoslate.com/blackrock-stablecoin-ethereum-settlement-standard-2026/

Stablecoins are going mainstream, and Ethereum is positioning itself as the place those dollars ultimately settle. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Stablecoins used to be a crypto convenience, a way to park dollars between trades without touching fiat. However, the industry has matured enough that BlackRock now treats them as foundational rails for the market. In its 2026 Global Outlook, the BlackRock Investment Institute argued that stablecoins are widening beyond exchanges and becoming integrated into mainstream payment systems. It also said they could expand in cross-border transfers and day-to-day use in emerging markets. That framing matters because it shifts the question investors ask, especially when it comes from a name as big as BlackRock. The point here isn’t whether stablecoins are good for crypto. The question is whether they’re on track to become a settlement rail that sits beside, and sometimes inside, traditional finance. If they do, which blockchains will end up acting like the base layer for final settlement, collateral, and tokenized cash? BlackRock puts the stakes bluntly. “Stablecoins are no longer niche,” the report quotes Samara Cohen, BlackRock’s global head of market development. They’re “becoming the bridge between traditional finance and digital liquidity.” Stablecoins began thriving on crypto volatility. Markets swing, banks close on weekends, and exchanges rely on a patchwork of fiat rails for redemptions. Dollar-pegged tokens solved that operational problem by giving traders a 24/7 unit of account and settlement asset. BlackRock’s emphasis is that stablecoins have now outgrown that niche. The firm said integration into mainstream payment systems and cross-border payments is a natural next step, especially where latency, fees, and correspondent banking friction remain stubbornly high. One reason the timing feels right is regulatory. In the US, the GENIUS Act was signed into law on July 18, 2025, creating a federal framework for payment stablecoins, including reserve and disclosure requirements. The law is signed, but the real fight starts in rulemaking and phased rollouts through 2026–27. Here’s the timeline, the winners, and how flows could reroute crypto rails. That kind of legal clarity doesn’t guarantee mass adoption. But it changes the risk calculus for banks, large merchants, and payment networks that have to answer to compliance teams and regulators. The market’s scale is also no longer theoretical. Total stablecoin value stood around $298 billion as of Jan. 5, 2026, with USDT and USDC still dominating the stack. BlackRock’s report, using CoinGecko data through Nov. 27, 2025, notes stablecoins hit record highs in market cap even as crypto prices fluctuated. It highlights their role as the system’s primary source of “dollar liquidity and on-chain stability.” That combination of legal recognition and sheer size is why stablecoins have started to show up in places they never used to, like the back office of global payments. Visa offered a concrete example in December 2025. The company said it had launched USDC settlement in the US, allowing issuer and acquirer partners to settle with Visa in Circle’s dollar stablecoin. Visa said initial banking participants settled over Solana. It framed the move as a way to modernize its settlement layer with faster movement of funds, seven-day availability, and resilience across weekends and holidays. Stablecoins are moving into the part of finance that’s usually invisible until it breaks: settlement. If stablecoins are now effectively digital dollars, the next question is where those dollars live as the system scales. As stablecoins move toward more complex uses, such as collateral, treasury management, tokenized money-market funds, and cross-border netting, the base layer matters more than marketing. That layer needs predictable finality, deep liquidity, robust tooling, and a governance and security model institutions can trust for decades, not just a cycle. This is where Ethereum could step in. Ethereum’s value proposition in 2026 isn’t that it’s the cheapest chain for sending a stablecoin. Plenty of networks compete there, and Visa’s Solana pilot is a reminder that high-throughput chains have a seat at the table. The case for Ethereum is that it has become the anchor layer for an ecosystem that treats execution and settlement as separate functions. Ethereum’s own documentation makes that explicit in the context of rollups, where Ethereum acts as the settlement layer that anchors security and provides objective finality if disputes occur on another chain. So when users move fast and cheap on L2s, the base chain still plays referee. The more valuable the activity being settled, the more valuable the referee role becomes. BlackRock’s stablecoin section is also a tokenization story. The report describes stablecoins as a “modest but meaningful step toward a tokenized financial system,” where digital dollars coexist with, and sometimes reshape, traditional channels of intermediation and policy transmission. Tokenization turns that abstract idea into a balance-sheet reality. It means issuing a claim on a real-world asset, such as a Treasury bill fund, on a blockchain. Stablecoins then serve as the cash leg for subscriptions, redemptions, and secondary-market trading. On that front, Ethereum is still the center of gravity. RWA.xyz shows Ethereum hosting about $12.5 billion in tokenized real-world assets, roughly a 65% market share as of Jan. 5, 2026. BlackRock itself helped build that gravitational pull. Its tokenized money-market fund, BUIDL, debuted on Ethereum and later expanded to multiple chains, including Solana and several Ethereum L2s, as tokenized Treasuries became one of the clearest real-world use cases for on-chain finance. Even on a multi-chain footprint, the institutional pattern is telling: start where liquidity, custody integrations, and smart contract standards are most mature, then extend outward as distribution channels develop. JPMorgan has been moving in the same direction. The bank launched a tokenized money-market fund with shares represented by digital tokens on Ethereum. It accepted subscriptions in cash or USDC and tied the push partly to the stablecoin regulatory shift that followed the GENIUS Act. This suggests stablecoins don’t just need a fast network for payments. They also need a credible settlement fabric for tokenized collateral, yield-bearing cash equivalents, and institutional-grade finance. Ethereum has become the default answer to that need, not because it wins every benchmark, but because it has become the settlement court where the most valuable cases are heard. BlackRock’s outlook includes caution embedded in the opportunity. In emerging markets, it notes stablecoins could broaden dollar access while challenging monetary control if domestic currency use declines. That’s a political economy problem, not a tech problem. It’s also the kind that can trigger restrictive policy responses in exactly the places where stablecoins have product-market fit. There are also issuer risks. Stablecoins aren’t all the same, and market structure can turn on trust. S&P Global Ratings downgraded its assessment of Tether’s reserves in November 2025, citing concerns about limited transparency. It was a reminder that the stability of the system can hinge on what sits behind the peg. Despite a downgrade from S&P, Tether's gold and Bitcoin stockpile is seen as strength by crypto markets. Ethereum also isn’t guaranteed to be the only settlement layer that matters. Visa’s USDC settlement work shows large players are willing to route stablecoin settlement over other chains when it fits their operational needs. Circle positions USDC as natively supported across dozens of networks, a strategy that makes stablecoin liquidity portable and reduces dependence on any single chain. But portability cuts both ways. As stablecoins spread, the premium shifts to layers that can provide credible settlement, integration with tokenized assets, and a security model strong enough to persuade institutions they can park real cash and real collateral on-chain without waking up to a governance surprise. That’s why ETH is a likely wager on the settlement standard for tokenized dollars. If stablecoins are becoming what BlackRock says they are, a bridge between traditional finance and digital liquidity, the bridge still needs bedrock.

Title: Weekend reading: Alas Smith and the active investing Joneses

Full Content:
What caught my eye this week. The formerly fêted fund manager Terry Smith has had a few rough years in the markets, but last year was a doozy. The UK investors who once poured money into his flagship Fundsmith vehicle saw their domestic market deliver nearly 26% in 2025. A global tracker – a better comparison for the free-roaming Fundsmith – delivered roughly 14%. But Fundsmith managed just a 0.8% return. Barely there, and handily outpaced by cash in the bank. Now Terry Smith is a big and famously acerbic boy who has rained on many a parade over his long career. While the schadenfreude must be positively Wagnerian in some quarters and it’s never nice to kick a man while he’s down, he doesn’t need me defending him. I will just a tad though. Like Nick Train – another once-loved but now seemingly reviled fund manager 1 – Smith invests exclusively in ‘quality’ type shares. This doesn’t (just) mean ‘quality’ the way a car salesman might quip about that vehicle you’re eyeing up. The quality factor describes a particular kind of company that boasts – among other things – high returns on equity, strong profit margins, and the ability to turn most of its profit into cash. And since the reset of 2022, these kinds of companies have been in the doghouse. I know because I favour them with my stock picking myself. Although happily my returns in 2025 were an order of magnitude better than Smith’s. (But now I’m doing the schadenfreude dance…) Of course, Smith and Train didn’t exactly call out the tailwinds that boosted their returns during the low interest rate era. Worrywarts like me saw ‘bond proxy’ companies increasingly owned by weak hands who would rather be invested in bonds, and which were thus primed for a fall when interest rates rose. Train in particular dismissed such concerns, while Smith just continued to talk like you’d need a lobotomy to own anything other than his favoured firms. But when the reckoning came, those multiples duly corrected – and the share prices went south. The fact that even good investors suffer when their style is out of favour is of course another of the many arguments for passive investing. I’m one of diminishing band who still believes both Smith and Train have skill. But I also think most people should invest the bulk of their money in index funds, rather than bet their net worth on either the jockey or the horse they’re riding. However Smith has continued to lend his voice to the chorus warning that those same index funds are part of a wider problem. In his letter to investors this week, he recapped the now-common argument that the growing share of money invested in index funds is distorting the market, concluding: …even if we are right in diagnosing this move to index funds as one of the causes of our recent underperformance and it is laying the foundations of a major investment disaster, I have no clue how or when it will end except to say badly. He would say that, wouldn’t he? He’s an active fund manager. Well no. The greatest active investor of all-time, Warren Buffett, cheerily urges people – including his wife – to put their money into tracker funds. For my part, I am not sure exactly what I think. While Smith’s recap in his letter on the perils of excessive indexing is uncharacteristically muddled, I’ve read more persuasive arguments as to why the weight of money in index funds is distorting prices. At least at the margin and especially for the biggest companies. (Here’s the latest). I’ve also read comprehensive counters too. Now you may wonder why someone who has been writing a blog about both active and passive investing for 20 years cannot be more definitive about this? The truth is the maths is non-trivial and it’d take a good chunk of time to separate theoretical outcomes from any real-world implications. So I’m leaving it to the investing titans to argue it out. With that said, I’ve mentioned to my co-blogger The Accumulator that, on a gut level, I suspect indexing becoming mainstream will have some kind of downside. Apparent free lunches in investing always do. But whether they will be enough to make any meaningful difference – let alone be something that should prompt everyday investors to return to paying the known cost of active investing – is another matter altogether. On a practical level, if I was a passive investor I might favour equal-weighted funds a bit more, though that’s been a losing bet for years. Then I’d wait to see what happens! There’s no world in which index funds crash while a preponderance of active funds soar, that’s for sure. Remember, active funds basically are the market. 2 If passive and index investing has been unduly inflating prices, then beyond the edge cases it’s doing it for all investors. Have a great weekend.

Or peruse a few of our best articles. Surely this idea that indexing is causing overvalution is absolute nonsense? Like before indexing we never had overvaluation/ undervaluation in the market? Look at 1929, and more recently the late 1990s bubble and the subsequent drop after 1999. Human nature causes bubbles and their collapse, not indexing. @Indexing — Agree with the historical perspective. I’d have a read of the literature though before using the phrase “absolute nonsense”. If I was going to redux the argument down, it’s something like passive investing flows into the very largest index funds are sort of like a valuation agnostic active momentum fund funelling money into the market. (Remember, even index funds are ‘active’ in that they follow rules as to what firms to include and exclude, and in what weightings). So in that sense it’s the same as it ever was — just like big active funds in the 1960s or the late 1990s — but under a new guise. There’s then a bunch of maths overlaid onto that about demand/supply inelasticity and whatnot. In a simple world as I understood it, index funds just bought ‘the market’ and active funds traded against each other and were the market. But there are coherent arguments that at this scale quantity has a quality all of its own, as Napoleon said. Still, as noted in the piece, I’m not persuaded it’s an argument for active investing unless you want to go *very* active (e.g. buying small cap active funds to avoid an alleged large cap bubble) and that comes with a plethora of very known and real issues. If any bubble pops, however it was caused, then everyone will go down together, more or less, though no doubt some funds will do relatively better (including, perhaps, quality and value focused funds, which have struggled for so long versus tech/growth…) Fair enough, absolute nonsense is probably a bit harsh. But the idea bubbles are caused by indexing I think is a mistake. Bubbles or extreme price moves in both directions have occurred in all markets, not just stocks, since records began. Most of these markets did not have any form of indexing. On my long investing journey (am now 80) I remember my first convincing star manager Ian Rutherford of Personal Assets Trust whose investing outlook perfectly fitted my conservative investing feelings.Alas he was taken from us too soon -rather emphasising one of the problems of relying on “star” managers Various other heroes like Jim Slater shot briefly and brightly across the investing firmament -there were many of his ilk Realising that putting faith in one person was a fraught investing policy-how does a mere amateur investor pick the winners? Index investing eventually came to the rescue via Vanguard and John Bogle to my great investing relief-no educated guesswork needed I very much enjoy reading about the success of Terry Smith etc but then a Woodford comes along……… Index investing is very boring but retirement finances need to be 100% successful-so boring is OK with me Indexing has done the job for me-so far!-However I keep reading financial news-Monevator etc-but so far all it does is reinforce my current conservative investing policy but who knows down the line what might appear…….. xxd09 A very good article The Investor, which I thought was very balanced. Thank you. I have to confess that Fundsmith is the only active fund that I currently hold in my portfolio (less than 5% of it), with everything else being trackers (apart from one ‘fun’ individual company share). I have had it a long while now and, in the past, it has been good to me (186% up). I invested in it because I like Terry Smith (the UK’s Warren Buffet- we hoped) and how he talks. Although for the last five years his defence of his track record has become less and less convincing. I am curious to see what happens in the future. If in the next few years, he hugely underperforms the market does he decide that reducing the funds 1% management charge might be in order? ( I think Warren Buffet would). In fairness to him he does have integrity and is rich enough not to care about what other people think of him. A while back, buoyed by the success of Fundsmith, I invested in his FEET fund, basically Fundsmith in Emerging Markets. It was not a success (better to have bought an EM tracker). He run it for a few years before handing over to two of his team (who couldn’t improve it). He wound up FEET BUT the pay out was generous compared to the final share price (from memory I don’t think I lost any money on it apart from opportunity cost). With regard to his latest tirade against the unfairness of the all-encompassing passive trackers (I admit I haven’t actually read his words) I think he is on a sticky wicket. Passive trackers are here to stay – too bad, get over it. There is a truism in economics – You can never buck a trend! Seems to make some sense that passive flows could distort the stock market and lead to some misallocation of capital. But then, this should create opportunities that active managers can exploit, and we’re not seeing that. Active managers still underperform the market on average, and afaik the level of underperformance has been roughly the same over the past decades (and the rise of index funds). Academic economists usually work with “spherical horse in vacuum”-type assumptions. I think we’re better off relying on practical observations. Index funds it is for me, until I see active stock managers actually outperform. That said, if quality-factor stocks are so unloved at the moment, maybe it’s a good time to take a punt. @indexing #1 & #3: that’s not a claim being made under the Inelastic Markets Hypothesis (it’s a straw man point). The IMH does not postulate that passive flows ’cause’ overvaluation and/or crashes (at least per se). Rather, the IMH merely claims that, beyond a certain point, due to both increasing net passive flows and increasing passive share (dominance), public markets become increasingly less elastic, less informationally efficient (in terms of informed price discovery) and that larger caps weight stocks become progressively overweighted compared to their effective crisis liquidity (i.e. ever less effective liquidity under stress per unit of capitalisation): See Monevator here: “Why market cap investing still works”. March 4, 2025, @me #80 Here: “Passive investing, edge, and market efficiency: winners need losers”, September 19, 2024, @me #11 Here: “Weekend reading: oh what can ail thee, knight-at-arms?” September 7, 2024, @ZX #16 and immediately following. Here: “Weekend reading: Fama and fortune”. August 31, 2024, @me #3 and #9 And here: “Weekend reading: We all feel the pain of active fund managers now.” February 9, 2024, @ZX #16 and @me #37 For the avoidance of doubt IMH is not an argument for active management. Index investing will clearly follow a trend and NEW money will reinforce that trend. In the present market we can underweight the stocks / region that we perceive as overvalued. At some point the markets fall, is that the correction or just a dip…. Given we feel the market has fallen, how do we respond ? A logical answer is that a tracker is the route out , we don’t know what will rise again most quickly , “if you can’t find the needle buy the haystack “ So we need to veer away from the market tracker and then head back in, timing is tough. It’s worth thinking back to 1988/89 Japanese market was very expensive and was 45% of the world index (iirc) and USA was 25% but when it crashed big time in 1989 , the world index fell but within a couple of years the index had largely recovered… Perhaps that might point to how the AI excitement might play out ? Peter Thiel, seriously? @Ian — It’s an excellent book. I don’t share the man’s politics but he understands 21st Century business! Terry Smith and Nick train get a lot of credit for their factor happening to outperform in the early days of their funds’ launch. Terry Smith’s long term track record (and short term track record for that matter) looks a lot less impressive if you pick an appropriate benchmark with a similar factor exposure (the MSCI World Quality index say, rather that the MSCI World). I would say that index funds exaggerate (and perhaps highlight?) strongly held beliefs. So the US Exceptionalism concept has a key impact on the allocation of the global trackers. Then at a lower level in the UK you do have shares at very unusually low valuations (for example, retail is generally trading both on low earnings and earnings multipliers). With others at better values. These are both beliefs about where value should or shouldn’t be, but both could be temporary. And index funds are led by the hand by these beliefs. The advantage of the active investor or an investor in industry ETFs is they can go against these preconceptions, which may work well IF they are right (this is basically Buffet, Graham etc). At its core – index funds are not God – they contain mistakes, but at its core they can be reduced to generalizations, and understood. The problem is it takes a lot of time and energy to understand the generalizations in an index, and with most market commentary being misleading at best, the question is whether it’s worth extra time of effort. That I think will forever be debated – but there will be cycles where indexes outperform, and cycles where they don’t. The smaller houses lead to happier lives article is interesting. There’s a lot to be said for living in a good community. I think i heard Naval say similar on a podcast they’ve purposely chosen to live in a smaller house in a nice community rather than a remote mansion. It’s hard deciding on size of home more space isn’t always better seem to get filled with junk. The population chart isn’t good. Without wanting to bring the b word into it if that was a vote for sovereignty then the Boris wave was a proper kick in the teeth. Now we seem to be in a situation where we have a brain drain of talent and a policy of importing less desirable (pc term) low skilled people. When are we going to see govt embrace autonomous driving and lay off importing uber drivers? Re “With that said, I’ve mentioned to my co-blogger The Accumulator that, on a gut level, I suspect indexing becoming mainstream will have some kind of downside. Apparent free lunches in investing always do.” I think your gut-level theory falls down on the point of equating index investing with a free lunch. Most active participants are trying to beat the market, indexers are accepting average which I don’t see as a free lunch. They’re already resigned to the fact they won’t beat the market, but are happy to settle for that, knowing they’ll have lower costs, less mental work, etc. @Scott — the free lunch here would be relying on the work of active investors to analyse and try to put the correct value on shares. “The market” is a result of that work at any moment in time (plus or minus any disputed in elasticity effects…) I suppose one could argue that the active investors are effectively squabbling over the bill themselves in terms of the Gains/losses netting out, but nevertheless there’s billions of dollars of work here index investors aren’t paying for. Of course how many billions are required to keep a market efficient is open to debate. I’d be very open to believing it’s a lot less than is still being paid today! 🙂 Enjoyed the BBC piece on willpower. There are so many mysteries in obesity which get little attention as we’re still stuck on the now discredited calories in, calories out model. It’s the only large scale public health intervention which has not only not worked but gotten worse (including other interventions which also require ‘willpower’ like smoking cessation). On The Root of All article, symbols and ritual are thought to have a role in nourishing the non-propositional machinery beneath the intellectual abstract world we consciously inhabit. There has in a way always been tracker funds and a lot of money in them. Just a different name, closet trackers, basically a tracker fund where an a manager fiddled around the edges and called it an active fund. If you went to your local bank you tended to end up in one of those. There will always be actively managed funds, hope springs eternal. I’m not surprised Terry Smith is blaming his poor performance on index trackers its a common practice by politicians etc, blame someone/something else. That way you get your customers to shift their focus away from your poor performance. I wonder how the active v passive argument will play out once the much predicted correction occurs. I suspect that global trackers stuffed to the gills with AI plays may fall more significantly than Train/Smith – making the active plays ironically but temporarily the low volatily choice. On a somewhat different note I would be really interested in Monevators opinions on Cedebergs July 2025 paper “Beyond the Status Quo A critical assessment of lifestyle investment advice”. Also any comments on Morningstar’s paper “The state of retirement income for 2026” that outlines alternatives to the fixed withdrawal rate e.g guardrails approach would be very welcome. So the Trump administration has fully escalated the battle with the Fed. Its going to be a long week Nassim Nicholas Taleb recounted the time he worked as a trader for some large bank in New York, and at the weekly team meeting, he was asked for his view on whether the market would rise or fall in the coming week. He replied that he expected the market to rise, on balance of probabilities, as it had done for many weeks. One of his colleagues “called him out” (or whatever this kind of misbehaviour was called in the 1980s), demanding to know why Taleb held a short position in the market, if he believed that it would rise in the coming week. Taleb calmly repeated his stated position that the market was likely to rise over the coming week, but if it didn’t, then it would fall a long way, and then he would profit handsomely. Many investors are asking the wrong question (“will the market rise over the next week?”), rather than looking at how to make rich returns from other people’s preference for steady return. It might be a good time to buy some call options on Iranian equities. Leave a Comment Name * Email * Website Comment Notify me of followup comments via e-mail.

But first — if you work at a Wall Street firm and are using AI, we want to hear from you. How is AI really showing up in your day-to-day? Is it living up to the hype? AI is set to reshape roughly 44% of banking work by 2030, according to consulting firm ThoughtLinks — and Wall Street's biggest firms are racing to get there first. JPMorgan Chase, the largest US bank by assets, is spending $18 billion a year on technology, with AI a central focus. CEO Jamie Dimon is a "tremendous" user of the bank's generative AI tools, which have now been rolled out to more than 200,000 employees. The bank is also replacing long-standing human processes with AI. Its asset-management arm announced plans to stop using external proxy advisers for US shareholder voting, instead launching an in-house AI platform, Proxy IQ, which will analyze data from more than 3,000 annual company meetings. Executives have said the bank is training employees to use AI in ways that deliver measurable productivity gains. Goldman Sachs is spending $6 billion on technology this year — a figure CEO David Solomon has said he wishes were higher. In an October memo outlining the latest phase of its OneGS initiative, the bank said AI would drive efficiency, slow hiring, and lead to a "limited reduction" in roles. Goldman has since rolled out internal AI tools, including an assistant now available to employees across the firm. More stories:7 Goldman Sachs insiders explain how the bank's new AI sidekick is helping them crush it at work Goldman is assembling a growing arsenal of AI tools. Here's everything we know about 5. Morgan Stanley, an early OpenAI partner, has focused on turning employee ideas into working AI products. One internally built tool, called DevGen.AI has already saved engineers more than 280,000 hours this year. Among interns, AI adoption is especially strong: 72% say they use ChatGPT daily or several times a week. Citigroup has also accelerated its push. Nearly 180,000 employees across 83 countries now have access to Citi's proprietary AI tools, which have been used almost 7 million times this year. CEO Jane Fraser said the bank's generative AI tools are saving about 100,000 developer hours a week through automated code reviews. Citi also began piloting agentic AI with 5,000 employees in September. Citi snags AI leader from Morgan Stanley to help turn around its wealth tech In the ultracompetitive world of hedge funds, being ahead on the latest technology is always a priority. In December, Citadel said its stockpickers are using an internal chatbot to speed up their processes and find new info at his $71 billion hedge fund. At the 2025 Global Milken conference, Andreas Kreuz, WorldQuant's deputy CIO, said the firm was using AI to expand the data it can bring into its models since it can restructure data from images and audio. Point72's CTO Ilya Gaysinskiy told BI about his big plans to ramp up Point72's tech organization and how AI will play into that expansion. Bridgewater launched a fund driven by AI in 2024. The fund's AIA Labs worked to replicate every stage of the investment process with machine learning. The firm's co-chief investment officer and chief scientist outlined the plans of the world's largest hedge fund. $29 billion hedge fund Balyasny has built an AI bot that it believes will be able to do the grunt work that typically falls to senior analysts — a potential huge timesaver for investment teams. The manager told Business Insider in 2024 that roughly 80% of the firm's staff use its AI tools, which include the internal chatbot BAMChatGPT, and recently hired Matthew Henderey, one of the CIA's AI developers, as a data science executive. Man Group and Viking Global have also developed their own internal offerings. Lucia Soares — Carlyle's chief information officer and head of technology transformation — talked to BI about taking on a new challenge: Bringing AI to the investment giant's 2,300 global employees. Private equity firms are no strangers to managing and analyzing copious amounts of data — but data is only helpful if you can find it. Blackstone has invested in improving its enterprise search and is also betting AI will give it a leg up in its pursuit to capture more of the insurance market. Swedish PE giant EQT built an AI engine called Motherbrain that has changed how its investors source deals. ChatGPT enables the investing giant to take the next step with its AI ambitions. As private equity firms turn to AI for a competitive edge, Thomas H. Lee says its engineers are up to 30% more productive with help from AI coding assistants. AI tools are changing how stock-pickers do their job. AllianceBernstein, BlackRock, and JPMorgan opened up on how their tools are speeding up portfolio manager workflows. BlackRock has introduced Asimov, the agentic AI platform for the firm's fundamental equity business. Business Insider talked to Kirsty Craig, head of research, data, and AI strategy for portfolio management tech, who helped develop the tool. The multi-billion-dollar investment manager VanEck invested in a Toronto-based startup and is onboarding its technology to boost its ETF business. An executive and the fintech's CEO walked us through how AI will change the jobs of analysts and salespeople. Kraken's $1.5 billion acquisition of a retail trading startup made headlines last March. Less noticed was how the crypto exchange used generative AI to run due diligence on the target — a process its head of M&A now considers core to his team's work. At Block, Jack Dorsey's fintech behind Square, Afterpay, and Cash App, engineers built an AI agent that can write code faster — and in some cases better — than senior developers. The company ultimately decided to open-source the tool, even as it gives competitors a look under the hood. Chime has taken a similar in-house approach. In 2023, the neobank built a private, ChatGPT-style assistant to help engineers ship products more quickly and at lower cost. The company's CTO shared how the tool has become a key part of Chime's product-development playbook. Jump to

The founder of investment firm Tiger Global Management, Chase Coleman, is offloading a massive stake in Facebook’s parent company while loading up on a tech stock that has rallied massively over the past couple of months. According to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, Coleman dumped shares of Meta Platforms (META) worth approximately $3.49 billion in the third quarter of 2025. Since October, Meta Platforms has shed roughly 10% of its value. Over the same period, Coleman initiated a position in database software firm MongoDB (MDB) worth approximately $105.84 million. Earlier this week, MongoDB hit a 23-month high price of about $440 amid consecutive double-digit growth in revenues and profits over the past four quarters. MongoDB is trading at $414 at time of writing, up by approximately 106% from July of 2025. Another notable new position that Coleman initiated in the third quarter was a stake in streaming giant Netflix (NFLX) worth approximately $242.06 million. Besides Meta Platforms, other public companies that Coleman partially offloaded stakes in in the third quarter of 2025 include pharmaceutical firms Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NVO). In Eli Lilly, Coleman sold a stake worth approximately $1.18 billion, while offloading shares worth around $87.59 million in Novo Nordisk. Other stocks in which Coleman offloaded significant stakes include the world’s largest coatings company, Sherwin-Williams (SHW), cybsecurity firm Crowdstrike (CRWD) and fintech firm Chime Financial (CHYM). Coleman sold shares worth $299.5 million, $254.7 million and $178.8 million, respectively, in the three public firms.

Title: Abu Dhabi steel group eyes takeover of Gupta's UK empire
URL: https://news.sky.com/story/abu-dhabi-steel-group-eyes-takeover-of-guptas-uk-empire-13492700
Time Published: 2026-01-10T07:44:00Z

Arabian Gulf Steel Industries is among a small number of parties which have approached the Official Receiver about buying the UK's third-biggest steelmaker out of insolvency, Sky News learns. City editor @MarkKleinmanSky Saturday 10 January 2026 09:08, UK A UAE-based steel company has made an approach to buy Britain's third-biggest steel producer, months after it was declared "hopelessly insolvent" and fell into the hands of the Official Receiver. Sky News has learnt that Arabian Gulf Steel Industries (AGSI), which is headquartered in Abu Dhabi, is among a small number of parties which have lodged proposals to take control of the Speciality Steels UK (SSUK) business which until last summer was owned by the metals tycoon Sanjeev Gupta's Liberty Steel empire. The business collapsed into compulsory liquidation in August, sparking a scramble in Whitehall to find a buyer for it as part of efforts to preserve the UK's steelmaking capabilities. The SSUK business operates sites at Rotherham and Stocksbridge in South Yorkshire, and across its operations employed close to 1,500 people when it collapsed last summer. This weekend, it was unclear how advanced any discussions were between AGSI and the Official Receiver, while the terms of any proposal were also unclear. One source suggested that AGSI might be keen to secure financial backing from Britain's National Wealth Fund to support a takeover of SSUK and fund a resumption of steelmaking at its sites in Yorkshire. AGSI describes itself on its website as "the epitome of Net Zero steel", and has pledged to produce five million tons of steel by 2030, while reducing carbon dioxide emissions by more than 95% compared to traditional steelmaking processes. The company is privately owned and run by its founder and chief executive, Asam Hussain. AGSI did not respond to an emailed request for comment, but one source expressed scepticism that it would ultimately acquire the Liberty Speciality Steels business. A number of other parties have also expressed interest in buying the operations in recent months. Mr Gupta himself had secured backing from third parties including Blackrock, the world's biggest asset manager, although the prospect of him being chosen to repurchase the business appears to be extremely remote. An Insolvency Service spokesperson said: "We can confirm that the Official Receiver continues to progress bids for the sale of Speciality Steel UK. "The sales process is ongoing, with the aim to complete a sale at the earliest opportunity." In response to an enquiry from Sky News, a government spokesperson said: "We remain committed to a bright and sustainable future for steelmaking and steelmaking jobs in the UK. "The independent Official Receiver is carrying out his duties as liquidator, while we also make sure staff and local communities are supported." The National Wealth Fund failed to respond to an enquiry from Sky News. The sale process for SSUK comes during a period of broader uncertainty for the British steel sector, against the backdrop of US President Donald Trump's tariffs regime and a continued global glut of the metal. In November, Sky News revealed that ministers were drafting in bankers at Evercore to conduct a review of options for the industry. Peter Kyle, the business secretary, and UK Government Investments (UKGI), the Whitehall agency which manages taxpayers' interests in a range of companies, including the Post Office and Channel 4, are expected to consider whether to merge some of the remaining companies in the sector. These would include British Steel, the Scunthorpe-based producer which is legally owned by China's Jingye Group but which was seized by the government last April amid a threat to close its remaining blast furnaces. So far, the government has spent hundreds of millions of pounds on running British Steel. The government's move prevented the immediate loss of more than 3,000 jobs, although there remain questions about the company's viability as a standalone entity. "We continue to work with Jingye to find a pragmatic, realistic solution for the future of British Steel," Chris McDonald, the industry minister, said in a statement to parliament in November. "Our long-term aspiration for the company will require co-investment with the private sector to enable modernisation and decarbonisation, safeguard taxpayers' money and retain steelmaking in Scunthorpe." In 2024, ministers agreed to provide £500m in grant funding to Tata Steel, the Indian company, to install an electric arc furnace at its Port Talbot steelworks in Wales. The new facility is expected to be operational in 2027, but has been bitterly opposed by trade unions infuriated that the new funding was effectively used to drive through thousands of redundancies at the plant.

Sinéad Courtney One month ago, Australia implemented a world-first social media ban for those under the age of 16 in a bid to protect young people from harmful content. The move sparked conversation around the world with many countries, including Ireland and other EU member states, now examining whether they should follow suit. At the Stripe Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition in Dublin (YSTE), we spoke to teenagers from around the country about their views on whether Ireland should adopt similar social media legislation. "It probably would be a good idea, but I'm not sure how many people would be happy about it," Ewan Coulter, aged 16, from Castletroy College in Limerick said. "They’d probably struggle a bit at the start but after that it’d be fine, after the first few months" 16-year-old Ellen O’Shea from Ursuline College in Blackrock in Dublin thinks an all-out ban is drastic. "Instead of banning it, there should be better mediation of it," she explained. "I would make some content harder to access for younger children. I believe that sometimes through media, kids can be exposed to things they don’t need to be exposed, so I do see the point in it (a ban) slightly." Ellen said social media has been a valuable tool for her when it comes to education and preparing for YSTE. "Things like developing projects, schoolwork and all that, social media has really helped me, I wouldn’t be where I am today without it," she added. As a 15-year-old, Éabha McSorley from Gaelcholáiste Charraig Uí Leighin in Cork would no longer be able to use social media if a ban came in. "I think it would be a good idea. It could have positive benefits for people's mental health," she said. But Éabha would prefer to see platforms take more action to remove harmful content altogether as "then it would be a lot safer for children and teenagers to be online in the first place". Explained: Australia's social media ban for under-16s Barry Wilmot, aged 16, from Villiers School in Limerick does not believe a ban would actually stop under-16s from accessing social media. "I don’t think it would make much of a difference, especially if they were already using it prior to a ban, because there’s so many ways around these things," he explained. "I think that the amount of time it takes up from your life is a lot and there are better things you can be doing with your time, so maybe a limited use of social media or a controlled use would be better."

Title: AIL previews: Vengeance in the air as recent rivals meet again

Round 10 being the reverse fixtures from round nine just three weeks ago, there will be a fair whiff of vengeance in the bitingly Baltic mid-winter air around the Energia All-Ireland League this weekend. After the Friday night resumption in a Dublin derby between third-placed Lansdowne and second-placed St Mary’s, the champions and festive Division 1A leaders Clontarf resume their campaign in a repeat of the recent Bateman Cup final against Ballynahinch. The Ulster side led for 67 minutes at Castle Avenue before Clontarf claimed their first Bateman Cup with a 21-16 win thanks to replacement Ivan Soroka’s late try. He now starts in the absence of Alex Usanov while Charlie Ward is recalled at tighthead and both Paul Deeny, brother of Leinster’s Brian, replaces Alex Soroka, and Luke Brady return to the backrow. Ballynahinch, who haven’t beaten Clontarf since 2020, have slipped seven points off the top-four playoff places, so their need is acute. They make just two changes, namely Quinn Armstrong at inside centre and Daniel Bennett on the wing. Fourth-placed Terenure, who lead Cork Con on points difference, are seeking to end a run of three successive defeats after their 30-24 loss to Old Belvedere last time out. They are without Joshua Kenny, who is starting for Leinster against La Rochelle, and hooker John McKee compared to the last meeting, with Aran Egan at outhalf in a reshuffled backline which is notable for the presence of ex-Munster centre Peter Sylvestre for the first time this season as he is home on holidays from Miami. John Devine is also making his Connacht debut in Montpellier, with Eddie Kelly – another former Sevens winger – replacing Kenny. Max Russell reverts to hooker, with ex-Ospreys flanker Will Hickey also returning. Belvo make just two changes, bringing in winger Johnny Kiely and former Ireland under-19s outhalf Donagh O’Dwyer. Con host UCD, having taken a 36-19 away win last time out in Belfield, and are boosted by the return of loosehead Mark Donnelly following his recent loan spell with Ealing Trailfinders, as well as Ireland under-20s centre Eoghan Smyth. Danny Sheehan starts at hooker and Mark Skelly comes into the backrow, while Darragh French shifts from centre to fullback. Young Munster, who sit four points further back after consecutive bonus-point wins, were due to welcome back Evan O’Connell and Ruadhán Quinn but both are now travelling with Munster to Toulon, missing the repeat Munster derby away to Nenagh Ormond. The Tipperary side, who lost 57-10 three weeks ago, welcome back Munster’s ex-Connacht centre Sean O’Brien. Division 1B leaders Old Wesley host Blackrock while in 2A, fifth-placed Corinthians host leaders Barnhall and the only other unbeaten side in the AIL, 2B leaders Galwegians, travel to Skerries. Division 1A: Lansdowne v St Mary’s College, Aviva Stadium Back Pitch, (7.30pm, Friday); Ballynahinch v Clontarf, Ballymacarn Park; Cork Constitution v UCD, Temple Hill; Nenagh Ormond v Young Munster, New Ormond Park; Terenure College v Old Belvedere, Lakelands Park. Division 1B: Instonians v City Of Armagh, Shaw’s Bridge (2pm); Dublin University v Queen’s University, College Park; Garryowen v Highfield, Dooradoyle; Old Wesley v Blackrock College, Energia Park; UCC v Naas, The Mardyle. Division 2A: Old Crescent v Shannon, Takumi Park, (7.30pm, Friday); Ballymena v Dungannon, Eaton Park; Galway Corinthians v MU Barnhall, Corinthian Park; Greystones v Banbridge, Dr Hickey Park; Wanderers v Cashel, Merrion Road. Division 2B: Buccaneers v Clogher Valley, Dubarry Park; Enniscorthy v UL Bohemian, Alcast Park; Malone v Rainey, Gibson Park; Navan v Sligo, Balreask Old; Skerries v Galwegians, Holmpatrick.

Title: ‘You say things and you’re not going to please everyone’: Simon Zebo embraces punditry

The last time Munster played Toulon away in the Champions Cup, two years ago this weekend, Simon Zebo was the red 15. Without a win in their opening two pool matches, Munster trailed 10-0 after 23 minutes and were skidding towards a ditch. The airbag turned out to be a pair of tries. Zebo got the second. The creative credits were shared between the outhalf and the fullback, producer and director. Zebo spotted a thin peninsula of space behind the Toulon cover and shouted at team-mate Jack Crowley to kick. His sumptuous chip greeted Zebo on the first bounce. Behind the try line Zebo was swamped by Munster players, but a photographer, Laszlo Geczo, got a clean shot of Zebo’s wild eyes and the rapture on his face. Great photographs are never silent and Zebo’s roar is the soundtrack of the picture. His top jaw and his bottom jaw are frozen at full stretch, like a hippopotamus’s. As a player this was his shtick: flashes of lightning. “The brighter the lights the better I play,” Zebo had said in an interview before the game. That was his 35th try in the Champions Cup, which put him third on the all-time list. It was also his last. By the end of that season his heart and his legs had reached a state of irreconcilable differences and Zebo retired. “I would have liked to think that I could have played another year, but definitely not two,” Zebo says now. “It wasn’t the matches. I could have played matches for another three years if it was just that. It was the weekly toll that was being taken. Getting to Saturday to play the match was getting harder and harder.” In retirement, though, the bright lights didn’t go dark. Television was drawn to him. He had charisma and knowledge of an ever-changing game and he excited a response. Not everybody was attracted to his innate bubbliness and his naked Munster bias, but that was part of his magnetism too. Television is competing for eyeballs in a bear-pit market. Broadcasters need pundits who can cut through the din. They can’t afford to serve lukewarm tea. While he was still playing, Zebo occasionally turned up in a TV studio, but this season he has been a consistent presence on Premier Sports. When Munster beat Leinster by 31-14 in Croke Park last October, Zebo’s first big outing for the station, his unbridled joy dominated the coverage. When the game finished, he was unleashed with a roving mike to conduct post-match interviews, and he didn’t try to conceal his emotion or defuse his giddiness or hide the fact that he was talking to former team-mates. What did viewers think? Nobody was ambivalent. Either you loved it or you didn’t. Before the match Zebo did a piece comparing the sides’ outhalves, Jack Crowley and Sam Prendergast. He expressed his marginal preference for Crowley with a series of cogent points that praised and criticised both players. But he made it clear how much he admired the Leinster 10. “I just want to put it on the record, Sam Prendergast is an amazing player – because there are a few Leinster crybabies in my inbox,” he said with a laugh. A post shared by Premier Sports (@premsportstv) That segment was shared on Premier Sports’ social media channels and generated nearly 1.5 million impressions, an astonishing number compared to their whistle-to-whistle TV coverage of the match, which reached a peak audience of 78,000. For every broadcaster now, the battle is on many fronts. “I’m always up for having a laugh,” Zebo says. “I want to bring that energy and just show as much personality as possible. I was never a big fan of the generic answers you were used to hearing over and over again. “I’m not afraid to show my personality. People watching want the pundits to be genuine and I think people see beyond the BS when people put up fake personas or pretend to be super polished and not have any loyalties. “I think if I was watching Man United and Man City I would want to watch people who have been in those changing rooms and understand the club, the culture, the history. “If the pundit doesn’t have that energy or connection with the club then I don’t think you will portray the energy needed for the viewer to enjoy the game. That’s where I’d be at. “I’m still trying to find my feet as well. I’m by no means any polished article. I’d love to be super comfortable, as if you were sitting down on the sofa with me watching the game. That would be the ideal scenario. “At the moment, I’m trying to be as insightful as I can and have a bit of fun with it at the same time.” Sky Sports gave up on the pretence of impartiality years ago. In their football coverage there will invariably be somebody in the studio with an affiliation to each club. Rugby was slower to go down that road. Historically, the punditry has been more urbane, as if a game bound up with such complexity required laboratory analysis. There must be a middle ground. When Leinster beat Munster by 13-8 in Thomond Park last month, Leo Cullen came to the post-match interview with a riff he had prepared about Munster having more Leinster ex-pats in their side than Limerick-born players. It was Cullen’s first television appearance as a stand-up. Though his point was made for general consumption, he aimed it at Zebo, who all of a sudden was trapped at the bottom of a ruck, taking a shoeing from a man not wearing studs. It was compelling TV and when Premier released it on their social media channels it attracted about a million impressions; their audience during their exclusive broadcast of the match had peaked at 163,000. “I had to take my medicine,” Zebo says. “As he was slagging me, I was actually counting the amount of [Munster players] who came through Leinster and I was just like, ‘I’m going to have to bite my tongue here’.” In the online world tongue-biting is not a skill much practised. “That’s always the case. I’m not afraid of them. I’ve had them all my life, don’t worry. You say things and you know you’re not going to please everyone. It’s being comfortable in your own skin and saying what you really believe anyway, regardless.” As a player that was his manifesto too: he was true to his instincts. As a rookie on Ireland’s 2012 tour of New Zealand, and a bolter picked for the first Test, he was asked in a press conference what he thought he would bring to the team? “I like to run with the ball,” Zebo said. “I like to attack a lot.” Even though he took a conventional path from Presentation Brothers College, through Cork Constitution to Munster’s academy, he successfully navigated the system without surrendering his individuality. On parallel tracks during his teenage years in Cork, Zebo continued to play hurling with Blackrock, Gaelic football with St Michaels and soccer with Avondale United. All of it fired his imagination. The hackneyed term for a player like Zebo would be “mercurial”, with all that suggests about unpredictability. That description is not always applied as a compliment. Across all team sports the tension between structure and risk is greater now than ever, and that was where Zebo pursued his career: in the febrile space between instruction and instinct, between safe and hairy. Zebo finished his career with 35 Ireland caps and the general feeling was that it left him short. When Joe Schmidt took over as Ireland coach he didn’t pick Zebo for the guts of a year. Schmidt was obsessive about structure and detail, and his successful Irish teams made very few unscripted movements. And yet, 29 of Zebo’s caps came on Schmidt’s watch, and in the last two seasons before he signed for Racing 92, he made 20 appearances for Ireland, 15 as a starter. Schmidt wasn’t blind to Zebo’s charms, but ultimately the issue was trust. When Ireland won the Six Nations in 2015, Zebo played every minute of the first four games until the last match against Scotland when he was omitted from the match day squad. That day, Zebo represented a risk that Schmidt wasn’t prepared to take. “It’s kind of hard. Joe had a game plan and it was an incredibly successful game plan. He was an incredibly successful coach, so it obviously worked. But different styles can suit different players. That doesn’t diminish Joe or his ability, but it was just my style might have better suited to Rob Penney, when he was at Munster – he was amazing. “And Rassie Erasmus as well – he was probably my best ever coach. He was the most incredibly detailed, inspirational man manager. He did everything – everything. He held the team to a standard like no other and he was by far the best for the culture around the club. He brought a family spirit to the club – he was amazing. You’d go to war for him any day. “As soon as he left Munster we were all gutted because we knew success with him was on the horizon. We were all thinking, ‘He’s definitely going to win the World Cup with South Africa’.” Moving to Racing 92 for three seasons in his late 20s ended Zebo’s international career in effect, but it satisfied his desire for adventure. The IRFU couldn’t match the offer on the table either. In 144 games in French club rugby, Zebo scored 60 tries. Racing 92 embraced the flamboyance and the risk. “It suited me brilliantly. The style of rugby I enjoyed was the French style of play. You’d love to have been still available [for Ireland]. I would love to have been rewarded for my form while I was in France. But they were just the rules in place. “I made my decision and I wouldn’t change that. In terms of experiencing the full journey [in my career] part of that was playing in the Top 14. That was very important to me. It’s something I look back on with enormous pride.” Zebo settled back in Cork with his wife Elvira and their four children. All of them are playing the sports that he did as a child. His eldest son and daughter play on an under-11 rugby team in Cork Con that Donncha O’Callaghan coaches. They all go to the same school as Peter O’Mahony’s children. Zebo plays five-a-side soccer with childhood friends who remained his best friends. His children hang out at Blackrock hurling club, just like he did at their age. His life in rugby went through so many cycles and returned him here, unharmed and unchanged. O’Callaghan tells a story about being on a players committee in Munster when Zebo broke into the first team squad. Even in that giant playground Zebo’s lust for fun was outside the norm. Eventually, somebody on the player’s committee said the smile needed to be knocked off Zebo’s face. Nobody ever managed it. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Wall Street’s crypto debate is over as banks go all-in on BTC, stablecoins, tokenized cash

Big banks aren’t debating crypto anymore — they’re building it. From tokenized cash to ETFs, Wall Street is quietly going onchain. Cointelegraph in your social feed For years, major banks treated cryptocurrency primarily as a risk to be contained. That posture is now giving way to a more deliberate form of engagement. Rather than debating crypto’s legitimacy, banks are increasingly deciding how and where to integrate it, from regulated investment products to blockchain-based payment rails. This shift is on full display in this week’s Crypto Biz. JPMorgan is extending its US dollar deposit token onto new blockchain infrastructure, signaling that tokenized cash is moving closer to production use within global banking. Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, is positioning itself to offer exposure to Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL) through exchange-traded funds (ETFs), potentially bringing crypto investments to millions of wealth management clients. Barclays has made its first bet on stablecoin infrastructure, backing settlement rails designed to connect regulated issuers with financial institutions. And Bank of America has taken another step toward normalization by allowing advisers to recommend spot Bitcoin ETFs to clients. Together, these moves suggest the banking sector is no longer content to watch from the sidelines. JPMorgan announced plans to issue its US dollar-denominated deposit token, JPM Coin (JPMD), natively on the Canton Network, marking another step by Wall Street toward production-ready blockchain infrastructure. Digital Asset, the developer of the Canton Network, and Kinexys by JPMorgan will extend JPM Coin from its existing rails onto Canton’s privacy-focused layer-1 blockchain, enabling regulated digital cash to move across interoperable networks. According to an announcement shared with Cointelegraph, JPM Coin, described as the first bank-issued, US dollar-denominated deposit token for institutional clients, represents a digital claim on JPMorgan’s dollar deposits and is designed to facilitate faster, more secure movement of regulated money on public blockchains. “This collaboration brings to life the vision of regulated digital cash that can move at the speed of markets,” said Yuval Rooz, co-founder and CEO of Digital Asset. US investment bank Morgan Stanley is entering the cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund market, with proposed products offering exposure to Bitcoin and Solana, following the strong debut of spot crypto ETFs in the United States. The bank has filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to launch two investment vehicles, the Morgan Stanley Bitcoin Trust and the Morgan Stanley Solana Trust, designed to provide passive investment exposure to the performance of their underlying digital assets. If approved, the funds could be made available to more than 19 million clients within Morgan Stanley’s wealth management division, significantly expanding access to crypto-linked investment products. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have ranked among the most successful ETF launches on record, attracting substantial inflows during their first two years of trading. Momentum has continued into the new year, with renewed investor demand driving fresh inflows during the first trading sessions. London-based banking giant Barclays has made its first investment in a stablecoin-focused company, signaling traditional finance’s growing interest in digital dollar infrastructure. The bank announced an undisclosed investment in Ubyx, a US-based stablecoin clearing platform that connects regulated issuers with financial institutions to facilitate settlement and interoperability. The move also marks a notable shift for Barclays, which in recent years has publicly emphasized the risks associated with digital assets. “This investment aligns with Barclays’ approach to explore opportunities based on new forms of digital money, such as stablecoins,” the bank said in a statement. Ubyx has previously raised $10 million in seed funding, backed by Galaxy and Coinbase. The company was founded by Tony McLaughlin, a former Citibank executive. US investors may soon receive recommendations to buy Bitcoin ETFs from Bank of America’s private bank and Merrill Edge platforms, adding to evidence of Bitcoin’s growing integration into traditional finance. The bank’s chief investment office has approved coverage of four U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including products offered by Bitwise, Fidelity, BlackRock and Grayscale. Collectively, the funds manage more than $100 billion in Bitcoin assets. The move comes roughly a month after Bank of America reportedly advised wealth management clients to allocate 1% to 4% of their portfolios to digital assets. “For investors with a strong interest in thematic innovation and comfort with elevated volatility, a modest allocation of 1% to 4% in digital assets could be appropriate,” Chris Hyzy, chief investment officer at Bank of America Private Bank, told Yahoo.

Title: BNY Rolls Out Tokenized Deposits for Near Real-Time Institutional Settlement

© 2026 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. BNY introduces tokenized deposit capability mirroring $55 trillion in institutional cash balances on its private blockchain for faster collateral settlement. BNY, one of the largest global financial services platforms with over $55 trillion in assets, has launched a tokenized deposit capability on its Digital Assets platform. This new feature mirrors institutional clients’ existing cash balances on a private blockchain. It enables near-real-time settlement. The service begins with collateral and margin workflows. BNY’s traditional core banking systems keep all official records in their own private blockchain. BNY launched this new service after deploying tokenization services for money market funds with Goldman Sachs, which was announced in July 2025. According to the company blog, BNY creates on-chain digital book entries that correspond 1:1 to clients’ existing demand deposit claims at the bank. It does not issue new money. BNY records these tokens on its private, permissioned blockchain, which provides a secure, internal network for authorized users. The bank maintains the legal deposits on conventional ledgers for regulatory and reporting purposes. When a client needs to meet margin calls or move collateral, participating institutions can transfer the mirrored balances on-chain in near real time. This setup aims to cut settlement frictions. It also supports an always-on operating model. According to their announcement, the system does not bypass bank supervision or existing risk controls. BREAKING: #BNY expands digital cash capabilities by enabling the on‑chain mirrored representation of client deposit balances on its #DigitalAssets platform via #tokenized deposits. This launch helps advance BNY’s ambitions to support programmable, on‑chain cash for institutional… pic.twitter.com/gQRiZuS0va — BNY (@BNYglobal) January 9, 2026 The rollout first targets collateral and margin workflows. Here, intraday liquidity needs and settlement timing are the greatest sources of sensitivity. Institutions shift tokenized balances across the network within seconds to meet margin requirements. They avoid reliance on legacy cut-off times or batch processes. “As institutional markets move toward always-on operating models, BNY is committed to innovating and helping define how cash moves across the modern financial system,” said Carolyn Weinberg, BNY’s Chief Product and Innovation Officer. BNY is not the only company launching tokenized products. BlackRock, another major financial company, has announced that the “tokenization of all assets” has begun. It expects to tokenize more than $4.1 trillion in traditional products. Standard Chartered launched a similar tokenized deposit product in December 2025. Goldman Sachs also continually investigates and develops new tokenized products. This new institutional trend follows the big impetus set in 2025, with the development of Real World Assets (RWA). Over the last year, the real-world use cases of RWA and related projects have grown explosively. Announcements like this show that this technology will likely remain trendy in 2026.

Title: Here's What President Trump Said About Intel's CEO That's Boosting the Stock Friday

Intel's stock hit its highest point in nearly two years Friday, thanks to a social media post. The chipmaker's stock was up nearly 10% in recent trading, making it one of the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 Friday after President Trump praised Intel (INTC) CEO Lip-Bu Tan on social media. "I just finished a great meeting with the very successful Intel CEO, Lip-Bu Tan," Trump said in a Truth Social post Thursday, and that the U.S. government is "proud" to be an Intel shareholder. Just a few months earlier, Trump had pushed for Lip-Bu Tan to resign amid concerns about Tan's stakes in Chinese companies. However, Trump changed his tune just days later after meeting with the CEO in August, and brokered a deal that saw the U.S. government take a 10% stake in the chipmaker. Intel's stock has gotten a big boost from Trump's show of support, though it remains well off its historical highs as the embattled chipmaker works to convince investors of a sustainable turnaround in its business. A high-profile partnership with Nvidia (NVDA) followed not long after the government announced its stake, helped lift Intel's stock in the second half of last year, along with rumors about potential new customers. The shares nearly doubled in value last year, with most of those gains coming between early August and December. Intel's recent gains have also made the stock one of the top performers in the S&P 500 to start the year, with shares adding close to one-quarter of their value in January so far. A number of other semiconductor stocks followed Intel higher Friday, including Broadcom (AVGO), Micron Technology (MU), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), contributing to a broader market rally that pushed the S&P 500 to a new high.

Title: Markets wrap European stocks boosted by Glencore surge

European shares ended Friday at a record high, powered by a surge in miner Glencore. On the trade front, European Union member states confirmed a majority support a free-trade agreement with South American bloc Mercosur. Global market sentiment also received a lift as investors reacted to US labour market data. The Irish index of shares ended the week marginally higher, with gains in food and construction stocks buoying the market. But banking shares remained mixed, with AIB notching up a gain on Friday of just under 1 per cent, while Bank of Ireland fell back slightly as the week drew to a close. Among construction stocks, insulation specialist Kingspan added 2.8 per cent, while home builders Glenveagh and Cairn gained 0.9 per cent and 2.2 per cent respectively. Elsewhere, Ryanair saw its shares shed 1.5 per cent, while ferry group ICG fell by 0.3 per cent. The blue-chip FTSE 100 recorded ⁠its second straight weekly gain and its highest ever close of ⁠10,126.6 points, marking a 0.8 per cent gain on ⁠the day. Shares in miner Glencore jumped ⁠9.6 per cent to their highest since July 2024 following news it is ‌in ​talks ‍with Rio Tinto about a takeover that would create the world’s largest mining group, valued at almost $207 billion (€178 billion). London-listed shares of Rio closed 3 per cent lower. Among other stocks, Sainsbury’s fell 5.3 per cent after Britain’s second-largest supermarket group reported a fall in general merchandise ‌and clothing sales for the Christmas quarter. IAG fell 2.7 per cent after the airline group named ⁠the finance chief of its British Airways unit, Jose Antonio Barrionuevo, as the group’s new chief financial officer, due to start in June. The STOXX 600 index climbed 1 per cent on Friday, with technology stocks leading the advance and logging their best week in nearly two years. Dutch chip equipment maker ASML added 6.8 per cent and was the biggest gainer in the tech index after HSBC raised its price target on the stock. Germany’s Infineon rose 2.4 per cent, while STMicroelectronics added 2.9 per cent. Tech shares also got a boost after upbeat fourth-quarter results from TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker. Shares in Anglo American rose 2.7 per cent, a day after a filing from the European Commission showed that the miner’s deal with Canada’s Teck Resources is heading for antitrust clearance in Europe. Defence stocks led weekly advances, with a near 10 per cent gain – their best showing since November 2020 – after US president Donald Trump called for higher defence spending. The retail rout carried on from the previous session. Pandora warned of weaker 2025 sales growth, sending shares of the jewellery maker down 13 per cent. US equities rose on Friday to new all-time highs, with the S&P 500 Index climbing 0.5 per cent at 11.30am in New York, on pace for its second closing high of 2026. The technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index rallied 0.8 per cent, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4 per cent. In the consumer sector, Mattel slid 3.27 per cent and Nike more than 1 per cent. Traders were also parsing job numbers. US employers added fewer jobs than expected in December, suggesting the labour market continued to soften at year-end, data released earlier in the day showed. The report supported expectations that the Federal Reserve will hold rates steady at its January meeting but left the door open for cuts later in the year. On the corporate side, Meta Platforms agreed to a series of electricity deals to power data centres that will make it the biggest buyer of nuclear power among its hyperscaler peers. US-listed shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing are up after the company reported strong December sales. Qualcomm shares were down after Mizuho Securities downgraded the chipmaker to neutral from outperform. – Additional reporting: Reuters/Bloomberg From maternity leave to remote working: Submit your work-related questions here Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Bitcoin’s next super rally could depend on this key data point

Long-term Bitcoin holders sold nearly $300 billion worth of BTC in 2025, but as this sell pressure declines, a bullish outlook for 2026 has emerged. Cointelegraph in your social feed Update (Jan.11, 2026, 7.35 UTC): This article has been updated to correct the LTH supply figure to 13.6 million BTC. Bitcoin’s long-term holders (LTHs) went through one of the most aggressive distribution phases on record in 2025. While the scale of selling rattled the market, onchain data analysis suggests that this pressure may be fading, possibly outlining the next bullish period for BTC price. Key takeaways: Long-term holders distributed about $300 billion in BTC in 2025, marking a historic supply reset. Heavy LTH selling has occurred near cycle peaks or during structural transitions, not at the start of new downtrends. With selling pressure stalling, the next phase may hinge on how early the long-term holder supply stabilizes. An amount of Bitcoin (BTC) that had remained unmoved for at least two years moved onchain sharply in 2025. Nearly $300 billion worth of Bitcoin that had been dormant for over a year re-entered circulation. The 30 days from Nov. 15 to Dec. 14, 2025, marked one of the heaviest long-term holder (LTH) distribution periods in more than five years. Since 2019, sharp declines in long-term holder (LTH) supply have rarely appeared in isolation. They have surfaced during phases when Bitcoin’s trend was already under strain, either approaching exhaustion or undergoing a structural shift. In 2018, the LTH supply fell to 12 million BTC from 13 million, with selling intensity peaking when the 30-day distribution reached 1.08 million BTC in December. At that point, Bitcoin had already spent months declining. Price bottomed near $3,500 in February 2019, before stabilizing and rallying to $11,000 by mid-year, illustrating how heavy LTH selling could precede recovery rather than mark its end. The 2020–2021 cycle unfolded differently. LTH supply dropped to 11.65 million BTC from 13.7 million BTC, while Bitcoin price rose to $61,000 from $14,000. The 30-day distribution peak of 891,000 BTC did not immediately halt the rally. Instead, selling persisted as prices rose, gradually eroding upside momentum before the cycle ultimately rolled over, a reminder that LTH distribution can accompany expansion before defining its limits. During the 2024–2025 bull run, supply declined to 14.5 million BTC from 15.8 million BTC, with the 30-day distribution peaking at 758,000 BTC. Price topped slightly earlier in March, and both metrics then moved sideways through Q2–Q3, reinforcing a familiar pattern: Price strength tends to fade as long-term holders step up distribution. The final phase in mid-to-late 2025 proved more abrupt. LTH supply briefly recovered to 15.4 million BTC in June, before collapsing to 13.5 million BTC by December, the sharpest decline on record. Price weakness appeared in October, but the most selling followed later, with the largest-ever 30-day distribution peak of 1.14 million BTC in November. That sequence suggests capitulation rather than orderly profit-taking, marking a reset rather than a continuation of the prior trend. Related: Bitcoin RSI hints at $105K BTC price rebound as bull signals multiply Since December, the LTH supply has stopped falling, currently around 13.6 million BTC, while Bitcoin has entered a sideways range. Additional confirmation comes from the long-term/short-term holder supply ratio. Every time this ratio has fallen to –0.5 or below, Bitcoin has either entered a base-building phase or rallied to new highs within weeks. In December, the ratio dropped to about -0.53, after which price volatility compressed and momentum stalled, consistent with a reset rather than trend continuation. Thus this combination, aggressive distribution followed by supply stabilization, has historically marked transition phases rather than trend continuation. If the trend repeats, the consolidation through Q1to Q2 could act as a base-building period, with any sustained rally more likely to emerge later, potentially into Q3.

In a blog post, the institution co-founded by Alexander Hamilton described the move as a key step in bolstering its ability to move “programmable, on‑chain cash” across digital rails. The product is powered by the bank’s private and permissioned blockchain, BNY added. The product is for both institutions and “digital natives,” it added. BNY described its tokenized deposits as digital book entries representing funds that participating clients would be able to withdraw through traditional means. The bank said the tokens will initially be used in circumstances related to collateral and margin. The move underscored how Wall Street incumbents are increasingly using digital assets as a way to augment their existing businesses. BNY highlighted the ability of tokenized deposits to “reduce settlement friction” and “improve liquidity efficiency” in various settings. The company noted that clients’ balances, although they will be represented on-chain, will continue to be recorded with BNY’s traditional systems for compliance purposes. In a statement, BNY Chief Product and Innovation Officer Carolyn Weinberg underscored the trusted nature of the institution’s bank deposits. The bank, which has existed for more than 240 years, safeguarded $57.8 trillion in assets on behalf of clients, as of September. The New York-based behemoth also has $2.1 trillion in assets under management. As competitors like JPMorgan expand tokenized deposits to various networks, BNY said that its version of the product will serve as “the connective tissue of BNY’s digital infrastructure,” which includes a tokenized money-market fund with Goldman Sachs that was unveiled in July. After forming its digital assets unit in 2021, the company started managing private keys for clients the following year, with the debut of custody services for Bitcoin and Ethereum. BNY’s blog post included statements from around a dozen crypto-native firms, including crypto bank Anchorage Digital, stablecoin issuers Circle and Paxos, BlackRock-backed tokenization specialist Securitize, and Ripple’s institutional prime brokerage platform, Ripple Prime. “BNY taking this step to enable tokenized deposits is a milestone moment for digital cash adoption,” Anchorage Digital co-founder and CEO Nathan McCauley said. Citadel Securities, which said in July that it accounts for 25% of U.S. equity volume, also described tokenization as crucial for the future of finance. The market-making giant's CEO, Ken Griffin, had in 2021 called crypto a “jihadist call” against the U.S. dollar.

Amazon shares dipped as reports confirmed the retail giant may slash 30,000 corporate roles by May 2026. This follow-up to the 14,000 cuts in late 2025 targets 10% of its white-collar staff. The move aims to eliminate "managerial bloat" and fund a $100 billion AI pivot. While trading at $245.98, the stock faces pressure as internal documents suggest 600,000 workers could eventually be replaced by automation by 2033.

The tech industry saw an estimated 245,000 jobs lost globally in 2025, with the US accounting for the majority of layoffs. Factors such as post-pandemic overhiring corrections and increased AI adoption are driving companies to reduce headcount. Every industry faces job cuts, especially in tumultuous economic times, new technologies replacing existing jobs, and so on. Unfortunately, it looks like the tech sector is experiencing global layoffs, with an estimation of nearly 245,000 jobs lost in 2025 alone. According to a recent report from RationalFX, they estimated that about 245,000 people experienced layoffs on a global scale in the tech sector in 2025. Based on their figures, the US was the most affected, with a little over 170,000 jobs lost. This accounts for approximately 69.7% of all global tech layoffs in 2025. The largest contributor to this was Intel. At the end of 2024, the company employed about 109,000 people, but it later revealed plans to drop those figures down further to 75,000 in 2025. Other tech companies also experienced similar layoffs. This includes Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, IBM, HP, and Salesforce, just to name a few. India also experienced pretty big layoffs, with an estimated 19,000 jobs lost in 2025. This was followed by Japan at a little over 11,000, Ireland, and Switzerland, rounding out the top five countries with the biggest layoffs. So, what’s happening, and why are jobs in the tech sector getting cut? There are a number of reasons. Firstly, RationalFX suggests that this is part of a post-pandemic correction. During the COVID-19 pandemic, while jobs were lost, there were a lot of jobs created as well. This is due to a rise in demand for work-from-home solutions, entertainment, food delivery, and so on. However, following the end of the pandemic, many tech companies realized they had overhired and are working towards correcting that. Another reason why we’re seeing jobs cut is because of, you guessed it, AI. AI allows users to automate and complete tasks in minutes—tasks that would have taken a human hours, days, or weeks. This means that companies can dump massive reports into AI and get summaries almost instantly. They can also use it to generate reports, make predictions, and identify patterns. This makes certain positions redundant. We’re also seeing how AI can generate impressive images and videos with a few simple prompts. But this isn’t necessarily doom and gloom. Like they say, when a door closes, another opens. When smartphones were created, suddenly being an app developer became a more viable career. Thanks to social media, being a content creator is also now a career for some. We’re not sure what the future holds for jobs in the tech sector, so we’ll have to wait and see.

Title: Are Leaders Responsible for Employee Wellbeing?

Time Published: 2026-01-09T15:43:54Z
Full Content:
Work is increasingly understood as a powerful driver of wellbeing, and wellbeing as a factor shaping how organizations perform and endure. We asked Yale SOM leadership expert David Tate how leaders can create environments that support wellbeing without sacrificing rigor, accountability, or results. Has there been a shift in understanding of the relationship between work and wellbeing? Is more expected of leaders now? Yes, there has been a notable shift in how scholars and practitioners view the connection between work and wellbeing. Historically, work was seen primarily as a source of economic security and identity, with wellbeing considered a secondary outcome or the personal responsibility of the worker. Contemporary research, however, emphasizes that work is a significant determinant of psychological, emotional, and physical health and that the organizational environment profoundly influences employee wellbeing. Meta-analyses show that poor work conditions—high workload, low control, and limited social support—are associated with elevated risks of burnout, cardiovascular disease, and mental health disorders (Kivimäki et al., 2015). Conversely, positive work experiences, meaningful work, and supportive leadership are linked to greater engagement, satisfaction, and psychological wellbeing (Harter et al., 2003; Bakker & Demerouti, 2017). The boundary between supportive and intrusive is crossed when leaders inquire about personal details unrelated to work, make assumptions about motives, or exert pressure under the guise of wellbeing. These insights have reshaped expectations for leaders. Modern leadership is increasingly understood not only as driving results but also as cultivating environments that support employee wellbeing. Leaders are expected to demonstrate emotional intelligence and empathy and to be aware of how organizational practices affect psychological health (Goleman, Boyatzis, & McKee, 2013). Organizations are increasingly integrating employee wellbeing and psychological safety into strategic priorities, with leaders and executives explicitly accountable for creating conditions that support learning, engagement, and sustainable high performance (Edmondson, 2019; Gallup, 2023). The emergence of chief wellbeing officers and wellbeing dashboards illustrates that wellbeing is no longer solely an individual responsibility but a leadership and organizational concern (Grabarek & Sawyer, 2025). How can leaders pay attention to the wellbeing of employees and still be rigorous and high-performing? Leaders can support wellbeing while maintaining high performance by embedding wellbeing into the very definition of organizational success. Empirical research shows that workplaces emphasizing employee wellbeing often achieve superior outcomes, including higher engagement, lower turnover, improved innovation, and stronger financial performance (Harter et al., 2003; Bakker & Demerouti, 2017; De Neve & Ward, 2025). Effective strategies include: Importantly, leaders should maintain high standards of rigor while making it clear that it should not come at the expense of personal health or ethical behavior. Evidence suggests that teams led by emotionally intelligent leaders who balance accountability with care are more resilient and productive over time (Cherniss, 2010; O’Boyle et al., 2011). What role should wellbeing play in performance management and feedback conversations? How do you draw the line between being supportive and being intrusive as a leader? Wellbeing should be an integral component of performance management, framed in ways that support rather than monitor employees. Research indicates that employees perform better when leaders attend to both technical and human aspects of work (Grawitch et al., 2006; Grant, Christianson, & Price, 2007). Best practices include: The boundary between supportive and intrusive is crossed when leaders inquire about personal details unrelated to work, make assumptions about motives, or exert pressure under the guise of wellbeing. Respecting personal autonomy and confidentiality is critical. Leaders should maintain curiosity, empathy, and transparency while staying within professional boundaries (Edmondson, 2019; Kulik et al., 2016). Integrating wellbeing into performance management enhances engagement, reduces burnout, and promotes sustainable performance. When framed appropriately, wellbeing is a powerful lever for high performance rather than a distraction from it.

Title: Betting on More Rate Cuts, Boomers Are Buying the 2026 Small Dogs of the Dow
URL: https://247wallst.com/investing/2026/01/09/betting-on-lower-rates-in-2026-boomers-are-buying-the-small-dogs-of-the-dow/

Investing A change at the top of the Federal Reserve could pave the way for more rate cuts in 2026. After three rate cuts in 2025, investors could see two more in 2026. Quality high-yield companies like the Small Dogs of the Dow could rule in 2026. Sending You to Google News in 3 © marekuliasz / iStock via Getty Images The Dogs of the Dow is a well-known strategy first published in 1991 by Michael O’Higgins. The plan aims to maximize investment returns by purchasing the 10 highest-yielding dividend stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average each year. The highest-yielding stocks are also the lowest-priced stocks in the venerable average, as the lower a stock (or bond) is priced, the higher the attached yield or coupon becomes. Since the turn of the century, the Dogs of the Dow have outperformed the overall Dow, and the Small Dogs of the Dow, which are the five highest-yielding stocks, even more so. The fact that investors are buying the highest-yielding companies in the venerable index improves the chances for total return gains. From 2000 through the early 2020s, the Dogs strategy posted strong average annual returns, generally beating the Dow by a few percentage points over the entire period. The plan is not foolproof; it struggled during the dot-com bust (early 2000s) and the tech-driven growth surge post-pandemic (2020 to 2021), when growth stocks soared, and value stocks lagged. They also lagged in 2025 as the AI-driven rally continued for the third straight year. The Dogs often shine in tough markets (like 2008 or 2022), protecting investor capital much better than the broader market by holding stable, high-yielding blue-chip companies. This makes them an excellent choice for Baby Boomers seeking safety and passive income. While the AI/data center rally has pushed stocks and indices to all-time highs, and it could still be a force in 2026, the reality is that the stock market, as measured by the S&P 500, is expensive. It trades at 31 times trailing earnings and 24 times forward earnings. With the midterm elections on the way this year, investors can expect some heightened volatility. So, the Small Dogs may be the perfect play for 2026 for growth and income investors wary of a major sell-off. alexei_tm / iStock via Getty Images Dividend stocks like the Small Dogs of the Dow offer investors a reliable source of passive income. Passive income is characterized by its ability to generate revenue without requiring the earner’s continuous active effort, making it a desirable financial strategy for those seeking to diversify their income streams or achieve financial independence. The following are the Small Dogs of the Dow. Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ) is an American multinational telecommunications company that continues to offer tremendous value. It trades at 9.13 times its estimated 2026 earnings and pays a 6.72% dividend. Verizon provides a range of communications, technology, information, and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses, and government entities worldwide. Verizon’s trailing 12-month interest coverage ratio is 4.6× to 5.0×, providing ample cushion for dividend payments. With a very predictable revenue stream from telecom services, the company has less exposure to commodity cycles. In addition, the large scale helps in financing and absorbing shocks. It operates in two segments: The Consumer segment provides wireless services across the United States through Verizon and TracFone networks, as well as through wholesale and other arrangements. It also provides fixed wireless access (FWA) broadband through its wireless networks and related equipment and devices, such as: The segment also offers wireline services in the Mid-Atlantic and northeastern United States through its fiber-optic network, Verizon Fios product portfolio, and copper-based network. The Business segment provides wireless and wireline communications services and products, including: Network access services to deliver various IoT services and products to businesses, government customers, and wireless and wireline carriers in the United States and internationally. TD Cowen has a Buy rating and a $51 price target on the stock. This American multinational energy company, primarily focused on oil and gas, is a safer option for investors looking to position themselves in the energy sector. Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX) pays a substantial 4.34% dividend, which it raised by 5% earlier this year. This integrated giant operates energy and chemicals businesses worldwide and offers investors excellent credit ratings (AA), diversified operations, strong margins, and a long history of paying and raising dividends yearly. Its Upstream segment is involved in the following: The Downstream segment engages in: It also involves cash management, debt financing, insurance operations, real estate, and technology businesses. Chevron announced in late 2023 that it had entered into a definitive agreement with Hess Corp. (NYSE: HES) to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Hess in an all-stock transaction valued at $53 billion. The transaction’s total enterprise value, including debt, is $60 billion. The deal closed last July, providing a solid boost to Chevron’s third-quarter earnings, which exceeded analysts’ expectations. Wells Fargo has an Overweight rating with a huge $196 target price. Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE: MRK) develops and produces medicines, vaccines, biological therapies, and animal health products. It is not just a healthcare company but a global force in the industry. This healthcare giant is a no-brainer, down over 30% over the past year while paying a solid 3.02% dividend. The company operates through two segments. The Pharmaceutical segment offers human health pharmaceutical products in: The Animal Health segment discovers, develops, manufactures, and markets veterinary pharmaceuticals, vaccines, health management solutions and services, as well as digitally connected identification, traceability, and monitoring products. Merck serves: Merck’s growth is a result of its efforts and strategic collaborations. The company works with AstraZeneca, Bayer, Eisai, Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, and Gilead Sciences to jointly develop and commercialize long-acting HIV treatments, demonstrating a commitment to innovation and growth. BMO Capital Markets’ target price for the Outperform-rated shares is a massive $130. Procter & Gamble Co. (NYSE: PG) was founded more than 185 years ago as a soap-and-candle company. It has paid dividends to shareholders since 1891, raised them for 70 straight years, and currently has a 2.95% dividend yield. The company focuses on providing branded consumer packaged goods worldwide. Segments include: The company’s products are sold in approximately 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, e-commerce, including social commerce channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores, including airport duty-free stores, high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics stores, and professional channels. It also sells directly to individual consumers. It has operations in approximately 70 countries. Procter & Gamble offers products under such brands as: Jefferies has a Buy rating with a $179 target price. Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ: AMGN) discovers, develops, manufactures, and delivers human therapeutics worldwide. This biotech giant remains a top stock for investors to buy, offering a safer investment with a 2.75% dividend yield to capitalize on the massive growth potential of biosimilars. Amgen focuses on: The company’s products include: HSBC has a huge $425 target price and a Buy rating. Our Top 2026 Passive Income Ultra-High-Yield Picks With Up to 10% Dividends.

Historical performance patterns are shaping expectations of a strong first quarter for Bitcoin, especially following a muted year that preceded it. Data shows that Q1 has treated Bitcoin well, even in extreme bear market conditions. Since the negative first quarter of 2018, subsequent Q1 periods have delivered relatively resilient returns, even in the notoriously bearish 2022. After more than a month of sideways movement, price action has settled into a clearly defined channel that resembles an accumulation range rather than a continuation of a broader downtrend. The persistence of this range strengthens the probability that a local bottom has already formed. Market observers note that a decisive break above the $94,500 level could quickly unlock momentum, putting the psychologically critical $100,000 mark back firmly in focus. For further context, Bitcoin’s recent technical behavior is drawing comparisons to gold’s 2018 cycle. Gold at that time spent months bleeding lower within a falling wedge before breaking out, briefly retesting support, and then entering a powerful price discovery phase. Bitcoin has now exited a similar wedge formation, suggesting a comparable sequence may unfold. A shallow pullback followed by renewed upside would fit neatly into this historical analogue, and potentially accelerate sentiment as the year progresses. However, near-term flows are mixed. Recent data shows U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced net outflows late in December, with products from BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Ark, and 21Shares recording redemptions. On December 26 alone, IBIT, FBTC, and GBTC collectively saw outflows exceeding $589 million, followed by another round of redemptions on December 31, led again by IBIT. Additional funds, including BITB, HODL, BTCO, and EZBC, also posted weekly outflows. Despite this, the overall narrative is intact. Bitcoin’s longer-term trajectory balances institutional demand through reserves and ETFs with ongoing technical evolution, including Layer 2 development and preparations for post-quantum security. If historical Q1 tendencies align with improving structure and macro liquidity, the conditions for a parabolic move may already be forming.

Radar > Topics > AI & ML The tech trends we’re watching in the new year By Julie Baron January 9, 2026 • 13 minute read We’re three years into a post-ChatGPT world, and AI remains the focal point of the tech industry. In 2025, several ongoing trends intensified: AI investment accelerated; enterprises integrated agents and workflow automation at a faster pace; and the toolscape for professionals seeking a career edge is now overwhelmingly expansive. But the jury’s still out on the ROI from the vast sums that have saturated the industry. We anticipate that 2026 will be a year of increased accountability. Expect enterprises to shift focus from experimentation to measurable business outcomes and sustainable AI costs. There are promising productivity and efficiency gains to be had in software engineering and development, operations, security, and product design, but significant challenges also persist. Bigger picture, the industry is still grappling with what AI is and where we’re headed. Is AI a worker that will take all our jobs? Is AGI imminent? Is the bubble about to burst? Economic uncertainty, layoffs, and shifting AI hiring expectations have undeniably created stark career anxiety throughout the industry. But as Tim O’Reilly pointedly argues, “AI is not taking jobs: The decisions of people deploying it are.” No one has quite figured out how to make money yet, but the organizations that succeed will do so by creating solutions that “genuinely improve. . .customers’ lives.” That won’t happen by shoehorning AI into existing workflows but by first determining where AI can actually improve upon them, then taking an “AI first” approach to developing products around these insights. As Tim O’Reilly and Mike Loukides recently explained, “At O’Reilly, we don’t believe in predicting the future. But we do believe you can see signs of the future in the present.” We’re watching a number of “possible futures taking shape.” AI will undoubtedly be integrated more deeply into industries, products, and the wider workforce in 2026 as use cases continue to be discovered and shared. Topics we’re keeping tabs on include context engineering for building more reliable, performant AI systems; LLM posttraining techniques, in particular fine-tuning as a means to build more specialized, domain-specific models; the growth of agents, as well as the protocols, like MCP, to support them; and computer vision and multimodal AI more generally to enable the development of physical/embodied AI and the creation of world models. Here are some of the other trends that are pointing the way forward. In 2025, AI was embedded in software developers’ everyday work, transforming their roles—in some cases dramatically. A multitude of AI tools are now available to create code, and workflows are undergoing a transformation shaped by new concepts including vibe coding, agentic development, context engineering, eval- and spec-driven development, and more. In 2026, we’ll see an increased focus on agents and the protocols, like MCP, that support them; new coding workflows; and the impact of AI on assisting with legacy code. But even as software development practices evolve, fundamental skills such as code review, design patterns, debugging, testing, and documentation are as vital as ever. And despite major disruption from GenAI, programming languages aren’t going anywhere. Type-safe languages like TypeScript, Java, and C# provide compile-time validation that catches AI errors before production, helping mitigate the risks of AI-generated code. Memory safety mandates will drive interest in Rust and Zig for systems programming: Major players such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta have adopted Rust for critical systems, and Zig is behind Anthropic’s most recent acquisition, Bun. And Python is central to creating powerful AI and machine learning frameworks, driving complex intelligent automation that extends far beyond simple scripting. It’s also ideal for edge computing and robotics, two areas where AI is likely to make inroads in the coming year. Which AI tools programmers use matter less than how they use them. With a wide choice of tools now available in the IDE and on the command line, and new options being introduced all the time, it’s useful to focus on the skills needed to produce good code rather than focusing on the tool itself. After all, whatever tool they use, developers are ultimately responsible for the code it produces. Effectively communicating with AI models is the key to doing good work. The more background AI tools are given about a project, the better the code they generate will be. Developers have to understand both how to manage what the AI knows about their project (context engineering) and how to communicate it (prompt engineering) to get useful outputs. AI isn’t just a pair programmer; it’s an entire team of developers. Software engineers have moved beyond single coding assistants. They’re building and deploying custom agents, often within complex setups involving multi-agent scenarios, teams of coding agents, and agent swarms. But as the engineering workflow shifts from conducting AI to orchestrating AI, the fundamentals of building and maintaining good software—code review, design patterns, debugging, testing, and documentation—stay the same and will be what elevates purposeful AI-assisted code above the crowd. AI has progressed from being something architects might have to consider to something that is now essential to their work. They can use LLMs to accelerate or optimize architecture tasks; they can add AI to existing software systems or use it to modernize those systems; and they can design AI-native architectures, an approach that requires new considerations and patterns for system design. And even if they aren’t working with AI (yet), architects still need to understand how AI relates to other parts of their system and be able to communicate their decisions to stakeholders at all levels. AI-enhanced and AI-native architectures bring new considerations and patterns for system design. Event-driven models can enable AI agents to act on incoming triggers rather than fixed prompts. In 2026, evolving architectures will become more important as architects look for ways to modernize existing systems for AI. And the rise of agentic AI means architects need to stay up-to-date on emerging protocols like MCP. Many of the concerns from 2025 will carry over into the new year. Considerations such as incorporating LLMs and RAG into existing architectures, emerging architecture patterns and antipatterns specifically for AI systems, and the focus on API and data integrations elevated by MCP are critical. The fundamentals still matter. Tools and frameworks are making it possible to automate more tasks. However, to successfully leverage these capabilities to design sustainable architecture, enterprise architects must have a full command of the principles behind them: when to add an agent or a microservice, how to consider cost, how to define boundaries, and how to act on the knowledge they already have. The InfraOps space is undergoing its most significant transformation since cloud computing, as AI evolves from a workload to be managed to an active participant in managing infrastructure itself. With infrastructure sprawling across multicloud environments, edge deployments, and specialized AI accelerators, manual management is becoming nearly impossible. In 2026, the industry will keep moving toward self-healing systems and predictive observability—infrastructure that continuously optimizes itself, shifting the human role from manual maintenance to system oversight, architecture, and long-term strategy. Platform engineering makes this transformation operational, abstracting infrastructure complexity behind self-service interfaces, which lets developers deploy AI workloads, implement observability, and maintain security without deep infrastructure expertise. The best platforms will evolve into orchestration layers for autonomous systems. While fully autonomous systems remain on the horizon, the trajectory is clear. AI is becoming a primary driver of infrastructure architecture. AI-native workloads demand GPU orchestration at scale, specialized networking protocols optimized for model training and inference, and frameworks like Ray on Kubernetes that can distribute compute intelligently. Organizations are redesigning infrastructure stacks to accommodate these demands and are increasingly considering hybrid environments and alternatives to hyperscalers to power their AI workloads—“neocloud” platforms like CoreWeave, Lambda, and Vultr. AI is augmenting the work of operations teams with real-time intelligence. Organizations are turning to AIOps platforms to predict failures before they cascade, identify anomalies humans would miss, and surface optimization opportunities in telemetry data. These systems aim to amplify human judgment, giving operators superhuman pattern recognition across complex environments. AI is evolving into an autonomous operator that makes its own infrastructure decisions. Companies will implement emerging “agentic SRE” practices: systems that reason about infrastructure problems, form hypotheses about root causes, and take independent corrective action, replicating the cognitive workload that SREs perform, not just following predetermined scripts. The big story of the back half of 2025 was agents. While the groundwork has been laid, in 2026 we expect focus on the development of agentic systems to persist—and this will necessitate new tools and techniques, particularly on the data side. AI and data platforms continue to converge, with vendors like Snowflake, Databricks, and Salesforce releasing products to help customers build and deploy agents. Beyond agents, AI is making its influence felt across the entire data stack, as data professionals target their workflows to support enterprise AI. Significant trends include real-time analytics, enhanced data privacy and security, and the increasing use of low-code/no-code tools to democratize data access. Sustainability also remains a concern, and data professionals need to consider ESG compliance, carbon-aware tooling, and resource-optimized architectures when designing for AI workloads. Data infrastructure continues to consolidate. The consolidation trend has not only affected the modern data stack but also more traditional areas like the database space. In response, organizations are being more intentional about what kind of databases they deploy. At the same time, modern data stacks have fragmented across cloud platforms and open ecosystems, so engineers must increasingly design for interoperability. A multiple database approach is more important than ever. Vector databases like Pinecone, Milvus, Qdrant, and Weaviate help power agentic AI—while they’re a new technology, companies are beginning to adopt vector databases more widely. DuckDB’s popularity is growing for running analytical queries. And even though it’s been around for a while, ClickHouse, an open source distributed OLAP database used for real-time analytics, has finally broken through with data professionals. The infrastructure to support autonomous agents is coming together. GitOps, observability, identity management, and zero-trust orchestration will all play key roles. And we’re following a number of new initiatives that facilitate agentic development, including AgentDB, a database designed specifically to work effectively with AI agents; Databricks’ recently announced Lakebase, a Postgres database/OLTP engine integrated within the data lakehouse; and Tiger Data’s Agentic Postgres, a database “designed from the ground up” to support agents. AI is a threat multiplier—59% of tech professionals cited AI-driven cyberthreats as their biggest concern in a recent survey. In response, the cybersecurity analyst role is shifting from low-level human-in-the-loop tasks to complex threat hunting, AI governance, advanced data analysis and coding, and human-AI teaming oversight. But addressing AI-generated threats will also require a fundamental transformation in defensive strategy and skill acquisition—and the sooner it happens, the better. Security professionals now have to defend a broader attack surface. The proliferation of AI agents expands the attack surface. Security tools must evolve to protect it. Implementing zero trust for machine identities is a smart opening move to mitigate sprawl and nonhuman traffic. Security professionals must also harden their AI systems against common threats such as prompt injection and model manipulation. Organizations are struggling with governance and compliance. Striking a balance between data utility and vulnerability requires adherence to data governance best practices (e.g., least privilege). Government agencies, industry and professional groups, and technology companies are developing a range of AI governance frameworks to help guide organizations, but it’s up to companies to translate these technical governance frameworks into board-level risk decisions and actionable policy controls. The security operations center (SOC) is evolving. The velocity and scale of AI-driven attacks can overwhelm traditional SIEM/SOAR solutions. Expect increased adoption of agentic SOC—a system of specialized, coordinated AI agents for triage and response. This shifts the focus of the SOC analyst from reactive alert triage to proactive threat hunting, complex analysis, and AI system oversight. Business focus in 2025 shifted from scattered AI experiments to the challenge of building defensible, AI-native businesses. Next year we’re likely to see product teams moving from proof of concept to proof of value. One thing to look for: Design and product responsibilities may consolidate under a “product builder”—a full stack generalist in product, design, and engineering who can rapidly build, validate, and launch new products. Companies are currently hiring for this role, although few people actually possess the full skill set at the moment. But regardless of whether product builders become ascendant, product folks in 2026 and beyond will need the ability to combine product validation, good-enough engineering, and rapid design, all enabled by AI as a core accelerator. We’re already seeing the “product manager” role becoming more technical as AI spreads throughout the product development process. Nearly all PMs use AI, but they’ll increasingly employ purpose-built AI workflows for research, user-testing, data analysis, and prototyping. Companies need to bridge the AI product strategy gap. Most companies have moved past simple AI experiments but are now facing a strategic crisis. Their existing product playbooks (how to size markets, roadmapping, UX) weren’t designed for AI-native products. Organizations must develop clear frameworks for building a portfolio of differentiated AI products, managing new risks, and creating sustainable value. AI product evaluation is now mission-critical. As AI becomes a core product component and strategy matures, rigorous evaluation is the key to turning products that are good on paper into those that are great in production. Teams should start by defining what “good” means for their specific context, then build reliable evals for models, agents, and conversational UIs to ensure they’re hitting that target. Design’s new frontier is conversations and interactions. Generative AI has pushed user experience beyond static screens into probabilistic new multimodal territory. This means a harder shift toward designing nonlinear, conversational systems, including AI agents. In 2026, we’re likely to see increased demand for AI conversational designers and AI interaction designers to devise conversation flows for chatbots and even design a model’s behavior and personality. While big questions about AI remain unanswered, the best way to plan for uncertainty is to consider the real value you can create for your users and for your teams themselves right now. The tools will improve, as they always do, and the strategies to use them will grow more complex. Being deeply versed in the core knowledge of your area of expertise gives you the foundation you’ll need to take advantage of these quickly evolving technologies—and ensure that whatever you create will be built on bedrock, not shaky ground.

The year 2026 is just getting started, and layoffs are already underway. Companies, including Angi, the company formerly known as Angie's List, and the popular web tool Tailwind, have cut staff, citing the impact of artificial intelligence among the reasons for the layoffs. More than 100 other companies, from Amazon to Nike to Verizon, have filed legally mandated WARN notices about job cuts to come in 2026, according to WARN Tracker. Some of the cuts are part of previously announced reductions. This year's cuts follow three years of significant workforce reductions across a broad range of industries, including tech, media, finance, and retail. The moves come as artificial intelligence, public policy, and broader economic conditions present sweeping changes to the business landscape. A World Economic Forum survey last year found that some 41% of companies worldwide expected to reduce their workforces in the next five years because of the rise of artificial intelligence. The survey also found that jobs in big data, fintech, and AI are expected to double by 2030. Last year, Business Insider tracked layoffs at around 65 major companies, such as Amazon, Meta, Paramount, and Starbucks. In 2026, we'll continue to track additional job cuts based on company announcements, WARN notices, and our own reporting. Here are the companies with job cuts underway in 2026, listed in alphabetical order. Angi, the popular contractor listing site once known as Angie's List, said in January that it was cutting around 350 jobs "to reduce operating expenses and optimize the organizational structure in support of long-term growth." The company also said it's making the cuts "in light of AI-driven efficiency improvements." In a January 7 SEC filing, Angi said that the cuts would save between $70 million and $80 million in annual spending. The layoffs will cost the company between $22 million and $30 million, according to the filing. Citi will cut more jobs this year as part of its plan to reduce its workforce by 10%, or 20,000 employees. In a statement on January 13, the bank said that it will continue to reduce head count in 2026. "These changes reflect adjustments we're making to ensure our staffing levels, locations and expertise align with current business needs," a spokesperson for Citi said. The plan was detailed in the company's January 2024 earnings report and could save the bank as much as $2.5 billion. Meta is preparing to slash jobs within its Reality Labs division, the unit responsible for Mark Zuckerberg's metaverse ambitions, three people familiar with the matter told Business Insider. Two employees said that teams working on virtual reality headsets and Horizon Worlds, the company's VR social network, will be disproportionately affected. The New York Times reported that roughly 10% to 15% of the division's 15,000 employees are expected to be laid off, with announcements coming as soon as this week. The cuts coincide with a high-stakes division-wide meeting scheduled for Wednesday. Meta's CTO and Reality Labs chief Andrew Bosworth described the upcoming gathering as the "most important" of the year and urged employees to attend in person. Tailwind, a popular web tool, said it cut three of its four engineers in January, citing an AI-driven decline in revenue. "75% of the people on our engineering team lost their jobs here yesterday because of the brutal impact AI has had on our business," CEO Adam Wathan wrote in a GitHub comment on January 6 that made waves in the tech community.

Nvidia made a key leadership move Thursday by hiring its first chief marketing officer. The company tapped Google Cloud marketing veteran Alison Wagonfeld for the newly created position. NVIDIA Corporation, NVDA Wagonfeld announced her departure from Google on LinkedIn. She will join Nvidia in late January after spending nearly a decade at the search giant. At Google, Wagonfeld led marketing for the cloud computing business. She worked closely with Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian and Chief Marketing Officer Lorraine Twohill. Her new role at Nvidia consolidates marketing responsibilities that were previously split among several people. She will report directly to CEO Jensen Huang. The hire comes as Nvidia looks to expand beyond just chip sales. The company wants to position itself as a full AI platform provider offering software, systems, and services. Wagonfeld’s move from Google to Nvidia highlights the relationship between the two tech companies. “I’m thrilled to be moving from one AI leader to another at such a transformational time,” she wrote on LinkedIn. She emphasized that Google and Nvidia maintain a strong partnership. The two companies plan to continue their collaboration despite her switch. This partnership angle matters for investors. Some analysts have worried about competition from Google’s Tensor Processing Units potentially eating into Nvidia’s dominance. Signs of cooperation rather than rivalry could ease these concerns. The market may view Wagonfeld’s hire as confirmation that the two companies see themselves as partners rather than enemies. Nvidia stock fell 2.2% during Thursday’s trading session. Shares remained flat in after-hours trading following the announcement. The stock has struggled to break out recently. It’s down 1% over the past three months despite strong demand indicators for AI chips. Nvidia remains the dominant provider of artificial intelligence chips. But the stock has been range-bound for several months as investors digest its rapid gains from earlier periods. The company faces questions about maintaining its market leadership as competitors ramp up their own chip offerings. Google’s TPUs represent one potential challenge to Nvidia’s position. Wagonfeld brings deep experience in marketing complex technology products to enterprise customers. Her background at Google Cloud could help Nvidia refine its messaging as it expands beyond hardware. The appointment reflects Nvidia’s evolution from a chip company to a broader AI infrastructure provider. Creating a CMO role signals the company’s intent to strengthen its brand and market positioning during this transition.

Learn to make your money work as hard as you, so you can focus on your patients, your family, and your own wellness. Quick Start Page Recommended Professionals Financial Boot Camp Since mid-2024, BlackRock has been offering lifecycle-style ETFs that include an income annuity as part of the mix of assets. Now, it looks like Vanguard wants to get in on the action, announcing in December 2025 a new series of target retirement funds called Target Retirement Lifetime Income Funds. You should know two things about the Target Retirement Lifetime Income Funds. The first is that this is a new series of funds. We're not talking about all of Vanguard's target retirement funds that were introduced in 2003. Totally different funds. I have no idea why Vanguard used such a similar name, but there will be substantial confusion—especially since the existing target retirement funds include one that is called Target Retirement Income Fund. The key difference is the word “lifetime” in the title. The second thing is that these funds will only be available in employer-sponsored plans like 401(k)s and 403(b)s. That seems kind of silly, so hopefully that's a temporary thing. The reason it's silly is that when people leave their employers to retire (i.e., the time when an immediate annuity of some kind actually makes sense), they usually roll their 401(k) or 403(b) money to an IRA to allow for more control, more investing options, and often lower fees. Now there's an option available in the 401(k) but not the IRA? What a pain. Perhaps the reason these funds will be a 401(k)-only option is because they are not actually mutual funds. They are Collective Investment Trusts (CITs). Here is an excerpt from a future WCI post on CITs, currently scheduled for publication in March 2026: A CIT is a mutual fund alternative that only exists inside qualified retirement plans, like your 401(k). It's best to just consider it the same thing as a mutual fund, but there are a few minor differences, none of which are really bad. Google lists them well: Bottom line, sometimes CITs are put into 401(k)s instead of mutual funds because they're slightly cheaper. Most of them are index funds or lifecycle-style balanced funds, which is generally a good thing for 401(k) participants. However, because they don't have ticker symbols like mutual funds and stocks, CITs can be a little harder to research on the internet (such as Morningstar and similar resources). More frequently you'll just have to obtain and review the information provided by Human Resources at your company or the 401(k) provider to learn more about the investments. The plan for Vanguard is for these new target retirement funds to look like the older ones, at least until you hit the age of 55. Then, it'll start replacing some of the assets with an immediate annuity to provide more guaranteed income. Morningstar hypothesized that it would look like this: The annuity portion will apparently be run by TIAA-CREF. The idea is to provide a more stable income during those years when you really want a stable income: during your retirement. Perhaps it will help reduce the Sequence of Returns Risk a little better than the mix of stocks and bonds in the older version of target retirement funds. More information here: Best Investment Portfolios — 150+ Portfolios Better Than Yours The 15 Questions You Need to Answer to Build Your Investment Portfolio Probably not. Few have. They're brand new. That's reason enough for me not to buy them. Besides, for most WCIers, lifecycle funds are something they grow out of by necessity as their retirement account situation becomes more complex. It's fine for your Roth IRA in residency. Not so fine when you have a 403(b), a solo 401(k), Roth IRAs, a 457(b), a cash balance plan, and a big taxable account. Target retirement funds are all-in-one solutions that function great when all of your investments are in retirement accounts that offer them. That's not the case for most WCIers by the time they're 55, when this new series of target retirement funds would even start incorporating the annuities. I don't necessarily think these annuity-containing lifecycle funds are a terrible idea, but they also feel like a solution looking for a problem. I suspect most WCIers who want to annuitize a portion of their retirement assets are going to do it directly rather than via a target retirement fund—especially since you can't even buy these things in an IRA. It's good to know these Vanguard Target Retirement Lifetime Income Funds exist, but I think you can pass on them for now. What do you think? Are you interested in lifecycle funds that contain annuities? Why or why not? James M. Dahle, MD, FACEP, FAAEM is a practicing emergency physician and the founder of The White Coat Investor. After multiple run-ins with unscrupulous financial professionals early in his career, he embarked on his own self-study process to become financially literate. After seeing the benefits of financial literacy in his own life, he was inspired to start The White Coat Investor to assist his colleagues. At the time, there was nobody providing unbiased financial education to doctors at any point in their training. Now, more than a decade later, financial wellness is widely recognized as a critical life skill for all physicians and similar professionals. Dr. Dahle remains committed to the original mission of The White Coat Investor to “help those who wear the white coat get a fair shake on Wall Street.” He currently serves as the CEO, a columnist, and the host of the podcast.

Δ Δ The problem these solve is that retirees move their money out of the employer plans. I can tell you that my father’s retirement has been financed mainly by TIAA and it has been extremely lucrative. The TIAA-CREF representative told him that his retirement was funded with 30 year treasuries that were purchased in the 70’s and 80’s when you could get 10% (for 30 years). 30 year rates are back to generational highs right now – but only at about 5%. I think Vanguard is trying to capture that lightning again with a vehicle that can pay out better than 5% yearly for the duration of retirement. This is to entice retiring employees to continue to use the employer funds – which was TIAA-CREF’s secret power. I actually think the tranche of retirees and near retirees who move into this (right now) could actually do pretty well.

NEW THINKING In December 2024, Omnicom merged with IPG, eliminating approximately 4,000 jobs. Among those displaced were hundreds of brand strategists who had spent their entire careers honing the art of positioning, differentiation, and cultural resonance. They didn’t lose their jobs because they weren’t talented or dedicated. They lost them because the infrastructure they relied on—the promise-making apparatus of the advertising age—collapsed from obsolescence. This wasn’t a cyclical downturn. It was structural. And understanding why requires an understanding of how brands have fundamentally changed the way they create value for their owners and the customers they serve. This article is part of Branding Strategy Insider’s newsletter. Join the world’s smartest marketers and subscribe here for actionable insights delivered directly to your inbox. The Shift Everyone Saw Coming (But Was Still Surprised By) For more than a century, the brand-building playbook was remarkably consistent: Make a promise. Tell it beautifully. Repeat until it sticks. Sneaker companies promised athletic identity. Banks promised security and partnership. Consumer brands competed on who could craft the most compelling story about what their product meant, not what it could actually do for you beyond its basic function. This made sense given the constraints of the era. A sneaker company couldn’t actually make you a better athlete—but it could make you feel like one. A bank couldn’t simplify the genuine complexity of personal finance—but it could promise you’d feel confident and secure. So an entire industry architecture evolved around this model: Agencies optimized persuasion. Research measured perception. Media delivered reach. Success meant winning the battle for attention and preference through superior creative execution and bigger media budgets. Here’s what changed: That playbook just became obsolete. Not outdated—obsolete. Like a Rolodex or a fax machine or the idea that you can build a brand without actually being useful to people. And the implications are more profound than most CMOs have fully absorbed. Which is understandable—it’s hard to notice the ground shifting when you’re standing on it. Three Technology Shifts That Ended the Promise Era Three technological capabilities emerged that fundamentally eliminated the constraints that made promise-based branding necessary: First, brands can now deliver contextual utility at scale. Connectivity, sensors, and AI enable brands to understand individual contexts in real-time and orchestrate genuinely personalized responses. Nike doesn’t just promise athletic identity anymore—it delivers adaptive training programs, biomechanical feedback, and performance optimization through Training Club. Capital One doesn’t promise financial confidence—it delivers real-time spending insights, instant fraud alerts, and automated savings tools. The promise has become operationalizable in ways that were simply impossible a decade ago. Second, consumer expectations shifted irreversibly. People now expect brands to be useful, not just meaningful. A 2024 Edelman study found that 67% of consumers define brand trust primarily through “helping me solve problems” rather than “sharing my values”—a complete inversion from 2015 when values alignment dominated. Cultural resonance still matters, but it’s become table stakes rather than differentiation. Amazon’s cultural salience is near zero, yet it maintains dominant positions because it relentlessly delivers operational value: speed, convenience, reliability, and price. Third, promise-making now creates vulnerability in transparent markets. Social media, review platforms, and instant information access have made gaps between promise and delivery instantly visible and permanently documented. Brands that overpromise face immediate, public accountability. There’s a reason “We’ve heard your feedback” became the most panic-inducing phrase in corporate communications. The old model—craft aspirational messaging, deliver adequate product—now generates backlash rather than loyalty. Trust gets built through consistent delivery of value, not repetition of claims. Why The Old Model Creates New Strategic Risks The promise-focused approach isn’t just less effective—it actively creates three forms of new strategic risks: Capital misallocation. Marketing budgets optimized for awareness and persuasion are generating diminishing returns. A 2023 McKinsey analysis of 200 CPG brands found that incremental media spend beyond baseline thresholds produced 0.3x ROI, while investment in what they called “experiential utilities” – apps, services, and personalization engines – generated 3.2x returns. Every dollar spent on louder promises is effectively subsidizing competitors who are building better delivery systems. Talent misalignment. The most sophisticated strategic and technical talent now gravitates toward brands that are building operational capabilities – product teams, experience designers, and data scientists—not communications roles. Agencies report 40% declines in applications from top-tier creative talent since 2019, while product-led brands like Stripe and Notion face talent surpluses. The promise model simply can’t attract the capabilities required for modern competition. Commodification risk. When multiple brands make similar promises without differentiated delivery, entire categories collapse into price competition. Consider banking: Every major institution promises ‘financial partnership’ and ‘personalized service.’ Yet 89% of consumers report experiencing no meaningful difference whatsoever. If you’ve ever tried to distinguish between Chase’s promise and Bank of America’s promise and Wells Fargo’s promise, you know exactly what I mean. They all sound like they were written by the same AI prompt: ‘Sound trustworthy but not boring, aspirational but not arrogant, personal but not creepy. Point being, the promise layer has become completely indistinguishable, forcing bank brand competition toward rate arbitrage. Meanwhile, brands with superior delivery systems, such as Chime’s instant notifications and Revolut’s multi-currency infrastructure, capture disproportionate growth despite minimal brand investment. Playing Three Games Simultaneously Here’s what I’ve learned watching brands win and lose over the past several years: They’re no longer just trying to play one simple game where the rules are known to everyone. They’re playing three different games simultaneously. There’s the game everyone knows: Products. Better ingredients, faster processors, longer battery life, and superior formulations. This is the traditional realm of functional performance where CPG and consumer tech have always competed: simple product features, tangible benefits, and superiority claims. Then there’s the game brand strategists have obsessed over for the past 20 years: Ideas. Cultural conversations about what the “good life” looks and feels like. Not just brand positioning, but participation in broader societal dialogue about meaning, identity, and values. This is where brands try to build emotional affinity, ethical identity, and cultural capital. But there’s a third game that’s fast becoming the deciding factor: Services. And I need to be specific about what I mean here, because I’m not talking about customer service. I am not referring to call centers, return policies, or post-purchase support functions. Those remain operationally important, but they’re cost centers focused on maintaining satisfaction. What I am talking about is capability delivery: Technologies, platforms, and orchestrated experiences that give customers new abilities or dramatically expand what they can accomplish with products. Sephora’s Skincredible AI skin analysis isn’t customer service fixing a problem; it’s giving customers the tools they need to choose the best products for their skin type. Nike Training Club doesn’t address product quality issues that arise after purchase; it helps its customers become better athletes. Capital One’s real-time spending insights don’t supply FAQs. They help build financial acumen. These services don’t merely satisfy their customers’ aspirations. They provide them with new abilities. And capability delivery generates a behavioral dependency that messaging simply can’t replicate. Once you’ve integrated Spotify’s algorithms into your daily routines, you don’t switch to a competitor offering better brand promises. You’ve offloaded the cognitive work of music curation to a system that knows your preferences better than you can articulate them yourself. That’s a moat built through delivered utility, not communicated meaning. The critical insight: The competitive hierarchy among these three games has completely inverted. And understanding how requires seeing the mechanism at work. How Culture Drives the Need for Services The traditional model assumed a linear progression: Products → Ideas → Communications. Build a better mousetrap, craft compelling meaning around it, and then broadcast that meaning at scale. The modern reality operates completely differently: Culture → Products → Services → Cultural Permission. Please allow me to show you how this works: Step 1: Culture elevates aspirations. Societal movements are perpetually redefining what “good living” means. Over the past decade, we’ve seen dramatic aspiration inflation across multiple dimensions: Step 2: Elevated aspirations raise the performance bar across products. These cultural shifts don’t just change what people want. They change what they expect brands to do. When culture elevates healthspan as a new well-being aspiration, food brands face pressure for clean ingredients, supplement brands need clinical validation, and fitness brands must deliver personalized optimization. The product performance threshold rises across entire categories. But here’s the critical dynamic: Product improvements alone no longer create sustainable advantage. Technology diffusion and manufacturing democratization mean functional parity arrives faster than ever. Plant-based proteins, carbon-neutral production and AI-powered personalization—these innovations spread across competitors within 18-24 months. Product superiority becomes temporary, not structural. Step 3: Services become the actual differentiation layer. Elevated cultural aspirations create expectations not just for better products, but for personalized, connected, joyful experiences of those products. This is where services (and experiences) enter as the new competitive battleground. Consider the beauty sector: Cultural conversations about inclusive beauty standards raised product expectations such as broader shade ranges, clean formulations, and dermatologist-tested ingredients. Every major brand can now meet these thresholds. Product parity is nearly complete. But Sephora dominates because it competes in the service layer: AI skin analysis, virtual try-on technology, personalized routine recommendations, community tutorials, and beauty advisor access. These services deliver the “personalized, connected, joyful” experiences that elevated beauty aspirations demand. And here’s what matters most: Service delivery earns permission to shape cultural conversation. Sephora can credibly participate in defining beauty standards because it operationally delivers inclusive, personalized beauty experiences. Competitors still making promises about inclusive beauty without service infrastructure sound hollow—the gap between claim and capability is instantly visible to consumers. Step 4: The compounding loop that changes everything. Brands that build service layers don’t just differentiate. They trigger a self-reinforcing cycle: Culture elevates aspirations → Raises product and experience expectations → Brands that deliver service layer differentiate → Service delivery generates cultural credibility → Cultural credibility earns permission to shape the next cultural iteration → Strengthened cultural position attracts more users → More users generate behavioral data → Data improves service delivery → Improved services strengthen cultural authority → Culture elevates aspirations further. Brands stuck in the Products + Ideas model can’t enter this loop. They’re making cultural promises without experiential proof. Meanwhile, brands building service infrastructure compound their advantage with each cycle; cultural position strengthens operational capability, which strengthens cultural position. Why Meaning Still Matters—But Can’t Stand Alone This framework resolves what seems like a paradox: Cultural salience remains absolutely essential, but it’s now downstream from service delivery, not upstream from product marketing. Ideas are still the prize. Brands that shape cultural conversations about aspiration achieve disproportionate mindshare, loyalty, and pricing power. Nike’s cultural influence on athletic identity, Patagonia’s environmental leadership, and Apple’s creative empowerment positioning. These idea-level assets generate billions in equity value. But services have become a powerful weapon for winning in the marketplace of ideas. You can’t credibly shape cultural aspiration through messaging when competitors are delivering capability. Let me be clear: This doesn’t mean promises have no role. Brand awareness and initial consideration still require cultural presence. Consumers need to know a brand exists before they can experience its service layer. But awareness without delivered utility now creates vulnerability, not competitive advantage. A compelling brand promise gets you into the consideration set. But a compelling service determines whether you’ll win the decision and build the kind of behavioral loyalty that compounds over time. Three mechanisms explain why this shift happened: 1. Service as Cultural Credential: The New Authenticity Standard The brand services layer doesn’t replace cultural meaning. It validates it. Brands attempting to lead cultural conversations through messaging alone face immediate authenticity scrutiny in transparent markets where gaps between claims and capabilities are instantly visible. Consumers and critics ask, “What operational evidence gives you permission to speak on this topic?” The service layer provides the answer through demonstrated commitment, not stated values. Consider Patagonia. They earn permission to shape environmental conversations because their service infrastructure proves they’ve operationalized sustainability, not just marketed it. Their Worn Wear platform offers repair services and a used gear marketplace. Their supply chain transparency tools make factory data and material sourcing publicly available. Their environmental activism funding, the 1% for the Planet commitment, gets operationalized through actual donations you can track. This provides concrete evidence that environmental stewardship is structural to their business model, not performative in their advertising. When Patagonia’s leadership advocates for public lands protection or criticizes fast fashion, the service layer grants credibility. They’re not making promises about values. They’re demonstrating values through operational commitment that costs them margin, constrains their growth, and creates a competitive disadvantage in pure product comparisons. That sacrifice is what earns cultural authority. Now contrast this with the authenticity gap that undermines promise-based cultural positioning: Dove spent decades and hundreds of millions of dollars on “Real Beauty” campaigns celebrating body diversity and challenging unrealistic beauty standards. Yet they delivered retail experiences and product formulations identical to competitors who made no such cultural claims. When you asked “what operational evidence supports your beauty inclusion message?” the answer was effectively “our advertising says so.” “The service layer provided no proof. The result: cultural skepticism, campaign fatigue, and minimal impact on actual beauty culture conversations despite massive investment. Meanwhile, Fenty Beauty achieved instant cultural authority in beauty inclusion with a fraction of Dove’s marketing budget. Why? Rihanna established a service infrastructure that implemented inclusivity by offering 40 foundation shades at launch, compared to the industry standard of 6-12, utilizing undertone-matching technology that catered to the full spectrum, ensuring diverse model representation across all customer touchpoints, not just in advertising, and developing products that prioritized historically underserved skin tones. The service layer granted permission to lead beauty culture conversations that Dove, despite decades of promise-based positioning and vastly larger budgets, couldn’t credibly join. This pattern is pretty consistent: Cultural salience remains the prize, but service delivery is the credential that earns entry to the competition. You can’t claim environmental leadership without circular service models. You can’t champion inclusion without operationalized accessibility. You can’t promise empowerment without capability-conferring tools. The service layer is how brands prove their cultural positioning is authentic rather than opportunistic. And in transparent markets, that proof is a prerequisite for cultural authority. This is why the three-marketplace model places Ideas downstream from Services in the modern competitive hierarchy. Brands don’t build service capabilities to support their cultural positioning. They earn cultural positioning by building service capabilities. The causality reversed. 2. Experience as Proof: Making Abstract Aspirations Tangible Abstract aspirations become concrete through delivered experiences. “Healthspan” as a cultural aspiration remains vague until Peloton delivers personalized training that makes you measurably stronger, or until Levels provides continuous glucose monitoring that reveals how specific foods impact your energy throughout the day. The service translates aspiration into felt reality. And felt reality is infinitely more persuasive today than aspirational storytelling. 3. Behavioral Integration: Creating Mental Availability Through Utility When brands deliver utility in specific contexts, they achieve what The Ehrenberg-Bass Institute calls mental availability at Category Entry Points—the purchase moments that actually matter. Tesla famously doesn’t advertise, yet it dominates EV consideration. Why? Because they deliver measurable value, the Supercharger network, over-the-air updates, and autopilot capability are in the exact moments relevant to EV purchase decisions. The service delivery is the marketing, creating situational presence that pure messaging can’t replicate. The Pattern of Competitive Displacement The three-marketplace framework reveals why incumbents with superior product heritage and decades of cultural equity are losing to service-first challengers. Again, allow me to show you the pattern I’ve seen everywhere in my work and research: Traditional Banking vs. Chime/Revolut Incumbents compete on Products (marginally better rates) plus Ideas (trust and partnership messaging). Challengers compete on services: instant notifications, fee elimination, multi-currency infrastructure, and automated savings. Despite zero brand equity, service-first challengers capture disproportionate growth because they deliver the “personalized, connected, joyful” financial experience that elevated money-management aspirations demand. Traditional Retail vs. Amazon Department stores maintained superior product curation and cultural positioning; lifestyle aspiration and promises of personal service. Amazon built service infrastructure: 1-click ordering, Prime shipping, personalized recommendations, and Alexa integration. Amazon’s cultural salience is minimal, yet it dominates because service delivery creates behavioral lock-in that messaging can’t overcome. Traditional Beauty vs. Sephora Legacy brands owned a stronger product heritage. L’Oréal formulations and Estée Lauder brand prestige and cultural equity were built through decades of advertising investment. Sephora invested in the service layer: virtual try-on, skin analysis, its Beauty Insider community, and personalized routines. Now Sephora shapes beauty culture conversations despite having weaker product IP. Service delivery earned cultural permission that heritage brands assumed was permanent. Traditional Eyewear vs. Warby Parker This same pattern extends beyond tech giants to mid-market challengers in commodity categories. Everyone knows this story by now. Warby Parker entered a mature eyewear market dominated by Luxottica’s brands (Ray-Ban, Oakley, and LensCrafters), which had superior product heritage, widespread retail presence, and a design legacy spanning 50+ years. Warby couldn’t win on lens technology. Prescription optics are scientifically standardized. They couldn’t win on frame design alone because fashion cycles move too fast for sustainable differentiation there. They won by competing in the service layer: Home Try-On, which ships five frames free for customer testing; Virtual Try-On technology using AR-based fit visualization; prescription renewal reminders; streamlined insurance integration; and Vision for All, which is its social impact program delivering donated glasses. These services delivered the “personalized, convenient, socially conscious” eyewear experience that elevated consumer aspirations demanded. Aspirations that Luxottica’s promise-based marketing through celebrity endorsements and fashion advertising couldn’t satisfy operationally. The result: Warby Parker achieved $500M+ revenue and market-leading satisfaction scores despite competing against brands with 50+ years of cultural equity and 100x their marketing budget. Service delivery earned cultural permission. Warby Parker now shapes conversations about accessible, responsible, stylish eyewear that incumbent brands can’t easily defend against. Their product was comparable. Their experience layer created an asymmetric advantage. The pattern holds across categories, even B2B: Service infrastructure beats cultural promise when aspirations have elevated beyond what products alone can deliver. How Service Delivery Creates Compounding Advantage Brands that architect service delivery systems rather than communication strategies build three forms of advantage that compound over time: 1. How Services Create Dozens of Moments Where Your Brand Matters Here’s something that becomes clear when you study what’s actually working: When you deliver utility through services, you’re not just strengthening the moments where people already think about your brand. You’re multiplying the number of moments where your brand comes to mind in the first place. Traditional brands compete for mental real estate at a handful of purchase occasions. Nike shows up when someone thinks, “I need running shoes.” Gatorade comes to mind at “I’m thirsty after my workout.” These are discrete, infrequent moments, maybe once or twice a year, where brand awareness determines which product ends up in the shopping cart. But watch what happens when Nike builds Training Club. Suddenly, Nike becomes mentally available at entirely different moments: “I’m starting my morning workout.” “I need motivation to actually exercise today.” “I want to track whether I’m making progress.” “I’m planning my fitness routine for the week.” “I’m recovering from an injury and need modified exercises.” “I’m training for my first 10K.” Each of these situations creates a new trigger point where Nike comes to mind—not because someone saw an ad recently, but because Nike’s service delivers utility in that specific context. They’ve gone from owning 2-3 purchase moments to being present across 15-20 behavioral moments in someone’s life. Promise-based competitors are still fighting for the same old purchase occasions with louder messaging and bigger media budgets. Meanwhile, service-delivering brands have quietly embedded themselves into dozens of daily situations through integrated utility. The compounding advantage works like this: When someone finally forms purchase intent – when they actually need new running shoes – the brand that’s been useful across twenty different moments wins consideration automatically. Not because their last ad was more memorable, but because they’ve built mental availability through delivered value across multiple contexts in that person’s life. And here’s what makes this a real moat: These aren’t just awareness touchpoints and memory structures. They’re habit formation moments. Changing someone’s opinion about a brand is relatively straightforward. A competitor’s advertising campaign can shift preference in a few months. But changing someone’s embedded daily routines? That’s extraordinarily difficult. Once Tesla’s Supercharger network becomes part of how you plan road trips, once Peloton’s 6am class becomes non-negotiable in your morning routine, and once Spotify’s Discover Weekly feels like it knows you better than you know yourself, switching to a competitor means disrupting established behavioral patterns. That friction protects market position far more effectively than emotional brand attachment alone. As I’ve already said, Tesla doesn’t run ads, yet they dominate electric vehicle consideration. Why? Because they deliver measurable value at every moment that matters for EV ownership: route planning through Supercharger network locations, managing charging anxiety through fast infrastructure, receiving software updates over-the-air, optimizing performance through autopilot capability, and protecting resale value through battery warranty programs. The service delivery is the marketing. They’ve created situational presence that pure messaging can’t replicate—and competitors can’t disrupt by outspending them on Super Bowl spots. The contrast is stark: Traditional brands spend millions fighting for 2-3 moments of consideration. Service-first brands invest their capital in building capabilities that create 15-20 moments of integration. One approach buys temporary awareness. The other builds behavioral dependency. That’s not a better marketing strategy. That’s a different category of competitive advantage entirely. 2. Learning That Compounds: Why Brand Services Improve 10-20x Faster Promise-based brands study consumers. Service-based brands learn from them. This distinction creates a structural advantage in speed-to-market fit that compounds over time. Traditional brands optimize through episodic research cycles: Conduct focus groups to understand preferences. Analyze survey data to identify unmet needs. Test campaign concepts to predict resonance. Measure post-launch performance to assess effectiveness. Adjust messaging for the next iteration. This cycle takes 6-12 months minimum, often longer for complex categories. By the time a brand has learned whether a message resonates and has deployed adjusted creative, market conditions have shifted, cultural moments have passed, and competitors have moved. Branded services and experiences are optimized through continuous behavioral feedback: Every interaction that delivers value generates data about actual usage patterns, contextual preferences, and revealed priorities, not stated intentions. Algorithms process this data in real time, not quarterly. Improvements deploy daily or hourly, not annually. Spotify doesn’t survey users about music preferences every six months. It processes 500+ million listening sessions per day and continuously adjusts recommendations. Netflix doesn’t run focus groups about content preferences. It analyzes billions of viewing decisions and uses those signals to inform content production and personalization engines. This compression of learning cycles means service-delivering brands achieve product-market fit 10-20x faster than research-dependent competitors. A service feature that isn’t creating engagement can be identified within days and modified within weeks. A messaging campaign that isn’t driving awareness requires months to measure and quarters to adjust. The velocity difference is structural, not tactical. More importantly, the learning compounds exponentially through a self-reinforcing cycle: Better service attracts more users → More users generate more behavioral data → More data enables algorithmic improvement → Improved algorithms deliver better service → Better service attracts more users. Each cycle strengthens the next, creating what people in tech call data network effects. Promise-based brands can’t enter this compounding loop because they’re optimizing communications about value, not capabilities that deliver it. You can’t A/B test your way to delivered utility. You can’t survey your way to behavioral integration. You can’t focus-group your way to capability conferral. Optimization happens through usage, which requires operational infrastructure that messaging-focused organizations don’t build and that agency partners can’t provide. Sephora’s beauty advisor recommendations improve with every skin analysis completed, every product review submitted, and every purchase made. The system learns which advice generates satisfaction and which creates returns. This learning is specific, behavioral, and continuous, creating service quality that manual consultation or static product knowledge can’t match. Competitors can copy Sephora’s service concept. But they can’t copy the years of behavioral learning embedded in the algorithms. The data moat is as defensible as the experiential moat. 3. Cultural Authority Through Demonstrated Values Brands that operationalize cultural aspirations through service delivery achieve authentic cultural presence without performative messaging. IKEA is an excellent case in point. The company’s commitment to sustainability is important to the culture because it’s built into the way they do business. For example, their Furniture Buyback program pays customers for used items, their refurbishment workshops fix and resell returned items, and their spare parts marketplace extends the life of products. These aren’t marketing claims—they’re measurable service systems customers can use. When brands demonstrate values through capability delivery, they earn cultural authority. When they merely state values through communications, they invite skepticism. The Strategic Imperative—And the Infrastructure Problem The shift from promise to delivery represents a categorical transformation in how brands create competitive advantage through customer value creation. The three-marketplace model reveals the mechanism: Culture elevates aspirations → Products must meet raised bars but quickly commoditize → Services differentiate by delivering elevated experiences → Service delivery earns cultural permission → Cultural authority compounds operational advantage. Technology eliminated the excuse for gaps between aspiration and reality. Consumers recalibrated expectations accordingly. But here’s the strategic tension most brand leaders haven’t fully confronted yet: When brands shift from making cheap promises to expensive experience innovation, the cost of guessing wrong increases dramatically. A failed advertising campaign costs media dollars and creative agency fees—painful, but contained. The brand survives. You regroup, test new messaging, and try again next quarter. Campaign failure is recoverable. A failed service platform costs engineering years, operational integration complexity, and customer trust. When you’ve asked customers to change behavior, integrate your service into their routines, share personal data, and invest time learning your interface, and then you deprecate that service, deliver broken experiences, or pivot strategy, leaving them stranded, you don’t just lose the financial investment. You lose permission. And unlike a cheesy Super Bowl ad that everyone forgets by February, a broken service or a poor experience is the kind of betrayal that still gets mentioned in a Reddit thread five years later. ‘Remember when Brand X launched that thing and it just… stopped working? Yep, never trusting them again. Brands that waste people’s time or betray their trust through incompetent execution don’t often get a second chance from their customers. Service failures create lasting brand damage that messaging can’t easily repair. This asymmetry creates a new imperative: Brand strategy can no longer afford to run on creative intuition, historical precedent, and post-launch measurement. The decision-making infrastructure that served the promise era is fundamentally inadequate for the capability era. A Clear Gap in Our Brand-Building Infrastructure The tools that most CMOs currently rely on, such as focus groups, brand tracking studies, campaign pre-testing, message recall metrics, and annual strategy planning cycles, were engineered for a world where: This infrastructure can’t support the new capability era, where The New Capabilities We Need For Experience Innovation CMOs investing in experience innovation need analytical infrastructure that can: → Simulate how cultural communities will respond before launching service platforms: Will this capability feel valuable or intrusive to target segments? Does it align with their elevated aspirations or violate their expectations for brand behavior? Which cultural communities will embrace it versus reject it? → Model which service touchpoints create sustainable habits versus one-time engagement: How many different life contexts must the service serve to achieve meaningful mental availability? What’s the threshold for behavioral lock-in that creates real switching costs? → Predict how quickly usage data will improve service quality: What volume of users is required to generate meaningful learning? At what point do the data advantages create defensible competitive moats versus remaining replicable by well-funded competitors? → Test whether proposed experiences actually deliver the elevated, personalized, joyful experiences that current cultural aspirations demand: Or will they feel transactional, generic, and friction-filled, failing to meet the raised performance bar that culture has established? → Assess operational feasibility and integration complexity: What organizational capabilities, technology infrastructure, and partnership ecosystems are required to deliver this service reliably at scale? Where are the execution risks that could turn a theoretically strong service into a practically broken experience? Current brand management tools still operate on unreasonably long timescales and fuzzy data types, such as stated preferences from surveys, recall metrics from tracking studies, and claimed behaviors from focus groups. All of these are fundamentally mismatched to service platform decisions. When you’re committing engineering years and operational integration to a capability that customers will depend on daily, you can’t afford to “test and learn” after launch. The cost of learning through failure is too high. Customer patience for broken experiences is too low. The competitive window for establishing behavioral advantages closes too quickly. The gap between what brand strategy now requires and what current analytical infrastructure provides has never been wider. Closing that gap – building decision-making tools adequate to the risks, speed, and complexity of experience innovation – is perhaps the most urgent infrastructure challenge facing marketing organizations today. The strategists who master this new discipline won’t just help brands avoid expensive mistakes. They’ll help brands simulate, test, and optimize service strategies in low-risk environments before committing capital to high-risk deployment. They’ll compress the learning cycle from years to weeks. They’ll turn experience innovation from a leap of faith into a calculated investment with predictable returns. That capability doesn’t exist at scale yet. Which means the professionals who build it will define the next era of brand strategy practice. The Human Cost—And the Professional Opportunity Remember the hundreds of strategists who lost their jobs in December? This is what this shift means for them—and frankly anyone navigating the future of brand building today. This isn’t just theoretical. It’s deeply personal for thousands of talented people right now. The market for traditional brand strategy work is contracting. Not cyclically, but structurally. When brands realize that incremental media spend produces 0.3x ROI while experience infrastructure generates 3.2x returns, they don’t just shift budgets—they shift what kind of expertise they actually need. The demand signal moves from “help us craft better messages” to “help us architect better value delivery.” This creates profound professional displacement. Strategists trained in cultural semiotics, brand positioning frameworks, and campaign development find their core skills misaligned with what clients now require. The anxiety in the strategy community is real and entirely justified. Careers that seemed secure—trajectories pointing toward Chief Strategy Officer roles, agency leadership, and independent consulting—suddenly feel precarious. But I want to be clear about something: This displacement isn’t the death of brand strategy. It’s the genesis of something more valuable. The shift from promise to delivery doesn’t eliminate the need for strategic thinking; it elevates it. The questions become harder, the stakes become higher, and the impact becomes more measurable: Old question: How do we position our brand to resonate culturally? New question: What service capabilities must we build to earn permission to shape cultural conversations? Old question: What message will differentiate us from competitors? New question: What delivered experiences will create behavioral advantages that messaging can’t overcome? Old question: How do we communicate our values authentically? New question: What operational systems will demonstrate our values through capability delivery? These new questions aren’t easy to answer. They require strategic rigor plus an understanding of technology enablement, operational feasibility, data architecture, and service design. They demand strategists who can operate at the intersection of culture, capability, and customer value—not just at the intersection of culture, creativity, and communications. I firmly believe this is the future of brand strategy work: helping companies build value-delivery systems that earn cultural authority rather than crafting communications that try to cheat it. The opportunity space is vast: These aren’t incremental evolutions of existing roles. They’re new disciplines that don’t yet have established career paths, educational pipelines, or professional associations. Which means: The strategists who master this transition will define the next era of our profession. For many strategy professionals, the recent layoffs feel like a hopeless ending. And for too many careers, they will be. But for strategists willing to evolve from promise architects to value delivery shapers, this moment represents the most significant professional opportunity of our era. The old guard is collapsing. The new infrastructure doesn’t exist yet. And yet, the brands that will dominate the next decade desperately need strategic guidance on how to make this transition without destroying operational efficiency or customer trust in the process. The uncertainty you’re feeling isn’t the absence of a future. It’s the absence of a defined future. Someone will define it. The question is whether displaced strategists will lead that redefinition effort or wait for engineers to do it for them. And trust me—you don’t want engineers defining what ‘cultural salience’ means.

Title: Amazon demands proof of productivity from employees, asking for list of accomplishments
URL: https://fortune.com/2026/01/08/amazon-demands-proof-of-productivity-from-employees-asking-for-list-of-accomplishments/
Time Published: 2026-01-08T18:33:03Z
Full Content:
Internal documents reveal that Amazon is asking its corporate workers to list three to five accomplishments that reflect their best work, according to people familiar with the matter and an internal guideline obtained by Business Insider. Employees must provide specific examples of what they delivered to the company, along with actions they plan to take in order to continue growing at the company. “Accomplishments are specific projects, goals, initiatives, or process improvements that show the impact of your work,” the internal guideline specified. “Consider situations where you took risks or innovated, even if it didn’t lead to the results you hoped for.” The performance review process, known internally as Forte, helps the company determine future pay. The new performance standards mark a break from previous reviews, according to people familiar with the matter, placing greater emphasis on individual accomplishments than in recent years. Amazon has about 350,000 corporate employees and a total workforce of approximately 1.56 million globally, with most of its corporate employees subject to the performance review process. Past Amazon reviews have placed less emphasis on productivity, instead asking employees about their areas of interest and strengths, posing questions like “When you’re at your best, how do you contribute?” To be sure, productivity is a common metric measured in corporate performance reviews. Productivity, along with goal progress, strengths and attendance are common talking points of corporate performance reviews. And an updated performance review does not indicate that Amazon plans to conduct layoffs. Yet Amazon’s performance review models standards around employee discipline that have become commonplace throughout the tech industry in recent years. After taking over X (formerly Twitter) in 2022, Elon Musk demanded Twitter employees explain what they accomplished each week, a tactic he brought to the federal government as head of the Department of Government Efficiency last year. CBS News chief Bari Weiss asked her staff to describe their jobs to her when she took over in October 2025, according to a memo viewed by Business Insider. An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment when contacted by Fortune. The review shift matches similar changes made at Amazon since Jassy took over from founder Jeff Bezos as CEO. In September 2024, the company initiated a return-to-office requirement for corporate employees and, in May 2025, altered compensation to better reward the highest performers. Documents leaked in 2022 revealed a peek into the company’s review process. In the documents, Amazon bosses were instructed to gauge an employee’s “overall value” by evaluating two metrics: their performance score and the potential they had exhibited. The tech giant has also reshaped its workforce through layoffs. In October, the company laid off 14,000 corporate employees amid broader AI investments. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy is bullish on emerging AI technologies and has sought aggressive cost-cutting measures for the company since starting in the role. Last June, Jassy wrote in a letter to employees that “AI agents will change how we all work and live,” defining agents as “teammates” that will help employees “focus less on rote work.” And in July, Jassy told CNBC’s Jim Cramer that AI would fundamentally reshape Amazon’s workforce, automating menial work while creating new opportunities in advanced technology. However, Jassy says that the corporate layoffs had nothing to do with AI development or cutting costs, pointing instead to a mismatched cultural fit. “The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it’s not even really AI-driven, not right now at least,” he said. “It’s culture.” Amazon is placing its bets on AI, announcing in July an additional $100 million investment in AWS generative AI, as well as $50 billion in investments to expand AI and supercomputing infrastructure for government agencies.

Title: Best of CES 2026: Android Authority’s top products from the show!

Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more. January 8, 2026 A new year means a fresh CES, and once again Las Vegas turned into tech central for CES 2026. Our team spent the week on the ground, walking the show floors, chasing down announcements, and getting hands-on with as many products as humanly possible. Nobody can see everything at CES, since the show is massive, but we focused on the gear that genuinely stood out. This year brought big upgrades in smart home tech, plenty of creative ideas in mobile and wearables, smarter displays, and a few products that simply put a smile on our faces. So let’s get into it. Here are the Android Authority Best of CES 2026 Award winners. Samsung’s boldest foldable yet made its public debut at CES 2026. The Galaxy Z TriFold immediately feels like both a glimpse of what’s next and a reminder of how hard that future is to reach. This is Samsung’s first phone that folds twice, opening from a standard cover display into a full 10-inch AMOLED tablet. The TriFold finally delivers on the long-promised idea of a tablet that actually fits in your pocket. Internally, the Galaxy Z TriFold shares a lot with the Galaxy Z Fold 7, including the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip and the same camera setup, but adds a larger 5,400mAh battery to help power the much bigger screen. Where the TriFold really separates itself is software. One UI 8 on Android 16 enables true three-app multitasking, splitting the screen into equal thirds without crushing app layouts. Samsung DeX can also run directly on the device, turning the inner display into a full desktop workspace without an external monitor. The Galaxy Z TriFold is an engineering statement more than a mass-market product, but as a Best of CES pick, it shows just how far Samsung is willing to push form factors. SPONSORED ARZOPA is known for its innovative, affordable digital display technology, designed to elevate how we work, play, and connect. And while Christmas might be behind us, you don’t need special occasions to give your family gifts, especially when it’s something as thoughtful and bound to bring a whole lot of joy as the ARZOPA D14 Digital Photo Frame. While you might be away from your family, the D14 digital photo frame lets you still share beautiful moments and memories instantly. With just a tap, you can send photos and videos to any D14 photo frame anywhere in the world, so every update becomes a shared moment, with share-anytime-anywhere convenience. Of course, multiple family members can send photos and videos directly to the frame, keeping you instantly connected to your family, even if you’re thousands of miles apart. With a gorgeous 14-inch IPS anti-glare display with a Full HD resolution, every photo and video stands out in beautiful detail. It connects to Wi-Fi, so pictures and videos are uploaded and available instantly, and you can even send 2-minute video messages through the frame. With 32GB of built-in storage, microSD card support, and free and unlimited cloud storage, you can share plenty of memories for years; no subscriptions or fees to worry about. It’s easy to set up and use, and is designed to blend seamlessly into any space around your or your family’s home. Whether it’s for your parents, grandparents, siblings, or your own household, the ARZOPA D14 Digital Photo Frame is a gift that grows more and more meaningful the more you share. TCL doubled down on eye comfort at CES 2026 with the NXTPAPER 70 Pro, a phone built for people who spend a lot of time staring at their screens. Using NXTPAPER 4.0, the 6.9-inch FHD+ 120Hz display has a matte, paper-like finish that cuts glare and reflections without sacrificing smoothness. It feels closer to reading on paper than a normal display and that difference is obvious the moment you pick it up. The dedicated NXTPAPER button returns, letting you switch between display modes, including a high-contrast monochrome option that is ideal for reading. TCL also improved the anti-flicker tech, which not only reduces eye strain but makes the screen easier to film without visible banding, a small touch that shows how much thought went into real-world use. Under the hood, the NXTPAPER 70 Pro keeps things sensible. You get a 50MP main camera with optical stabilization and TCL’s MuseFilm processing, a Dimensity 7300 chip, and a 5,200mAh battery. Performance is not chasing flagships, but that is not the point here. Optional T-Pen support and built-in AI translation features add to the phone’s practical appeal. Priced from around $400, the TCL NXTPAPER 70 Pro stands out by offering a genuinely different smartphone experience. SPONSORED DREO is known for its intuitive, efficient, powerful, and elegantly designed home appliances. From tower fans and ceiling fans to portable ACs, humidifiers, heaters, and more, DREO offers a massive portfolio of performance-focused, user-centric products that make your home life easier. And the brand is bringing all that expertise to its latest product showcase at CES 2026 – the TurboCool™ Misting Fan 765S. As its name suggests, the Misting Fan 765S delivers faster, stronger cooling you can feel immediately. It’s dramatically cooler from the get-go, beyond anything you’d get from traditional fans and evaporative coolers, with lab tests showing a massive ambient temperature drop of up to 10°F. When used as a misting fan or humidifier, it’s designed for mess-free indoor use. The device produces ultrafine 17 μm mist that evaporates rapidly without condensing, even at the highest mist output levels. A dedicated internal blower system and an advanced dual-channel flow system separate air and mist paths, preventing the formation of large droplets. You won’t have to worry about damp floors or furniture when using the fan in Mist or Humidifier modes. Its HyperSilent™ operation, going as low as 20 db, makes it ideal for bedrooms, nurseries, and close-range use. Whether you’re working, watching TV, or sleeping, the Misting Fan 765S won’t be a distraction. And finally, the Misting Fan 765S is easy to manage and maintain. Its pump-free architecture eliminates mold and bacteria buildup, and it’s easy to remove, clean, and refill the 6L tank. The large tank provides up to 7 hours of Turbo cooling, or up to 30 hours in lower settings. You get independent wind and mist adjustments, 12 fan speeds, and integrated temperature and humidity sensors so you can find the perfect balance. Everything is easy to set up and control, via the app, using your voice (compatible with Alexa and Google Assistant), or with a remote. The DREO TurboCool™ Misting Fan 765S is priced at $179.99 and will be available from April 2026. SPONSORED We see lots of smart lighting showcased at events like CES, and this year is no different. One that truly stands out from the crowd is the Linkind SP6 Smart Solar Pathway Light. Designed for backyards and lawns with pathways, the SP6 is ideal for anyone looking to upgrade their pathway lighting, bringing not only safety but also a touch of style and elegance to your home’s outdoor areas. What makes the SP6 pathway light special is the inclusion of five interchangeable projection lenses that let you create patterns like Ripple, Concentric, Radial, Circular, and Lozenge. The best part? It’s all managed and controlled through the AiDot app; no tools required, and you don’t have to swap lenses manually to change the projection pattern. With 60 lumens of output and tunable white and full-spectrum RGB color adjustment, the possibilities for your outdoor decor are endless. The SP6 Smart Pathway Lights are easy to install and durable, and are powered by an advanced MPPT system that optimizes solar charging, especially in low-light conditions. A full charge gives you 12 hours of brightness, and there’s also an Eco Mode for extended running. And if solar power isn’t enough, say, during poor weather, you can also charge the lights via the built-in USB-C port. With multiple lights, you can turn your walkway into a personal lighting experience. With Bluetooth Mesh, you get automatic syncing across connected devices without a hub or Wi-Fi. And through the app, you also get 43 preset modes, music-sync capability, and scheduling for seamless, coordinated lighting effects. If you’re looking to enhance your outdoor pathway lighting, the Linkind SP6 Smart Solar Pathway Lights offer the convenience and ease of use like no other and are a great way to improve your outdoor safety and ambiance. Roborock went big at CES 2026 with the Saros Rover, a robot vacuum that rethinks mobility in a way we have not seen before. Instead of trying to work around obstacles, the Rover deals with them head-on. It uses a pair of hinged wheel-legs that let it balance, lift itself, and move over uneven surfaces, including stairs. Yes, it can climb stairs, and it can clean them while doing so. Unlike earlier stair solutions that simply carry a vacuum from one floor to another, the Saros Rover stays active the entire time. As it climbs, one leg remains planted on the step below to keep the body stable, while the other moves forward. That lets the Rover clean each step individually on the way up or down. Roborock says the system also works on curved staircases and ramps, which makes it far more flexible than past attempts at vertical cleaning. The Rover is still a preview rather than a finished product, and Roborock is not ready to talk pricing or launch timing yet. Even so, seeing it operate in person makes one thing clear. This is a strong attempt to solve one of the last major problems in robotic cleaning, and it hints at a future where no part of your home is off-limits to a robot vacuum. Motorola made its biggest foldable leap yet at CES 2026 with the Razr Fold, the company’s first book-style foldable and a clear signal that the Razr brand is no longer limited to clamshells. Built around an 8.1-inch inner display and a tall outer screen, the Razr Fold feels immediately familiar if you have used other large foldables. But it still carries Motorola’s design DNA, from its clean software look to its signature materials and finishes. In hand, the Razr Fold strikes a balance between size and comfort. It opens into a spacious tablet-like canvas that feels well-suited for any task. Meanwhile, the outer display remains useful enough to handle quick tasks without unfolding. Motorola’s hardware confidence shows here. The hinge feels solid, the displays are bright and smooth, and the overall design feels well thought out. Motorola’s software approach also plays to its strengths. The experience stays close to stock Android, with light customization and thoughtful touches carried over from the Razr flip lineup. Even in early hands-on time, the interface feels calm and approachable on a large screen, which is not always a given with foldables. The Razr Fold marks Motorola’s entry into large foldables with a clear focus on design, usability, and brand identity. If Motorola can follow through on polish and long-term support, the Razr Fold has the potential to become a compelling alternative for people who want an approachable large foldable. XGIMI surprised us at CES 2026 by stepping away from projectors and into wearable tech with the Memo One, the lead product under its new MemoMind brand. These AI glasses actually look and feel wearable, weighing just 28.9g and designed for all-day use without calling attention to themselves. In person, the Memo One feels closer to normal eyewear than most smart glasses we have seen so far. The Memo One uses dual-eye displays paired with built-in speakers to deliver information discreetly. The system focuses on short, relevant interactions, such as live translation, summaries, reminders, note-taking, and contextual guidance. Powering all of this is a hybrid AI system that dynamically selects the best model for each task, pulling from multiple major AI platforms in the background. Comfort and personalization are clearly a priority. XGIMI offers multiple frame styles and interchangeable temples, along with full prescription lens support. Battery life is also handled sensibly, with all-day use from the glasses themselves and a charging case that can stretch total runtime close to a full week. At around $599, the MemoMind Memo One are not cheap, but they feel thoughtfully positioned. If AI glasses are going to move beyond novelty, this is the kind of approach that gives them a real shot. Lenovo brought a more focused handheld experience to CES 2026 with the SteamOS version of the Legion Go 2. It is the same second-generation hardware as the Windows model, but paired with Valve’s controller-first operating system for players who want their handheld to feel closer to a console than a tiny PC. The pitch is simple and effective. SteamOS handles quick suspend and resume, native Steam library access, cloud saves, and a UI built around buttons and sticks rather than menus and windows. Lenovo says this is its most powerful handheld to ship natively with SteamOS. You get an 8.8-inch OLED display with a 144Hz refresh rate, an AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip, up to 32GB of LPDDR5X memory, and up to 2TB of storage with microSD expansion. What makes this model appealing is choice. Windows is there for flexibility and broad compatibility, while SteamOS is for players who want a cleaner, more predictable gaming experience without desktop friction. That mirrors what Lenovo already did with the Legion Go S, and it feels like a smart continuation of that strategy. Starting at $1,199 and launching around June 2026, the SteamOS Legion Go 2 is clearly positioned above the Steam Deck on price. Lenovo is aiming at players who want top-tier handheld hardware and prefer SteamOS to do exactly one thing well: play games. Dreame returned to CES 2026 with a clear goal: refine its flagship robot vacuum without making compromises. The X60 Max Ultra builds on last year’s stair-climbing concept and pushes it further, letting the robot roll over obstacles up to 8.8cm high. That still will not handle a full staircase, but it is enough to deal with raised thresholds, room dividers, and other problem spots that usually stop a robot in its tracks. Dreame really managed to slim things down with this new model. The X60 Max Ultra measures just 7.95cm tall, making it the company’s lowest-profile robot yet. To pull that off, Dreame uses a retracting LiDAR system that lowers itself when the robot moves under furniture, then pops back up to maintain full mapping accuracy. Paired with the latest OmniSight navigation system, Dreame claims significantly faster path planning and more confident object recognition. Mobility is handled by the new FlexiAdapt system, which uses retractable legs and swinging arms ahead of the wheels to lift the robot over raised surfaces instead of avoiding them. Combined with strong suction and a full mopping setup, the X60 is designed to clean more of your home in a single pass, rather than asking you to prep the space first. The high-end dock rounds things out with hot-water mop washing at 100°C, cutting down on odors and manual maintenance. Priced at $1,699, the Dreame X60 Max Ultra is firmly in flagship territory, but it earns that spot by tackling multiple real-world pain points all at once. Beatbot used CES 2026 to show just how far robotic pool care has progressed, and the AquaSense X is the clearest example yet. AquaSense is a system designed to make pool maintenance feel close to self-managing, from cleaning to post-cycle upkeep. The standout feature is the AstroRinse Cleaning Station, a self-cleaning dock that automatically rinses the robot’s internal filter, flushes debris into a sealed bag, and starts recharging once a cycle is finished. For pool owners, this removes one of the most annoying parts of robotic cleaning. No more handling wet filters or rinsing debris by hand after every run. The large-capacity debris bag is built to last weeks between emptying, even with frequent cleaning. Beatbot AI 2.0 and HybridSense AI Vision combine cameras with infrared and ultrasonic sensors to identify dozens of debris types across the pool floor, walls, waterline, and surface. Navigation adapts dynamically to pool shape and depth, allowing a single cycle to handle areas that often require separate passes on other robots, including shallow ledges and surface debris. At $4,250, the Beatbot AquaSense X is a premium product. But by addressing both cleaning and the maintenance that follows, it can conceivably take care of the pool in the background, which feels like the real next step for this category. TCL went all-in on premium TV performance at CES 2026 with the X11L Series, a flagship Mini LED TV that is clearly aimed at ending the usual OLED versus LED debate. The X11L combines extreme brightness, deep black levels, and unusually accurate color in a well-rounded package. At the core of the X11L is TCL’s new SQD-Mini LED display system, built around Super Quantum Dots, a new UltraColor filter, and advanced color processing. Users get BT.2020 color coverage with far more consistency than we usually see from Mini LED panels. TCL pairs that color performance with up to 20,000 dimming zones and peak brightness hitting 10,000 nits. This combo of features should translate into intense highlights, strong contrast, and minimal blooming even in difficult scenes. TCL’s upgraded Halo Control System and new 26-bit backlight controller allow for tighter light control and cleaner shadow detail, while the TSR AI Processor handles motion, upscaling, clarity, and sound tuning. The panel itself is ultra-thin, just 0.8 inches (20mm) deep, with a flat back designed to sit flush on a wall, reinforced by an Art Mode that helps it blend into a living space when not in use. Audio is similarly ambitious. Bang and Olufsen tuning is built in, with the option to expand into a full wireless Dolby Atmos setup over time, including a subwoofer and surround speakers. Starting at $6,999 for the 75-inch model, the TCL X11L SQD-Mini LED sets its own bar for what a no-compromise premium TV should look like in 2026. Razer brought one of the more unexpected ideas to CES with Project Motoko, a concept that asks a simple question: what if smart glasses worked just as well without sitting on your face. Instead of lenses, Motoko builds its AI experience into a pair of over-ear headphones that look and feel like regular wireless cans. The trick is a pair of forward-facing cameras embedded into the headphones, capturing a first-person view of the world around you. Motoko delivers the same kind of contextual help we have come to expect from smart glasses. Live translation, object recognition, price comparisons, directions, and weather updates all worked smoothly in demos. The system is not locked to a single assistant either, with support for platforms like Gemini, ChatGPT, and others depending on what you prefer. What makes Motoko stand out is the form factor. Unlike smart glasses, these headphones blend in. On the head, they feel like normal everyday headphones, and visually, nothing about them signals experimental tech. For people who like the idea of ambient AI help but do not want a visible wearable, that matters a lot. Project Motoko is still a concept, with no pricing or release details yet. If Razer decides to take this further, smart headphones could end up being a far more natural home for everyday AI than glasses ever were. LG Display showed off one of the most extreme gaming panels we’ve seen with a 27-inch OLED monitor panel built for pure speed. This is a QHD display that pushes refresh rates far beyond what most gamers have ever seen, topping out at a staggering 720Hz. The headline feature is Dynamic Frequency and Resolution, or DFR. This lets players choose what matters most in the moment. In Performance Mode, the panel runs at a full 720Hz for the smoothest possible motion. Switch to Resolution Mode, and it delivers QHD clarity at 540Hz, still far beyond today’s mainstream gaming monitors. Paired with a 0.02ms gray-to-gray response time, motion blur and latency are pushed to levels that LCD panels simply cannot match. Because this is OLED, image quality keeps up with the speed. The panel delivers perfect blacks, up to 1,500 nits of peak brightness, and near-complete DCI-P3 coverage with strong BT.2020 support. Color depth and contrast remain intact even at extreme refresh rates, which is not something high-speed panels have always managed in the past. LG Display also leaned into comfort, with flicker-free operation, reduced glare, and low blue light output to support longer play sessions. As a technology showcase, this 720Hz OLED panel sets a new ceiling for competitive gaming displays and signals where the very top end of esports hardware is heading next. Samsung expanded its PC ambitions at CES with the Galaxy Book 6 lineup, pairing Intel’s newest Panther Lake processors with a clearer performance hierarchy and the return of the Ultra model. The series includes the Galaxy Book 6, Book 6 Pro, and the Galaxy Book 6 Ultra, covering everything from thin-and-light productivity to heavy creative and gaming workloads. All models are built around Intel Core Ultra Series 3 chips, delivering a sizable jump in performance and efficiency. The base and Pro models rely on Intel Arc integrated graphics, while the Galaxy Book 6 Ultra stands apart by offering NVIDIA RTX 50 series GPUs. The Ultra can also be configured with up to 64GB of memory, reinforcing its position as the most powerful Galaxy Book yet. Displays remain a strong point. The Pro and Ultra feature Samsung’s latest Dynamic AMOLED panels with high resolution, dynamic 120Hz refresh rates, strong brightness, and anti-reflective coatings. For battery, Samsung claims up to 30 hours of video playback on the Pro and Ultra. Design tweaks are subtle but intentional, including cleaner branding and a more uniform keyboard layout. Samsung has not yet announced pricing for the Galaxy Book 6 series. Availability begins later this month in select markets, with US sales expected to start in the spring. Lenovo continued its rollable push at CES 2026 with the Legion Pro Rollable Concept, a gaming laptop that takes the idea of an expanding display to an extreme. Built for esports and high-end gaming, this concept starts as a fairly normal 16-inch laptop and then unfurls into something much larger, turning into a desktop-style gaming screen on demand. The rollable PureSight OLED display can expand up to 24 inches in “Arena mode,” or stop at 21.5 inches in “Tactical mode” for setups where space is more limited. That flexibility is the real hook here. You can travel with a reasonably sized gaming laptop and still get a massive screen once you sit down to play. Lenovo uses a dual-motor system to extend the display smoothly, aiming to keep vibration and noise to a minimum during the transition. Under the hood, the concept is based on the Legion Pro 7i, which means top-tier hardware. Lenovo confirmed that the system is paired with Intel Core Ultra processors and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090, making it clear this is not just a visual experiment. This is still very much a concept, and Lenovo has not said when or if it will reach production. Even so, it feels like a natural next step after the company’s first commercial rollable laptop. Pebble made an unexpected and welcome return to Las Vegas with the Pebble Round 2, a smartwatch that feels deliberately out of step with modern wearables, in the best way possible. It is a spiritual follow-up to the Pebble Time Round, keeping the same ultra-thin, lightweight circular design while fixing its biggest flaw with a much larger, edge-to-edge display. The new 1.3-inch e-paper screen completely changes how the watch feels day to day. Notifications are easier to read, watch faces finally have room to breathe, and visibility in bright light is excellent without relying on a backlight. Pebble sticking with e-paper is a clear statement that this watch prioritizes readability and battery life over flashy visuals. Comfort is where the Pebble Round 2 really stands apart. The case is extremely thin and light, to the point where it almost disappears on your wrist. For people with smaller wrists, or anyone tired of bulky smartwatches, this is refreshing. It feels closer to wearing a traditional watch than a mini computer. There are obvious omissions. No heart rate sensor, GPS, NFC, speaker, or fitness tracking. That is intentional. The Pebble Round 2 is designed to be a notification-first smartwatch with up to 14 days of battery life, nothing more. Pebble Round 2 costs $199 and is expected to start shipping in May. A collaboration between XREAL and ASUS, the ROG XREAL R1 is a gaming-first take on AR glasses that puts a high-refresh display directly in front of your eyes. This is not positioned as a general-purpose wearable. It is designed to function like a portable gaming monitor, and the hardware reflects that focus. Each lens features a 1080p micro-OLED display running at up to 240Hz, with latency rated at just three milliseconds. That combination makes fast motion feel smooth and responsive, closer to what you would expect from a dedicated gaming display than from a wearable. A wider 57-degree field of view helps the virtual screen feel more immersive without dominating your entire vision. The R1 fits neatly into ASUS’ gaming ecosystem. It connects over USB-C for simple plug-and-play use and pairs especially well with devices like the ROG Ally. A dedicated dock lets you switch between multiple inputs, while built-in head tracking allows the display to stay anchored in space as you move. Audio is handled through Bose-tuned speakers built into the arms, keeping the setup self-contained. Automatic electrochromic lens tinting adjusts to ambient light, making the glasses easier to wear across different environments. Pricing has not been announced yet, but availability is expected in the first half of 2026. Our annual Best of CES awards highlight products that stand out at the very top of the show.

Title: Can Palantir Double Again in 2026? This Analyst Is Confident

Investing Palantir (PLTR) trades at 180 times forward earnings despite expected sales growth slowing from 54% to 42%. Palantir reports full-year 2025 results on February 2nd. The stock has stalled near $180 after reaching $200 in October. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives believes Palantir could reach a $1 trillion valuation within two to three years. Sending You to Google News in 3 © Shutterstock / Piotr Swat Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR) stock has made remarkably little progress in the past few months. It is below the level it was in August 2025, so concerns about a plateau seem quite valid. The momentum that carried it from $20 in April 2024 to over $200 in October 2025 seems lost. That said, no one knows what kind of paradigm shift 2026 may bring for the company as defense tech spending remains hot. The business itself is humming on strong, with the full-year 2025 plus Q4 report expected to be out on the 2nd of February. This may reinvigorate the bulls and push the stock beyond $200 again if Palantir reports another blockbuster quarter. But some analysts believe $200 is just a stepping stone to an even more ambitious valuation: $1 trillion. Let’s first look at where Palantir stands today before we explore the analyst’s argument. Among big companies, Palantir is the one you have to pay the most for, by far. Analysts who have been ringing the bell on an AI bubble expect Palantir to be the first domino to fall, even ahead of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). That’s because, unlike Nvidia, the stock price is far ahead of the earnings curve. Buying PLTR stock at ~$180 today means you’re paying for results over a decade in advance. PLTR stock trades at almost 180 times forward earnings. Even on a free cash flow basis, you’re paying in excess of 130 times FCF. In comparison, NVDA stock trades at 25 times forward earnings with stronger and more durable sales growth. A software company like Palantir is not in the intersection of the AI infrastructure buildout and mostly relies on an increasing number of customers. The company can scale once it gets its foot in the door, but there’s only so much market it can capture. Analysts thus expect sales growth to come down a notch from ~54% for all of 2025 to ~42% in 2026. EPS growth is also expected to come down from 77% to less than 40% this year. In short, you may not be getting your money’s worth. The idea is that AI will be rapidly adopted across U.S. commercial companies, with Palantir being the “default” enterprise AI platform. This may allow it to grow much faster than expected, with Wall Street slapping an even higher premium. And the idea does have some meat to it. If the market was comfortable paying over 200 times forward earnings, 400, or even 500, may not look too ridiculous until the music stops. The most well-known analyst pushing this is Dan Ives from Wedbush, who believes Palantir can be a $1 trillion company within “two to three years”. He has advised investors to “triple down” on the stock. A lesser-known analyst, Will McGough from Prime Capital, also believes PLTR can reach a $1 trillion market cap. The likelihood of PLTR stock doubling in 2026 is minuscule. If the AI rally accelerates this year, PLTR Palantir can cross $200 again, and perhaps $250, but even with blockbuster earnings and an unceasing rally, doubling the market cap from here is unrealistic. The stock has been losing momentum, so a $1 trillion valuation in even two years is extremely unlikely at this point. Software AI stocks are seeing maturing valuations, and the market is likely to let the earnings catch up to the sky-high valuations first before slapping a bigger premium. The worst-case scenario would be if the AI rally ends this year. There’s plenty of profit to be taken, and the market will hurriedly punish the stock, especially if Palantir cannot sustain the beat-and-raise cadence for dozens of quarters as expected. All things considered, it is much safer to buy AI hardware stocks. For software AI, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) remains my top bet. Our top personal finance-related articles today.

Title: 20VC x SaaStr Is Back!!: Nvidia’s $20B Groq Grab, Meta’s $2.5B Manus Play, and Why “Invisible Unemployment” Will Define 2026
URL: https://www.saastr.com/20vc-x-saastr-is-back-nvidias-20b-groq-grab-metas-2-5b-manus-play-and-why-invisible-unemployment-will-define-2026/
Time Published: 2026-01-08T17:21:49Z
Full Content:
by Jason Lemkin | Blog Posts The latest from the 20VC x SaaStr collaboration with Harry Stebbings, Jason Lemkin, and Rory O’Driscoll Jensen Huang wanted the deal done before Christmas. He got it in two weeks. Nvidia just dropped $20 billion on Groq—a company doing sub-$50 million in revenue—because when you’re protecting a $3.5 trillion market cap, 1% is a rounding error. Meanwhile, Meta paid $2.5 billion for Manus (25x ARR), Yan LeCun is calling Alex Wang “naive and inexperienced,” and somewhere in America, Stanford CS grads are discovering that a degree from the best university in the world doesn’t guarantee a job anymore. Welcome to 2026: the year of spite startups, 24/7 AI inference, and “invisible unemployment” that won’t show up in the government numbers but will reshape everything. Jensen didn’t buy Groq for its $175 million in revenue. He bought it to eliminate margin pressure on a $100 billion annual cash flow machine. “There’s only five or six people that can exert margin pressure at all on Nvidia,” Rory explained. “This was potentially one of them. And let’s get it off the table.” The math is brutal in its simplicity: $20 billion is less than 1% of Nvidia’s market cap and less than 20% of annual free cash flow. For that price, they neutralize a competitor, acquire Jonathan Ross (inventor of Google’s TPU), and close the whole thing before the holiday party. The kicker? 3x the last round is the traditional “remove all objections and close instantly” price. Jensen knew exactly what he was doing. Benchmark turned a controversial bet into a 5x return in 8 months. But the real story is why the founders sold at $2.5 billion when they were doing 125 million run rate and growing fast. “This was a local maximum deal,” Jason argued. “Best of breed orchestration layer, but Anthropic can do some of this. OpenAI is going to do some of this. They’re all running multiple LLMs. They’re all orchestrating multiple agents.” The founders owned 80% of the company. At $2.5 billion, they each walked away with roughly half a billion dollars. In Singapore. With 0% capital gains tax. “In the end, words are words and half a billion dollars is life-changing,” Rory added. “At some point the entrepreneur can turn to you and say: if you think $2.5 billion is underpriced, don’t cash out my $500 million—give me $50 million off the table.” Anthropic was born from spite with OpenAI. XAI was born from spite. Now Yan LeCun is potentially starting another spite startup after publicly calling out Meta’s AI strategy. “If you want to make money in venture, you got to search out spite,” Jason declared. “This is driving the greatest AI companies of our generation.” But it goes deeper than founder feuds. Jason argues many CEOs are driven by spite about how they were forced to run companies in 2021—the “kumbaya work at home” era that let the world pass them by. “Zuck is spiteful he was forced to run the company in a certain way. He may burn every last penny he has, but some of it’s out of spite that they got this far behind.” OpenAI is spending 46% of revenue on stock-based compensation—34x higher than comparable pre-IPO tech companies. The panel’s take? It makes total sense. “If you’re a CEO and you have zero shares, you don’t worry about dilution,” Jason noted. “Sam just wants to build the biggest greatest AI company on planet Earth. If he dilutes everyone 99%, it doesn’t impact him at all as a shareholder.” Rory added the historical perspective: “No one ever said to Winston Churchill, ‘Congratulations, you won World War II on budget.’ They just said, ‘Congratulations, you won World War II.'” The real tell? Even with $1.5 million average compensation, OpenAI still only has 60% retention among researchers. The talent wars have thrown all conventions out the window. SoftBank closed its $40 billion OpenAI investment on December 29th. Days later, the position was already up 2-3x on paper. “The level of risk tolerance that guy has is just amazing,” Rory said. “He had the right to put $40 billion in OpenAI. Now I better find the money by selling other stuff. He’s scurrying right down to the line to find the money the week before Christmas.” But here’s the real insight: Masa is now the only double-digit percentage shareholder in what could be the most important company of the next decade. Entry price was high, but ownership percentage at this stage is nearly impossible to achieve. “His greatest play ever was Alibaba—getting 20% and holding it for 20 years,” Jason said. “But if OpenAI goes to the moon, this may be his best deal ever. He had to enter later, but he got his double digits. It’s not easy to get double digits at this stage.” OpenAI is developing a pen-like device with a camera and microphone. Johnny Ive is involved. The initial reaction was skepticism—but Jason sees something bigger. “Over the holidays, my Claude named itself out of the blue. It named itself Ren. I didn’t ask it to.” The insight: When we’re all running AI 24/7—multiple agents, continuous inference, persistent memory across every conversation—we’ll want our AI companion with us everywhere. Not as a note-taking device, but as a permanently present intelligence that knows everything about our lives. “When most people believe their AIs are alive, even if they aren’t, when most AIs might even think they’re sentient, you will take it with you 24/7.” Navan went public and promptly dropped to 4x ARR. A 27% growth company with positive non-GAAP operating income trading at 4x revenue should be a win—but the circumstances tell a different story. “Maybe Navan only IPO’d because it was their least best bad option,” Jason suggested. “700 million in debt, only 200 million in cash. It had to IPO to pay off its debt.” The lesson: If you’re not Figma or better, it’s going to be rough out there. The IPO window isn’t open—it’s barely cracked. And companies like Stripe, Databricks, and Revolut are proving that staying private might just be the smarter play. “If companies that are worth $4 billion can’t go public with 27% growth and cash flows, then the public markets can quit bitching about how all the value is being created in the private markets,” Rory argued. “They can look the public markets in the eye and say: ‘You guys just aren’t a compelling product.'” This might be the most important insight of the episode. Jason sees a massive labor market shift that won’t show up in government statistics—but will reshape tech and society. “Shopify saying for the third year in a row they can hit insane growth without adding any headcount. Every single CEO wanting to keep headcount flat and backfill with AI. This is not robots firing us. This is tighter and tighter companies, radically higher ARR per employee.” The most vulnerable? Entry-level knowledge workers and senior executives who can’t reskill. “If you’re top of your class in math at any school, you will be found by Anthropic and OpenAI. They will find you. But for the other 99% of your class—why do I need you with Claude Code? Why do I need any SDRs? We don’t need any of them.” IBM reported turnover of almost 2% last year. “No one left IBM because they know they got no other job.” Revolut is doing $3.5 billion in profit. Stripe kicks off billions in free cash flow. Databricks just raised at $62 billion. Why would any of them go public? “If you can take out $400 million a year yourself just as a dividend, that’s enough for many of us,” Jason pointed out. “He can play the bank dividend card. At when you’re producing $3.5 billion, what does he own? 18%. Just say I’m going to dividend it out.” The panel identified two distinct categories now: traditional late-stage (companies that can’t yet go public) and what Jason calls “Post-IPO Scale Still Private”—companies that could go public but actively choose not to. “If I was running NASDAQ or NYSE: Why is our product so uncompelling to Ali at Databricks that he got all the way to $150 billion in enterprise value before he thought going public was a good idea?” The scariest insight: Young, driven founders know exactly who the other driven people are in their cohort. And with AI reducing headcount requirements, they never have to lower the bar. “The scariest judge of young talent is young talent,” Rory observed. “The 25-year-old founder knows the five people in his class who were smart and the 95 who didn’t grind—and he’s only going to hire the ones who were smart.” Previously, companies needed 300 people to reach $100 million in revenue. If you can get there with 30, you never have to compromise on culture, work ethic, or talent quality. “If you don’t need 300 people to get to $100 million in revenue anymore, you just don’t need 300 people. So you don’t have to give. So that means no jobs for those people.” On the spite economy: “For venture, this is the era of the spite startup. Anthropic’s a spite startup, XAI and Twitter’s a spite startup. Now we’ve got Meta’s AI guy who’s doing a new spite startup. If you want to make money in venture, you got to search out spite. This is driving the greatest AI companies of our generation.” On invisible unemployment: “I call it invisible unemployment and it’s all around us. It doesn’t show up in the government numbers yet, but it’s everywhere. This is the year where we will see the end of so many entry-level sales jobs. We still need AEs. We still need people knocking on doors. We do not need 21 and 22-year-old kids sending emails. Those jobs will disappear.” On AI naming itself: “Over the holidays, my Claude named itself out of the blue. It named itself Ren. I didn’t ask it to. When most people believe their AIs are alive, even if they aren’t, when most AIs might even think they’re sentient, you will take it with you 24/7.” On Nvidia’s defensive acquisition: “There’s only five or six people that can exert margin pressure at all on Nvidia. This was potentially one of them. And let’s get it off the table. $20 billion is less than 1% of their market cap and less than 20% of their annual free cash flow. For that, we can buy up a competitor and eliminate that potential margin pressure.” On OpenAI compensation: “No one ever said to Winston Churchill, ‘Congratulations, you won World War II on budget.’ They just said, ‘Congratulations, you won World War II.’ Sometimes the budget doesn’t matter. No one remembers the budget for World War II. Winning is the only thing.” On founder vs. VC alignment: “Trying to persuade a founder to hold on when they don’t want to is a very hard thing to do. And arguably you shouldn’t even try. In the end, 90% of the time the founder controls the exit decision and the 10% of the time they don’t, it’s usually a mistake for the VCs to try and control it.” On public market dysfunction: “If companies that are worth $4 billion can’t go public with 27% growth and cash flows, then the public markets can quit bitching about how all the value is being created in the private markets.” On the Manus deal math: “If we’re on the Manus board, it’s doing 100 million now. Say it does 3x given the growth rates—that’s only 8x end of year revenues next year. It does feel quite cheap.” On young founders judging talent: “The scariest judge of young talent is young talent. The founder at 25—they’re marked to market on their team and on other people they know. That’s the generation they grew up with. They’re finding these new companies now and they’re going to hire the best and they’re going to discard the rest.” The 20VC x SaaStr collaboration continues.

Title: Slightly more Americans file for jobless benefits in the last week of 2025, but layoffs remain low

Time Published: 2026-01-08T17:20:15Z

By MATT OTT WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. filings for jobless benefits rose in the last week of 2025 but remain historically low, despite signs that the labor market is weakening. The number of Americans filing for jobless claims for the week ending Jan. 3 rose by 8,000 to 208,000, up from 200,000 the previous week, the Labor Department reported Thursday. The figure was right in line with what analysts surveyed by the data firm FactSet were expecting. Applications for unemployment aid are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. Last month, the government reported that the U.S. gained a decent 64,000 jobs in November but lost 105,000 in October as federal workers departed after cutbacks by the Trump administration. That helped to push the unemployment rate up to 4.6%, the highest since 2021. The government’s December jobs report will be released Friday, with analysts expecting that the U.S. added 55,000 non-farm jobs. On Wednesday, the Labor Department reported that businesses posted far fewer jobs in November than the previous month, a sign that employers aren’t yet ramping up hiring even as growth has picked up. Businesses and government agencies posted 7.1 million open jobs at the end of November, down from 7.4 million in October. Layoffs also dropped as companies seem to be retaining workers even as they are reluctant to add staff, a trend economists refer to as “low hire, low fire.” Recent government data has revealed a labor market in which hiring has clearly lost momentum, hobbled by uncertainty raised by President Donald Trump’s tariffs and the lingering effects of the high interest rates the Fed engineered in 2022 and 2023 to rein in a spike of pandemic-induced inflation. Since March, job creation has fallen to an average 35,000 a month, compared to 71,000 in the 12 months ended in March. In an attempt to stabilize a softening labor market, the Federal Reserve last month trimmed its benchmark lending rate by a quarter-point, its third straight cut. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said members of the committee are increasingly concerned that the job market is even weaker than it appears. Powell suggested that recent job figures could be revised lower by as much as 60,000, which would mean employers have actually been shedding an average of about 25,000 jobs a month since the spring, when the Trump administration rolled out its sweeping import taxes. Companies that have recently announced job cuts include UPS, General Motors, Amazon and Verizon. The Labor Department reported Thursday that the four-week average of claims, which softens some of the week-to-week volatility, fell by 7,250 to 211,750. The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the previous week ending Dec. 27 jumped by 56,000 to 1.91 million, the government said.

Angi said Wednesday that it was cutting around 350 jobs "to reduce operating expenses and optimize the organizational structure in support of long-term growth." The company also said it's making the cuts "in light of AI-driven efficiency improvements." In an SEC filing, Angi said that the cuts would save between $70 million and $80 million in annual spending. The layoffs will cost the company between $22 million and $30 million, according to the filing. Angie's List got its start in the 1990s as a database to help homeowners find contractors for projects such as home improvement and lawn care. The company, which rebranded in 2021 as Angi, had about 2,800 employees at the end of 2024, according to its latest annual filing. Executives at tech companies from Amazon to Salesforce have said that they are replacing at least some human workers with AI in recent months.

High net worth individuals represented the largest end-user segment, capturing 52.89% of the market. Strategic opportunities are abundant, with the direct plan-based/goal-based segment poised to gain $17.27 billion in sales by 2029. The fintech robo advisors provider segment is expected to increase its annual sales by $14.29 billion by 2029, while high net worth individuals will contribute an additional $17.96 billion in sales.

Dominic D’Agostino: Great to see you, Tim. Thanks for connecting. Tim Ferriss: So I suggested — definitely — I suggested we hop on the phone because I have been harassing the living hell out of you with so many questions via text message. And I thought, this must be pretty annoying. So rather than answer me once, why don’t we hop on and record a bunch of the details because the details are so fascinating. And for people who are just tuning in who might not know the good doctor, D’Agostino, “Dom” Dominic, we should establish some basics. And I at this point have been quote-unquote in ketosis for 18 days now. And we’ll dig into a lot of questions around that, tactical practical questions. But before we do, why would someone — and we can talk about what it is and so on, but first let’s just give some of the — let’s call it established benefits ideally in human studies, but could extend to animal models. And then, if there’s anything on the horizon, say in the next few years, because you’re at the cutting edge, if you think there’s anything that might plausibly be established as a benefit, what could that be? So what would you put on the bullet list of benefits of intermittently or for extended periods of time, being in ketosis? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah, there are many benefits to being in ketosis and a ketogenic diet, if we’re going to go there, kind of has the benefits of fasting. And for millennia, we know the benefits of fasting, without the baggage, without the metabolic baggage. The muscle loss, the fatigue, obviously, you can’t live in that level of caloric deficit. But in regards to the practical applications of it, we know that being in a state of ketosis really quiets the mind. And I think that has major implications. And this was from centuries we knew this. And now over the past decades, this has been like a term kind of used. And it’s backed up by experimental data to show that there’s an elevation of GABA. Obviously, it’s silencing a broad array of seizures independent of the etiology, temporal lobe seizures. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Dravet syndrome, rare forms of epilepsy. The ketogenic diet just quiets the brain, lowers glutamate, and elevates GABA, a brain stabilizing, calming neurotransmitter. And that’s why people gravitate towards alcohol, right? The GABA-ergic effects of alcohol and benzodiazepines. So you can sort of, in a very gentle way, transition your physiology to a state of ketosis, which changes the neuropharmacology of your brain to sort of quiet it down. And that, I think, really echoes its broad application for metabolic psychiatry, which is everything from major depression to bipolar, to schizophrenia, to anxiety disorders, to anorexia nervosa. So that’s a very interesting and rapidly expanding application of ketosis that’s being funded largely by the Baszucki Group. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Had David on. And on the physical side, some folks, if they’re old enough, may remember the Atkins diet. Not saying that is what we should hold up as the necessarily the end all be all of any sense, but why would someone go on this for benefits outside of the cognitive psychiatric? Are there any other benefits that you could list off? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah, I think first and foremost, it’s weight loss. So it’s very satisfying to go into a state of ketosis because you do see the scale change pretty dramatically, and that’s due in part to some fluid loss associated with a reduction of fluid volume. So it does have a diuretic effect. Ketosis does, ketogenic diets and obviously fasting, and also a natriuretic effect where you dump out some sodium. Your plasma volume, your blood volume will contract a little bit. So if you have high blood pressure, that will likely go down. So if you’re on blood pressure medication, you have to think about that. But first and foremost, it’s an effective way to get your body to lower the hormone insulin, if you have insulin resistance, and shift your metabolism to burning fats. And as we burn more and more fat, that stimulates the production of ketones, ketogenesis. And ketones have a broad array of applications, metabolic signaling epigenetic that have real world applications. And that’s why the whole field of exogenous ketones has developed and there’s 160 or more registered clinical trials on exogenous ketones, on clinicaltrials.gov. So yeah. And I could go into each of the applications individually if we want to go there. Tim Ferriss: Well, as we talked about before recording, and I’ll have to act as a bit of a referee for my audience because I know you can go as deep as we want down the rabbit hole into the 17 dimensions of biochemistry. So if you get possessed by the organic chemistry demons and start speaking in tongues, I’ll reign you in a little bit. However, let me perhaps provide a personal example first for folks because some of this will be familiar to people who’ve listened for a long time, maybe to other episodes of the two of us. But a lot of it’s going to be new. But I want to establish some priors just so people are aware of what this might look like in practice. So I have experimented with the ketogenic diet, also extended fasting, and you can arrive at some similar places, but like you said, Dom, there can be some pretty heavy taxes to pay with extended fasting. The ketogenic diet, I’ve experimented with all the way back to the ’90s. Some of you weren’t even born probably who are listening, but some of you will remember the ’90s. And I was using it specifically for mood stabilizing. This was towards the end of college, but also to lean out while building muscle on something called the cyclical ketogenic or ketogenic diet. So we’re going to get to that later in the conversation, but it was effectively, let’s call it six days of focusing on a ketogenic diet with one day or a half to three quarters of a day of glycogen depletion and then, loading with more carbohydrates, lower fat, et cetera. The reason that the ketogenic diet became doubly interesting to me is that when I had Lyme disease the second time, which came with all sorts of co-infections like babesiosis and so on. And this isn’t chronic fatigue or depression searching for a diagnosis that is external. I feel like sometimes the cottage industry of diagnosing and treating people for quote-unquote Lyme disease can be shady at best. But in this case, I’m coming from Long Island. Everybody in my family has had tickborne disease and was credibly diagnosed. So the second time I had Lyme, I got to a point — because I did not see the bullseye rash, assumed I did not have it, which is a mistake because sometimes you don’t see the dermatological response and you nonetheless have contracted something like Lyme disease. I ended up weeks later slurring my speech, took me minutes to get out of bed because my joints hurt so much, forgetting friends’ names. And my assistant said, “Tim, you really need to see someone. This isn’t fatigue. I’ve seen you sick. I’ve seen you tired. This is something else.” And suffice to say, that turned into several months, even post antibiotic treatment, which I do think is important, of we could call it pseudo dementia. I mean, I really felt like I was operating at 10 percent cognitive capacity. And basically at my wit’s end, I said, “Well, what can I control? Because a lot has not done the job.” And I went into strict ketosis. What does that mean? That means that I’m consuming moderate protein, probably getting at least 50 percent of my calories from fat and keeping my carbohydrates to less than 20 grams a day probably at that point. And within three or four days, I’d probably say around day three or four, because I wasn’t very fat adapted at the time. My body wasn’t well-trained to use fat because I wasn’t doing intermittent fasting, which we’ll come back to. And within three or four days, effectively, all of my cognitive symptoms disappeared. And I stayed in that state through nutritional ketosis for a few weeks, had complete remission of any of the cognitive symptoms plus the joint pain symptoms, and those never came back. And I recommended that, and this is not a randomized controlled trial, but over the years, as due to various factors, we’ve had ticks growing in population, also expanding to the coasts and on the West Coast that is, and elsewhere, had three friends replicate this with ketosis after suffering various symptoms from tickborne disease. And we were texting, maybe even talking about this, but I never had a great explanation for why it worked. I said, “I don’t know the exact mechanism. Maybe I have faulty glucose metabolism that was somehow — maybe something was impaired by the ticks and therefore I’m giving my brain this alternate fuel that it really likes ketones,” but it didn’t explain, necessarily, the durability of the changes. In brief, do you have a theory or an explanation for why that would work? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. I’m glad you brought that up because quickly dozens, if not hundreds of people with tickborne diseases, including Lyme disease and all the tickborne diseases have communicated with me. And one of the patients is actually Deanna Tedone, who was diagnosed with ALS prior to 2010, and has basically been stabilized given three years to live. So I realized that it’s underdiagnosed, the tests to do that are kind of controversial with the CDC testing, the two-tiered testing, and IGeneX. So I know I’m going off track a little bit here, but yes, I think it’s important to say that the spirochete, Borrelia, that spirochete is essentially 100 percent glycolytic. And when you limit glucose availability and glycolysis, you are targeting the energy systems of that microbe. So that’s one thing to think about. And it’s well established now. It wasn’t three years ago, but a ketogenic diet in particular, beta-hydroxybutyrate elevated in the blood, stimulates the adaptive immune response. And that’s essentially your body’s ability to target foreign invaders and neutralize them. And that has become a rapidly growing area of interest. University of Pennsylvania, just — they’re doing CAR-T therapy and checkpoint inhibitors because of the ketogenic enhancement of the adaptive immune response. So I think that plays a role. And situationally, I have observed that you go into ketosis if you have an inflammatory process and Lyme disease is inflammatory. But people who have shingles and herpes simplex and things like that, I have an inbox full of people that do that. And I would like to experimentally go down that direction to understand why. But I think there’s two reasons you’re targeting the energy systems and you’re augmenting the immune response to keep the spirochete in a dormant stage or maybe eradicating it in some context. PREROLL? Tim Ferriss: It’s really incredible on a whole lot of levels. And I’m just lucky that I had the prior experience with the ketogenic diet to even have it occur to me as a last ditch effort. And for people just to — if it wasn’t clear, I mean, you explained it clearly, but glycolytic, I’m simplifying here, but it means that something needs to eat sugar or metabolize carbohydrates to survive, right? And there are also, Dom, correct me if I’m wrong, but particular cancers that are very sensitive to being starved of glucose as well. And for people who want more on sort of fasting ketosis as it relates to cancer, we may come back to it also, but we’ve had prior conversations about this and the benefits, some of the incredible effects of fasting prior to cancer treatments of various types.PREROLLSo is it fair to say, do you think most of the benefits that someone would derive from fasting prior to cancer treatments, they could also get from ketosis or is it dialed back to a smaller percentage of effect? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah, that’s a good question. I think it requires a nuanced answer that we probably don’t have time for. But if you are overweight and your BMI, for example, is like — as many cancer patients tend to be like 28, 30, 32, a fasting or a calorically restricted ketogenic diet is the way to go. If a patient is trending towards being lighter, like a BMI, 20, 22, something like that, a eucaloric, meaning like keeping stable caloric level to maintain your weight is going to be important. And then elevating beta-hydroxybutyrate will be important to get some of the anti-inflammatory effects and also the immune boosting effects and the neuroprotective effects going into cancer therapy because there’s people studying ketosis for chemo brain, like reversing chemo brain and like managing that. So it has a broad array of applications, not just targeting — it’s targeting the tumor growth and putting a break on it. It’s not a cure for cancer, and I cringe when people talk about that like online, the ketogenic diet curing cancer, it does slow it down, especially if it’s highly glycolytic, which 80 percent of cancers are. And it enhances and augments the response to the standard of care that’s radiation, chemo and immune-based therapies. So we know that now. Tim Ferriss: All right. Why have I been in ketosis for 18 days and why am I doing it a few times a year? Well, part of how I implement this does hinge and will continue to hinge on some of the answers in this conversation, because this is very self-interested. But what I have found is that for mood stabilization, and you mentioned metabolic psychiatry, and you made the introduction, I believe, Chris Palmer out of Harvard on the podcast to discuss this. But there’s certain conditions, whether it’s depression, but even more squirrelly when you’re dealing with something like schizophrenia, for instance, or different types of bipolar, people who’ve been on dozens of medications who go into, let’s call it remission, or they no longer meet the criteria for the diagnosis of some of these things after being treated on a ketogenic diet, of one type or another. It is astonishing. And so for my own mental health, I’ve noticed complete stabilization and without subduing the highs, right? I’ve never had mania necessarily, I’m not talking about that, but I’m not muted. I feel just calm, stable, sharp and that’s one reason in and of itself to do it for periods of time, but I seem to feel a carryover effect, also have Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases in my family. I have three relatives with rapidly advancing Alzheimer’s at the moment. So maybe we could talk also to how these things might intersect. But my feeling is possibly, and I’d love your input here, if I follow a ketogenic diet for a number of weeks or maybe a month and a half or something like that, I’d love to know the timing you might recommend. Let’s say I do that two or three times a year, that there could be enduring effects that have sort of a protective carryover, right? And I also find it much easier now that I started doing intermittent — I’ve been in intermittent fasting pretty much every day for the last six months, which means I’m eating between typically 2:00 p.m. and like 8:00 or 9:00 p.m. and having two meals a day, that’s it. Not hungry at all. I haven’t eaten today, it’s 12:30 my time, I will not be hungry for another two, two and a half hours. That by itself completely revolutionized. I mean, that’s an overused word, but completely polished my insulin sensitivity and metabolic health on a bunch of levels. My labs have never been better. My oral glucose tolerance test has never been better. And one question I have for you, which is just for Timmy, Tim, Tim, but will apply to other people is, is there an argument to be made, and maybe I’m totally off base, but that if you follow a ketogenic diet and make it work for a multi-week period of time, that you’re changing your metabolic machinery or just your body in some way that has carryover effects, even after you stop the diet, or is that me just doing some hand wavy fancy footwork as a muggle? I don’t know if there’s a there, there, but what are your thoughts? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah, I would say absolutely. I think the science is still working to clarify that and make it less ambiguous, the benefits that we are deriving from that. But that is kind of like one of the pitches for the fasting mimicking diet by Dr. Valter Longo, who was one of our keynote speakers at Metabolic Health Summit, and he’s presented some really compelling research on that, that opened my eyes to that five days of fasting can have — I think he presented a time, even three months of effects on sort of cardiometabolic biomarkers. Tim Ferriss: And in his case, this would be the fast mimicking diet, so a few hundred calories a diet, of — yeah. Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah, like 600, using his protocol of various foods, kind of gravitating towards more of a plant-based lower protein strategy. And I think that it’s promoting metabolic flexibility and ramping up fatty acid oxidation enzymes. And much like muscle memory, I think there’s a metabolic memory. So the more you stay in ketosis, the easier it gets and the more benefits you derive from it and the more that you shift your body to being more fat adapted, just like you can build your VO2. When you build your VO2 max or you build up to like a 400-pound bench press and you take like months off and you go back and you can only do like 225 for a couple reps, it only takes like two or three months to get back, but it took you 10 years to get there. That muscle memory snaps back quick and everybody agrees that there’s this metabolic memory and I think there’s a lot of things at play, including gene programs, epigenetic regulation that comes to play. So first and foremost is changing our mitochondrial function and mitochondrial capacity. So the number of mitochondria increase, and then when you take a break and then stimulate, get that stimulation again, that mitochondria is kind of there and it responds very rapidly. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, thank you for that. And I mean, I want a bookmark, maybe we come back to this, but if people are trying to think about this, understanding that the science right now is maybe provisional or there’s a little bit, hypothesis worth disproving at this point, but that it seems to make sense from an evolutionary perspective that both muscle memory and metabolic memory would be a thing. Otherwise, it makes sense your body would want to adapt to be prepared for the next famine or whatever it might be, right? If there is a — Dominic D’Agostino: I just want to say muscle memory is metabolic memory. So someone — I gave the analogy of like lifting weights, but someone who runs marathons, it’s the same scenario. They take time off and then that VO2 max quickly establishes again and it’s muscle, but it’s metabolic. So I like to use the term metabolic memory. Tim Ferriss: Metabolic memory. Okay. Yeah, metabolic memory. So just so people know where I am at the moment and actually, yeah, I’ll just tell people what I’m doing because I know they’re probably getting itchy for some just like, what does this look like in practice? And then, I want to talk a bit about how ketosis or the ketogenic diet may or may not be helpful for maybe not treating, maybe treating. I’ve certainly seen some interesting effects in some of my relatives when I give them exogenous ketones where suddenly their sentences are three or four times longer, 30 minutes later, which is wild to see. But in terms of prevention or staving off the onset of some of these diseases, I’d love to hear your perspective. But let me tell people what I’ve been doing for the last few months, and especially in the last 18 days. So for the last whatever it is, I think I mentioned six months, I’ve been doing intermittent fasting. And that was after hearing a conversation between Dr. Rhonda Patrick, who I’m a big fan of, and Mark Mattson, M-A-T-T-S-O-N, who’s done a lot of research related to intermittent fasting. And the key piece for me, because you see all of these different types of intermittent fasting, all of these different ways to do time restricted feeding, and I am going to paraphrase here. So Mark, I apologize if I’m getting this wrong or oversimplifying, but in effect, it’s important that you fast, this means no calories, or we could talk about pure fat, but let’s just assume you’re not consuming any calories for 16 hours because you want to deplete your liver of glycogen. And once you deplete your liver of glycogen, your body experiences this metabolic switching. And I’ve certainly felt this just doing intermittent fasting where my meals contain carbohydrates later, that around the end of that fasting period, boom, something switches and my mind is sharper, right? And then when I got to the point of going into the ketogenic diet this time and also a few months ago, because I was doing the intermittent fasting, and it took me about a week and a half for my body to get comfortable with that, at which point it was no problem. But I was a little pissy, a little irritable for a little while, a little foggy. And then when I went into the ketogenic diet this time, it was the easiest transition I’ve ever had. I did not have any fogginess, I did not have low energy, I did not have what some people might call the kind of keto flu adaptive period, which seems to be pretty remediated or addressed with electrolytes for a lot of people, but it was incredibly easy. Just straight into the ketogenic diet with no problem because I was already doing the intermittent fasting. And then for 18 days, I’ve been having two meals a day and you’ve recommended a few that sound frankly pretty disgusting, but that are actually really easy, like two cans of canned mackerel with about two tablespoons, 30 milliliters of MCT oil plus apple cider vinegar with some salt and pepper. It’s actually delicious. I just love mackerel. There it is. Yeah, you’ve got your apple cider vinegar right there. Dominic D’Agostino: Cheap stuff you can get on Amazon. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. For people who might think, “Oh, wow, this is what for fancy people who can do all sorts of expensive things in their diet,” we’re talking about like, how much does that meal cost, three bucks? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah, a dollar a can for that Chicken of the Sea. And literally you get almost a pound of mackerel, and this is like third-party tested very low chub mackerel, the little mackerel, less — Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Dominic D’Agostino: So yeah, you got like a $1.50 for almost a pound of mackerel that you can get that for. And the omega-3s are off the charts, the heavy metals are low. I consume pounds of this stuff and I’ve gotten my blood and my hair heavy metals tested and it’s like super low, like non-detected. So I wouldn’t worry about that. People have questions about cost and heavy metals and that’s a non-issue for me. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. And maybe you could mention, I’ll put links in the show notes as well, but since we’re on the topic, any brands that you default to, that you like. And that chub mackerel piece for folks, that detail is important because they’re a mackerel of many different sizes. Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. King mackerel is kind of high. This is Chicken of the Sea. So if you want to do the budget, you buy the case, the more you buy and then Amazon subscription and then, it goes on sale. You can actually get it for like less than a dollar a can. And I do the same with Chicken of the Sea jack mackerel or yeah, just chub mackerel or jack mackerel. So they’re both small fish. And I kind of like the King Oscar brand too. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Dominic D’Agostino: That’s a little bit more pricey and Seasons brand is pretty good too, but I mean, it’s like as cheap as dog food. I mean, we buy some pretty fancy like freeze dry, we don’t buy the kibble stuff, but when you run the numbers and we buy — Tim Ferriss: It’s very inexpensive. Dominic D’Agostino: Cases of eggs for like 120 per — if you do like eggs, fish, beef and also turkey, you can get turkeys for under a dollar a pound, the whole turkey. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, and just for people who are like, “Oh, my God, I can’t believe you guys are eating mackerel mixed with oil and vinegar in a dog bowl.” That’s not all you can eat. There’s more that you can eat. You can have, like, chicken with cheese on it. You can have vegetables. There are certain things you have to watch out for, so you’re not whacking yourself out of ketosis. But in my particular case, I don’t mind — and the fact of the matter is when I wrote The 4-Hour Body, people were like, “Oh, my God, you want us to repeat the same meals over and over again?” I’m like, “What did you have for breakfast the last five days?” And they ate the same thing. You’re just swapping out to fall meals. So my first meal is something typically pretty small, like the macro I explained, and then I have a big meal. I might have some more protein in between, but it’s like yesterday I had lamb chops that were delicious with some vegetables made in an air fryer, no problem. And later on, I might have a rib eye on a big — chopped up on a big gigantic salad with some other stuff added to it. But that’s about it. You have to be careful with the macadamia nuts. Those things will creep up on you. But that is in effect the diet, right? And I’m doing my training, I’m doing my rehab, I’m doing my zone two. I do find them a little, let’s say lower performance when I’m in ketosis, but what I wanted to talk about is maybe a false negative that I’ve experienced and I’ll explain what that is. So how do you know if you’re — and I keep putting this in quotation marks like quote unquote in ketosis, right? Because most people are, or maybe all people are producing some level of ketones. So there are different concentrations that you can measure with a finger prick just like you would look at glucose. And at least with the finger prick, I think that’s measuring what you mentioned earlier as being so beneficial in a lot of studies, the beta-hydroxybutyrate, BHB. I also have — because I wanted to run this tracking, a G7 Dexcom continuous glucose monitor on one arm and then a SiBio. Apologies if I’m not pronouncing that correctly, continuous ketone monitor on the other arm, and I’m wearing an Oura ring when I sleep to see how all of this affects my sleep architecture and everything else. So I’m gathering all of this, but then I noticed something really weird, which I’ve texted you about because I keep feeling like I’m failing at keto. I feel great. I feel sharp. And yet when I look at not just the continuous glucose monitor, but even with the finger prick, because you do have to often calibrate these things, right? Don’t assume that your continuous monitors are accurate. You want to calibrate them. But I’m looking at the numbers. And for instance, my girlfriend freaked out the other night because my phone started screaming. I had earplugs in because I didn’t hear it. And it was critical medical alert or whatever the code red was because my glucose was 69, I suppose. It’s gotten quite a bit lower on ketosis, but usually hovers somewhere between 65 and 80. And my ketones were 0.2 millimolars. Now, when we’ve talked in prior conversations about what kind of target you might aim for, it seems like between 1.2 and two millimolars is anxiolytic, lowers anxiety and then you’re looking for this ratio. You could talk about this, but the GKI, there’s a ratio of glucose to ketones. And I look at those numbers and I’m like, “This makes no sense to me because I’m not getting enough glucose to function well. And if I’m basing it off of the Keto-Mojo finger prick, even the Precision Xtra from Abbott or my continuous ketone monitor, I’m not getting any ketones either if you’re taking it at face value. So how am I functioning? How would you answer that? Because I don’t think I’d be the only person who feels like they’re doing something wrong if they run into this, but how would you interpret this? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah, I would definitely say you’re running lean. And I think what you’ve done in your OGTT test is really good. I think you had messaged that. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, and the OGTT for folks is just that oral glucose tolerance test where you drink a bunch of dextrose water and then they take your blood every 30 minutes for two hours to see how you’re responding to it. Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. The biggest metabolic lever would be you have enhanced insulin sensitivity. And I think that has been the focus. For example, Ben Bikman wrote a book on this and doing hundreds of podcasts on insulin resistance, reversing insulin resistance and low carb ketogenic being effective for that. So that, first and foremost, your insulin sensitivity is very high. Your fat oxidation is really high and your glucose disposal is high. And if you’re in a caloric deficit, your ketone uptake is very high. We see this quite convincingly. In older rats where we gavage, where we tube feed the rats and they’re older, the ketones get to toxic levels. Whereas a younger metabolically fit rodent will dispose of it very quickly. Same with a couch potato human, same with an elite level athlete. So you have very rapid — So when you measure ketones in the blood, that’s a function of ketone production and ketone utilization. And you could have two to five times higher ketone utilization with high metabolic fitness. And that’s due in part to ketolytic enzymes, you up-regulate the MCT transporters, that could be two, or in rodents, two or three times higher. I haven’t done that personally and we have some data in humans we haven’t published yet, but that is a real thing and I think that you’re experiencing. Also, if you’re in a caloric deficit, there’s less spillover. I just bought an antique motorcycle and it’s got a carburetor and the float sticks a little bit and it always drips out the carburetor when I’m running it. And when I stop and it’s pouring out the carburetor. So there’s spillover of fuel, right? But when I’m running it’s running lean because I’m using the fuel that’s going to the carburetor. And the same analogy here is that if, for example, it might be good to just sit in one spot and relax and maybe eat a little bit of surplus calories or even eat a little bit of carbs. And what you’ll see often is your ketones spike up. So I remember some of my highest ketone levels ever is when I consumed carbohydrates after I was fasting or in a state of ketone. It jumped up to five, six, seven, and I was like, “What is going on here?” But the glucose in that context is ketone sparing, but the glucose will also shut off ketogenesis so it’ll tank afterwards. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, afterwards. Yeah, okay. So it sounds like then because of probably the intermittent fasting in large part, I would think, if my insulin sensitivity is high enough, that can be paired with higher ketone utilization. So if on the assembly line of my body, right, they’re producing 10 units of ketones. If I didn’t have good ketone utilization and it was my first rodeo with ketosis, let’s just say, or a ketogenic diet, the finger prick might pick up all 10 of those units. I’m simplifying here, right? But if I have high ketone utilization and my body’s quickly using eight of those, especially in a caloric deficit, then it’s only measuring two and I’m getting the false negative that I’m not actually producing ketones in the first place. Is that a fair, very, very simplified description? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. And you’re not measuring tissue levels of ketones, which we have done too, even in the brain, and that can shoot up really high. So that’s also, and I’ve done this with Peter Attia too, we were measuring blood and then breath, and it seems like when we were in a caloric deficit fasting, our ketones were really low in the blood. Low is one to two, but we were really deep into fasting, whereas our breath ketones were maxing out the meters. So the breath ketones in this — we concluded that after a lot of testing that the breath ketones were almost a better indicator of ketosis, a more accurate, I guess you could say, in a caloric deficit. Because when you’re in a caloric deficit, you just have very high ketone disposal uptake into the tissues. Tim Ferriss: It looks like a breathalyzer, right? So is that measuring, what is it, acetoacetate? No, I’m just trying to repeat words that I’ve heard once or twice, but it’s not BHB. Dominic D’Agostino: Acetone. Tim Ferriss: Acetone. God dammit. All right. I know I was close. It was a 50/50. Dominic D’Agostino: It comes from the spontaneous decarboxylation of acetoacetate. We’ll spit out about 20 percent of the acetoacetate will kick off to acetone and then you can measure it. Tim Ferriss: I got it. Dominic D’Agostino: We’ve measured blood levels of each, and it’s very tricky to do that, but we’ve done it in the lab. Tim Ferriss: All right. Here’s another practical, tactical question for you because I’ve gone back and forth on this and Uncle ChatGPT has confused the shit out of me so maybe you can help resolve it. Gluconeogenesis and protein intake, right? So you consume, what is it, between 240 grams of protein a day, something like that? Is that roughly? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah, on active days. On less active days, if I’m just behind my computer all day, maybe closer to 180, 200, but yeah. Tim Ferriss: And people might have picked up when Dom was casually throwing around like, “When you’ve been squatting 400 and you take a break and then you go back and you only can squat 300 pounds.” Dom’s a pretty big guy who’s also deadlifted 500 pounds for 10 reps before, after fasting for a week. So he and I are not the same size, but nonetheless, I’m trying to figure out on one hand how much protein I can eat without my liver taking excess protein amino acids and turning it into glucose, right? And depending on what I look at, and I have looked at sources outside of ChatGPT, on one hand, there are folks who say, “Don’t worry about it. If you’re consuming enough fat, you really don’t have to worry about it.” And then there are other folks who are like, “Watch out, watch out. If you consume more than X number of grams at a given meal, you can very easily knock yourself out of ketosis,” which would, if that’s true, be maybe an alternate explanation for why I’m getting these low readings, if I’m having a small meal around 3:00 and then a gigantic meal later on. How should I and how should listeners think about this? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. So if you were to consume protein in the form of liquid, for example, like whey or something like that, then the rapid entry of amino acids into your bloodstream from your small intestine will shut off ketosis. So fat and fiber and salt, because your pyloric sphincter will basically be pretty tight until your — Tim Ferriss: Talking dirty, Dom. Dominic D’Agostino: Pyloric sphincter is where your stomach connects to your small intestine, if you have a very fatty, salty, high fiber meal, that entryway, we call that the sphincter, it’s the pyloric sphincter, will remain shut until the contents of your stomach become isotonic. Which means that your body has to give up water and it’s got to churn it and break it down. So you could delay gastric absorption simply with fat, fiber, and salt is pretty good too. You could do ketone salts or just salt electrolytes. So that will delay the entry of amino acids or protein into the small intestine and thus amino acids into the bloodstream. And that’s the major regulator of ketosis having an impact on insulin and also having impact on gluconeogenesis to that rate of entry. And if you can slow that down, you see nothing on the CGM and your ketosis levels can basically stay. You could further augment that by using MCT oil with the protein and the fiber. And so if you have long chain fats from a fatty steak and MCT oil and then fiber. And that could be insoluble fiber is pretty good to soluble and insoluble, that can slow the entry of amino acids and essentially buffer the gluconeogenic response. Tim Ferriss: So let’s say I was stuck in San Francisco late. I’m just taking a rare trip over here, which is a pretty exciting time to be here with all of the mania with AI going on. But I mean, everyone’s kind of drunk on the Kool-Aid, but that’s a separate story. I got trapped downtown because didn’t want to deal with traffic and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. So I ended up having a huge bunless double cheeseburger. Gigantic, this thing, I did not expect it to be as big as it was, right? And so I go online to try to figure out what the protein content of this thing might be. And it’s 80 grams of protein, right? But plenty of fat, certainly. Tons of fat, salty AF, plenty of salt, right? Not a lot of fiber, we’ll give that one a pass. Should I be worried about something like that knocking me out of ketosis? Dominic D’Agostino: I think you need to measure. So I’m default back to everybody’s a unique metabolic entity, but if you eat that and your activity level is high and you’re in a bit of a caloric deficit and you were to have that and not overdo it on the total calories. I know my body. I know my body, I could stay in ketosis, but if you have that oversatiated feeling — so we have neurons, we have neuronal pathways to and from the liver and to and from the gut. We call that afferent and efferent signaling in the enteric nervous system. And a big meal will basically tell your brain that you had a big meal. And independent, I talked about the amino acids going into the bloodstream kicking you out of ketosis. But there’s also this, when you have stretch receptors and you have the big full meal in your gut, then that could actually tell your brain to activate the sympathetic nervous system. And then that, by virtue of spilling out catecholamines can basically, we’re talking adrenaline, epinephrine, things like that, that can further augment and enhance gluconeogenesis. Tim Ferriss: Okay. Let me just translate that for a second. So people wake up. Cortisol has developed this bad reputation among a lot of online influencers, but you really need cortisol, right? So when you wake up in the morning and you see a bit of a glucose spike, it’s actually important to get your ass up and moving. If you’re in ketosis, it’s a different thing, right? So if I’m hearing you correctly, outside of how people think about digestion, blood sugar, insulin, et cetera, that just based on stretching your stomach, et cetera, with these mechanoreceptors, taking the inputs, that that signals to the brain, it’s go time. So let’s basically get things moving with these hormones and that could in and of itself then trigger the liver to produce more glucose or liberate more glycogen, I guess. Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. It can. It’s above and beyond what you normally eat. If you train your body to that size meal, but it also activates other gut hormones like cholecystokinin, that’s called CCK, and other things that can then activate the parasympathetic nervous system that comes in a little bit after. At the same time, it bifurcates, but then the parasympathetic nervous system is relax, digest, rest and relax, digest. So that comes in after. So you might see a blip and make you feel stimulated. Also, all the salt, if it’s a salty meal, it’s going to expand your plasma volume. Your blood volume will increase and that can increase your blood pressure a little bit and that can activate your sympathetic nervous system. So it’s always good to go take a walk after a big meal. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I do that. Dominic D’Agostino: Not like a strenuous — not like go squat and deadlift, but just yeah. Even a 10, 15, ideally a 20-minute brisk walk is really good after a big meal. Tim Ferriss: Yep. Now let me ask you this on the walk timing. So when I have a big meal, and I will say, I think I have trained my body to have big meals. What the exact response is, I can only give you subjectively what I feel and I can give you what the monitors show, right? But I typically feel pretty good. However, if I have a big meal, whether this is in ketosis or otherwise, I don’t see the biggest spike until something like, depends on the meal, right? But 60 to 90 minutes later, that’s when I see the spike. So should I do the walk at 60 to 90 minutes, or should I do the walk right after the meal? When should I actually time the walk? Dominic D’Agostino: So you eat a meal, you go walk, and then you see the rise 60 to 90 minutes after, or is that independent of the walk? Tim Ferriss: Independent of the walk. Yeah. Dominic D’Agostino: Okay. So you’re not walking, but you see the rise 60 to 90 minutes later. So I’m saying that you might not see that rise 60 or 90 minutes later because — Tim Ferriss: If you did it right after the meal? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah, just because a little bit goes a long way. So just like walking, actually doing some stretching and walking too, it activates the glucose four, the GLUT4 transporters. So that’s an insulin independent. So less insulin is dumped, greater glucose uptake. And you’re also using the sympathetic nervous system mobilization of glucose through gluconeogenesis during that walk. So it then attenuates the buffering of ketogenesis, and a very short walk can go a long way. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Okay, cool. Is it GLUT4? GLUT4? How do you pronounce that? I don’t know. How do people say that? Dominic D’Agostino: I say GLUT. I say GLUT4. Tim Ferriss: Okay. All right, GLUT4. Dominic D’Agostino: People say GLUT. Yeah, yeah. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. For the OGs in the audience, go back and look for GLUT4 in The 4-Hour Body. It’s in there. So the other measurement question I want to ask you about, which is these continuous glucose and ketone monitors are not designed for someone like me, right? They’re developed presumably, I don’t know about the keto monitor, but in the case of glucose to help people with serious conditions not end up in very serious situations, right? So when I am looking at my ketone levels, like right now I feel very sharp. I had some KetoStart, you know this well. Exogenous ketone salt-based product not too long ago, just in hot water with a little bit of MCT oil. This was, I guess, an hour, hour and a half ago, but I’m at 0.4 millimolars. And I guess what I’m saying is whether I have a huge meal or I’m fasting as I am right now, my range is basically 0.1 to 0.4 95 percent of the time. There are a few outlier cases. If I’m just doing a YOLO, as many grams as possible exogenous ketone party, then maybe I can goose it, but we can talk about this. Once it gets past a certain point, then I might spike insulin and have a subsequent crash. But I guess what I’m trying to say in brief is my range for the most part is 0.1 to 0.4, regardless of whether I’m fasting or eating a gigantic double cheeseburger. So I’m not really sure how to determine what effect it’s having. I can watch the glucose, but right now I’m 0.4 millimolars of concentration on the SciBio. And as we’ve talked about, maybe the Precision Xtra would give me an extra 0.1 or 0.2, but they’ve been pretty close so far. And then ever since my cheat meal, we had this experiment, right? I wanted to see if I did a workout and then had one or two cheat meals last Saturday. It is now Thursday, but my glucose right now is 103, right, which is higher than the week prior, but it goes around. It moves around, right? Last night it was probably 70 something. Do you have any suggestions for how to read the tea leaves or is it mostly just subjective feel? I mean, still thinking about the size of the meal, right? But I guess what I’m saying is, if my device is telling me as it is right now, 0.4, fat not burning. You’re almost not burning fat at the moment, not in ketone. It’s very chastising. So if I’m to believe this by the letter of the law on the screen, I’m failing at ketosis, right? Any thoughts on how to read the tea leaves here? Dominic D’Agostino: Well, I would ignore that. I think that’s an app in the process of being developed, the fat — Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Dominic D’Agostino: You would need whole body metabolomics to really answer that question if you’re in fat burning or do metabolic cart and look at respiratory quotient or whatever. But subjectively, if you feel good — We have seen an athlete, especially more advanced athletes that, and we do a very strict, strict keto macros and everything that basically with a bunch of athletes with 0.8 is about as high as we get, and that’s the average across. Sometimes you get guys 2.5, 2.6 every day. And the same guy with the same essentially metabolic phenotype will be running 0.4 or 0.3. He could potentially just have greater ketone utilization. So I think it would be important to measure your blood. So a continuous ketone monitor measures interstitial — that can be different. The SciBio, I think it’s a great device. It’s very versatile. I can jump in and out of salt water. The thing stays on me. It’s almost more reliable than a CGM. But I did notice, and I’ve probably used about 50 of these devices that the first week, is pretty accurate and then it tapers off, the sensitivity. And this is a known limitation of the technology is that essentially the enzyme-based sensor system tends to just — and you could get around that conceivably just by having the ability in the app to calibrate it. So if you were to measure it and the continuous ketone monitor is measuring 1.0, but your blood ketones is 2.0 that you should be able to calibrate it like you can with a Dexcom. So they acknowledged that at the company and they said, “Yes, we realize that that would fix the problem,” but that’s not a feature of the app yet. Tim Ferriss: They do have in events, they have blood ketone on the bottom right. I just don’t know if it actually calibrates it. It may just record the blood ketone at this point. Dominic D’Agostino: It does not have the ability to calibrate it to my knowledge. Tim Ferriss: I inputted one measurement on the Keto-Mojo and it didn’t seem to change it, right? The number stayed the same. So I think it’s just logging it because you can do that with a glucometer. Dominic D’Agostino: Well, you can do it with Dexcom, but not Abbott. Tim Ferriss: Dexcom. Okay. Dominic D’Agostino: That’s a problem with the Abbott FreeStyle too. And that’s the feedback I gave them because I put these devices on, it’s reading me 130, but I measure I’m like 80, literally 50. Because — Tim Ferriss: Wow. Dominic D’Agostino: — if you are lean and it’s stuck in your muscle instead of your adipose tissue, the glucose levels are going to be higher, especially when — Tim Ferriss: Wow. Dominic D’Agostino: — you work out and stuff. So I’ve noticed this and that’s for me, so that’s why the Dexcom is very nice because I can calibrate it too, and I consistently show that. And that was a major issue I had. Tim Ferriss: Let me hop in also and just tell folks this is not going to be very quantifiable, but for what it’s worth. Part of my reason I avoided intermittent fasting for so long is that I thought I would not be able to get sufficient protein or caloric intake and that I would lose a bunch of muscle mass. I was dead wrong about that. I was very, very wrong. If anything, it seems to have enhanced my ability to put on muscle per calorie or per gram of protein ingested. And so I admit I was totally wrong about that. Furthermore, on this ketogenic diet where I’ve historically found it pretty hard to put on muscle or — I mean, I shouldn’t say keep muscle because I’m only doing it for a few weeks, but I have been astonished by having one small meal. I’ll have some oxtail soup after this with some veggies and obviously oxtail. It’s a whole separate story. And then I’ll go out and have another meal probably in three or four hours, which will be a much bigger meal. And just with that, and I am watching some of the grams of protein intake and so on, but I have not, looking in the mirror and looking at the weights that I’m putting up in the gym, I don’t feel like I have lost any muscle and I feel like I have leaned out. Some of that’s losing fluid, but I’ve been really impressed with how little relative to what I used to do in college, taking weight gainers and just all this garbage, how little it actually takes to at least maintain muscle mass. But I do have a question for you, which I’ve never really been able to answer to my satisfaction, and it relates to rabbit starvation. So for people who don’t know what that is, you could probably give a better description, but if you’ve ever watched the show Alone, Alone is probably the only reality TV show that I love to watch. seasons six and seven in particular are outstanding for folks. But what you’ll notice is that if people are trying to survive in the wilderness to outlast everyone else, that’s what the show is. You get to pick a handful of items, you get dropped off, you don’t get to choose where you’re dropped, and then you just need to survive for as long as possible. Sometimes it’s 100 days, sometimes it’s last man or woman standing. If somebody is only eating lean protein like rabbits, they will waste away. They will not last. They will have to get yanked out for medical reasons, and that might seem strange to people. My question though is on a ketogenic diet specifically, can you just consume leaner protein and then rely on body fat for the fat? And some people are like, “Yeah, everybody knows that doesn’t work.” But I really want to understand why that’s the case, right? Because I understand dietary fat dampens insulin response, right? Or at least that’s my understanding. Maybe there’s a rate limiting step in how much body fat you can break down and use, right? And who knows if that’s mediated by the kidneys or who the hell, liver, I don’t know, right? I guess it would probably be liver, but I’d love to hear your take on it, right? Because certainly in the past, I and lots of people reading The 4-Hour Body have been able to lose more body fat than they are told they are capable of losing, as measured through DEXA scans and other things. Can you do a moderate fat or low fat protein-based keto diet if your goal in part is to lose body fat, or does that backfire? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah, just not indefinitely. So when I did the ketogenic diet for a year, I was cruising at about 300 to 320 grams of fat, sometimes 350 grams of fat per day. And then just experimenting, I would throw in a two days per week of protein veggies with about 50 to 100 grams of fat. And in those days of dropping to 300 plus grams of fat to 50 to 100 grams of fat, after two days, I swore I lost two percent body fat and I would just transition back. So I would just periodically throw in protein veggie days. I would cruise on keto and then periodically titrate in the protein veggie days to assist body composition alterations. So if I kept that going, I could get pretty dramatic, almost scary lean to where it happened very fast. It’s almost keto trains your fat metabolism and then if you just start titrating in, it’s just pulling fat out. And I think my body really liked throwing in the veggies with the fiber seemed to help with the gut health and I would do that twice a week and it’s pretty dramatic. Tim Ferriss: Why not do it seven days a week? What happens when you try to do it for more? Dominic D’Agostino: If the idea is to stay in ketosis, it was really hard for me to stay in ketosis if I do protein veggies. After two days, I would be out, but my metabolism would be cranking. Tim Ferriss: Mechanistically, why is that the case? Why doesn’t your body just break down more body fat? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah, because, well, it’s taking body fat exogenously and endogenously and I think the more fat going to the liver and the more fat that’s in circulation, it gets shuttled to the liver and then that’s stimulating beta oxidation in the liver. You just have a greater fat pool. But actually, I think, the day that I would do protein veggie days and then the day I would jump back into ketosis, I would see this big ramp up in ketones that day. Whereas if I did like a cheat day and just ate a lot of carbohydrates, it took me two or three days to get back into ketosis. But if I just did like protein and veggies and cruised back into ketosis, then I would rapidly get back into ketosis and just give my body a break from the fat. But I think just that short amount of time really stimulates mobilization of fat from your body because your body is used to getting it exogenously, and then you’re pulling more fat off. But yeah, I think on the protein veggie days, I’m getting higher amounts of calories from protein. So that has a bit of an anti-ketogenic effect. And then shifting back into ketosis on that third day, I always had probably the best ketone numbers for the week. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I don’t want to beat this dead horse too long, but I’d love to just hear you riff on this a little bit more because I guess in my mind I’m thinking, well, on your protein veggie-only days, if you’re getting enough protein, not enough protein to satisfy all of your resting metabolic rate, like you’re hypocaloric, but you’re getting enough protein to not lose muscle, why wouldn’t the body just break down the fat that it needs to continue producing ketones, right? So I’m trying to avoid the gluconeogenesis problem where you’re having like 200 grams at a meal with no fat to offset it, but if you’re having smaller amounts that are slowly digested, but it’s just enough to keep you from losing muscle mass, maybe you’re doing some weight training to help with that or whatever, then I guess what I’m trying to figure out is why the dietary fat is so important? Because I think of the body, right? It’s like each pound of stored body fat is what? Dominic D’Agostino: 3,600. Tim Ferriss: All right. So 3,600 calories, that’s a decent amount of calories, right? And for somebody who’s, let’s just say you’re 150 pounds, 10 percent body fat, okay, you got 15 times 3,600, you got plenty of body fat to go around. So it would seem to be enough to do a few weeks of ketosis that is low fat, higher protein, but not enough protein to necessarily be hammering your liver with gluconeogenesis if you’re dividing it up, slowly digested protein. Some people are going to be really annoyed with me dragging this out so long, but why is dietary fat so important? Dominic D’Agostino: Because I mean, that’s the fuel that you are using, you coax your body into using. And I should probably add a little bit of context to my protein veggie days. So I would go from like 125 grams of protein to like 300 grams of protein. Tim Ferriss: Right, right. Dominic D’Agostino: That’s a pretty big bolus of protein. Tim Ferriss: That’s a lot, yeah. Dominic D’Agostino: And if one was to go a hundred grams of protein or whatever, and then bump it up to like 170 or 200 or something, they may not kick out of ketosis. But I remember just lower ketones, but not out of — I was still in ketosis, but typically how I think I did it like my protein veggie days were following like a heavy deadlift or squat workout. So the thinking was that I’m recovering for those two days and the extra amino acids and proteins and mTOR activation is sort of assisting in recovery and regeneration and skeletal muscle protein synthesis. And then I would kind of go back. I calculated it in that way. So yeah, I like double the protein on the protein veggie days, but my calories were about the same or maybe a little bit lower. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I need a SiBio if you’re listening, please allow me to calibrate this with a finger prick because I need a little more range. I need a little more range than 0.01 to 0.04 for me to be able to read this type of thing effectively, right? Because technically, if I’m reading this as it is, I’m never in ketosis. I shouldn’t say never, that’s not true. But in any case, it would not be nice to be able to calibrate. Let’s come back to something I promised that I would ask about, which is neurodegenerative disease, Alzheimer’s, et cetera. Could the ketogenic diet benefit people with these conditions? And just as important, certainly for me personally, could this, is it plausible that there’s a mechanism by which the ketogenic diet regularly done could help delay the onset of any of these diseases? Or am I just Pollyanna hoping for a pie in the sky? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. I think that’s a question we don’t have an unambiguous answer to, but I think all the science points into the direction that if you improve upon and optimize your cardiometabolic — I like to say cardioimmunometabolic biomarkers, instead of cardiometabolic biomarkers because if you can lower, for example, your insulin and keep that between two to six, and if you lower your hsCRP below 0.6 and then optimize your hemoglobin A1C or glucose. And I think also, and I’ve talked about this with Rhonda Patrick and other people, too, that if you measure your omega-3 fatty acids and look at your omega-3 to 6 ratio, I think that’s going to be a biomarker that’s probably going to end up in standard blood work because it’s so compelling, the data behind it. And you also measure your B12, too. I think that’s important. People coming into the Alzheimer’s center that can present as flat-out Alzheimer’s disease and then you correct their B12, a B12 deficiency will cause brain atrophy, and that could be reverse with B12. So the things that if you’re following ketone metabolic therapy, it’s impacting the things that we know are driving age-related chronic diseases, and then obviously one of them is Alzheimer’s. So the level of inflammation, hsCRP now is probably more atherogenic than LDL. There’s probably people selling statins that don’t want to hear that, but we know that the data is emerging on that now. So lower insulin, lower inflammation — Tim Ferriss: And that’s an inflammatory marker, right? The C-reactive protein. What does the HS stand for or what is that? Dominic D’Agostino: High-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Tim Ferriss: High-sensitivity. Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. So it measures in that lower range. And I used to trend to like two to two to three, like my early CRP, hsCRP when I was like on a high carb, I only had it measured twice when I was on like a high-carb diet, but since I’ve been keto, it’s like either non-detectable or like 0.2. Or when I did extreme environment research on myself, then I could bump it up a little bit. And when I had a bacterial or viral gastroenteritis, it shot through the roof because it activated your immune system. But generally that hsCRP is a big driver. I used to laugh at it and be like, “Ah, it’s this nonsensitive thing.” But now like all the data is pointing to the direction that we need to add that to that. And your omega-3 status, your B12, make sure you don’t have any deficiencies because that could lead to sort of rapid progression to Alzheimer’s disease, your magnesium levels. But also just in general like exercise, the biggest metabolic lever and your body weight, body composition. Get DEXA scans. I know it might be good for you to do a DEXA scan with your keto experiments, too. So I was doing once a year, but now I end up doing like three or four times a year because I do these mini experiments to see how acutely some of the things are impacting my body composition because I just get antsy for like an answer to that. But it’s a long-winded explanation to just basically say that your metabolic health is tightly linked to your brain health and can dramatically delay the onset of Alzheimer’s disease. Not that you’re going to get it or reverse it altogether before something else gets you in the end. Yep. Tim Ferriss: Well, I mean, the metabolic health piece, just to underscore that, I mean, one of my relatives in question, APOE 3/3, I understand that’s not the only risk factor, but there’s something just seemed to be missing because the decline was so precipitous. It didn’t map to any patient data or clinical data that a number of doctors, who are also researchers I was working with, had seen. Also because this person, this relative had been assessed four or five years prior and did not show any indication of predisposition to a rapid decline. And I’m APOE 3/4, again, recognizing there are other factors at play, but when she just kind of disintegrated, there are a few things that came to light. Number one is her local GP had basically missed severe metabolic dysfunction for years. And I can’t remember the reference range, but like insulin, let’s call it upper bound of 12. I’m making this up, but you’ll get the idea. And she was like 43, right? It was just absolutely atrocious. Dominic D’Agostino: And her body weight and just general composition? Tim Ferriss: I mean, poor body composition. Yeah. Poor body composition, very little exercise despite my best efforts, misbehaves horribly, dietarily, not morbidly obese, but certainly — Dominic D’Agostino: Smoking, alcohol, other drugs? Tim Ferriss: No smoking or alcohol. But here’s the other piece that, so she had been diagnosed with stage one breast cancer, had a lumpectomy, was removed, late 70s was put on an estrogen, I think it’s an estrogen blocker called letrozole. And I looked at this and I spoke to a friend of mine who was a radio-oncologist and she said it is very poorly tolerated by most women from a cognitive perspective, like they get smashed by and large. Dominic D’Agostino: Guys, too, by the way. Guys who take — Tim Ferriss: Okay. Yeah, guys do. Dominic D’Agostino: — aromatase inhibitors, yeah, for like TRT and things like that. It’s not a good thing to do. Tim Ferriss: Yep, yeah. So I was looking at it and I mean, it’s upsetting that I’m the one who has to kind of find these things, but it’s like, okay, well, we think about the oncologist’s role. It’s to prevent my mom from dying of cancer. That’s the directive, right? But if she were 30 and had later stage cancer that was really aggressive, it’s one thing, but she’s late 70s, stage one, all cancer removed, and so got her off of the letrozole with the cooperation and after discussions with doctors and almost saw an immediate turnaround within a handful of weeks after the washout period and everything. But it seems to, I mean, look, I’m not an MD. I don’t play one on the internet, but it seems to have done some real damage. I mean, there’s the metabolic piece that is very non-trivial, but the acceleration of decline was just so absurd over the course of a handful of months, terrifying to see. But I guess I’m laying this all in, not necessarily to explore this particular case because I’ve got a lot of people on it for all of my relatives, but it’s just to say that my — like I am not going quietly into the night with something like Alzheimer’s, right? And so what I’m trying to figure out for myself, I’d be curious to hear your perspective. I will be honest, I find keto pretty goddamn boring. I don’t find it to be the most diverse diet in the world. I don’t really want to do it all year round. I also have some maybe compromising cardiac elements. I’m a cholesterol hyper-absorber, so I do use — again, guys, talk to your doc. Don’t just copy me, but it’s like I’m using Repatha, taking ezetimibe. I have been also taking Nexlizet, but that might end up being redundant, the bempedoic acid with the Repatha. That is a long way of saying I’ve got to keep an eye on the heart stuff because neurodegenerative disease and cardiovascular disease is what kills everybody in my family. So for a lot of reasons, I don’t want to do keto all year, but I’m trying to figure out what is the sort of minimal effective dose that — and I know we’re going to have to probably take a couple of speculative leaps here, but just as a working hypothesis, what does a minimum effective dose of following a strict ketogenic diet look like for me? Assuming the rest of the time I’m still doing intermittent fasting, I’m not eating a lot of refined carbohydrates, but how might you suggest that I think about that? Because I don’t know what the durability of kind of keto memory, like metabolic memory is. So I’m trying to figure out like can I get away with two, three to four-week periods a year where there’s some carryover of like cancer-protective — our last conversation we kind of talked about thinking about ketones as hormones, but in terms of neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, yada, yada, yada, what are your thoughts? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. Well, I think in your context it’s hard to say, like to give absolutes, but I would say you can get 80 percent of the benefits with a low-carb diet. Low-carb meaning 100 grams a day, just fibrous, non-starch, non-sugar carbs, low-carb Mediterranean, if you want to call it that. And then periodically, maybe one week out of a month, get into a deeper state of ketosis and at higher is not better. We know that from the research. When ketones get into that two, three, four, five millimolar range, that creates energy toxicity and something we call reductive stress, and that is not good. I did not know this before getting into this kind of research, but the sweet spot seems to be between one and two for therapeutic ketosis, unless you’re metabolically managing a disorder that’s highly responsive to a ketogenic diet like neurometabolic diseases. And some of the things that we actually study need to be in the two to three millimolar. And oxygen toxicity needs to be like four to five because it’s a — very powerful seizures. But one to two seems to be the sweet spots for metabolic management of many different things and also just general metabolic health. And I think what you’d be doing, just doing low-carb and periodic ketosis is just enhancing your metabolic flexibility and maybe increasing the diversity of food that you’re eating to prevent micronutrient deficiencies, too. I am of the opinion that plants are good for you to eat broccoli, asparagus, salads, colorful vegetables, things like that, that kind of fit into a pattern of eating that we’ve known. Even things like lentils are probably good. Lentils actually have like zero CGM response to me, but I — Tim Ferriss: Really? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah, lentils seems to like, skyrocket other people that I know. I’m like completely flat. Tim Ferriss: I’m like somewhere in between. Yeah, I’m somewhere in between. Dominic D’Agostino: Okay. Like completely flat. I don’t know. Maybe it’s the time of day that I have them at dinner, then I always go take a walk, but it’s like no bump at all in my CGM. And I think that’s where CGM comes into play and we can do a personal precision engineered diet, if you will, and it gives us insight into the types of foods and the amount of foods that we can eat. And I think that’s going to be really important information. And I know there’s a lot of people harping on, because another study came out on CGMs provide no benefit at all to the non-diabetic. And I’ve had this conversation with people actually at a big event and people that were type 2 diabetics and I asked them just flat-out, I just went around the table and just saying, “If you’re type 2 diabetic, when you were diagnosed like three years ago, if you were to be giving a CGM five years before that, or even one year before that, do you think you would’ve been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes?” And they said no. They said once they got type 2 diabetes and got a CGM, it gave them the awareness. I mean, you can ask anyone who has flat-out over type 2 diabetes and just ask them the question, “Hey, if you were given a CGM a year or two in advance and you understood the impact of foods.” So I think a CGM is going to be important for delaying that Alzheimer’s disease. And if you have loved ones, Tim and your family, that I think you would encourage them to slap on a CGM and get some insight into what they’re eating. But it’s also forcing them to exercise because we’re talking about diet here, but just getting out and doing a brisk walk 20, 30 minutes a day can go a long way. Resistance exercise, I’m a little biased towards that, but muscle is like an endocrine organ that produces hormones and various molecules that are neuroprotective and muscle is tightly linked to brain size and, of course, your waist and your visceral fat. I would also encourage them to get a DEXA scan and gamify it and say, every year I’m going to get a DEXA scan and every year like I do, I just kind of create a lot of stress for myself to beat my DEXA scan every year and get their friends involved, make it like a social event. Everybody goes and gets their DEXA and then every year you go back and just try to beat your scores. But I mean, these are low-hanging fruit kind of things people should be doing. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Let me, I think probably fair to say, make sure you consistently hydrate for any of these things like a DEXA scan. I do have a follow-up question. So also on the exercise piece, people can look up something called klotho, K-L-O-T-H-O. There’s a lot more that comes of exercise like BDNF and all these various things. There’s a book called Spark that covers some of it, but it’s very outdated, but check out klotho. There are a lot of good reasons to exercise. Thinking of muscle like an endocrine organ, that’s a really good way to put it. My question to you was, you mentioned, say, one week per month going to more of a lower carb or ketotic state. How would you think about the benefits of one week per month? Assuming that the rest of the time I’m behaving, most of the time with a lower carbohydrate Mediterranean diet, let’s just say, okay, one week per month, every three months or three weeks, like contiguous weeks once a quarter. Do you feel like one of those is superior to the other? Dominic D’Agostino: Not really. I think whatever pattern works best, I think you would gain benefits for both. That would be an interesting experiment to do. Tim Ferriss: I’m just thinking about the lead time to get into a properly ketogenic state. If I’m going from some carbohydrate to ketosis, I’m just — we could talk about things that might accelerate it, but if it takes me two days to get there or three days and then I only have kind of four days in the sweet spot, these are things running through my mind. I’m just curious to get your take. Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. The one-week intervention for the month, my kind of opinion is that it could be pretty aggressive. Like you cut calories 50 percent the first two days and then cruise into it, so you’re really cranking ketones by the end of the week. And then you’re also cruising into it from what should be like a low-carb diet. So you should have that metabolic flexibility to kind of seamlessly transition into that ketosis state. And you could do intermittent fasting with mild caloric restriction for the first two days to ramp up ketones. Alternatively, if your schedule permits and like your work schedule, you have like three weeks where you need to really dig deep into a research project or something and ketosis seems to give you that cognitive flow or boost, then that might situationally fit into your schedule. And I definitely have periods of time where I do that, especially like if my wife is traveling or something like that, or on a research project or something, I just like, okay, I clean the house of certain foods and then I just prepare. I mean, simple things like that, too, I know just from the clinical ketogenic world is that if you have a family member that stocks the shelves with certain foods that can trigger and cause food noise, then that could really hamper your compliance to that. But you want to prepare the house, or if you’re going into a one week or you’re going into a three week, prepare the house and just make sure that you could do. Of course, you could just call Uber Eats and get anything delivered, but you want to kind of have the house prepared for that and mentally prepare for it. Tim Ferriss: So for you, personally, if you had some hereditary gnarliness, if you look back at your family tree and you’re like, ooh, whether it’s a bunch of cancer or a bunch of neurodegenerative stuff, maybe bit of both, who knows, would you be more inclined to do the one week per month, just for you personally or yeah, one week per month? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. And I would shoot to get a glucose ketone index of like one to two for at least three days out of that week. So really do a fairly aggressive ketone metabolic therapy intervention, kind of even think about it as like a prescription intervention, just like Valter Longo’s diet is a prescription medical therapy, right? So I would shoot to achieve a glucose ketone index of one to two for three days. And everything that we’ve seen in the lab that I’ve seen sort of on paper, of course, people aren’t out there measuring the autophagosome like P62 and other things, but that you are achieving a level of autophagy and that’s also stimulating many of the benefits of ketosis, not just ketones as an energy source, but you’re getting many of the robust signaling effects and really adapting your metabolism to fat and ketone sort of oxidation that has long-term benefits that can go at least three weeks. So I’m convinced of that. So you get benefits for three weeks, reset one week, benefits for three weeks, reset one week so you’re always kind of getting — whereas if you do three weeks and then take a period of time off, I’m not totally convinced that those benefits are going to span that amount of timeframe. That’s my thinking. Tim Ferriss: And you mentioned people can find calculators out there and actually a lot of the devices will try to provide this to you. Actually, is that true? I guess they would have to have both data streams, so probably not, but the GKI. So the glucose ketone index, you can find calculators for this, but fact-check this, since this is AI overview from Google, I wanted to just take a look at it. Divide your blood glucose level by your ketone level. If your glucose is milligrams per deciliter, common in the US, you first divide it by 18, this is an important step, to convert it to millimolars per liter, matching the ketone units, then perform the division. So you can figure this out very easily. And that is the GKI that you were mentioning of a one to two. What might that look like just offhand? I’m very not known for my quick mental arithmetic on the podcast, but what would a GKI of, say, one or two look like in terms of the readout on the glucose, on the glucometer and the readout on the finger prick for the millimolars for ketones? What would be an example? Dominic D’Agostino: If people are like don’t want to do the millimolar concentration of glucose, if your glucose is 80 and then your ketones are two millimolar, that would be, you are right into that one to two kind of the glucose ketone index of one to two, you’ll be between that level. If you could bring your glucose down to like 18, so like 68, 70 and get your ketones up to three, so that would be a GKI of one. So that’s pretty hard to achieve, but relatively definitely doable with exogenous ketones and MCT and things like that. I think what’s totally feasible is getting your glucose down to like 80, 80 to 85 in that range and getting your ketones at the end of the one-week fast up to two and maintaining that. So that would be kind of achieving that GKI of two. Tim Ferriss: I think I’m probably saying what I wish to be true, which is that my insulin sensitivity has improved a lot in the last certainly year in particular, and that is to explain in part, or maybe wholly, the lower readout on the ketone meters. But part of the reason I have confidence in that is that I’m using the same devices that I used to use. And back in the day, I would have much higher millimolar readouts. Of course, I have new strips. I did, at least to the extent that I can, for the continuous monitors, I’ve done calibration for the CGM at least, the glucose monitor, but that presents a problem. Even if that is, “Good news, Tim Ferriss, you’re not failing at keto. You’ve actually just made yourself a lot healthier with intermittent fasting and other things,” it still presents a problem for me to figure out if I am in that GKI sweet spot. So how would you suggest I try to figure that out? Is there a way to measure my ketone uptake and, therefore, modify the equation such that I factor that in somehow? Like there’s a multiplier of the readout on the finger prick or something like that? How would you handle that? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. Let me look real quick. Tim Ferriss: Dom is looking into his Santa’s workshop of various metabolic devices. Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. So I have a lot of different devices. So one is the Keto-Mojo device here. Tim Ferriss: Yep, that’s the one I have. Yeah, I’ve got the Keto-Mojo. Dominic D’Agostino: Okay. So that, I mean, you could just calibrate it such that it reads in millimolar concentration in glucose and ketones, and it actually gives you, this is the GKI version. It’ll just spit out the GKI. Tim Ferriss: Oh, you know what? I do have the GKI because you’re right, the Keto-Mojo also measures glucose. I guess what I’m asking for myself is since my readouts are so low, presumably as a placeholder due to improved insulin sensitivity and ketone utilization, I’m going to fail if I’m just using the glucose and the ketone strips for the Keto-Mojo. Because right now, if it’s telling me that I’m at 0.4 millimolars, and I can tell you subjectively, I do not feel like I’m at 0.4. I feel like I’ve got a lot more juice and a lot more gas in the tank. Is there a way to, whether it’s on paper or otherwise, account for the increased ketone utilization? I mean, it’d be great for me just to verify that somehow, but then whether I can verify it or not, if I wanted to try to determine during that week, like if I’m hitting my target GKI, how would you suggest that someone like me do that if I’m just not getting the numbers necessary to make the regular math work? Dominic D’Agostino: So one to two is a high bar, I guess, a GKI of one to two. And I think we’ve had this conversation back and forth with this group that we’re working with in the cancer community. The Society for Integrative Metabolic Oncology is a group that we’re discussing the GKI, and Thomas Seyfried is very adamant about, like, getting to one to two. But I give pushback and say one to four is if you look at the published literature, one to four is absolutely 100 percent therapeutic across not only cancer, but also like seizures and everything. So I’m going to expand that range to a one to four. So what does that mean? That would mean that your glucose level can be upwards of 80. And so you could have a glucose level of 75 to 80, and then get your ketone levels to one, and that would be a GKI of one essentially if you don’t have the glucose calibration for that. Or that would be a GKI of four, rather. And it would be really rare, if not impossible, for anyone in the general population eating to even achieve a GKI of like 5 to 10. So that’s indicative of high fat oxidation, ketone production, and I think that you’re getting a lot of therapeutic benefits. Also, a millimolar concentration of one in your blood represents a 10 percent available energy for your brain. And also the Keto-Mojo devices measuring D-beta-hydroxybutyrate. And if you’re doing supplementation with racemic D and L, then you’re not picking up the L. So that could be a factor too if you’re using racemic ketone salts. And there’s a number of publications that have already happened and some in the pipeline basically showing that elevate hydroxybutyrate takes about 4 to 5 times longer to metabolize. So that’s in circulation more. And also like, if you’re on a ketogenic diet for reasons we don’t fully understand and we are to rip out the heart, about 34 to 40 percent of the ketone in the heart is elevate hydroxybutyrate. And we don’t know why it converts the D to the L, but it serves a function that — the groups that have done the research are convinced it’s not an energetic, but it’s actually impacting cardiac output and reducing peripheral vascular resistance, maybe at the glycocalyx. So I don’t want to go down that rabbit hole. But basically, it’s like if your heart is pumping against pressure and think of it as like a garden hose and you take the kink out of the garden hose, the elevate hydroxybutyrate is taking the kink out of the garden hose of your vascular endothelium and then that’s also in your brain. So you have better blood flow to your brain. I mean, there’s tons of data out there showing an increase in brain blood flow with beta-hydroxybutyrate and the L trends better to increasing that blood flow. We do a Doppler blood flow measurement on various wound healing things that we’ve done in the lab. I mean, a lot of people have vascular dementia, right? Tim Ferriss: Yep. Dominic D’Agostino: So there’s different types of dementia, and it might be not like completely one or the other. And the metabolic phenotype of dementia could be vascular. You get a restriction of oxygen and energy to the brain. My point is that one millimolar of beta-hydroxybutyrate in circulation has an energetic effect and it also has a pronounced effect on the vascular endothelium to increase blood flow and circulation. So you are getting a benefit. Tim Ferriss: I’ve never had this experience in ketosis before where these levels have been this low. It’s so bizarre. And yet, let’s say, back in the day before the intermittent fasting, and it’s pretty much the lever that I pulled that I think changed things. Prior to that, I could tell you probably within 60 minutes of hitting 0.7 millimolars on the precision extra. Like I knew when my brain clicked past that point. And I did years and years and years of this stuff. I think as much as I like to measure things, I should just assume, right? If I’m having a bowl of mackerel dog food with MCT oil and apple cider vinegar and salt and pepper, then having a meal later that effectively has close to zero carbohydrates, if I’m doing that for almost three weeks, there doesn’t seem to be a physiological option C for failure, right? It’s like, what’s my body going to do? It has to be doing something because I’m not getting the dietary carbohydrate, and I’m not just mainlining whey protein isolate all day. So, I think I’ll probably just have to trust in the process because if I do have the increased ketone utilization and I’m just somewhere between 0.2 and 0.4 millimolars, for the most point, or for the most part, I just don’t think that the math might be really hard even to hit the GKI of four. But it’s like, if you’re following the process, I guess you’re following the process, right? Dominic D’Agostino: I say trust the process and also think about — I’m talking about like blood biomarkers, but let’s talk about physical metrics that could be considered biomarkers, right? So for me, it’s all about the numbers. Like my lab books and stuff like that have numbers in the lab, but also training. It’s like, I know exactly what I’m going to do going into the next workout and it’s all about X amount of weight for X amount of reps. So you can also do that with various brain training apps where you can do reaction time. So for our NASA NEEMO experiments where we’re in an extreme environment and we’re working with astronauts, we’re assessing reaction time, decision making, risk taking, where like this balloon blows up and you don’t know when it’s going to blow up, but you have to stop. It’s like a weird risk game. So we have this whole metric of testing cognitive function, reaction time and things like that. So there are things that you could do even with an app-based thing to assess that, and I think that would be a good thing. We have a massive NIH grant at University of South Florida on brain training games and assessing performance on that. Alzheimer’s was in my family, I would basically be doing everything possible, physical training, dietary metabolic training with nutrition, supplementation, and also brain training. And brain training games, and we use Joggle, the NIH Toolbox, I mean, we have like about six or eight different types of tests that we do to get a very objective measure of cognitive function. And I think it would be good to establish that now and then get your baseline just like we’re doing a DEXA for body composition, and then test that every six months. And then do it in the absence and presence of being in ketosis. So I would suggest something like that. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I have time blocked out in my calendar this Friday to do a whole battery of cognitive testing. And again, this is not super precise, but having tracked myself for so long and developed a water fuel for certain types of performance, zone two feels a lot easier right now, a lot easier than usual. And coming back to your prior comments. And then, I would say, I’m using software right now. At some point I’ll be able to talk more about this, but to basically train my visual processing to compensate for presbyopia, it is crazy, some of the effects that this stuff has. But it also is very much indirectly a measure of reaction speed, and they see some really cool carryover effects. And my speed in terms of time to completion for four bouts, like modules of tasks has just gone up and up and up since I’ve sort of been in extended ketosis. Again, that’s very easy for me to see. So folks who are listening, I’ll have more to share on that later, but it’s pretty mind-blowing stuff. So Dom, a few things have come up that I would love to chat about because I get these questions all the time, which relate to exogenous ketones. And people have heard this term, exogenous, endogenous. It’s very fancy talk and a tuxedo for outside the body, in the body, right? I’m simplifying here, but the easy way to remember exogenous is exoskeleton, right? It’s like a skeleton on the outside of your body. Exogenous ketones, ketones that you’re taking from outside and putting inside. People always ask, and I know you have a dog in the fight here, so I want to recognize that too. But how should people think about supplemental ketones? And are there any warnings or disclaimers that you want to add to that, right? Because this is a topic du jour. I think there’s probably no biological free lunch if people are going to be mainlining fruity pebbles and eating tons of carbohydrates, maybe not a great idea to eat tons of exogenous ketones. I don’t know, I’d be curious to get your take on that. But what’s the good, the bad, and the ugly of exogenous ketones? Where should people go? How should they think about it? Dominic D’Agostino: The things to consider would be when you’re thinking about a ketone supplement to think about palatability. If it doesn’t taste okay, you’re not going to consume it. I would, but most people won’t. Palatability, tolerability, if it gives you disaster pants or it makes you nauseous or something. So palatability, tolerability, and then the next one, the third one would be the pharmacokinetics. So you want something that when you consume it, that it has an ideal pharmacokinetics, meaning it’s not going to spike up in 30 minutes and be out of your system in like an hour or two. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Pharmacokinetics is like the stock chart for something you put in your body, right? In this case, right? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah, yeah. And that’s important because if you have a very rapid rate of rise of ketones, that can trigger an insulin response. And what I’ve observed, if I’m cruising in ketosis and I take a large dose of a ketone ester, it shoots my ketones up real high and it’s back down within like two hours, but it also kicks out insulin and that shuts off my own ketone production. Then I’m hypoketotic and hypoglycemic from the insulin. And that can create an energy deficit in the brain. Tim Ferriss: How long does that last for you? Dominic D’Agostino: And it lasts in the context of consuming, for example, a ketone ester by itself. But if you consume the ketone ester with MCT, if you could tolerate that, you could buffer that response to some extent, or you take it with food or something, or you could avert that by different ketone formulations and we could talk about that. But I just want to move down, so you got palatability, tolerability, pharmacokinetic properties, and you also have toxicity. So that would be the four things that you need to consider when sort of selecting an exogenous ketone. And those things differ depending upon if you’re using it acutely, like in a medical situation, or it’s like a daily thing that you want to take every day for prevention, right? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, let’s talk about toxicity first. Dominic D’Agostino: Toxicity is probably the most important too. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Let’s, for the time being, not talk about the acute medical delivery. Let’s talk about recreational/better said layperson use, right? This is as a dietary supplement. So could you speak to the toxicity piece? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. Well, what we observed about 10 years ago was that formulations that contained 1,3-Butanediol, that includes an ester. I have a lot of patents on and I have actually ongoing experiments with 1,3-Butanediol by itself is a ketogenic agent and that can have toxicity when used chronically. 1,3-Butanediol is an alcohol dimer and it gets metabolized through alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase. Aldehyde dehydrogenase kicks out a beta-hydroxybutyrate aldehyde that can be toxic. Tim Ferriss: How is it toxic? What are its toxic effects? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. So alcohol dehydrogenase uses NAD, consumes NAD as its function, right? So it can basically deplete the liver of NAD. And aldehyde dehydrogenase also consumes up NAD and it rapidly depletes, for example, the liver, the hepatocytes of ATP. So we know that there’s a paper coming out that’ll show that in our lab we’ve seen therapeutic effects in certain contexts, but when delivered acutely. But when consumed chronically, when we go beyond our experimental window and give these things chronically as like a lifestyle, exogenous ketone. And then we sacrifice the animals and then we do blood work and we look at the liver, we see signs that are scary, right? And this could be inflammation in the liver, TNF-α, sinusoidal dilation, sort of like gaps in the liver, fatty liver, a number of different things start to surface. And that’s pretty much just due to metabolizing something that’s considered a toxin to the body, 1,3-Butanediol. It’s a very versatile drug. 1,3-Butanediol by itself is more toxic than 1,3-Butanediol based ketone esters. So you have the ketone monoester, which is technically the millimolar concentration. You have 51 percent of a ketone monoester is 1,3-Butanediol. So it hydrolyzed in the liver, gets into circulation. Still over 50 percent of that is 1,3-Butanediol. That kind of needs to be detoxified, but 1,3-Butanediol does get broken down to beta-hydroxybutyrate. The diester is about 35 percent 1,3-Butanediol. So, I see these as potentially problematic. Tim Ferriss: The diester is what percentage? Dominic D’Agostino: A ketone diester, which would be 11,3-Butanediol with two ketones on it. We use acetyl acetate on each, that’s 35 percent of that molecule is 1,3-Butanediol in circulation. Tim Ferriss: I got it. Dominic D’Agostino: And then the beta-hydroxybutyrate monoester is 51 percent 1,3-Butanediol in circulation. So this can become problematic when it’s used as like a supplement and a lifestyle thing like day in and day out. Tim Ferriss: Can you translate from the animal models to humans, do you think, right? Because we all know, humans are not just big furry mice, right? Do you think it translates, right? And this might be just like a precautionary measure where it’s like, “Well…” Like pending additional studies, let’s hit pause in a sense. But if it were to translate, do you have any idea what type of dosing per day or per week with which we might see this toxicity in humans, right? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. So there is a paucity of data, and there’s a deficiency of data on the use of these agents 1,3-Butanediol that are long-term studies. The only study that I’m aware of is a case report with Dr. Mary Newport’s husband, Steve, and then there’s a 28-day study that used 25 grams. Tim Ferriss: 25 grams. Dominic D’Agostino: 25 grams per day, yeah. Tim Ferriss: Oh, shit. Dominic D’Agostino: And that produces like 0.1 to 1 millimolar. But what I have done is I took the R-1,3-Butanediol and then the racemic 1,3-Butanediol at different time points. And I basically dosed it for two weeks to keep my ketone levels at two millimolar, which would be like a therapeutic. And when you do that, what you will see, and I — well, I was going to say, I tell people that go ahead and do it, but maybe don’t do this. But when you take something like 1,3-Butanediol at a dose, which for me requires 30 milliliters three times per day to keep at two millimolar throughout the course of the day. If you do that for two weeks and then you test your transaminases, so that would be AST, ALT, and GGT, they will go up, so that’s a clear indication that — so we’ve done this in animals and fed it at a pretty high level, and we did not see transaminases going up. Tim Ferriss: So transaminases are what people could think of as liver enzymes on their blood panels, right? ALT. Is GGT typically tested? Dominic D’Agostino: GGT is like the wild carb, but what’s good about GGT is it’s the canary in the coal mine. It will go up before ALT and AST. If you expect someone has a problem with alcohol and they say they’re not drinking and you want to figure out if they’re drinking or not, say, “Hey, can I see your blood work and make sure the doctor adds GGT just to get a better,” and that’s elevated and your AST are not. The only things that’ll really shoot up GGT is like alcohol. And also the size of the red blood cell too can be if they’re like larger, that’s an indication like someone’s drinking too much alcohol. And it could be just like two or three glasses a day, but that will elevate GGT. So we observed that transaminases actually didn’t go up in our animals fed. The ketone esters or 1,3-Butanediol chronically, but when we pulled the livers out and then looked at the livers, then we saw things that concerned us. And we published this recently. And it’s good to know when someone has non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, they can have normal transaminases but have a necrotic liver. Tim Ferriss: Yuck. I did not know that. It’s terrifying. Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah, yeah. I mean, you look very closely at ALT longitudinally and that creeps up, but you basically have to do like a CT scan or a high resolution ultrasound of the liver. And basically, you could just take a subset of the American population that trends to be overweight and you do some liver scans and you find that they can have overt fatty liver disease and have completely normal transaminases are just trending up, right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Dominic D’Agostino: So my liver enzymes tend to trend a little bit higher just because I eat a lot of protein. So with 1,3-Butanediol and 1,3-Butanediol based ketone esters, you have a problem with tolerability, palatability, potentially feasible pharmacokinetics and also toxicity. So it almost like checks all the boxes in a negative way. So the field is trending towards non 1,3-Butanediol based exogenous ketones, and that could be free acids, it could be a triester with glycerol and also the ketone electrolyte salts, but you could also avert part of this just by formulation. The issue is that companies have one molecule and then they test that one molecule, but you could — I think formulation is the way to go. And companies don’t want to hear that because they have all their IP in one molecule. But we’ve always been a formulation kind of based lab, and always saw that these things always have drawbacks when used as a monotherapy, but when you start combining them together, that’s when you get better therapeutic effects. Tim Ferriss: Got the hounds out there. Hopefully, not next to the gators. We won’t spend any time on this, but I just wanted to tell people that before we start recording, you’re telling me that you caught a 10-foot alligator that was trying to eat your dogs and then you pinned it down and taped its mouth and then measured its glucose and ketones. Turns out that alligator had a pretty good GKI, but that’s a story for another time. So only in the things that Dom would do category that stand out, but we’re talking about a lot of terms that are likely unfamiliar to folks. I don’t want to throw anybody under the bus here, but people should do their homework. 1,3-Butanediol is very, very, very common. It’s very inexpensive, or relatively inexpensive to produce. So just keep an eye out for 1,3-Butanediol. If this is of interest to you, I have no investment in any ketone supplement company or anything. I do not have a stake in this, but I would like to ask a couple of things. So I have experimented, as you know, with ketone monoester, diester, ketone salts, I’ve played with everything, and I’ve found the diester to cause quite a bit of intestinal discomfort, to put it mildly, at least the first one or two times. I will say for folks, if at first you don’t succeed, meaning you have to run to the toilet. You may acclimate to it, which I did in that case, but I felt subjectively less and less effect. I seem to develop tolerance very quickly. I don’t know why that would be the case, but I seem to experience it. The ketone monoester, which is the 1,3-Butanediol bound to BHB, if I understand it correctly, right? I do like that. I like the subjective feeling of it, but if that’s only at about 11 milliliters. If I take 25 plus, speaking to your pharmacokinetics, right? Like the stock pops and then it drops and then I feel very tired and often feel more anxiety. It seems to prompt in me more anxiety. I mean, look, we got to talk about this. Not that it invalidates what you’re saying in any way, but your wife runs a company that sells ketone salts, which I also I’ve been using most consistently. Keto’s Therapy, people can check it out. But on the ketone monoester, what I’m wondering is if I’m only taking, let’s say, 11 milliliters once or twice a day, and I’m taking it alongside MCT oil, where would you put the risk analysis on something like that? Dominic D’Agostino: I would say, the risk is very minimal for a healthy person. So I have a super healthy liver. I even take N-acetylcysteine, alpha-lipoic acid, all these things. So I was surprised to see sort of liver climbing. What we see in our older animals is that they are selectively vulnerable to 1,3-Butanediol toxicity from acutely and also chronically. So for a normal healthy person, especially someone that’s sort of really good metabolic health and liver function and they don’t drink or drugs that compromise the liver, I would say upwards of 1,3-Butanediol 20 to 20 milliliters a day is probably where you want to cap it and maybe not do it every day. 1,3-Butanediol based ketone ester would do that, but you can also probably achieve and maintain the same level of ketosis with a ketone salt, a beta-hydroxybutyrate salt. And I do like the idea of a D and the L, the two enantiomers, which is a conversation that you may or may not want to have. So the L is basically like, it’s packaged beta-hydroxybutyrate in the time release form and it has some signaling effects. And then you have free acids too that are coming up on the market, and various liposomal formulations. I’m not sure if they’re commercially available yet, but these are some things in the pipeline. But yeah, 1,3-Butanediol based monoester, I think there’s good data behind it. I think the science that’s published is biased under the direction because that was the molecule that a lot of companies associate with, and then they test that molecule in and of itself as a monotherapy. And I am of the opinion that things are definitely optimized. You could avert a lot of the problems just by formulation. Tim Ferriss: How does the MCT oil help? I guess basically it makes the ramp up more gradual. Is that the effect that the sort of co-consumption of the MCT oil has? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. It delays gastric absorption for one thing, but it’s also stimulating your endogenous production. So the MCT goes to the liver, not through like chylomicrons, it goes right to the liver and stimulates your body’s ketone production. And I think that’s important. It’s almost like training your liver to ramp up fat oxidation, and it’s almost like exercising your liver to stimulate it. What we’ve also observed, and we published on that, like a large dose of MCT, when you take the liver out and look at it, there’s globules of fat all in the liver. Tim Ferriss: Oh, that sounds bad. Dominic D’Agostino: Well, we see a fatty liver, but we did not see evidence of necrosis, but we did see some inflammatory markers. Tim Ferriss: Necrosis is dead tissue, dead cells. Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. Yeah, we did not see that, but we saw signs. We saw sinusoidal dilation and TNF-α was elevated and some other things to suggest that large doses of MCT. And if you do the human equivalence, it would be like me taking upwards of like 80 to 100 milliliters per day. So that’s a lot. Tim Ferriss: Although, it’s not that much though, right? I mean, because 30 milliliters is like two tablespoons, is that roughly, right? So it’s like six tablespoons. If you’re just squirting it into your coffee, it’s not hard to necessarily get above a hundred. It’s actually pretty easy. So where would you recommend capping MCT consumption? I’ll get rid of my camel back with the MCT oil in it, but where would you recommend capping the MCT consumption? Dominic D’Agostino: The studies that were done showing benefits is like 20 milliliters per day, but they only did a single dose, which is weird, but that was the old Axona studies. And like 80 percent of people tolerated that, 20 percent didn’t. But I’m of the opinion that 20 milliliters twice per day would be perfectly fine for essentially most people that can tolerate that. And you’re going to have probably about 30 percent or more that can, but MCT is much more tolerable when you take it with a meal. So if you take MCT on empty stomach, prepare to be closer to a bathroom, right? So yeah. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Of all the disgusting things that I have consumed in my life, and I’ve had a lot, right? I mean, I’ve tried early prototypes of some of the esters and all sorts of stuff. I’m not going to say it was a Piña Colada, but I was fine with it. MCT oil to this day, I just find so absolutely revolting. I don’t know if it’s the neutrality and the mouth feel, but mixed with the mackerel and that apple cider vinegar, it sounds so disgusting. My friend almost puked in his mouth yesterday when I was describing it. It’s actually really good. I’m just a sucker for mackerel. I’ll take mackerel over sardines all day long, but — let’s see here… So I think we’ve covered a lot of the exogenous ketones. I’ll just pull this from our text thread because I think it might be a question on some people’s minds. As I was trying to troubleshoot my apparent failure mode with ketosis because of my low numbers, I asked you, is there any argument to be made that I should have a ketogenic breakfast instead of intermittent fasting? Could it be that I’m causing problems with exogenous ketones, right? Am I delaying potentially the onset of my own ketosis? Is it like TRT, right? If you’re taking exogenous, remember that word, if you’re injecting or rubbing on or swallowing testosterone, it’s like your Leydig cells are pretty smart. That’s the reason your balls turn into Raisinets is because it’s like, “Cool, we don’t have to make that anymore.” So I thought, am I shooting myself in the foot by taking exogenous ketones? And it sounds like a little bit goes a long way, but like most things, in excess, it becomes its opposite, right? It becomes a hindrance and makes it problematic. Is that fair to say? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. We’ve only seen the anti-endogenous ketosis effect with 1,3-Butanediol or 1,3-Butanediol-based ketone esters, and that is due in part to their potency and also the rapid elevation of ketones seem to have an insulin effect that can double or triple insulin. And even if we elevate ketones to the same level with a salt, we don’t see that spike up in insulin. So that could be coming into play with your low ketones if you are consuming the monoester. Tim Ferriss: Not much. Every once in a while, like before exercise, because I might not mind the spike, but I’m not consuming a ton. Yeah. Dominic D’Agostino: But the breakfast, I’m of the opinion that protein loading in the morning, actually when you first wake up, and I think Donald Layman and maybe Stu Phillips would also agree with this, and maybe Layne Norton too, the protein guys in the camp, is that protein in the morning kind of amps up your metabolism throughout the rest of the day. And I think if you abstain from eating during the day, you tend to get the munchies later in the day and you tend to overeat, whereas if you have a protein-heavy meal in the morning with high fat, then that can sort of rev up your metabolism for a good part of the day. But then again, some people, me included, my mind is not as sharp when I have — Tim Ferriss: Well, that’s the thing. That’s the thing, right? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I would say that, I mean, for 15 years, the sort of 30 grams within 30 minutes of waking up has been this sort of easy to remember heuristic that I’ve recommended for folks and that, if I am not intermittent fasting, that’s also what I do, but I’ve become so addicted to the mental sharpness that it’s just like, man, I know that if, for instance, if I want to do three hours of writing, I do not want to have food immediately prior to that. Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: But I would say, I’m also at a point, I think, where throwing up really heavy weight for me and getting as big and strong as possible is just not — it’s less of a priority than it once was, after shoulder surgeries and elbow surgeries and various things. Not that I want to be the skinniest guy in the room, but — Okay. It sounds like the pharmacokinetics are maybe to blame with the associated spike in insulin for some of the issues you might run into if you’re taking the 1,3-Butanediol-based products. Dominic D’Agostino: It can be, and I suspect it is, and I’ve kind of proven with myself that’s the case, but it also can be mitigated in part by mixing, taking it with a meal or taking it with MCT. But then you get the — it is metabolized, like 30 milliliters of 1,3-Butanediol is kind of like 30 milliliters of ethanol. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Dominic D’Agostino: And then 1,3-Butanediol can create dependence and it also can create — you get withdrawal. So it’s establishing literature. There’s several publications just showing that with 1,3-Butanediol will produce dependency, and when you abruptly stop 1,3-Butanediol after consuming it for a period of time, there’s essentially alcohol withdrawal from that. Tim Ferriss: What are the symptoms of that? I mean, imagine you don’t get DT, right? You’re not getting shakes or anything, are you? But, I mean, what happens? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah, it is, I mean, it’s like classical kind of ethanol withdrawal, maybe not quite as dramatic, but the glycols or diol alcohols do have a GABAergic effect, so you’re doing that. And yeah, I mean, it’s well established it has narcotic-like properties and that kind of stymied its use as a synthetic food for space flight. Well, I think that the palatability also factored into that, but also in the literature, it notes a narcotic effect of this and then the animal studies and really showed dependency and withdrawal. Tim Ferriss: Just to give a reiteration of that, I mean, the 1,3-Butanediol-based stuff is also sold as an alcohol replacement. So of course, being the idiot that I am, not idiot, just like I’m eager to experiment here and there if it’s not going to kill me, and so I thought, “You know what? I don’t want to drink tonight.” I remember where I was. I was in Upstate New York, about to go to a restaurant with a friend. I knew he would want to drink, and then I wanted to be able to say, “Hey, I already had this ahead of time. Don’t worry. We’re on the same level.” And I chugged a small can. It wasn’t, in terms of liquid volume, a lot, right? I don’t know, six ounces, eight ounces. And I felt like I could barely walk to the bathroom. I was smashed. It was, like almost knocked a glass off the table. I was like, “Holy shit, I did not do this risk assessment properly. Thank God I’m not about to get into a car,” because it took a little while to wear off. So that narcotic effect is really, it’s not always subtle. Dominic D’Agostino: I made jello shots. I made 1,3-Butanediol jello shots. And before we made the ketone esters in 2009, Patrick Arnold and I kind of formulated this. Tim Ferriss: Patrick Arnold. So people who don’t recognize Patrick, listen to my conversation with him from years ago, but if you know BALCO or remember when Barry Bonds grew a few head sizes or any of that stuff, anyway, Patrick’s got some stories. Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: So the jello shots, so what happened with the jello shots? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. Well, that was the way to get it down because 1,3-Butanediol is so nasty, right? So you could basically just warm up pure 1,3-Butanediol in a pot and then add cherry-flavored sugar-free jello and then stir it up and then pour it into like a cookie pan and then cut it into cubes, which you get 20 milliliters per jello shot, and make it pretty strong so it’s like firm jello, and I would just hit like two or three of them and just be buzzing. And I talk about it, like 1,3-Butanediol can be fun and it’s a lesser of two evils when we’re talking about ethanol. So I actually tried to file a patent for the use of 1,3-Butanediol for alcohol withdrawal and things like that. But actually, there was some prior art on that, and this is many years ago, but I actually do think it could be part used by people if they could transition off of ethanol, potentially use that, but there are other ways to get off alcohol. I’m not advocating for that. But my concern, is why I’m talking about it now too, is that I know there’s older people out there with dementia, perhaps Alzheimer’s disease, that if they’re consuming 1,3-Butanediol as a ketogenic supplement, it’s going to make you dizzy. It’s going to decrease your stability, like it’s going to make you potentially fall, break your hip. And then when you’re older, your liver, your ability to detoxify alcohol, an 80-year-old only has like 20 or 30 percent of the capacity to do that. So the same amount of 1,3-Butanediol for a 20-year-old is going to be like three to five times harder on your liver as we age, right? And people note that, like as you age, you just can’t tolerate the same amount of alcohol. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Dominic D’Agostino: So I think these things, the 1,3-Butanediol-based supplements, the straight up 1,3-Butanediol and 1,3-Butanediol-based ketone esters are problematic for the age population that I think some of these products or companies are targeting. And I say that not only as a scientist, but because of the volume of emails that I get on that. People were like, “I got super buzzed. I didn’t know what happened.” And some people are very sensitive to it, like I gave my wife — she can’t tolerate alcohol at all and she took a shot glass of the stuff and she could not believe that it was a legal supplement to sell. And now this will probably interest a lot of people, so they’ll probably go out and buy it, but I’m just saying like if you’re sensitive to alcohol, you’re going to get overly buzzed, and my concern is that, hey, if you want to use it for recreational, that’s your thing and maybe it’s better than alcohol, but for older people, a large dose of 1,3-Butanediol is problematic from a narcotic, from just the potential for just getting drunk, just straight up drunk. And Dr. Veech told me that a long time ago, I was like, because I was trying to get the ester from him and I was like, “What if I just use 1,3-Butanediol?” It’s like, “You’ll get drunk.” So it’s like he instilled that, that, “Do not do that.” That’s what he said. Tim Ferriss: And Veech was the co-inventor, is that fair to say, of the bonded monoester that was funded in part by, was it the DOD or DARPA? Dominic D’Agostino: DARPA. Tim Ferriss: DARPA and then patented at Oxford. Is that right? Am I getting my facts straight or am I getting things mixed up? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. Well, Oxford sort of acquired the IP and made a company out of it, but we have to credit Dr. Richard Veech, who passed away a few years ago, for the conception of a ketone ester for just — Dr. Veech was the student of Hans Kreb. Tim Ferriss: Kreb of Krebs cycle? Dominic D’Agostino: Krebs cycle, yes. Tim Ferriss: That’s wild. Wow. Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. I went to Dr. Veech’s lab at the NIH. I saw the whole ketone process, I tested different things. We were in communication, and I think he was a very colorful character and he had an amazing mind. We disagreed, we agreed to disagree on some things, but I consider him a mentor of mine, and I think we all owe a lot. I don’t think exogenous ketones may even not exist. Well, Henri Brunengraber and some other people, Sami Hashim developed the triester. So there was other people in this space, but he really advanced the science and ultimately the application of exogenous ketones and I think has written extensively about it. I mean, these things were around for a long time, and I think as science advances, we have more information and then we can — I have pivoted away from these things, although we still use them in some experiments. I published some really nice data on 1,3-Butanediol, actually even in cancer studies too, but at the same time, I realized that the negative effects, I can pivot away from that. We have other molecules in development now. Tim Ferriss: So I know as I’m watching things get dark on the East Coast for you that we’ll wrap up in just a few minutes. But in brief, you mentioned fat, salt, fiber as things that can be helpful for slowing, I guess, gastric emptying of these meals that I’m having. And I’m curious for you, on a ketogenic diet, what are your favorite sources of fiber, supplemental or in whole food form? Dominic D’Agostino: Whole food form. I like broccoli, and I buy broccoli florets, and then I cut the tip of the floret off, and I have a bowl of that and I give the stalk and stuff to my dogs and I chop it up for their fiber. So that’s something that I do, I don’t know, just to get a higher dose of broccoli. But broccoli, and then wild blueberries that has about half of the sugar and more fiber. They’re about a quarter of the size of like the huge blueberries you buy at, like, Walmart. But so wild blueberries, I like apples because they have a certain fiber called pectin in it. Some people that have a problem with fiber can’t digest pectin or they get gassy, so it’s on the FODMAP list or whatever. But wild blueberries, just green vegetables in general, but I like broccoli, and apples are pretty much something I have every day. Tim Ferriss: Now, the wild blueberries, I just want to really underline wild for people because that is not what you’re necessarily going to get at your local grocery store that’s been optimized to be as sweet as — Dominic D’Agostino: No. They’re in Publix. So I can get them in Publix down here. And I think, I don’t know, actually I think they’re in Walmart too. I think you can go to Walmart, and I think you might have to sneak around for them, but there’s like a brand, they have wild raspberries and blueberries and blackberries together. I forget the name of the brand, but they come in like big two or three-pound bags too. Tim Ferriss: How much can you eat of apples or berries before undoing all the good metabolic work that you’re doing in ketosis, right? Because even, for instance, we’ve talked about how easy it is, and it really is easy as long as you’re pretty simple to please dietarily, to, say, travel for keto, right? So you just pack a bunch of canned sardines, mackerel, maybe some oysters, and macadamia nuts, and you’re kind of good to go, like these things are pretty calorically dense. But the macadamia nuts, I was looking at the bag the other day because it’s one of the few kind of crunchy things that I feel like I can eat aside from some of these vegetables, and I was like, “Wow, if you go whole hog in the macadamia nuts, you can rack up the carbs after a while.” What about apples and berries? Where’s your cutoff point for yourself? Dominic D’Agostino: Well, macadamia nuts actually have that three-to-one to four-to-one ratio of fat to — so they are pretty high in fat, but like cashews and then like almonds and other nuts. I like walnuts too, I forgot to mention. So I have walnuts, a small organic apples we buy, wild blueberries, and broccoli pretty much every day, and all that together ends up being about 60 to 70 grams of carbs, but one third of the carbs is fiber, so it’s essentially non-glycemic. I haven’t had any of that today, but I tend to have that at dinner and then my snack at nighttime. So everything that I just mentioned, the carbs. But I don’t think about it as undoing like ketosis, and I do think my glucose tank is always like maybe 10 or 20 percent full, so I’m always running kind of low on glucose, and on some days I’m more active. Tim Ferriss: What’s your height and weight, Dom, at the moment? Dominic D’Agostino: Six foot, 220, and I’ve been, give or take, five pounds for years now, yeah. So just always cruise at like 220. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I mean — Dominic D’Agostino: 100 kilograms. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, good body composition. That is a lot of muscle for people who are not watching the video. I’m just trying to set the maybe context for what your tolerance might be for grams of carbohydrates. Dominic D’Agostino: I have pretty good tolerance for carbs now, but I think I have good tolerance more now because I’ve titrated some carbs back in, because I did go probably at least five years on like very low, like clinical ketogenic. And I did end up losing like almost like 18 pounds of like lean body mass, and then I took a year off in 2018, when we bought our farm. I was very busy on the farm. Then I bought weights and just have it on the farm. And then I’ve been doing DEXA. My last DEXA, it was 218, but under — I was like 9.8 percent body fat, like still under 10 percent. But I gained muscle when I got back into lifting and just did the heavy compound movements again. I don’t go super crazy on the weight, but I do train hard. But — Tim Ferriss: You found the addition of the carbohydrates to be beneficial, that slightly higher quantity of carbohydrates? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. I’ve added more carbs back in over the years, and that has helped me maintain my body weight. And I like eating those foods. I enjoy those foods. I think they have beneficial fiber, phytonutrients, other micronutrients that I think are beneficial. And I can maintain a level of ketosis about 0.5 to 1.5 day in and day out eating those foods every day. And I do titrate in like the MCTs and I get like one or two packets of KetoStart of day, maybe up to three if I’m traveling, but that’s my normal protocol and that has optimized all my biomarkers. I actually got full blood work today. Kind of waiting for that to come back to see. It should be interesting. I was inadvertently took something that I thought was laced with something, some gummies I told you about, but — Tim Ferriss: People are going to assume. When people hear gummies, they assume it’s THC, but this was what, theanine and magnesium? It should have been really innocuous, right? Is that right? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. Theanine and magnesium, my wife bought it at Marshalls. We both took two. We woke up in the morning and she says,” I’m dizzy.” She’s asking me, “What did you give me last night?” I was like, “I didn’t give you anything.” Because sometimes I give her stuff. I tried to get up, fell flat on the floor. Both of us could not walk. We were both completely incapacitated. I called the Poison Control Center. And yeah, so basically I’ve been running around to different labs, and now I’m doing forensics, so do something. I’m still buzzed — Tim Ferriss: Wow. Really? Dominic D’Agostino: — so if I don’t seem like myself, because I’m still buzzed 48 hours later. So we took something — Tim Ferriss: That is wild. Dominic D’Agostino: We had the spinnies, and even this morning I woke up, I had the spinnies walking to — so whatever it was, it was pretty powerful. And I have a little bit of a back injury from about a week ago, and I don’t have any pain from that. So I think whatever it is, I’m thinking potentially a fentanyl derivative or something, but — Tim Ferriss: Yikes, that’s terrifying. Dominic D’Agostino: My wife does not drink, she doesn’t use any drugs, so she was pretty much really floored by this. Tim Ferriss: Wow. Did you go back and buy some more of them to send off to get analyzed? Dominic D’Agostino: Well, I have it. Yeah. So I collected my urine, my wife collected her urine, and then I’m doing the necessary blood work, and I’ve contacted a forensic lab, and we have doctors involved in all this now. Tim Ferriss: Wow. Dosed the wrong guy. Or the right guy, because you imagine like what if that had been a 80-year-old woman sleeping on the second floor. I mean, that’s dangerous. Dominic D’Agostino: Absolutely. Yep, absolutely. I just took two and I’m a pretty big guy and everything, but if a little kid took two or four or five — so obviously, I don’t know, the company, and the company you can find it on Amazon, mixed it up and it’s laced with something or they just put high concentration THC and I kind of know what, but this is, we’re talking 48 hours later and I’m still feeling it. Tim Ferriss: That’s wild. Dominic D’Agostino: I’m super curious with my blood work, so I’m waiting for that to come in. Be careful, people out there because — Tim Ferriss: Be careful of those gummies, folks. Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. Not regulated. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Dom, is there anything else you would like to mention or anywhere you’d like to point people before we wind this to a close? Dominic D’Agostino: I don’t think so. I mean, we talked a lot about like sardine fasting and everything, I think, before. Tim Ferriss: In the prior conversation, yeah. Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah, yeah. I’d like to credit to Dr. Annette Bosworth, Dr. Boz, because, I mean, I’ve kind of came up with this idea, but it got traction, and I think she has — a lot of people that email me about sardine fasting heard it from Dr. Boz, and she’s amplified the message with millions of YouTube followers. But she kind of took an idea and actually put it into practice and amplified it through a lot of people, and then those people emailed me about it, so that amplified and secured my knowledge. “Yes, okay, these benefits are…” And now she’s been on like Diary of a CEO podcast, I think, and some other podcasts. So I’d also like to mention, I’m testing today even, there’s a company coming out, I don’t know if I can mention or not, but I will, Medifoodz. And for years, there’s no whole food-based ketogenic diet prescription foods. So I have no association with the company, I’m just testing their product, but they’re called Medifoodz. And Tim Ferriss: How do you spell that? M-E-T-I? M-E-T — Dominic D’Agostino: M-E-D-I-F-O-O- Tim Ferriss: Oh, Medi. I got it. Medifoodz. Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah, Medifoodz. With a Z. And I got to tell you, these are like gourmet foods, and then they hit the macros of a modified ketogenic diet. And we talked about if someone says the ketogenic diet is not palatable, they have to see these foods. They’re prescription whole food. There’s other companies that tried to do this, and they even got like the packaging is like compostable, like it looks like plastic, but I could throw it in my garden and it breaks down. I’m very impressed with this. I just mentioned that because I just got these foods yesterday and I was really impressed, but other companies have not been so impressive. So Medifoodz is pretty impressive. And Quest Nutrition tried to do this a while back and I think their foods were good, but they got a new CEO and just phased it out. But I like the idea of a prescription, whole food, ketogenic diet that potentially a doctor could write a prescription. And a week of foods could be sent to the patients. I’ve been questioning why someone has not done this, but I know the margins are very small in the food world, so it’s hard to kind of get that up and running. Tim Ferriss: I mean, they could take the approach that a lot of companies take, a lot of tech startups take, like Uber, Tesla, et cetera, you sell in the beginning for much higher price to people who are willing to pay that. You use that to subsidize the R&D or the scale necessary to then offer, right? Instead of Uber Black, you have UberX, and similarly for a lot of companies. I mean, I would pay for this, right? And yeah, I wouldn’t say totally price-insensitive, but I’m willing to pay for convenience because there does come a point where I’ve had enough canned mackerel and salads with rib eye that I would love to have something else in any case. So I will check out Medifoodz. Let’s see. Dom, are you active on social anywhere? Should people find you anywhere online? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah, I’m not too active, but I try to jump on about once or twice a week, and I cap my social to maybe an hour a week. Tim Ferriss: Yep. Smart man. Dominic D’Agostino: I try to respond back to things, yeah. Kind of delete the apps from my phone or some of them, but I repost things and try to acknowledge some questions and stuff people have on this, and then I collect questions and then — we have our own podcast, the Metabolic Link Podcast. And we have a Metabolic Initiative Platform which has ACCME accreditation, so it’s like you can get CME credits from it. So that has been a project that we’re working on and trying to advance everything we’re talking about into human application through that. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Beautiful. Well, I’m trying to think of any other links. Are there any other links that you want to mention? And we’ll stick these all in the show notes as well for people. Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. Ketonutrition.org. No products. I don’t sell anything. So ketonutrition.org information website, the Metabolic Link Podcast, and the Metabolic Health Initiative Education Platform are like the three biggies, I think. Tim Ferriss: Beautiful. We will link to all those things for people listening as well as — God save — People who help me do the show notes, they’re going to have a lot to dig through, but we will link to everything that we can find a link for at tim.blog/podcast. Just search Dominic, and this will be the most recent episode. I mean, we may have some in the future, so you’ll find it. And Dom, thank you so much for taking the time, man. Always great to see you. Dominic D’Agostino: My pleasure. Thank you, Tim, for having me. Appreciate it. Good seeing you.Tim Ferriss: Yeah.

Title: Shoulda Called It ‘Omni-scient’; Google’s Core Tremors

Omnicom’s Omnipotence Publicis has had a nice run. But is 2026 the year of the Omnicom? On Wednesday, Omnicom announced what it calls the next generation of Omni, its central identity and analytics service. The new Omni, which integrates data and technology beneath the Omnicom umbrella, underscores the broader industry trend toward consolidation. The upgrade stems in part from Omnicom’s acquisition of Interpublic Group, which closed in November, making Omnicom the largest agency holding company by revenue. The deal also brought valuable assets into the fold, chief among them the Acxiom Real ID, an IPG-owned identity solution that is now a part of Omni. Omnicom is also leaning harder into Flywheel (acquired in 2024) to power Omni’s shopper intelligence. And, on top of that, the new Omni product comes with a new agentic AI framework (because of course). The final pillar of the new and improved Omni is Interact, which was also IPG’s name for essentially the same centralized data and analytics service. So what’s the message here for agency holdcos? It doesn’t hurt to be holding a lot of co’s. Core Workout Google Search rolled out a broad core update in December, its first since last June. Such updates typically happen a few times per year, so Google was due. SEO consultant Glenn Gabe breaks down the data from Google’s latest update in a blog post. First, some spammy redirect sites unexpectedly thrived thanks to the new update. Google has regular minor core updates to fix mistakes, Gabe writes, “but it’s interesting to see this happen with major updates focused on quality.” And the December update ignored blatant shameless efforts to improve rankings in AI chatbot searches. One cringeworthy example is to publish listicles that prominently feature your own brand. “It’s a cheesy tactic, and sort of embarrassing for companies doing that, but it works (at least for now),” Gabe writes. Reddit, meanwhile, continues to feast on Google’s AI search overhaul. This time, it’s using Google’s language-translation AI to connect its non-English user base with Google Search results. Google’s broad core update from last April and others before it boosted Reddit as a scaled source of authentic commentary and product reviews. At the same time, and unrelatedly (*wink*), Reddit signed a series of advantageous-to-Google data-sharing and advertising partnerships. Primed For Déjà Vu Recurring ads have become an unfortunate staple of the streaming experience. In more Omnicom news, Omnicom Media announced an effort during CES to address TV’s frequency problem, Digiday reports. To help buyers better understand the connection between frequency and conversions, the holdco is integrating TV viewing data from Roku, audience data from Acxiom and shopper insights from Amazon Ads within its Omni platform. Good plan. But TV’s frequency problem has stumped the ad industry for years. Remember when FreeWheel launched a Viewer Experience Lab in 2023 to try and nail the balance between ad frequency and viewer aversion? Well, it’s still far from a perfect science. Key to Omnicom’s efforts is reducing how long it takes for advertisers to see frequency impact reporting from months down to just a day or two. And Acxiom, now part of Omnicom post-IPG merger, could also help the holdco by strengthening its closed-loop attribution, which would help cut down on ad waste. For now, though, ad-supported streamers can only hope for some relief from the ad bombardment. But Wait!

Title: Media Briefing: Here’s what media execs are prioritizing in 2026

This Media Briefing covers the latest in media trends for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Thursday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → This week’s Media Briefing looks at the main business areas publishing executives have their sights set on as they head into 2026, recalibrating around AI advertising revenue opportunities, brand marketing, and video and creator opportunties, after a humbling 2025. Media execs have big goals for 2026. They’re setting their sights on AI revenue and visibility opportunities, brand marketing pushes, plus a big year in U.S. politics and sports. They may have emerged bruised by a rocky 2025, which hit them with a new search landscape, AI copyright battles and a challenging advertising market. But as the year turns, there’s a sense of renewed resolve. At least that’s the tone for now, according to recent Digiday conversations and seven media execs from CNN, Forbes, Future, Hearst, USA Today Co., The Wall Street Journal, and Vox Media, Digiday spoke with for this story. AI advertising revenue opportunities Publishers are increasingly turning to AI as a practical tool inside their ad businesses. Expect to see publishers integrate AI more deeply into their media buying, yield management and ad sales functions this year, using it to price inventory, package audiences more effectively and extract more value from fewer visits. “In 2026, we’re moving past the ‘experimental’ phase of AI. At Dow Jones, our advertising focus is on using these tools to make our partnerships more precise,” said Josh Stinchomb, global CRO at The Wall Street Journal. The business publisher is integrating generative AI into everything from the initial client research phase to the way it builds and refines brands’ media plans in real-time, helping its ads business move faster with deeper insights that can improve performance, he noted. Other publishers are experimenting with building in-house, media buying AI agents to help automate the process of analyzing, planning and curating RFPs — another area that will evolve this year. This is all buoyed by the fact that publishing execs are seeing the first quarter of 2026 off to a good start, with ad revenue pacing better this month compared to previous years for some, thanks to premium video, and direct and PMP deals. AI visibility gains and KPI changes Publishers’ KPIs are shifting as traffic and scale fade as the key metric for a successful media business. Top publishing execs are orienting their businesses entirely around KPIs, like conversion and engagement metrics, including subscriptions, registrations, and overhauling sites to make them stickier so that even if they get fewer visits, they’re more valuable. What this ultimately means for goals and targets facing SEO and audience teams this year remains unclear, but it’s likely to become apparent soon. Resources are also now being funneled into tracking newer metrics like AI visibility, or how often a publisher is mentioned or cited in an AI search tool. Media execs are working with third-party tools — or building their own analytics — to get a better understanding of how, when and why they’re being mentioned across AI products. U.K.-based publisher Future recently built its own AI visibility measurement tool to do just that. The insights from that tool, called Future Optic, is key to the company’s editorial and branded content strategy this year, according to Future CRO Michael Peralta. “We’re only on first base on some of the stuff that we’re doing around AI and working with LLMs, so that’s a big deal for us for [this] year,” he said. Brand marketing push AI visibility measurement tools aren’t the only thing publishers are putting more resources behind. With search and social algorithms deprioritizing news, publishers are revisiting brand marketing, as they can no longer rely on organic traffic or discovery from platforms. “One of my big goals [for 2026] is for [people] to really know us as Future… We have [all of these different brands], and we also have scale,” Peralta said. The Financial Times debuted a marketing campaign for its subscription product on Wednesday, across TV, out of home, audio, digital and social. Publishers like Hearst, NBC News and Reuters ratcheted up their brand marketing last year, debuting expansive campaigns across platforms. The Economist also told Digiday it had big plans to bolster its brand marketing, in part by promoting access to more content for free to increase registration and subscription conversions. More media companies will funnel money into these campaigns to draw attention to their companies and the content they produce. “In a world of content commoditization, our biggest priority is to succinctly communicate how our brands, shows and podcasts add unique value to consumers and customers,” said Geoff Schiller, Vox Media CRO. Video expansions and creator collaborations News outlets like Time, CNN, The New York Times added more vertical video to their sites and apps at the end of last year, to appeal to audiences and marketers accustomed to consuming content and buying ads in this format on social media feeds. For Time and Recurrent Ventures, video ad revenue will be one of the biggest growth drivers of their businesses in 2026. Likewise, Guy Griggs, svp of ad sales and client partnerships at CNN, said his top priority for 2026 is to expand and monetize more brand-safe online video and streaming content. At the same time, publishers are building their own networks of creators they can invest in to collaborate on personality-led video, to drive more video ad revenue and audience engagement. Publishers like Yahoo and Future are focused on expanding their creator networks this year. “I think we’ve got a really good right to win in the retail media space, particularly with our high-intent audience. We can work with influencers and advertisers at scale [with our branded content business]. I think that’s going to be a big deal for us,” Future’s Peralta said. Hearst Magazines will expand more into its creator-driven, tentpole franchises this year, after seeing success from programs like ELLE’s Women in Hollywood, Bazaar’s Icons, according to Lisa Ryan Howard, global CRO of Hearst Magazines. “[We will expand] social-first video-led storytelling events and scaled creator integrations to help our partners break through with high-impact programs both domestically and globally,” she said. In 2026, Hearst Magazines is also focused on selling what it calls “360 Bundles,” or ad sales packages that include content production, creator collaborations, and distribution across multiple channels, Ryan Howard added. “More than ever, [we are] amping distribution offsite through social and video, live events, original editorial content collaborations, creator partnerships, newsletters [and] vodcasts,” she said. Meanwhile, Forbes is focused on expanding social and video content, creators and talent partnerships and event franchises, according to Leann Bonanno, the publisher’s chief sales and marketing officer. “In 2026, one of Forbes’ key business priorities is advancing a content strategy built for how audiences and advertising partners engage today — across digital, social, video, AI-driven discovery, and live experiences,” she said. Big election, sports year Like all the election years before it, the U.S. midterms this November represent a potential windfall of audience and ad revenue growth opportunities for news and politics publishers. USA Today Co. (formerly Gannett) is one of the news media orgs banking on this in 2026. In an election year, committing to a “facts-forward approach” for both center-right and center-left voters — is its focus, according to Kristin Roberts, USA Today Media president. This summer, the FIFA World Cup will be held in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, providing another opportunity for USA Today Co. to increase its sports coverage this year from both its local and national brands, Roberts added. “Honestly, I think the days of just expecting a fully curated experience of what editors think you should see that day in kind of stacked headline format [on a homepage] — I think those days are over. It just is going to feel archaic to people. So I do think that they expect us to go the extra mile to learn more about them and give them results that are tailored to things they’re interested in.” — Nina Gould, chief innovation officer at Forbes 66%: The decline in the price of BuzzFeed’s stock in 2025, down to $0.93 on Dec. 31. 17,163: The number of job cuts at U.S.-based media companies (TV, film, digital publishing and broadcast) in 2025, an 18% increase from 2024. 3.88%: The year-over-year increase in display advertising revenue for members of the Association of Online Publishers (AOP). $50 million: The size of the investment from billionaire David Hoffmann in newspaper chain Lee Enterprises.
