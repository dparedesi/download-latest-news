Title: NYSE Plans Texas Exchange as Financial Firms Flock to State

The New York Stock Exchange plans to start an equities exchange in Texas, the latest firm seeking a slice of the financial services industry in a state where the taxes are lower and regulation looser. NYSE said it will reincorporate its NYSE Chicago operations in Texas and will launch the fully electronic exchange in Dallas, pending regulatory filings. The exchange will serve companies from Texas and around the world, it said. NYSE’s move underscores the heightened allure of Texas for corporations and financial firms seeking to benefit from a more relaxed regulatory environment than blue states like New York and California. Dallas is host to the Texas Stock Exchange, which counts BlackRock Inc. and Citadel Securities among its backers and plans to begin trading in early 2026. Nasdaq last year reorganized its listings business into three regional divisions including Texas. “As the state with the largest number of NYSE listings, representing over $3.7 trillion in market value for our community, Texas is a market leader in fostering a pro-business atmosphere,” NYSE President Lynn Martin said in a statement. The NYSE’s plans give another boost to the Dallas-Fort Worth area, which already has more finance workers than Chicago or Los Angeles, trailing only New York. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is building a new campus in Dallas that will house about 5,000 employees. “With the launch of NYSE Texas, we will expand our financial might in the United States and cement our great state as an economic powerhouse on the global stage,” Texas Governor Greg Abbott said. Although the state is known for its business-friendly approach, the Texas Stock Exchange has faced some other challenges. It was already contending with an uphill climb to secure listings. Its promises to avoid what could be seen as political requirements, like board composition requirements, have lost punch as companies have begun rolling back diversity and environmental pledges. It would also need to bite off business from private equity. “They’re not only competing against the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq,” said Andrew Silverman, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. “They’re also competing against Blackstone. They’re also competing against Apollo. They’re also competing against Berkshire Hathaway.” TXSE Group Inc., parent company of the proposed Texas Stock Exchange, recently closed its initial fundraising round at $161 million and said TXSE has filed for registration as a bourse with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. “We are committed to closely aligning with issuers and investors to provide a premier venue for listing and a world-class platform for trading,” a spokesperson for TXSE said in a statement. “We have known all along that Texas is the best place to do business.” NYSE and its biggest rival Nasdaq dominate the IPO market, which is rebounding after a lengthy slump on geopolitical uncertainty, inflation and higher interest rates. Nasdaq Chief Executive Officer Adena Friedman said last month she expects a strong environment for IPOs in the second quarter and rest of the year. NYSE’s move to Dallas is “going to bring more financial firms with it, and force Texas to reinforce its infrastructure,” said David Choate, chief operating officer of Dallas-based brokerage firm CAPIS. “You’re always wanting to be on the cutting edge of technology if you’re hosting financial firms like exchanges,” he said.

Title: Is Axon Enterprise, Inc. (AXON) the Best Gun Stock to Buy in 2025?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Gun Stocks to Buy in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Axon Enterprise, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXON) stands against other best gun stocks to buy in 2025. Please keep in mind that the category of "gun stocks" covers not only gun manufacturers, but also suppliers and retailers of gun parts, ammunitions, or adjacent products such as the ones used by law enforcement and public safety officers. America has a deep connection to guns, dating back to its earliest days. The Second Amendment of the Constitution guarantees citizens the right to bear arms. According to a Pew Research Center survey in 2023, about four in ten adults in the country say they live in a household with guns, while 32% personally use one. READ ALSO: 10 Defense and Aerospace Stocks To Benefit From Trump’s Peace Through Strength Policy and 8 Best Military Drone Stocks To Buy According to Analysts. While there is mixed opinion over the right to own a gun and the laws that regulate its use in modern times, most gun owners consider the weapon an integral part of their freedom. About 72% cite protection as the major reason behind owning a gun. Others own the weapon for varying reasons, including gun collection, hunting, sports shooting, and job purposes. While firearm purchases have been on a steady decline since the pandemic peak, the demand is still reasonably high. The United States is home to a thriving firearms industry that generates billions in revenue every year and provides employment to thousands of Americans. According to The Firearm Industry Trade Association, the sector contributed $90 billion toward the national output in 2023. This was 371% higher than the levels in 2008. American companies that manufacture and sell firearms, ammunition, and hunting equipment had employed nearly 155,000 people, as of 2023. The market has also created thousands of jobs indirectly in the ancillary and supplier industries, resulting in over 384,000 jobs tied to the sector. Combined, these workers earn around $25.98 billion in wages. While final figures for gun sales in 2024 are yet to be known, the FBI’s database recorded 5.5 million guns being bought by Americans during the first four months of the year. This was a slight dip year-over-year from 2023. California, Florida, and Texas represented 22% of gun purchases between January and April. During his election campaign, Trump vowed to defend gun rights and oppose any firearm limits. After being elected President, the 78-year-old signed an executive order aimed at reversing Biden’s actions on the guns. On February 7, the U.S. president asked the Department of Justice to review regulations drafted by the previous administration to look for any ‘ongoing infringements’ of the Second Amendment. Gun stocks surged last year in July, following the assassination attempt on Trump. The demand for guns and ammunition often sees an uptick after a law and order incident, or when there is chatter about a change in laws that could limit their availability. We scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds for the third quarter of 2024 to identify gun, ammunition, or adjacent product companies. From there, we picked 10 companies with the highest number of hedge funds having stakes in them. Since there are few pure-play gun and ammunition stocks, we have also included sports and outdoor recreation companies selling shooting products in our list. The best gun stocks to buy are ranked in ascending order by the hedge fund holders in each company. When two or more stocks were tied on the number of hedge fund holders, we outranked one over the other on market capitalization. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

(NASDAQ:AXON) is an American manufacturer of weapons and technology for law enforcement agencies, military, and civilian use. The company has a diverse product catalog that includes TASER energy weapons, cameras, sensors, and others. The stock has had a tremendous five-year run, during which its share price has grown by a whopping 656%, amid robust demand in its TASER segment and several tactical partnerships and acquisitions during this period. The company’s financial performance remains strong as well. During its recent Q3 2024 earnings call on November 7, Axon Enterprise, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXON) reported that it had delivered above 30% annual revenue growth for each of the three quarters in 2024, driven by surging demand for all its products and services. This marked 11 successive quarters of over 25% growth, which has further bolstered investor confidence in the stock. Conestoga Capital Advisors stated the following regarding Axon in its Q4 2024 investor letter: Axon Enterprise, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXON) continued to see robust demand for its products and services, from TASERs to body cameras to the software that powers many applications within public safety operations. Shares jumped on third-quarter results, which saw revenue grow 32%, EBITDA 58%, and backlog 33% to $7.7 billion. In addition, AXON continued to expand adjusted EBITDA margins, which were above 25% in the third quarter. AXON was a leader in three of the four quarters in 2024. According to Insider Monkey’s database for Q3 2024, 46 hedge funds held a stake in the company – a significant improvement from 36 at the end of the second quarter. Navellier & Associates was the largest investor in the company, with holdings valued at over $8.6 million as of September 30, 2024. Based on investor sentiment, Axon Enterprise, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXON) is the best gun stock to buy in 2025. Overall, AXON ranks 1st on our list of best gun stocks to buy in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of gun companies, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AXON but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, Feb. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo Nordisk” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) and reminds investors of the March 25, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that the true state of Novo’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” On December 20, 2024, during pre-market hours, Novo announced headline results for its REDEFINE-1 trial, which determined CagriSema had achieved a weight loss average of only 22.7% after 68 weeks. The Company attributed this diminished result, in part, on the previously undisclosed “flexible” nature of the protocol. This flexibility resulted in less than 60% of patients apparently completing the dose escalation period and thus being treated with “2.4 mg cagrilintide and 2.4 mg semaglutide once-weekly,” the maximum dosage of CagriSema contemplated by the trial, during the 52-week maintenance period in the manner outlined by the published protocol for the REDEFINE-1 study. Investors and analysts reacted immediately to Novo’s revelation. The price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $103.44 per share on December 19, 2024, Novo’s stock price fell to $85.00 per share on December 20, 2024, a decline of about 17.83% in the span of just a single day. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Novo Nordisk’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Title: Super Micro is walking head-high despite the chaos in the stock market. Here's why

Despite the turmoil in the stock market caused by persistent inflation, shares of Super Micro Computer (SMCI+4.99%) rose Wednesday morning as the chipmaker’s earnings report highlighted a positive outlook regarding its delayed annual report and announced an ambitious goal for 2026. The AI hardware company is working to avoid delisting by Nasdaq, with a deadline of February 25 to submit its delayed annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). CEO Charles Liang is confident that it will be submitted on time. The company expects to reach $40 billion in revenue by fiscal 2026, while analysts anticipated $30 billion for that period. However, the company lowered its fiscal 2025 revenue guidance, now expecting between $23.5 billion and $25 billion. This marks a decline from its previous forecast of $26 billion to $30 billion, while analysts had projected $24.9 billion. Moreover, the company reported net sales between $5.6 billion and $5.7 billion, reflecting a 54% year-over-year growth, although analysts had expected $5.89 billion. Super Micro makes hardware that supports AI applications. Last year, the San-Joes-based company went through many ups and downs. The SMCI stock thrived for much of 2024 and entered the Fortune 500 at No. 498 as part of a frenzy over AI and related tools. As a key partner and reseller of Nvidia’s (NVDA+3.33%) GPUs and other components, Super Micro integrates the technology into its servers to support AI workloads. Super Micro CEO Charles Liang and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang are both Taiwanese immigrants and have a long-standing relationship. Super Micro Computer went through a rough phase in September 2024 when a short seller, Hindenburg Research, published a scathing report accusing the company of accounting red flags and questionable business dealings, including alleged sanctions evasion from exports to Russian and Chinese firms. Following that, its auditor, Ernst & Young, resigned, citing disagreement over Super Micro Computer’s governance practices and board independence. Looking forward to a fresh start in 2025, SMCI stock has risen 37% year-to-date and is currently trading at $41 per share.

Title: The Trump premium isn't being baked into Meta's stock: Analyst

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts. It's more Meta's (META) fundamentals powering the stock to record heights than a cozier relationship between Mark Zuckerberg and President Trump. Or so argues Morgan Stanley managing director Brian Nowak. "I don't think their relationship has actually impacted the [price-earnings] multiple in a material way," Nowak told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (see video above or listen below). "I don't think there's a multiple premium necessarily related to their relationship change now versus the first administration." Meta's stock has been on a blistering run this year — especially in February — as Zuck's efforts to court Trump have coincided with a strong fourth quarter earnings report. Shares are hovering near a record high. The stock is up 23% year to date and is the best-performing component of the "Magnificent Seven." The stock is up 5% in February alone, besting the relatively flat performance for the S&P 500 (^GSPC). Nowak believes there is a lot to like fundamentally about Meta. The first is the raw numbers, powered by several years of improving the platform and better advertising industry dynamics. Earnings and revenue easily beat analysts' estimates. Profits were up 50% from a year ago. Its app family (Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp) saw sales improve by about $7 billion year over year. The business added close to $7 billion in operating profits too. In the last seven days, Yahoo Finance data shows 23 analysts have pushed up their earnings per share estimates on Meta for 2025. A total of 20 analysts have hiked their EPS projections for 2026 in the past seven days. 54 out of 63 analysts that cover Meta rate the stock a Strong Buy or Buy. "They're analyzing more instances of when you scroll up and down the feed, where do you stop, where do you stall, where do you scroll faster? And they're using more data points to essentially improve the relevancy of all the content that their users see by daypart," Nowak explained. "And then they're able to also take that data and use it on the advertising side and determine are you more likely to click on ads in the morning when you're catching up from the night's news? Or is it, are you more likely to click on ads in the evening when you're scrolling through your daily catch up or your sports." The next catalyst for Meta shares could be how the issues surrounding TikTok play out. TikTok is working again after briefly going dark in the US to comply with the divest-or-ban law that kicked in on Jan. 19. A final decision on the platform's fate by President Trump has not been made, though he has leaned toward pushing for part US ownership. "I still do think there is some uncertainty about what happens with TikTok — if TikTok is acquired, who ends up acquiring it, it does matter for Meta. If TikTok is instead shut down, that also really does matter for Meta. That is sort of all related to President Trump as well," Nowak added.

Title: NYSE comes to Dallas with rebranded branch as Texas Stock Exchange eyes launch

Business By Sasha RichieBreaking business reporter Breaking business reporter The New York Stock Exchange will reincorporate its Chicago branch in Texas, it announced on Wednesday, rebranding it as NYSE Texas and moving to Dallas. With the upstart Texas Stock Exchange taking shape and the Nasdaq expanding its reach in the Lone Star State, the Dallas region is about to find out if “Y’all Street” is big enough for three players. Timing of the Big Board’s “fully electronic” Texas equity market will depend on regulatory filings, the NYSE said. The announcement comes as a number of big companies flock to Texas as a whole, drawn in by its low taxes and business-friendly regulation. “As the state with the largest number of NYSE listings, representing over $3.7 trillion in market value for our community, Texas is a market leader in fostering a pro-business atmosphere,” Lynn Martin, president of NYSE Group, said in a statement. Become a business insider with the latest news. Or with: By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy “We are delighted to expand our presence in the Lone Star State, which plays a key role in driving our U.S. economy forward.” New York’s NYSE and Nasdaq have had a near duopoly on the U.S. securities market for decades, but both apparently see a formidable challenger in the Dallas-based upstart TXSE. The startup has gotten $161 million in initial backing from financial giants like BlackRock and Citadel Securities, and is on track for an early 2026 launch. Late last month, it filed for U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approval. The TXSE’s goal is to lower the costs of getting listed while also raising standards for who gets to be listed, in order to reincentivize companies to go public while taking advantage of Texas’ robust business community. “The Texas Stock Exchange is harnessing this momentum to build a national securities exchange in our home state. We are committed to closely aligning with issuers and investors to provide a premier venue for listing and a world-class platform for trading,” a spokesperson for TXSE said in a statement responding to NYSE’s announcement. “The mission of the Texas Stock Exchange is to bring competition back to the markets, and we look forward to cementing Dallas as one of the financial capitals of the world.” Recently, the Nasdaq announced a new regional management division based in nearby Irving, just months after TXSE founder and CEO James Lee announced he’d raised over $100 million in capital. “Texas is the most powerful economy in the nation, and now we will become the financial capital of America,” said Gov. Greg Abbott in a statement. “With the launch of NYSE Texas, we will expand our financial might in the United States and cement our great state as an economic powerhouse on the global stage.” Sasha is a business reporter for The Dallas Morning News.

Title: How Will Tariffs Impact You? Here’s What To Know About Trump’s Plans

Consumers will start feeling the impacts of President Donald Trump’s tariffs soon. Trump is set to unveil “reciprocal tariffs” today, a 10% levy is in effect on goods from China, and while his 25% levies on Mexico and Canada were delayed until next month, they would also have sweeping economic impacts. Many Americans are left wondering: Who pays the price? Here’s a rundown on the history and impacts of recent tariffs, Trump’s proposals and what to expect when it comes to increased costs. And there will be impacts: Nearly all economists agree tariffs are a tax on consumers. If you’re wondering how to prepare for the financial implications, we’ve got you covered on that, too. Workers assemble washing machines on the production line at a Haier factory in Qingdao in east China's Shandong province. To see the direct impact of tariffs on prices, look no further than washing machines. In 2018, President Donald Trump enacted tariffs ranging from 20% to 50% on imported washing machines. His administration purported that the tariffs would protect American industry—and such a move did add around 1,800 jobs domestically, according to a study in the American Economic Review. But each of those jobs came with an average annual cost to consumers of over $815,000. That’s because the report found that the tariffs raised the price of washing machines and dryers (which were not subject to such a tax, but are usually bundled with washers) by about $86 and $92 per unit, respectively. In total, the tariffs cost consumers just over $1.5 billion annually. And it wasn’t just the foreign producers who upped prices: Domestic manufacturers like Whirlpool and Maytag raised their prices by nearly the same amount once their competitors were charging more, says Felix Tintelnot, associate professor of economics at Duke University and one of the study’s authors. And he said the price of dryers went up alongside washers to likely spread out the additional cost producers were facing. Tintelnot said while tariffs can increase the number of jobs in specific sectors, they won’t affect aggregate employment because the country is already near full employment (unemployment is at 4%). “You can get [a] reallocation of employment towards industries that faced higher imports before, but that’s going to come at the loss of employment in other industries, especially export intensive industries,” he tells Forbes. “We are basically trading off cost to consumers with the benefits for producers in the import competing sectors.” Anti-World Trade Organization protesters during a 1999 demonstration in Seattle. Tariffs have been a trade weapon in the United States’ arsenal since the country’s very beginning. One of Congress’ first acts was to pass the Tariff Act of 1789, which was aimed at protecting domestic industry and raising revenue for the new government. In fact, tariffs actually constituted the majority of the federal government’s revenue until the creation of the income tax in 1913. With more money flowing into the government’s coffers from the income tax, along with the spoils of major industrial expansion in the late 1800s, import duties became less critical. Still, after the stock market crashed in 1929, Congress approved the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which raised already high tariff rates and angered the country’s trading partners. Trade between Europe and the U.S. fell by two-thirds, worsening the Great Depression. Some experts also say it helped give rise to extremist ideologies in Europe. But after World War II, the world rejected “protectionist” trade policies like tariffs, and 23 countries signed onto the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1947, which later became part of the World Trade Organization. And we remained in that era of free trade for decades, amid rising globalization and corporations “offshoring” manufacturing to lower-cost countries like China. U.S. manufacturing employment peaked in 1979 at 19.6 million, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, but by 2019, that had fallen to 12.8 million, a 35% drop. Americans’ anxieties over the loss of such blue-collar jobs had been brewing long before Donald Trump, as the manufacturing sector was particularly hard hit by the 2008 Great Recession. Enter Trump, who tapped into those frustrations with an “America First” pitch. LUIS TATO/AFP via Getty Images Trump used tariffs as a tool in his first administration, targeting washing machines, solar panels and crucially, steel and aluminum, key materials in an already pricey housing market. Former President Joe Biden kept many of Trump’s tariffs in place. But Trump’s tariff threats this time around are more wide-ranging and potentially damaging, economists say. Though the president’s latest threats focused on Canada, Mexico and China, he has previously suggested taxing all goods manufactured abroad at 20%. That would almost certainly raise prices for consumers, especially since manufacturers wouldn’t be able to avoid a tariff by moving operations to a different country. Still, Vietnam is expected to be a major beneficiary of Trump’s China tariffs, and some companies already pivoted to the Southeast Asian country during the previous Trump Administration. Apple, for instance, started moving AirPods manufacturing from China to Vietnam in May 2020. “If previously it was made in China, now it’s going to be made in Vietnam,” Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University, told Forbes in November. “That production is not coming back to America.” ANDREJ IVANOV/AFP via Getty Images Trump’s China tariffs are expected to impact a wide variety of consumer goods, from electronics to toys and shoes. Around 80% of toys imported to the U.S. come from China, the Toy Association trade group told Forbes, and around 37% of all footwear imports—totaling $9.5 billion—to the U.S. in 2023 came from China, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission. And for millions of price-conscious shoppers who rely on low-cost Chinese retailers like Temu and Shein, the tariffs will also close a little-known loophole that allows merchandise under $800 to enter the U.S. without being taxed. Many electronic devices like iPhones are assembled in China, a core concern for Apple investors as its stock fell 3% the day before the tariffs went into effect. And despite his relationship with President Donald Trump, Elon Musk was the biggest, immediate loser amid the stock market’s tariff reaction early last week, as investors expect the tariffs to impact Tesla’s business and profitability. Though the tariffs on Canada and Mexico were delayed for 30 days, Trump indicated that they would be needed as recently as Sunday, and they have the potential to wreak havoc on a highly integrated North American supply chain. Consumers are already conscious about grocery prices, and the U.S. relies heavily on the two countries for fresh produce. Canada is the largest exporter of meat to the U.S. Natural gas and oil from Canada would be subject to a 10% levy, and oil traders and consumers would pay the price. The price of gas is likely to increase up to 40 cents a gallon within days of tariffs on Canada and Mexico, according to Patrick De Haan, GasBuddy’s head of petroleum analysis. Canada sends about 20% of the oil used by Americans. Tariffs on the two countries would also hit the auto industry hard, as companies like General Motors and Ford rely on Canadian and Mexican companies for parts. Experts estimate the average price of a new car will increase by $3,000, as 22% of all vehicles sold in the U.S. are imported from the two countries, per S&P Global. “The proposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico are really quite harmful and would change how American firms can do business,” says Tintelnot. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Separate from tariffs planned for Canadian and Mexican imports, Trump imposed a 25% global tariff on steel and aluminum imports Monday. But the European Union vowed to retaliate, and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese sought an exemption for his country. And still to come: Trump signaled he would institute his most wide-ranging import taxes yet, reciprocal tariffs. These tariffs are straightforward in theory: The U.S. would place the same levies on imported goods that a country imposes on what they import from the U.S. But it’s actually more complicated than that, because different types of goods are taxed differently. If Trump were to implement what’s called “country-level reciprocity,” or the same average tariff that our trading partners place on U.S. goods, the U.S. would see a weighted average tariff rate of 4.8%, Deutsche Bank economists estimated. That’s an increase from a 1.5% effective rate in 2022, per the World Bank. It would also likely result in higher inflation in the short term. Companies are likely to respond to tariffs in several ways, explains Lori Yue, an associate professor at Columbia Business School. One is building up a supply chain in the U.S., which “doesn’t happen overnight,” or they may lobby the Trump Administration for exceptions. But ultimately, they’re likely to just pass on the cost, which economists expect to tamp down economic growth. “Some of the products, especially the agriculture, gasoline and also the automobile products, this affects people’s daily life,” Yue tells Forbes. “They’re going to feel it stronger than last time.” Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images TOPLINE While Donald Trump’s 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada are paused for now, investors should be prepared if that relief is only temporary. The tariffs on China still took effect this month, and Trump may be emboldened to continue using the threat of tariffs as an intimidation tactic. Adrian Helfert, CIO of alternative and multi-asset portfolios at Dallas-based Westwood, recommends finding protection in small- and mid-sized businesses that have a more domestic focus, which are still broadly undervalued relative to large caps. He has his eye on U.S. defense stocks like Kratos, a manufacturer of military electronics and drones, anticipating that defense spending will be mostly spared from Trump’s threatened cuts to the federal budget. Another area of the market Helfert is bullish on is regional banks like Texas-based Cullen/Frost Bankers, which will benefit from decreased regulatory costs and more M&A activity and don’t have a large international presence. One of Trump’s tariff goals in addition to stemming drug trafficking is to pressure other American businesses to bring more manufacturing back to the U.S. and trade more with American peers, which will help smaller companies who already have most of their footprints close to home. Nicholas Galluccio, who manages the Teton Westwood Small-Cap Equity Fund, points out that companies comprising the Morningstar small-cap value index already generate 70% of their revenue domestically and are trading at a 20% discount to large caps, while historically they’ve fetched a premium. For investors more inclined to invest in passive index funds, the Vanguard Small-Cap Value Index Fund ETF (VBR) could be an appropriate option for shelter from a potential trade war. WHY IT MATTERS “The stock market cheered Donald Trump’s return to office, rising to new records after he was elected in hopes that his victory would signal a new era of business-friendly deregulation, but it might not be that simple,” says Forbes staff writer Hank Tucker. “Even economic experts who supported him downplayed his threats of tariffs during the campaign, but now that it turns out he was serious about some of those promises, the stock market could suffer. Regardless of how investors feel about his politics, it’s important to be thinking about which businesses will be more sheltered from trade restrictions with China if tensions continue to escalate and prices rise.” MORE Trump Says Looming Oil Tariffs Are Negotiable: ‘Depends On What Their Price Is’ Trump’s tariff proposals would cost middle-class U.S. households $1,700 in increased taxes each year, as projected by the nonpartisan think tank Peterson Institute for International Economics. So how do you prepare? Consumers can try shopping at discount or bulk retailers like Costco or Sam’s Club, and for groceries, consider your local farmer’s market, though increased demand could drive up those prices, too. If you’re a small business owner, it’s probably a good time to refresh research on your supply chain, taking tariffs into account when considering pricing.

But we must start by recognizing that returning to Ukraine’s pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective. Chasing this illusionary goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering." -snip- "A durable peace for Ukraine must include robust security guarantees to ensure that the war will not begin again," Hegseth said Wednesday. "The United States does not believe that NATO membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement. Instead, any security guarantee must be backed by capable European and non-European troops." "If these troops are deployed as peacekeepers to Ukraine at any point, they should be deployed as part of a non-NATO mission and not covered under Article 5. There also must be robust international oversight of the line of contact," he continued. "To be clear, as part of any security guarantee, there will not be U.S. troops deployed to Ukraine." -snip- Hegseth also said he is in Brussels today to "directly and unambiguously express that stark strategic realities prevent the United States from being primarily focused on the security of Europe." "The United States faces consequential threats to our homeland. We must -- and we are -- focusing on securing our own borders," he said. "We also face a peer competitor in China with the capability and intent to threaten our homeland and core national interests in the Indo-Pacific." (Excerpt) Read more at foxnews.com ...

Title: Blackrock CEO Larry Fink Gave His 'Diagnosis' Of Retirement Crisis: Rely On Social Security Alone And 'You're Going To Be Living In Poverty'

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink isn't sugarcoating the problem: retirement in America is broken. In a March 2024 interview with Bloomberg, David Westin got straight to the point, asking Fink for his take on the crisis: "Give us your diagnosis of that problem." Fink clarified that millions of Americans aren't financially prepared for their later years. "We have still 57 million Americans who don't have any savings or any retirement plan," he stated. And if those people think Social Security alone will carry them through, Fink had a blunt reality check: "If that's all you have when you retire, you're going to be living in poverty, below the poverty line." Don't Miss: Many don’t know there are tax benefits when buying a unit as an investment — Here’s how to invest in real estate by mirroring BlackRock's big move Many are using retirement income calculators to check if they’re on pace — here’s a breakdown on what’s behind this formula. Fink's wake-up call wasn't just theoretical. In his 2024 annual letter to shareholders, he reflected on his experience handling his parents' finances after his mother passed away. He was surprised at how much they had saved despite their modest income, a stark contrast to the dire state many retirees find themselves in today. According to Fink, the crux of the issue is that the entire retirement system is outdated. "Most Americans retired between 60 and 62 then, but most Americans passed away at 67," he explained. "Today, statistically, a couple 60 years old in good health – one of them is going to live over 90." With people living decades longer, retirement savings must stretch further, yet most aren't prepared. Advances in medicine compound this longevity crisis. "The miracles of technology ... are extending life," Fink said, referencing breakthroughs in treatments for heart disease, kidney disease and even dementia. But while medicine is evolving, financial planning isn't keeping up. "There is not a dialogue in America ... about can we afford that longevity?" Trending: Can you guess how many Americans successfully retire with $1,000,000 saved? The percentage may shock you. Fink believes fixing retirement requires two things: conversation and action. "We solve problems through conversation," he said. But when it comes to retirement, "we have no conversation." He stressed the need for a global – and national – dialogue to reevaluate retirement age, savings strategies and investment approaches. One potential fix? Using capital markets to boost retirement savings. Fink pointed to Japan, where a recent policy change doubled the amount of tax-deductible retirement contributions. The result? A 30% surge in the Japanese stock market, driven by long-term investment. "Not only does it give financial returns for those who are retiring and saving for retirement, but it's a big foundation for domestic companies," he explained. With Social Security on shaky ground, Fink suggested a controversial idea: investing the Social Security trust fund in long-term assets. "Right now in Congress, a number of senators and congressmen are talking about rehabilitating our Social Security pool and maybe contributing a big block of money into it," he noted. The U.S. system, he said, is a "pay-as-you-go" model, unlike countries such as Australia, where retirement funds are structured differently to ensure sustainability. See Also: Inspired by Uber and Airbnb – Deloitte's fastest-growing software company is transforming 7 billion smartphones into income-generating assets – with $1,000 you can invest at just $0.26/share! As a baby boomer himself, Fink acknowledged that his generation has benefited from economic prosperity, but he questioned whether they've done enough to secure a stable future for younger generations. "We were born at a great economic moment," he said. "We all have a responsibility to try to recreate that environment for our grandchildren." His message was clear: Americans need to save more, invest smarter and rethink their approach to retirement. Because as Fink put it, "We need to have a conversation." That conversation shouldn't just be national – it should also be personal. With people living longer and the retirement landscape shifting, now is the time to consult a financial advisor to ensure you're on track. Whether adjusting your investment strategy, maximizing your savings or finding ways to generate income in retirement, getting professional guidance can help you retire on your terms – without relying solely on Social Security.

Title: The Bidenomics Atrocity: 7 Migrant Jobs for Each American Job
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/immigration/2025/02/12/bidenomics-final-score-7-jobs-for-migrants-for-each-american-job/
Time Published: 2025-02-12T12:05:21Z
Full Content:
The results are in: The Democratic Party’s Bidenomics strategy produced a disastrous score of just 160,000 extra jobs for Americans during each year of President Joe Biden’s presidency. President Joe Biden’s dismal Bidenomics also created jobs for 4.7 million migrants — including almost three million illegals, according to federal data collected by the Center for Immigration Studies and reported on February 7. So Bidenomics created 7.3 migrant jobs for every job gained by an American, even as it also exploded the national debt by $8 trillion. Bidenomics also flatlined wages, spiked housing costs, and slowed workplace investment. The Bidenomics 7:1 policy — 4.7 million jobs for migrants, 645,000 for Americans — was deliberate. Bidenomics deliberately stranded millions of working-age Americans outside the workforce, without jobs or prospects, often homeless and on drugs, and usually dependent on expensive government aid. “The share of working-age (16 to 64) U.S.-born men not in the labor force — neither working nor looking for work — is likely 22.1 percent in January 2025 and remains near a historic high for an economic expansion,” the Center for Immigration Studies reported February 7. The 22 percent — one in five! — is far above the 16.6 percent seen in January 2000. If Biden and Congress had cared, roughly 5 million working-age American men could have been found, trained to use work-multiplying machinery, de-toxified, put back on their feet, and hired into starter jobs. But Biden’s deputies repeatedly showed that they favored importing more migrants than the once-normal option of helping millions of ordinary Americans get ready for high-productivity jobs. “As our economy grows, we need workers that we just don’t have enough of,” Katie Tobin, the senior director for transborder security on the National Security Council, told a D.C. audience in May 2023. “So it is in our interest to bring people in and to stay competitive globally.” “We look to the north, with Canada,” migration czar Alejandro Mayorkas told a Texas audience in September: Canada takes a look at its market needs, and it says, “You know what? We need 700,000 foreign workers to address our labor needs domestically.” And, so, they build a visa system for that year to address the current market condition. And they say, “We’re going to bring in a million people.” And it’s market sensitive. We [in the United States] are dealing with numerical caps on labor-driven visas that were set in 1996. It’s 2024. The world has changed. It is remarkable how there can be [elite] agreement that [the visas system] is broken and not have an agreement on a solution. The country is suffering as a result of it. During their four years, Buden’s deputies replaced those Americans with a flood of roughly 9 million southern migrants, roughly three million legal airport migrants, and roughly 4 million temporary migrants. Those airport arrivals included roughly 1.5 million white-collar workers carrying H-1B, J-1, L-1, and OPT/EAD visa documents that allow them to take jobs from American college graduates. That huge inflow displaced many Americans from jobs, cities, and the workforce. The displacement was so massive that the share of Americans who held jobs arguably declined during Biden’s years. In a chart posted by Harvard economist Jason Furman, the other countries that did badly on that measure were the migration-flooded United Kingdom, Canada, and Germany. Mayorkas, Tobin, and Biden’s other deputies had several reasons to prefer inviting migrants over helping their fellow Americans. First, migration is a rapid way to expand the national pool of consumers, workers, and renters before the next election. Migration means there is no need to wait 25 years for Americans to marry, raise their kids, and get them into jobs. Their get-rich-quick policy worked; The inflow of migrants quickly expanded the economy, creating a rush of extra profits and new stock values for investors — even as the rush of migrants pushed down wages and pushed up housing costs for ordinary Americans. RELATED — White House Despairs: ‘Pollsters Are Not Asking the Right Questions’ About Biden’s Economic Policies Second, the rush of migrants held down the wage-driven inflation once the gusher of Biden spending spilled into pay packets and weekly wages. That was good for the White House’s friends on Wall Street. For example, Goldman Sachs celebrated the inflow of wage-cutting migrants because it would reduce inflation. Third, Biden’s deputies favored more migration because it reduced the pressure on employers to divert their profits and stock values toward greater workplace productivity. Normally, productivity improvements — such as better-skilled workers, swifter robots, and subtle software — are very desirable because they generate both extra profits for CEOs and higher wages for workers. However, productivity improvements are expensive, so they reduce near-term quarterly profits, stock values, and executive bonuses. This means that most investors are loath to invest in productivity — especially because the government has deliberately helped them by extracting millions of workers and consumers from poor countries since 1990. The results of this cheap labor vs productivity trade-off can be tracked over a few years. For example, the loss of migrant labor during Trump’s first-term crackdown and the coronavirus disease “spurred approximately an additional $55 billion in investment in the U.S. economy,” the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Loius reported in June 2024. But the investment fell — and so did productivity gains — once Biden’s deputies flooded the labor market with cheap migrant workers. Basically, Biden’s team stuffed the economy with more federal dollars, unproductive workers, consumers, and renters — and the stock market zoomed to record levels. MorningStar.com reported: The 46th president of the United States is bringing his time at the White House to a close with the S&P 500 SPX up over 55% since he took office on Jan. 20, 2021. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA advanced more than 39% over the same period, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP jumped nearly 46%, according to Dow Jones Market Data. But there was a flaw. The migrant workers also need to sleep and eat, and so they fuelled rent, housing, and food inflation far more than Biden’s deputies expected. “On net [after inflation], real wages have fallen since January 2021.” former White House economist Furman wrote in a February 10 article for Foreign Affairs. Once inflation ate into wages, ordinary Americans averaged a wage gain of less than half a percent during Biden’s four years. Furman’s economic analysis is titled “The Post-Neoliberal Delusion And the Tragedy of Bidenomics.” The analysis is echoed by one of Elon Musk’s investor friends, Chamath Palihapitiya. He is an immigrant from Sri Lanka who founded Social Capital, which seeks to make money from the health, financial services, and education sectors. Ironically, Trump and his GOP deputies gained many new jobs in January 2025 when the understandably angry voters defenestrated Biden and his deputies in November. Despite the obvious damage and chaos, the establishment’s media is still hiding the Biden/Mayorkas economic disaster from citizens, mostly by posting sympathetic stories urging Americans to empathize with unlucky but hard-working migrants. On February 4, the Washington Post reported on two imported workers who Mayorkas “paroled” into U.S. jobs to reduce the pressure on U.S. employers to raise wages: Among them were a 25-year-old man from the Boston area who asked that his name not be used, because he, his wife and their 3-year-old daughter fear losing their temporary protection and being deported to Venezuela. He said they fled extreme poverty and fear under the authoritarian regime of Nicolás Maduro in 2023, and trekked for three months through a hazardous jungle and north into Mexico in order to reach the U.S. border. In Venezuela, he worked as a construction worker for $30 a week, unable to pay for basics such as milk. In Massachusetts, he earns $180 a day working on a demolition crew and moonlights cleaning at a hotel. His wife also has a job cleaning at a hotel. He said Trump is wrongly portraying Venezuelans as criminals. “We came to this country to work,” he said. For the moment, President Donald Trump is helping to fix the mess by blocking the arrival of Mayorkas’ illegal and quasi-legal migrants. He is also helping by deporting perhaps 1,000 migrants a day, starting with criminals and migrants who have lost their legal appeals to stay. Predictably, establishment media outlets worry that Trump’s shutdown of the Mayorkas migration might raise wages for ordinary Americans. For example, Politico.com reported on February 7 that “a broad-based crackdown on immigrants could slow the economy’s expansion and choke off a supply of workers that Kansas City Fed researchers and others say have alleviated staffing shortages and eased wage pressures [emphasis added].” Rationally, business lobbyists are now working to ensure Mayorkas’ roughly 9 million illegals can stay — and to ensure the continued inflow of more migrants and visa workers. On February 10, BusinessInsider.com reported that a “Make America Wealthy Again” [MAWA] lobbying campaign seeks to persuade Trump to keep most migrants: “Trump as a businessman understands that if he doesn’t have 200 guys cutting the grass at his golf courses, then they don’t look right, and people won’t want to play golf there,” says Cristina Antelo, the founding principal at Ferox Strategies, a lobbying firm that counts the National Retail Federation, Walmart, and the tobacco giant Reynolds America among its clients. “There’s a way to get to Trump and make him realize that. How many businesses does he need to hear from before he’s like, ‘Crap, I really am going to paralyze the entire US labor market if I do this’?” The MAWA plan is to apply pressure on business allies in Trump’s inner circle, rather than on the president directly, and to steer clear of Stephen Miller, the administration’s most outspoken anti-immigration hard-liner. “Stephen Miller won’t ever be convinced. Forget that,” says a lobbyist from a prominent trade association. “But Trump can be convinced not to screw over fellow businesspeople. Miller isn’t the only dude who has Trump’s ear.” … In addition, lobbyists have already begun reaching out to members of Congress and their staffs — both on Capitol Hill and in their districts back home — via phone, Zoom, and in-person meetings. Several lobbyists describe a campaign of “shock and awe,” one that will seek to apply “1,000 points of pressure” to GOP members of Congress who understand that immigrants are willing to take low-paying, high-risk jobs that are shunned by most Americans. Among those being targeted is Rep. Glenn Thompson of Pennsylvania, who chairs the House Agriculture Committee. Trump’s voters backed him because he seemed to promise he would Make Americans Great Again — not just America. If he resists pro-migration pressure from businesses, he may show Americans how a low-migration policy of “tight labor” can create greater productivity, higher wages, more trade, more innovation, and a stronger economy, as Blackrock CEO Larry Fink argues. But Trump is zig-zagging under lobbying pressure from people such as Elon Musk. On Sunday, February 9, for example, Trump again touted a misleading article that defended the H-1B visa program which has been used since 1990 to push millions of American graduates — and their families — out of good careers. The Wall Street Journal article echoed Mayorkas as claimed “U.S. companies find it crucial … And [because] one way to reduce illegal immigration is to allow more legal pathways to meet the needs of the U.S. economy.” Trump has yet to issue a formal policy statement on the increasingly unpopular inflow of white-collar visa workers. But he may be forced to show his cards this week at his White House meeting with India’s Prime Minister. Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting. Copyright © 2025 Breitbart

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Tesla's (TSLA) stock has known only one direction in February: reverse. Shares of the Elon Musk-led EV maker dropped another 2% to $321 each in pre-market trading on Wednesday, continuing an eye-opening slide from their recent 52-week high. At its current pre-market price, Tesla's stock is down 33% since hitting a record high on Dec. 18, 2024, weeks after the Election Day win for President Donald Trump — who was heavily backed by Musk. The stock is the worst-performing member of the closely watched "Magnificent Seven" group of tech megacaps: Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Apple (AAPL). Musk's net worth — which is closely connected to the fortunes of Tesla — has plunged $54 billion year to date, according to Bloomberg data. He is still the richest person in the world with a net worth of $378 billion "The bears are owning the narrative," Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told me. And the bears have a lot to feast on regarding Tesla at the moment. For starters, numbers on Tesla sales in important overseas markets have come in soft to kick off the year. The readings have triggered some concerns in Tesla circles that Musk's close proximity to Trump is damaging its brand. Tesla sold 63,238 vehicles in China in January, according to data released this week by the China Passenger Car Association. The figure marked a steep 33% drop from December. At the same time, Australia's Electric Vehicle Council reported that Tesla's overall sales fell 33% year over year in January. "We're cautious on what's happening for the EV maker," Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch said on Yahoo Finance's Market Domination. Meanwhile, fresh tariffs from the Trump administration stand to raise costs for Tesla and other automakers. On Monday, the president signed two executive orders imposing additional 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum. Both steel and aluminum are key raw materials used by Tesla. Trump's new trade war with China doesn't help either — a 2023 study by Nikkei found that 40% of the suppliers for materials used in Tesla's batteries are Chinese companies. "Changes in government and economic policies, incentives or tariffs may also impact our production, sales, cost structure and the competitive landscape," Tesla pointed out in its latest 10-K filing. And last, Tesla's fourth quarter left a lot to be desired. The company's EPS missed analyst estimates by a penny. Automotive sales fell 8% year over year alongside price cuts across the Tesla vehicle lineup. Podcast: how Musk delivers on his biggest promises "There's a bit of a disconnect, in our view, between what's happening fundamentally and what's happening from a sentiment perspective," Rusch said. The Oppenheimer analyst is also concerned that even with the sell-off in the stock, Tesla remains overvalued. Yahoo Finance data shows Tesla shares are valued at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 111 times. The forward PE ratio for the S&P 500 is about 22 times. Auto rivals Ford (F) and GM (GM) are valued at PE multiples of 6 times and 4 times, respectively. Rusch thinks Tesla's valuation will be "a little bit challenged" in the coming years, unless the company can "deliver on a number of promises" it has made to investors such as robotaxis and humanoids.

Title: How Do Young Men See the World? We Asked Them.
URL: https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a63613007/young-men-america-2025/
Time Published: 2025-02-12T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
Everyone else agrees they’re struggling. But how do men themselves feel about it? We sat down with twelve everyday guys from across America to get their candid opinions—on money, masculinity, Donald Trump—and find out what’s really on their minds. What exactly is going on in the minds of young men? It’s a question that society keeps coming back to these days because, truth is, we’re worried. Everything we’re told about the rising generation of men in America—everything they’re told about themselves, in the media, the academic research, the employment data, the mental-health studies—is about how royally screwed they are. And that has consequences for all of us. You’ve read the headlines. Young men today are angry. They’re lonely and friendless. The data shows that they are falling behind young women in school and at the workplace, living with their parents longer, playing too many video games, watching too much porn, getting married much later in life (or not at all), having fewer kids (or none at all), and facing a lifetime of student-loan debt, credit-card debt, and medical debt. As a result, many of them are adopting increasingly extreme beliefs, getting hooked on opioids, and killing themselves at alarming rates. They feel ignored by politicians, blamed for society’s ills, and forced to keep their toxic, privileged, microaggressive mouths shut about it. But what no one can seem to agree on is why. Is social media to blame? There’s no doubt that growing up in the age of the smartphone has profoundly shaped the lives (and brains) of anyone under twenty-five, and most of the rest of us, too. But that applies to young women as well, and they don’t seem to be drifting as badly as men are. Rather than add our voice to the chorus of speculation about what guys are thinking and feeling about the world, we had a radical idea: Let’s just ask them. Not all of them, of course. There are nearly 16 million men in the U. S. between the ages of eighteen and twenty-four. We weren’t looking to conduct yet another survey. Instead, we wanted to have long conversations with a relatively small group about what it’s like to be a young man in America right now. Our first step was to seek out regular, everyday guys. No influencers or celebrities or lunatics. Just guys like the ones we all know. Guys with so many of their big life decisions still ahead of them. In the end, we settled on twelve men from different parts of the country representing a wide range of backgrounds and experiences. We asked them to submit portrait photos of themselves, and most of them did. As you’ll see, they reflect much of the frustration and alienation we expected—but not always in the ways we anticipated. They were thoughtful and candid. They surprised us. If there was one subject that came up again and again, it was Donald Trump. Timing had a lot to do with it. Our conversations followed Trump’s reelection in November, a victory powered in part by young male voters. Men between the ages of eighteen and twenty-nine voted for Trump over Kamala Harris by a margin of 56–42, a dramatic reversal of 2020, when they voted for Biden over Trump by a 56–41 margin. For the young men we spoke with—guys who’ve come of age in the MAGA era—talking about Trump was often shorthand for discussing class, race, masculinity, and the big subjects that were really on their minds. Here’s what they had to say, in their own words. I noticed the shift in people of color moving conservative a year, maybe a year and a half in advance. I remember a conversation with my mom about seven months before the election—we were in the swimming pool, and she was like, “Oh, this election, I’m not sure what’s going to happen.” And I told her, “Trump has already won the election. I know for a fact.” Because he’d stolen the support of people of color from the Democrats, especially men. You could just see it. The first thing I noticed was how conservative so many young Hispanic men were—it is mind-­boggling to me how conservative. My girlfriend is half Latino, and she kept telling me, “Aidan, Latino men are more conservative than people think.” This notion that Latinos always support Democrats—it’s very false. I was also noticing in my community, a bunch of Asian American men, they were thinking the same way. They were starting to talk out loud about supporting Trump. The first thing was the LGBTQ community normalizing the idea that you can have a bunch of genders, you can have whatever pronouns you want, and that you can introduce that to very young children. And then with Asian men, the Harvard case that overturned affirmative action a few years ago—remember, the people who filed the lawsuit were not white. They were Chinese. They were like, Wait, affirmative action discriminates against us. That’s when the Chinese vote started to go. And then I did not realize this, but my girlfriend’s also Vietnamese, and she was telling me that most Vietnamese people are conservative. So guess what? Now Trump’s got the Vietnamese support. And obviously his white male support is only growing. So in my head I’m like, How is Biden going to win this election? He’s lost half the people of color to Trump. To me, it’s not necessarily that men were drawn to Trump—it’s men pulling away from Democrats. That’s one key thing I really want to say. I think this shift happened not necessarily because of anything Trump was doing. It’s because of what the Democrats did. They decided to let in all this pronoun stuff and this whole idea of censoring young men and emasculating them. And then with people of color, like me, they seem to assume, like, Of course you’re going to vote for us. We’re your allies. We’re going to help you. The Republicans aren’t going to do anything for you. But then the Democrats get in power in 2020, and people of color are kind of waiting, like, Okay, so . . . what are you going to do for us? And then you look at the end and the Black community is still in the same position. Asian Americans are now getting discriminated against in educational systems, and you’re losing Latinos because of this LGBTQ stuff that’s relevant to literally 1 percent of the population and you’re trying to kind of force it on everyone else. I dropped out of community college because I got a job as a butler at the Venetian casino and I was making good money, so I put everything else on the back burner. What a butler does is, from the moment the whales and high-end guests arrive, we greet them, we grab their things, we bring them their food, we do everything they need—personalized and intimate service. The tips can get pretty big. I got $750 once. I know a guy who once got $5,000. But that job didn’t work out. There was an issue where I accepted a tip—for one dollar—and I forgot to write it down on my log at the end of the day. The next day I had to go out of town, and by the time I came back, HR was already involved. Every square inch of that building is monitored. When they saw on my log that I didn’t have anything tipped in, one of the other coworkers was like, “No, no—I was right there when he accepted his tip.” He ratted me out. They went back into the footage and I got fired. I was very, very upset. I was ready to settle down and get really good at that job. I like learning new things, and it was this world of whiskeys and wine and fine dining—all this luxurious stuff that I’d never been exposed to. I grew up lower middle class, so it was an entirely new world. That was the best part about coming into work every day—something new to learn, a new problem to solve. And then all of a sudden I was back at my job at Domino’s. Being a butler definitely jaded me. Look, I feel like successful people should be able to appreciate the fruits of their labor. That doesn’t bother me. And a lot of rich people aren’t insanely rich—they’re millionaires, not billionaires. They’re normal people when it comes down to it. But when you start dealing with old-money people—how they treat the people around them and the people under them—it opens your eyes. I would overhear conversations around a poker table where executives are talking like, “Well, if we get rid of this department here and we lay off six hundred people here, we can put that money here.” Meanwhile they’re playing poker with $100,000 a hand. The most insane thing I can remember was buying suitcases for a guest because they bought all these bottles of liquor from us and they needed something to take them home in. Two suitcases full of approximately $300,000 worth of wine and liquor. It’s the frivolousness that’s the breaking point for me—the way they can spend all that money and have no repercussions, but those repercussions spread to us, lower down. It’s fucking bullshit. I have friends going hungry, not because they don’t want to work but because they’re not given enough hours to be full-time and get health insurance. Five years ago, if you had a job that paid fifteen to twenty dollars an hour, you were set. And now it doesn’t feel like that anymore. Your dollar just doesn’t go as far. Real estate has doubled here in Vegas. The eleven-hundred-square-foot apartment that I rented with my girlfriend in 2018 for $1,100—I looked a few weeks ago, and now it’s going for $1,950. It’s so hard to build savings right now. I spent years building up enough for a down payment on a house, and I’d just gotten to the point where I could feasibly do it, and then I needed to pay for a car repair earlier this year and a lot of that money went away. You learn to live with this fear and paranoia, like, What if I shatter my leg and I can’t work? What would I do? I am not a fan of Donald Trump—I’d say I lean very left—but at the end of the day, he understands that Americans are angry and upset, and he’s really good at channeling that. As Americans, we’re all feeling the same pressures, we all see prices are rising, we’re all making less money. We all notice it. But the Republicans are a lot more ready to say, “This is the reason. It’s that guy. This is who you should be mad at.” The bigger split in America for me is not left or right. It’s class—it’s whether you’re bourgeois or you’re proletariat. It comes down to whether you make enough money to be in their special club. There’s this pastor I like to listen to named Voddie Baucham, and he talks about how men think the definition of manhood is the Three B’s: the billfold, the ball field, and the bedroom. Like, it’s all about how much money you make, how well you perform at sports, and how many girls you can get with in the bedroom. And I think that’s . . . not totally wrong? I mean they are signs. If you can perform on the ball field, that shows power and strength and your ability to protect yourself, which is important. If you’re making money, that doesn’t automatically mean you’re competent, but it shows signs of competency. And then bedroom—I don’t know, that one doesn’t make as much sense. But his point was that the Three B’s are how the culture is defining manhood today, and the correct way is how the Bible defines it, which is all about love and family and sacrifice. My friends say I’m a based Christian guy—“based” like based in truth, someone who’s more realistic and objective. I appreciate the objective truth of conservatism, but I also understand the compassion of liberals. Overall, I’d say I’m like 60 percent conservative, 40 percent liberal. Maybe 70–30. And Christianity is a really good guide for being conservative, because there’s this objective eternal being at the center of it who’s been unchanged the whole time. And I do believe some things are just objectively true, like: I am a man. It doesn’t really matter if someone wants to be called a man—that doesn’t change what you are. Sorry, that’s it. You weren’t assigned it by a doctor. You were assigned it by God. And going against that is rebellion. If God’s making these rules, it’s not because He wants to be a cosmic killjoy. If I’m going to trust anyone about the world, I would trust the person who made it. It’s like going against the video game developer’s ideas for how to play the video game. You’re just going to lose. For thousands of years, men have been the rock of society. And now because there have been so many tyrannical leaders, people want to take that power away from men and say it’s for everybody. Just because some men did it the wrong way. Like, it’s kind of unfair to men to say, “We don’t need you anymore because of how well you did at building a society.” And I’m like, “Well, we kind of built this country and fought and died for it . . .” I didn’t vote, because I didn’t feel like going through the process, and I didn’t see the point, because Biden was going to win California, even though it was way closer than I thought. But if someone had put a gun in my head and told me to vote, I would’ve voted for Trump. I think minority guys are tired of feeling like they are expected to vote a certain way just because of their color. Even Obama, who basically shamed Black guys for not voting for Kamala—I don’t owe you anything. I don’t owe this party nothing. I’m not going to get reprimanded by you when I’m an autonomous man who can make decisions for myself. I don’t need you to browbeat me like I’m your son. Sometimes I think we’re like an anti-welfare state. We’re not really into helping people in this country. I just feel like we live in a very individualistic society, and so it’s all about “How do you stand out as an individual? How do you make yourself stand out from the pack?” You can even see this with car culture in our country—young men always want to buy the most massive truck and drive around in it. I live outside Denver in a town called Golden, and the Colorado School of Mines, which is a big petroleum and gas college, is here in Golden. So a lot of guys come out here from Texas and they drive these giant lifted pickup trucks—these massive old F-150’s that’ve been jacked up so there’s like three feet of separation between the wheels and the body. I grew up with a lot of these guys in Bozeman, Montana—cowboy-type dudes. That’s manhood out here in the western states: Every man wants to be a cowboy. They want to buy cowboy boots and the cowboy hat and drive an old pickup truck, or the new pickup truck if they’re wealthy. And they vote for Republicans. I didn’t really like those guys. I grew up with two sisters, so I guess I’ve always been more comfortable around women. If you’re not overconfident, it’s really hard to get ahead in this country. You really have to act like you know what you’re talking about all the time. And that’s definitely not something that I was doing in the past. I hate talking about myself, promoting myself. But when I decided to go to grad school, I just kind of made up my mind that I was going to start. I made this separation in my brain between my home life and my work life—at work, I was going to be this alternative person who was really competitive and confident all the time and could talk about himself very easily. And as soon as I made that switch, people were a lot more attracted to me. I’m getting treated better by this country, by our systems, our culture. That’s how America works. People in this country love confident people who seem like they’re smart, who seem to know what they’re talking about, even if they don’t. And Donald Trump is the embodiment of the confident man who doesn’t know what he’s talking about. He’s like: Take what you want, grab it, it’s yours—everyone else is telling you you’re not supposed to be this way, but you’re allowed to be this way because I’m this way. He’s kind of a reaction to all the beta cucks out there—men like me, I guess. But I don’t think that it’s just my generation of men that’s angry. I think it’s all of them. It’s the emotion that men are taught. It’s the one that we get. It’s not manly to feel all the other ones. But anger is for sure. My generation—I don’t think we have very much power, so maybe that’s part of our anger. Our lives are being dictated by people who are decades and decades older than us, and they just don’t get it. They just don’t understand that the world has changed, that you can’t buy a house for three lucky magic beans anymore. I feel like our generation is just waiting for our moment to take up our power, but I don’t know if we’re ever going to get there, because it seems like these boomers are trying to hang on forever. I see it in my work, too—anytime you go to a public hearing or a city-­council meeting, they dominate those meetings, because they have time and resources to show up. They’re really dictating our future even though it’s not going to affect them. And that’s really frustrating. It’s like they were raised in a time of bounty and we don’t get a slice of the pie. They have the entire pie. I was born in Nicaragua and immigrated with my parents to the United States when I was really young. We lived in Miami for a few years, then in 2004 we moved to El Paso, Texas, and that’s where I grew up. Now I teach at an all-boys Catholic private school in California, and my kids are juniors—the age where they think they know everything and can get away with anything. Before the election this past November, some of them were asking me political things, like, “Yo, Mr. O”—that’s what they call me, Mr. O—“what do you think of Trump?” And I’d always say, “That’s not your business.” I’d tell them that the faculty handbook says I have to be nonpartisan. And one of them said, “But we need to know! Please don’t tell me you voted for Kamala!” And this was actually a Black student, by the way. Not that just because you’re Black, you should be voting for Kamala—it was just a little more unexpected. I come to find out that a lot of my students, and I mean a lot of them, are very conservative. Our school is very, very sports heavy. Our academics are amazing, don’t get me wrong—but sports are where it shines. Out of about 1,100 total students, maybe 900 are student athletes, and of course football is king. There was even a movie about our team that came out like a decade ago. I’ve been there three years now, but when I first started, I was this five-foot-eight, soft-spoken Hispanic teacher, and I’m teaching all these sixteen- and seventeen-year-olds who were six-foot-five, these enormous—like, what are they putting in the water here? Think of a hobbit in the Shire—that’s me, and everyone else is the elves. My first year, especially, was really hard because they could get very disrespectful. I had students yell at me, berate me just for asking them to put their phones away. It’s like, “Why am I being abused right now?” They wouldn’t necessarily make it obvious that it was because they think I’m less of a man or because I’m smaller. But I could tell it didn’t help. For a lot of these kids, their norm was coaches who would yell at them, which is not how I roll. There were days when I broke down in front of the students. I just couldn’t handle it anymore. It was like they were experimenting with dominance. And I mention all this because I think they really want that dominance to continue. I think they like getting away with talking very, very confidently. And I think they see Trump talking what I think is nonsense, but they’re like, “Oh, wow—he gets away with saying that!” And so they want to emulate that. They want that power. There was this friend group in my class that year—all of them were athletes for different sports, and they actually ended up becoming one of my favorite groups of students. The next year, they told me I was their favorite teacher. Even the ones who gave me a lot of issues said that. And I was like, “Wow, thank you—but if I’m your favorite teacher, why did you behave like this to me? Are you only going to follow the people who berate you? Are those the only people you’re going to respect? Because that’s kind of a crappy way to live, no?” And they said it was because my class was the only break they got from hard teachers and hard coaches. It was like a period of peace. They’d spend the rest of the day getting taught that weakness must be stamped out and eradicated. And then they meet me and I flip the whole thing on its head. Sometimes I do think to myself, Why am I like this? I’m not going to get anywhere being like this. I do get resentful sometimes. I’m not going to lie. I do feel—not marginalized, but I feel like when people think of men or masculinity, I’m not the image that comes to their head. I’ve always felt that way. At the same time, so many people, whether it be my classmates, my friends, my relatives, my students, my coworkers, everyone has said, “Jacinto, you’re one of the kindest people I’ve ever met—please don’t ever, ever change.” And it’s like, “Okay, see? So we do celebrate this other side of the coin. Sometimes.” When the election happened, I was so blindsided and distraught that for a month or so I just kind of turned that whole part of my brain off. I guess I live in a bubble, right? I go to NYU—a very liberal school, very performatively progressive, though I think the key word there is performative. But needless to say, I don’t have anybody close to me who voted for Trump or even considered voting for him. I guess that’s why I really thought Kamala was going to win. I wasn’t even that worried, because in my mind, I was like, We already went through four years of this douchebag. We know the type of person that he is. I just really thought that people were sick of him, regardless of where you are on the political spectrum. And then I was watching those numbers on election night, and that sinking feeling started, just like in 2016. I’m trying to make sense of it now. I’ve really tried to put myself in the mindset of just your average twenty-year-old Latino dude, because I know that’s where he gained a surprising advantage, and that shocked me the most. I guess a couple things jump out. Like, whether you like it or not, Trump does fall into that ultramasculine, ultra-fragile-ego archetype, and he disguises the fragility with machismo, with bravado, with boldness. Saying things with his chest. No matter how wrong he is, he carries this energy of absolute confidence. And I think that when you’re an impressionable young man, that’s appealing. It’s like, “I want to be a guy who’s not afraid to say whatever I want to say.” I’m the son of a Mexican immigrant who’s legal now—he has a green card—but for a while, he wasn’t. And I remember being a young kid in 2016 and hearing Trump say those things about Mexicans being rapists and criminals. And so obviously I’m like, That’s not who I am. That’s not who my father is. So in my mind, from a young age, there was an immediate fuck-you toward Trump. I identify with the immigrants from all these Latin American countries. I identify with that struggle. I see their pain. But not all Latino people, and especially not all Latino men, think that way. They feel like they’re citizens, they’re good, their family’s good. Whereas the people coming here now—they think they can just walk in, hand themselves over to border authorities, and then get shipped off to a sanctuary city without having to go through all of the pain that my family went through? That’s not fair. I definitely sense this sort of Democrat-­equals-good sentiment among my friends, but I very much do not identify with the Democratic Party. Seeing how people like Joe Biden were utterly indifferent to—actively in support of—Israel’s genocide, like, yes, on paper, at a glance, the Democratic Party has more of a progressive agenda, but in practice, do they? That was how I felt about Kamala, to be honest. Obviously I wasn’t going to vote for Trump—hell no, never—but I wasn’t a fan of Kamala, either. Her history, the fact that she was a prosecutor, that she put so many Black and brown people in jail—she kept showing she had no spine and no actual beliefs leading up to the election. I was debating who to vote for right up until I walked into that stall in the voting station—Harris or a third party. I voted for Kamala largely due to my mom, just how important her victory would’ve been for female reproductive rights and how catastrophic it would be if Trump won. And then he did. I need to make money and be self-­sufficient as soon as I can because my mom turns sixty next year, and if she’s still hustling and working her ass off at eighty, I’m going to feel like I failed. I’ve got to make sure that in some way, shape, or form, I can give back to my parents and start helping them out by the time I’m like thirty. That’s a big priority for me. And I don’t doubt that I’ll make money. I know I have skills, and it’s not like I’m just going to be sitting around. The doubt is about whether I can make enough to support my parents one day, to live an actually comfortable life, to have savings, a 401(k), a retirement plan. The doubt is about living a financially stable life as opposed to just living check to check or gig to gig. I will try my best, but I’m going to be honest, I know that the odds are not good. My generation is not in an optimal position. Honestly, it kind of feels like I was born too late. Like I missed out on something. It feels like I’m living in a generation where we’re cleaning up after someone else’s mess. I like to tell people I went to college undecided and I kind of came out the same way. I graduated in May of 2023. When I came home, I didn’t really know what I wanted to do. I moved back in with my parents, and that’s where I am now. My mom’s a school librarian, so she said, “Why don’t you try being a para-­educator?” And I said, “Well, I don’t have any other plans,” so now I help with third graders. It’s been a good year, and I’m grateful to have done it, but I don’t think I’d want to be a teacher. And being a para-educator is not a job where I’d be able to move out and afford rent and groceries and such. And you can’t really pay your bills with a philosophy degree. I play a lot of video games. This hat I’m wearing is from a game called Oblivion that came out in 2006. It’s like a fantasy role-playing kind of game. I’ve played several thousand hours throughout that series, and it’s like a lot of online spaces where you find young dudes—whether it’s video games or TV shows or Star Wars or sports or music or whatever. It’s not something you pick up on unless you’re in these spaces a lot. But take Star Wars: A lot of the top creators in those spaces are right-wing people talking about how some new Disney show is woke and bad, or how it’s forcing some lib agenda. Like, the most famous Star Wars YouTuber is a guy named Star Wars Theory, and most of his videos are just trashing all the new Star Wars shows for being DEI, whatever the term of the day is. In a lot of spaces that young men naturally gravitate toward, there’s already kind of a pipeline built, a feeling or environment of “This thing I like is under attack.” I don’t know who said it, but there’s a quote that sticks with me: “When you’re accustomed to privilege, equality looks like an attack.” A lot of reactionary sentiment is built on nostalgia. And the Right in America has realized that you can weaponize that natural disenchantment with the world and spin it as: Something that you like is being attacked by the Left. And to me, it’s a uniquely right-wing phenomenon—the ability to infiltrate any space and be able to steer people toward that intellectual viewpoint. Once I noticed it, it was hard not to be aware of it. Whereas I think the Left, broadly speaking, does not have anything remotely equivalent. It’s the same tenor in these manosphere communities about women. I’ve only really had one serious relationship—a long story, but it didn’t work out. I’m not a big fan of the whole manosphere and red pill and all that stuff, but there were definitely times when I’d find myself scrolling on my phone, and I’d come across videos, obviously framed to show how women are bad, and I wouldn’t agree with them, but I could kind of say, at least for a little while, “Yeah, that’s how it feels.” It’s just a lot easier to feel like you’re the victim of some wrongdoing. And if you’re a young man who suffers some sort of ego injury, that online ecosystem is very easy to plug yourself into. That pipeline is ready and waiting. I want to be champion, bro. My life is very difficult right now, and I do that to myself. I have to make it. It’s not about plan B. It’s not about plan C, bro. This isn’t like wrestling or football where there’s scholarships to college. If you don’t make it in MMA, you’re back to square one. That’s kind of the thrill of it, too, if I’m being honest. I had a really tough upbringing, and it turned me into kind of a sad person. My dad’s from Cape Town in South Africa. I had neighbor kids who had all this cool shit, got to play video games for eight hours a day, or who lost a tooth and then the tooth fairy came and dropped a Nintendo DS under their pillow. I never had that stuff. We were living paycheck to paycheck. We couldn’t afford meat every day of the week. My father opened up this gym, but it didn’t make any money for eight years. So he worked another full-time job, and then he also fought a little bit. The gym’s super successful now, but it was tough, bro. Life’s tough. So Coeur d’Alene—I’m pretty sure they say it’s the fastest-growing city in the nation. I mean, it’s just crazy, bro. Like holy smoke. When my dad moved here for college, this was a one-stoplight town, and now it’s just a massive city. We get a ton of people from California who are like, “We don’t like our state anymore—it’s getting dangerous down there. So we’re going to go over to Idaho and change things.” Then they make it more like California. What they’re doing in the schools is just wrong. After Covid, the underclassmen just got progressively worse. Kids wearing weird stuff. Just really borderline satanic stuff. Weird colors. It’s gotten super free, in the wrong sense. Then after I graduated, they started doing the transgender bathroom stuff, so now they got a bathroom for them folks. So that is courtesy of the California people. I can’t name a Democrat in this gym right now. I can’t name a friend who’s a Democrat. I don’t know anybody who voted for Kamala, honestly—anybody that’s sober. Maybe some pothead buddies that aren’t really friends of mine. But the blue side is winning, dude. This younger generation—these kids are getting brainwashed into thinking blue. And blue is definitely not a righteous route. I mean, we still don’t have the full list of Epstein’s folks. A lot of these blue guys are just totally numb to the fact that there’s right ways and wrong ways to do things in life. They just don’t care. But common sense is coming back a little bit—that’s what I thought when Trump won. And I’m so thankful he won, because he says common-sense stuff, like building up the border wall. That sounds offensive, but it makes sense, because we all know where the drugs are coming from, and it’s not Canada. Also, I used to work in construction, so I see all these Hispanic folks that are working for nine or ten bucks an hour, and they’re doing double the work the Americans are doing, because they have to survive. Like, they actually are taking our jobs. They are. So I’m not a fan of immigration in that sense. The neighborhood where I grew up in Philadelphia—it wasn’t the worst, but it definitely wasn’t the best. My mother struggled through so much raising us. I learned from her that it’s okay to falter, but you can’t give up. I went to a horrible, underfunded public school. I wanted to be the first person in my family to graduate college, and I could see that my school wasn’t going to get me anywhere close. So I secretly applied to a private school that my mother didn’t know about. And they were so impressed that they reached out to me, gave me a tour, gave me a financial-aid package, and I started there my junior year. I went from a school that was like 98 percent Black to a predominantly white school—one of the best private schools in the country, where I got exposed to different opinions and learned how to challenge the current ideology that exists in any atmosphere. And that’s really guided me through my political transition to this day. A couple of years ago, like in 2020, 2021, I had blue hair. I was very far-left progressive. I protested for Black Lives Matter. I was 100 percent pro-choice. But the shift really began at this private school—all boys as well. In class we’d talk about things like the American Dream, and does it exist for African Americans? Everyone was saying the same thing: Systemic racism is the issue, and how horrible our country is. And just to be a contrarian, I said, “What if there are cultural or personal-responsibility issues that lead some people to fall short of their dreams? I went to a public school where I saw so many kids, the number-one obstacle in their lives wasn’t not having a father in their life—they just weren’t doing their homework.” The Black students at this private school, who were predominantly wealthy, found that offensive. They said, “You just got here, and you’re giving these white boys permission to think they’re right. You should just shut up.” They started a campaign of threatening me. If I sat next to them at lunch, they’d get up and walk away. I was completely iced out. I even got kicked out of the Black Student Union. They said, “If you come to another meeting, we’re going to have a problem.” And then all the slurs came. He’s an Uncle Tom. He’s just a Black mouth with white talking points. I’m very used to that now—if you call me those things, I don’t really care. But back then I felt like I was a horrible person, so I just bottled up all of my doubt. I basically had to neuter myself. One of the things I started to notice while I was arguing my leftist points to my conservative friends—like about getting vaccinated, supporting Trump—they would just ask me a lot of questions. They wouldn’t get mad at me. One of the conservatives I hated the most was Tucker Carlson, but I finally listened to one of his most controversial takes—about white replacement theory, and immigration—and I thought, “Look, I want to hate the guy, but I can’t really disagree with what he’s saying.” I’d been told for so long not to go look at these sources because they’re racist, they’re regressive, they’re harmful. And actually, it turns out I’m left wanting more. That’s when I did a full factory reset. I tried to relearn things from the ground up. When I look at most of the young men in my life, a lot of them are very sheepish about what they believe. They hold their beliefs to themselves. And conservatives have to talk in a certain way so they don’t alienate you, they don’t polarize, they don’t make it seem as if they’re trying to disrespect you. They’re always on the back burner trying to defend themselves. A few weeks ago in class, we had a group assignment, and this one girl in our group—I knew she was a feminist, I knew she was a control freak, and I knew she was going to sink our grade. But none of the guys in my group, including me, wanted to tell her no about anything. We didn’t want to speak over her. You could tell we were subconsciously teaming up to protect her from the idea that we were trying to mansplain to her, or that we were trying to hurt her feelings. And when I talk to older men who are in the corporate world, they do the same thing. We’re all holding ourselves back from our natural behavior. We’ve ceded so much power. Voting for Trump has made me more unyielding. I don’t necessarily care who I offend. I’m not doing it to harm you. I’m doing it because sometimes ideas have to offend people. They have to invoke some kind of passion. Out of all the hardest things someone can do in life, I think coming out of poverty is first. And then coming out of the progressive trap is probably second. This article appeared in the March 2025 issue of Esquiresubscribe I’m cisgender. I’m heterosexual. I’m not white, but I tick all the other categories that seem to form like the bad straw-man character on the Left, if you know what I mean. In these discourses you see on the Internet, on social media, you’ll have a lot of these left-wing influencers, these feminists just going on tirades against men—like, men are responsible for this, men are responsible for that, yada, yada, yada. Part of the reason why we’re experiencing a loneliness epidemic and we have all these crazy influencers like Andrew Tate out there is because we as a society, I think, have told men that they’re not valued and that whatever natural traits they exhibit are written off as toxic masculinity. We’re told to express ourselves, be vulnerable—but then the moment we are vulnerable, we’re still judged. Like, “Why are you that vulnerable?” Or if you grew up in a really tough, traditional, machismo family, you’re told the exact opposite: Keep everything in. So you either keep everything in and let that balloon grow and grow until one day it pops, or you try to let some of it out, get judged, and then never do it again. I’m not one of those manosphere guys or anything like that, but for a long time I did feel like, as a guy, I was kind of being sidelined. There was a time in my life when I considered myself pretty liberal, but then just the way I’d get shut down if I had a viewpoint that was maybe a little different—like, on abortion, there was a time in high school when I genuinely didn’t know what abortion was because my Indian parents never talked about it. I learned about it in school when Roe v. Wade got overturned. This one girl who I grew up with, I asked her, “Oh, what’s abortion? I don’t know what that is.” And she was like, “It’s when a pregnancy gets terminated.” And I was like, “What do you mean terminated? The baby dies?” And she was like, “Yeah, basically.” And I was like, “Well, isn’t that murder? Why would someone want to do that?” And she got super mad at me. She actually threatened to hit me. I’m a child of immigrants, but you seem to get more benefits as an illegal migrant than if you’re a citizen here. They get housed in hotels, they get debit cards, and yet there’s so many veterans on the streets who don’t get any of it. Last summer I applied for this internship at BlackRock on their portfolio-management team, and I clicked on this thing called the Founders Scholarship, because they’ll give $20,000 toward your tuition. And I got an offer for an accelerated interview. So I tell my dad about it—an accelerated interview at the biggest asset manager in the world! And he was like, “What do you mean ‘accelerated interview’? They only give those to marginalized communities—they only give those to people who are LGBT and Black and Hispanic and all that.” He said, “You should email them and tell them you’re not one of those.” So I send an email. I tell them, “Hey, thank you for the offer, but I don’t think I should be interviewed in this way because I don’t fit into those categories.” They were like, “Okay, well, thanks for telling us.” And then a few weeks later, I got rejected. So my initial thought was like, Okay, so they were going to consider me because I ticked a few identity markers—but now that I don’t, they get rid of me? I still have this negative view of affirmative action because of it—because it’s like they were willing to lower the standard for me. It’s demeaning. And obviously you’re never going to be happy because—whether people say it out loud or not—you’ll always be seen as the guy who got in because there was a lower standard. I voted for Biden in 2020, and I voted for Trump in 2024. I didn’t like Trump back in 2020, and I still don’t really like him. He’s got the kind of persona that I despise—that kind of main character, center of the universe, got pampered a lot as a kid, all that. And he was definitely a sore loser in 2020. I voted against him in 2020 because I just didn’t like how the last four years went, the amount of polarization, the way he handled the pandemic. So I voted against him. And then this time I voted against Biden by voting for Trump. It’s ridiculous the way the Left has portrayed Trump as this threat to democracy when they’ve done a lot of things that are just as bad. Like, it was obvious they couped against Biden, and it’s not like they had an open primary where other Democrats could run. They just put Kamala in there. Then Biden pardoned his son after he said he wouldn’t. I also think the Justice Department is politicized. Sure, maybe Trump has some legit cases against him, but why are they trying to fish for everything they can? I definitely admire his resilience. He’s got all these court cases on him, all these convictions, and yet he’s still out there campaigning like crazy. Trump’s also got, what, two assassination attempts on him? Not to mention the entire media machine being against him, the entire political machine being against him, even Republicans. And yet he’s out there winning. There’s a lot of talking points in the world right now about a male loneliness epidemic. And for the most part, I would venture to say the people who focus on it tend to be right-wing grifters trying to make a buck off of male rage. That being said, many of the young men in my life—certainly not all, I wouldn’t even say most, but way, way more than I’d think is normal—have no close friends. Like, they have guys they go out and drink with. But if something is weighing on you, if your mom is sick, I could probably name three or four men in my everyday life who would have no one in their lives to speak to about that. That extends to their relationships with women. A disproportionate amount of the men in my life are single. I’m not a single guy, so I can’t speak to this personally, but I know there’s a lot of incel-­adjacent bitterness around that fact. These guys have spent their entire adult lives single and have grown to resent women for that. And it’s exacerbated when you go online, you go on YouTube and TikTok, and there are men reinforcing this idea that actually you’ve been right all along, you are right to be waiting for the “highest-value woman”—that’s what they call it—and every other woman who won’t date you, those women are bad. They’re sexually promiscuous, they’re ignorant, and you’re right to be angry at them. So many men are hearing this messaging and develop a sense of bitterness that drives them away from the women in their life—not just potential partners, but their mothers, their sisters. I try not to associate with people who harbor real bitterness for women, but I mean, I think about the way that some of them talk in my classes—men who take a gender-studies class just to dunk on the feminist talking points they hear. They view themselves as on some kind of crusade to be the logical voice of reason in the room. Like, in a moment of social reckoning, a moment of reorganization where there are more women in college than men, they view themselves as a last bastion, a final crusader in the quest to defend masculinity from an emasculating society. It’s a really sad thing. It’s embarrassing to watch. And if you asked those men in those lectures what they’re so angry about, they’d say they’re mad that their side of the story is not being told, when in fact their side of the story is the most well-­reported, well-documented, well-studied thing in the history of the world. In this election, it seemed like the Democrats were focusing on just women’s issues and women’s rights, we need a woman in office, everything just centered around women—and I am in no way degrading women, that’s fine—but they left out the entire other gender. There wasn’t anything for young men or pretty much men in general. It was just women’s this, women’s that. And for men, we’re like, “What about us?” The problem with today’s society, and especially with my generation, is everyone just focuses on, “Oh, men have had this and men have had that over the course of history.” They’ve had better benefits or they’ve gotten paid more. And what about women? What about women’s equality? Which I’m not opposed to—I do feel like women should be paid equally. Although if that’s what we want, then women need to start integrating themselves in the jobs that men naturally do. You’re not going to see a woman doing tile work. There’s not a single woman on the job sites that I work in. There’s not a single woman working in the coal mines or the oil rigs. If we want to have an equal society, then women need to start doing these jobs. At the end of the day, who Trump is as a person is not my concern. What he does in his daily life, the way that he acts, his whole demeanor, is not reflective of my opinions. It all goes back to what he will do to better the country. That’s what I’m concerned with—the things that affect my life. So his rants on Twitter and all that stuff, yeah, it’s stupid and I don’t agree with it. He should stop doing it. I mean, it’s kind of funny, but it’s also pretty stupid for a political leader to be ranting on Twitter like that. At the end of the day, though, it doesn’t affect me. What affects me is what he’s going to do for the country. All these Democrats keep saying he’s going to be the fall of America, which is just an idiotic remark to make, because if he was the fall of America, it would’ve fallen already. We still have our democracy, we still have our freedoms, we still have our right to believe in our own values and religion and anything that you want to believe in. I feel like Democrats just have this hatred for Trump himself. They don’t have a problem with what we as Republicans believe in. They just hate Trump. During the four years he was president, all they did was try to indict him, impeach him, get him out of office. And the last few years, they’ve been trying to put him in jail. It’s been really shocking to see what they were doing to him. The Democrats are always preaching about, “Oh, he’s going to be the fall of democracy and the end of America.” Yet they’re the ones inciting a world where you can decide someone’s unfit to be president just because you don’t like them. History will speak for itself, though. Because at the end of the day, in 2030, in a hundred years, whatever, our kids are going to be reading about Trump in their history books. You don’t need to like him as a person, but it’s undeniable the impact he’s had on the country. Whether it’s George Washington or Barack Obama or Donald Trump, our kids in future generations are going to know their names.

Title: Lyft shares sink as tough competition takes a toll on bookings forecast

(Reuters) - Lyft shares slumped 12.5% in premarket trading on Wednesday after the company forecast weak gross bookings for the first quarter, as it battles with larger rival Uber Technologies to attract more riders. The ride-hailing platform has been aggressively working on luring customers away from Uber through competitive pricing and new features, but faced challenges from wildfires and extreme weather in some crucial markets. "The key question for Lyft remains the company's ability to sustain top-line growth while ramping profitability," Evercore ISI analysts said. At least six brokerages cut their price targets on the Lyft stock, a day after the company's fourth-quarter results, bringing the median PT to $18, as per data compiled by LSEG. Morningstar analysts cautioned that Lyft's weakening network effects could be a sign of a negative feedback loop where softening demand, lowers the incentive for "supply/drivers to remain on the network, which can result in worsening app performance and ultimately pushes users toward the competitor." Lyft on Tuesday forecast gross bookings between $4.05 billion and $4.20 billion for the first quarter, below Wall Street estimates of $4.26 billion. Last week, Uber too projected first-quarter gross bookings that were short of analysts' expectations. Earlier this week, Lyft announced that it would partner with Japanese conglomerate Marubeni to roll out Mobileye powered fully autonomous robotaxis in Dallas, on its platform "as early as 2026." Automakers and technology companies are funneling significant investments into driverless technology, betting on it as a key driver for future growth and transformation in mobility. Lyft's 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio is 13.8, compared to Uber's 30. In 2024, Lyft's shares fell 13.94%, while so far this year it has risen 11.55%.

Business FILE PHOTO: An empty Lyft pick-up area is shown in Los Angeles, California, U.S., August 20, 2020. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo Lyft shares slumped about 9 per cent on Wednesday after the ride-hailing company warned that lower pricing trends from late last year are expected to continue in 2025, as it tries to match prices with larger rival Uber. The ride-hailing platform has been aggressively working on luring customers and drivers onto its platform by keeping prices competitive and launching new features that differentiate it from Uber. However, Lyft said on Tuesday that it saw prices fall in the fourth quarter and the trend has continued so far this year. It added that the company had to drop fares for rides and give away more coupons in the last few weeks of 2024 to keep prices competitive. In contrast, Uber said last week that it expects prices for its affordable private car offering, UberX, to be marginally up this year, as it passes insurance cost hikes on to consumers. "What seems clear though is U.S. rideshare is allocating more incentive dollars towards consumers, funded by lower incentives to drivers — ok 'if' done with balance," Bernstein analysts said in a note. Lyft said it had the flexibility to adjust incentives to balance supply and demand in the marketplace since it had a robust number of drivers on the platform. "We suspect prices will be lower for longer which will test the elasticity of demand for the industry," Needham analysts said. At least thirteen brokerages cut their price targets on the Lyft stock, a day after the company's fourth-quarter results, bringing the median PT to $18, as per data compiled by LSEG. Lyft on Tuesday forecast gross bookings below Wall Street estimates, similar to rival Uber's projection last week. Lyft's 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio is 13.4, compared to Uber's 29.4. In 2024, Lyft's shares fell 13.9 per cent, while so far this year it has risen 11.6 per cent. Its market capitalization was set to fall by more than $500 million to roughly $5.4 billion, if losses hold. Uber's shares were about 3 per cent lower on Wednesday.

Title: How Goldman Sachs Doubling Down on Bitcoin ETFs Boosts New Crypto Like Meme Index

Time Published: 2025-02-12T10:15:36Z

New York-based banking titan Goldman Sachs has more than doubled its Bitcoin exchange-traded fund ($BTC EFT) holdings. The company’s latest quarterly report reveals it now holds $1.57B in $BTC ETFs, more than twice its Q3 2024 value. Most of Goldman Sachs’ funds – over $1.25B – lie in BlackRock’s IBIT (iShares Bitcoin Trust). Sachs also holds a sizable chunk of Ethereum ($ETH) ETFs and other crypto options. Let’s unpack why this matters for the wider crypto market and for new crypto projects like Meme Index. In the previous quarter, Goldman Sachs reported it held $461M worth of IBIT shares, which made it the fund’s second-largest holder, only rivaled by Millennium Management with its $844M pile. Additionally, Sachs bought $288M worth of Fidelity’s FBTC (Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF). Its $3.6M GBTV (Grayscale Bitcoin Trust) holdings, however, remained unchanged. Sachs’ other crypto options now total $760M, and its $ETH portfolio grew nearly 19x from $25.1M last quarter to $476.5M. Half of Goldman Sachs’ $ETH exposure is through Fidelity’s FETH (Fidelity Ethereum Fund) and half through BlackRock’s ETHA (iShares Ethereum Trust). Overall, the 12 $BTC ETFs saw $40.46B in net inflows since their launch. BlackRock’s IBIT is the largest fund with $40.87B in inflows, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC with $12.60B inflows. Grayscale’s GBTC suffered $21.95B outflows. The scale of $ETH ETF investments can’t compete with $BTC. Still, institutional interest is evident from $3.17B cumulative inflows. BlackRock yet again leads the pack with its ETHA fund ($4.44B inflows), while Grayscale’s ETHE falls behind with $3.95B outflows. While banking giants build their crypto portfolios, degen investors are reviving old-school TradFi concepts. Meme Index ($MEMEX) is rolling out the world’s first meme coin index. Essentially, it provides exposure to the $120B meme coin market through four baskets that cater to different risk appetites. Each of the baskets contains eight tokens, from OG memes like Dogecoin ($DOGE) to new, volatile players like Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN). By spreading investment across several projects, you offset potential losses and risk. The $MEMEX token presale kicked off in January and has already hit the $3.5M milestone. One $MEMEX now costs $0.0160993, but the price is set to increase tomorrow. Never before did degens have the opportunity to gain exposure to highly speculative assets in such a safe way. Given this unique positioning, $MEMEX could reach $0.074 by the end of 2025 and bring its supporters even greater gains in the long run. To buy $MEMEX, visit the official presale website, connect your wallet, and pay with $ETH, $BNB, $USDT, or a bank card. Alternatively, secure your share of tokens through Best Wallet’s top presales aggregator. Goldman Sachs isn’t just dipping its toes in the crypto waters – it’s diving in headfirst. Wall Street heavyweights investing billions in crypto suggests it is now perceived as a legitimate asset class, which will surely drive broader adoption and innovation. Meanwhile, the crypto community is taking pages from Wall Street’s book, with creative solutions like $MEMEX providing a safer entry into the meme coin market for risk-averse investors. As always, though, we remind you to DYOR before investing in any cryptocurrency. The market is notoriously volatile, and even tools like indexes don’t fully mitigate the risk.

Title: Palantir stock has been on a tear. But a reckoning could come soon

Palantir Technologies (PLTR+0.12%) is the top-performing stock in the S&P 500 to start 2025, soaring 50% so far this year. But the software company’s bright earnings prospects won’t be enough to protect investors from short-term pain as its share price eventually returns to more normal levels, some analysts say. The stock, which dipped about 3.5% to close at $112.62 per share on Tuesday, has still surged about 35% since the company reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings earlier this month. And it’s up a whopping 350% over the last 12 months. That’s taken Palantir’s price-to-earnings ratio to almost 600, and about 200 based on projected 12-month earnings. The overall current PE for the Nasdaq is about 42. “The stock’s not made of teflon,” said Bob Lang, founder and chief options analyst at Explosive Options. Palantir is trading at about 150% of the 200-day moving average, which Lang called an “extraordinary” level that can’t last forever. “Eventually the rally will peter out as investors get exhausted,” Lang said. The company, which builds software for big data analytics companies, earlier this month reported revenue of $828 million for the fourth quarter — a 36% jump year over year. Revenue from the U.S. government grew 45%. Palantir’s projections for sales and profit in 2025 both topped analysts’ estimates. Palantir may trigger a selloff if it opts to sell new shares to take advantage of its current, much higher market valuation, Lang said. The could quickly test the $84-$87 level. However, even at $90 per share, there would still be an uptrend. Lang remains optimistic about the company’s earnings prospects. He said analysts’ estimates of 25% growth in 2026 are far too low as Palantir secures new work, especially from governments. Michael Rechenthin, head of R&D at tastylive, a streaming platform geared toward options traders, shared both Lang’s optimism about Palantir’s potential work for the Trump administration — and his caution about the stock’s immediate prospects. “Revenues and net income have been increasing quarter after quarter — but not by the rate at which is stock is growing,” Rechenthin said. He said he won’t be adding to his position at this level. In August, Palantir and Microsoft (MSFT-0.11%) announced that they were deepening their partnership to provide secure cloud, AI, and analytics capabilities to U.S. defense and intelligence agencies. Through the partnership, agencies will have access to Microsoft’s Azure cloud compute and large language models, or LLMs, including OpenAI’s GPT-4, through its Azure OpenAI Service that will be integrated with Palantir’s AI Platforms (AIP). Palantir’s products will be deployed in Microsoft’s Azure cloud for government, including clouds for top secret use. —Britney Nguyen and Vinamrata Chaturvedi contributed to this article.

Chip foundries are responsible for producing a critical part of every piece of technology in the world. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) is perhaps the most well-known chip manufacturer, known for fabricating advanced chips designed by Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL). The Taiwan-based chipmaker has a 92% share in advanced AI chip production, according to data from Boston Consulting Group, cited by JPMorgan (JPM). Total global chip foundry revenue was $131.7 billion in 2024, according to TrendForce data cited by the firm. Seven chip foundries, including U.S.-based Tower (TSEM) and Taiwan’s Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, each have a 1% share of total global revenue, according to the data, while 3% of the total is shared by “Others.” Taiwanese chipmakers command a 70% share of the total revenue, while Korean companies made up 11%, and Chinese chip foundries had 8%. Here are the top six chip producers in the world by revenue share. Chinese pure-play foundry Hua Hong Semiconductor had a 2% share of total chip foundry revenue in 2024. China’s partially state-owned, pure-play chip foundry, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, also known as SMIC, had a 5% share of total chip foundry revenue in 2024. U.S.-based chip designer and manufacturer GlobalFoundries (GFS) had a 6% share of total chip foundry revenue in 2024.

Chip foundries are responsible for producing a critical part of every piece of technology in the world. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) is perhaps the most well-known chip manufacturer, known for fabricating advanced chips designed by Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL). The Taiwan-based chipmaker has a 92% share in advanced AI chip production, according to data from Boston Consulting Group, cited by JPMorgan (JPM). Total global chip foundry revenue was $131.7 billion in 2024, according to TrendForce data cited by the firm. Seven chip foundries, including U.S.-based Tower (TSEM) and Taiwan’s Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, each have a 1% share of total global revenue, according to the data, while 3% of the total is shared by “Others.” Taiwanese chipmakers command a 70% share of the total revenue, while Korean companies made up 11%, and Chinese chip foundries had 8%. Here are the top six chip producers in the world by revenue share. Chinese pure-play foundry Hua Hong Semiconductor had a 2% share of total chip foundry revenue in 2024. China’s partially state-owned, pure-play chip foundry, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, also known as SMIC, had a 5% share of total chip foundry revenue in 2024. U.S.-based chip designer and manufacturer GlobalFoundries (GFS) had a 6% share of total chip foundry revenue in 2024. Taiwan’s first chip company, United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), had a 6% share of total chip foundry revenue in 2024. Samsung, one of the world’s main producers of high-bandwidth memory chips, had a 10% share of total chip foundry revenue in 2024.

Title: Report: Pro-Migration Lobbyists Plan to Surround, Submerge Donald Trump

A coordinated alliance of lobbyists are submerging President Donald Trump and selected GOP politicians under many close friends and allies who are urging them to import more low-wage and submissive migrants for jobs that would otherwise go to Americans who can vote in future elections, according to Business Insider. On February 10, BusinessInsider.com described the “Make America Wealthy Again” [MAWA] lobbying campaign: “Trump as a businessman understands that if he doesn’t have 200 [H-2A visa worker] guys cutting the grass at his golf courses, then they don’t look right, and people won’t want to play golf there,” says Cristina Antelo, the founding principal at Ferox Strategies, a lobbying firm that counts the National Retail Federation, Walmart, and the tobacco giant Reynolds America among its clients. “There’s a way to get to Trump and make him realize that. How many businesses does he need to hear from before he’s like, ‘Crap, I really am going to paralyze the entire US labor market if I do this’?” The MAWA plan is to apply pressure on business allies in Trump’s inner circle, rather than on the president directly, and to steer clear of Stephen Miller, the administration’s most outspoken anti-immigration hard-liner. “Stephen Miller won’t ever be convinced. Forget that,” says a lobbyist from a prominent trade association. “But Trump can be convinced not to screw over fellow businesspeople. Miller isn’t the only dude who has Trump’s ear.” The campaign is called “Make America Wealthy Again,” said Business Insider, because it is”designed to appeal to Trump and his business-minded allies.” The headline is “Make America Wealthy Again: Inside corporate America’s ‘quiet’ campaign to change Trump’s mind on mass deportations.” The drive is also submerging congressional legislators under pro-migration voices and advocates, according to the article: In addition, lobbyists have already begun reaching out to members of Congress and their staffs — both on Capitol Hill and in their districts back home — via phone, Zoom, and in-person meetings. Several lobbyists describe a campaign of “shock and awe,” one that will seek to apply “1,000 points of pressure” to GOP members of Congress who understand that immigrants are willing to take low-paying, high-risk jobs that are shunned by most Americans. Among those being targeted is Rep. Glenn Thompson of Pennsylvania, who chairs the House Agriculture Committee. The campaign is a direct threat to Trump’s delicate coalition of businesses and employees, investors and families. A power grab by one faction may break the coalition — just as President Joe Biden’s presidency was quietly wrecked by his powerful alliance of pro-migration West Coast investors. The same pro-migration skew crashed the career and retirement plans of Canada’s Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau. It also smashed the career of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in the United Kingdom. In the United States, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) twice lost the Majority Leader post because of his support for migration in 2014 and 2024. Outside Washington, a vast number of ordinary employees and family voters are increasingly opposed to illegal migration, and they carried Trump to victory — will help elect his successor in 2028. Moreover, many of the high-turnout voters needed in the off-year elections are increasingly opposed to the legalized inflow of white-collar Indian migrants via the H-1B and other visa programs. The H-1B program keeps roughly 730,000 foreign graduates in a wide variety of starter and experienced jobs throughout the Fortune 500. Without the H-1B program, those jobs would supercharge another generation of expert, outspoken, and innovative Americans in the leading edge of the U.S. economy. Overall, at least 1.6 million foreign graduates hold white-collar jobs via a variety of uncapped visa programs, such as the J-1, L-1, OPT, E-2, H4EAD, TN, and the H-1B program. Most of the visa workers graduate from low-grade universities, and many are chosen by lottery, so exploding the lobbyists’ claim that they are “highly skilled.” They cannot work as professionals because many are hired by foreign-born managers and all know they can be fired and sent home if they disagree with top managers. Many white-collar illegal migrants also hide in the growing workforce of migrant subcontractors. The result is a growing cascade of high-tech failures and disappointments in American companies and research centers. Those counterproductive programs have pushed millions of American college graduates out of good careers in technology, healthcare, management, and many other professions, and have crippled the innovation and flexibility of the U.S. tech sector. Other countries that also have tried to solve structural problems by importing migrants — Germany, Canada, and the United Kingdom — have also quickly fallen behind. In contrast, young Chinese scientists and their companies have quickly earned leading roles in manufacturing technology, artificial intelligence, the auto sector, 5g communications gear, and drug development. The “MAWA” phrase is an elitist version of Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan. Trump’s campaign slogan is only half of what Americans heard — yet many voters also heard him say “Make Americans Great Again” — not just America. If Trump resists pro-migration pressure from his friends, deputies, and donors, he may create a great America for Americans when a “tight labor” economy forces CEOs and investors to grow productivity, raise wages, risk more trade, and tolerate more innovation, as Blackrock CEO Larry Fink argues. But Trump is already zig-zagging under lobbying pressure from people such as Elon Musk. On December 28, for example, Musk slammed voters who oppose his use of the H-1B program to outsource U.S. jobs to India, saying: “Take a big step back and FUCK YOURSELF in the face. I will go to war on this issue the likes of which you cannot possibly comprehend.” On Sunday, February 9, for example, Trump again touted a misleading article that defended the H-1B visa program which has been used since 1990 to push millions of American graduates — and their families — out of good careers. The Wall Street Journal article echoed Mayorkas as claimed “U.S. companies find it crucial … And [because] one way to reduce illegal immigration is to allow more legal pathways to meet the needs of the U.S. economy.” Trump has yet to issue a formal policy statement on the increasingly unpopular inflow of white-collar visa workers. But he may be forced to show his cards this week when he meets with India’s Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, who is expected to demand more Indian immigration in exchange for U.S. exports to India.

Title: Ukraine's Battlefield Fights Are Messy. Its Political Battles Are Getting Messy, Too.

By Mike Eckel February 12, 2025 The mayor of Ukraine's capital city is feuding with the president. The defense minister is under investigation as part of a bitter fight over control of weapons purchases. Recruiters are struggling to get enough men to the front. Ukrainians are fighting calls to lower the draft age. And last week, two more towns fell to Russian forces, though the losses were more symbolic than tactical. Ukraine is struggling to fight an existential war of defense, trying to hold back the nearly 3-year-old all-out invasion by Russia. Exhausted and battered, the population has mainly continued to rally behind the leadership of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. But fractures are appearing in the country's leadership and political class. How wide and deep they may become is an open question. Regardless, they come at an inopportune moment for Kyiv, as momentum builds for a cease-fire with Moscow, with Ukraine's main weapons provider, the United States, eager to end the war and diplomacy heating up ahead of the Munich Security Conference this weekend. "These facts tell you that the political process remains active in Ukraine even during the war," said Orysia Lutsevych, a Ukraine analyst at the London-based think tank Chatham House. "There is much hope that there could indeed be a cease-fire and that political competition will restart. It is almost like returning to normal life, to have elections and to have competition." War: A Continuation Of Politics By Other Means On the battlefield, Ukrainian forces have been on the back foot for months, going as far back as February 2024. Last August, Ukraine tried to change the narrative, staging an audacious cross-border assault on Russia's Kursk region, the biggest invasion of Russia by foreign troops since World War II. Kyiv hoped it would relieve pressure elsewhere along the front line and prove to its Western backers it was still nimble and capable of battlefield ingenuity. The West was definitely surprised, but Russian troops did not redeploy from elsewhere. Across the autumn and into the winter, Ukraine was forced to steadily retreat in multiple locations. Velyka Novosilka, a southern Donbas town along the meandering river valley, fell to the Russians as Ukrainian officials, on January 27, confirmed the withdrawal of the 110th Separate Mechanized Brigade. A few days later, Russian forces took control of the last remnants of Kurakhove, pushing Ukrainian troops west toward the city of Zaporizhzhya. Major General Mykhaylo Drapatiy, the new commander of Ukraine's ground forces, was ordered to take direct command of the eastern front, a move many saw as a possible indication of how worried commanders might be about defenses. Capital City Wrangling Back in Kyiv, Mayor Vitali Klitschko, a former heavyweight boxing champion, fired a public broadside on January 29, accusing Zelenskyy's presidential office of political intrigue with its choice of a new military administrator for the city. Military administrators have been put in place across the country since the onset of the invasion as a way to streamline coordination between civilian and military authorities. But the appointment of Tymur Tkachenko a month earlier had "political motives," Klitschko asserted, charging that Tkachenko was "interfering in and blocking of economic activity" in the capital. "I am addressing the president of Ukraine," Klitschko said in a video posted to Telegram. "While you, as the supreme commander-in-chief, are focused on the war and the defense of Ukraine, people around you are tirelessly engaged in political intrigue." Tkachenko punched back. "I am not inclined to organize political shows like people who have been in the city government for decades," he said. "We will solve the problems of the city and help the people of Kyiv." Procurement Problems The Defense Ministry, meanwhile, is embroiled in pitched bureaucratic warfare over how weaponry is procured for the armed forces. The Defense Procurement Agency was established in 2022 as a way to manage the flood of weaponry -- both from abroad and from within the country -- that Ukraine needs to arm its military. Previously, arms procurement had been dogged by corruption and graft. On January 31, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov dismissed the head of the agency, Maria Bezrukova, accusing her of mismanagement. Bezrukova in turn denied the accusation and claimed Umerov's dismissal order was illegal because the agency's supervisory board had extended her contract. The National Anti-Corruption Bureau, an independent law enforcement agency, then jumped into the fray, opening an investigation and saying Umerov may have violated the law by not recognizing her contract extension. The turmoil drew concern from the Group of Seven nations: "Compliance with good governance principles and NATO recommendations is essential to maintaining the trust of the public and international partners," they said in a statement. More Men, More Boys Ukraine's battlefield woes stem in large part from its inability to send enough men to bolster exhausted and depleted units struggling to fend off a bigger, better-armed Russian military. Despite passing legislation last year to overhaul the existing system, officials have still struggled to recruit and train enough men. Highlighting the recruiting difficulties is the scandal surrounding the 155th Separate Mechanized Brigade, a French-trained and -armed unit that was supposed to be a vanguard of a modernized armed force for Ukraine. Instead, the unit saw scores of men deserting; its commander was relieved of duty just before the unit deployed to the Donbas, and investigators are looking closely at what went wrong. Zelenskyy ordered a halt to the creation of similar brigades. U.S. and other Western officials have called for lowering the conscription age from 25 to 18. Zelenskyy has resisted, fearing it would decimate the country's already fragile demographics, making it impossible to increase the population in the future. Elephant In The Room Looming over all this is the prospect of peace talks. The Trump administration has signaled it will use a mix of coercion and inducements to get Kyiv and Moscow to at least sit down and negotiate. Among the issues on the table: whether Ukraine should suspend martial law to allow for new presidential elections, which have been prohibited since the start of the Russian invasion. Zelenskyy won a five-year term in 2019. A poll published February 3 that asked Ukrainians which public figures they trusted the most found that Valeriy Zaluzhniy, the former commander-in-chief, topped the list. Since being appointed ambassador to Britain, Zaluzhniy has kept a low political profile, but many see him as a strong contender if there is an election. He was followed in the ranking by Kyrylo Budanov, the sphinx-like head of Ukraine's military intelligence agency, and Oleksandr Usyk, who last year won the world heavyweight boxing title. In fourth place: Zelenskyy. Experts say Zelenskyy's political advisers are aware Zaluzhniy would be a formidable rival in an election. Since his move to London, most of the gruff former general's public statements have called for national solidarity in the fight against a foreign enemy. There's also the fear that Russia could meddle in any Ukrainian election -- as it has done in the past. Sergei Zhuk, a fellow at the Wilson Center think tank in Washington and a professor at Ball State University in Indiana, told RFE/RL in an interview last month that the Kremlin could use its powerful propaganda machine and pro-Russia elements inside Ukraine to destabilize the country during elections. Also lurking in the background: former President Petro Poroshenko, whom Zelenskyy defeated in 2019. Poroshenko's supporters appear to be laying the groundwork for him to run again, although he is still widely unpopular. "There was always this discussion about mobilization, the level of war-time tax, procurement process at the [Defense Ministry], building defenses around power stations," Lutsevych said. "There is unity where it matters in war: about the enemy, and that enemy is Russia." RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service contributed to this report.

Title: Bitcoin May See Gains from Soft U.S. CPI, Major Risk-On Surge in BTC Appears Unlikely

A soft U.S. inflation report later Wednesday will likely bode well for risk assets, including bitcoin (BTC). But those expecting bullish fireworks may be disappointed. The Labor Department will publish January's consumer price index (CPI) report on Wednesday at 13:30 UTC. It's expected to show that the cost of living increased by 0.3% month-on-month in January, slowing down from December's 0.4% rise, according to Reuters estimates tracked by FXStreet. The annualized figure is expected to match December's 2.9% reading. The core inflation, which strips out the volatile food and energy component, is forecast to have risen to 0.3% month-over-month from 0.2%, resulting in an annualized reading of 3.1%, down from December's 3.2%. Lower-than-expected data, particularly the core figure, will likely bolster expectations for further Federal Reserve (Fed) interest rate cuts, which could lead to lower Treasury yields and a weaker dollar index, ultimately boosting demand for riskier assets. According to CME's FedWatch tool, the market currently estimates a 54% chance that the Fed will either cut interest rates once or not at all this year. While a potential adjustment in Fed rate cuts could lift BTC, it is unlikely to be the sole catalyst for a breakout from the ongoing consolidation between $90,000 and $110,000. This is due to forward-looking market metrics indicating higher inflation in the coming months amid trade war fears, suggesting that the Fed may have a limited window to implement aggressive rate cuts. Data tracked by Mott Capital Management shows that two-year inflation swaps have climbed to nearly 2.8%, the highest since early 2023. The five-year swap is exhibiting a similar trend. Higher inflation swaps indicate that the market is expecting inflation rates to rise in the future, prompting investors to pay a higher premium to protect themselves against potential purchasing power loss by entering into swap contracts tied to CPI. In other words, the ongoing uptick in these metrics indicate that the progress in inflation toward the Fed's 2% target has stalled, and price pressures are likely to increase over the coming years, probably due to Trump's tariffs. Plus, some investment banks believe a soft January CPI reading won't see the Fed move away from its hawkish rate guidance. In his testimony to Congress Tuesday, Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank is in no hurry to cut rates. "We don’t expect that progress on inflation will be enough to prompt additional interest rate cuts from the Fed this year," RBC's weekly note said, adding that January's report will show limited easing in price pressures. BlackRock said the persistent services inflation will keep the Fed from cutting rates. "We get U.S. CPI for January this week. Even as December’s CPI report showed signs of inflation pressures easing, wage growth remains above the level that would allow inflation to recede back to the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, in our view. We see persistent services inflation forcing the Fed to keep rates higher for longer," BlackRock said. Lastly, BTC may move closer to the lower end of its $90K-$110K trading range should the CPI print hotter than expected.

Title: Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO): Among the Best International Dividend Stocks to Buy Now
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/novo-nordisk-nvo-among-best-055118386.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best International Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) stands against the other international dividend stocks. Dividend stocks have been grabbing investors' attention for a while now. According to JP Morgan, over the last two decades, global dividends per share have increased at an annual rate of 5.6%, but analysts expect this to rise to 7.6% in the future, driven by historically low payout ratios. During the 2020 pandemic, many companies cut dividends, but as earnings have recovered, especially in Big Tech and AI, dividends have not kept up. With payout ratios at 25-year lows, simply returning to normal could add 2% annual growth over the next five years. After slowing down post-COVID, global dividend growth made a surprising comeback last year, increasing 8% and adding an extra $180 billion in payouts despite ongoing economic and geopolitical challenges. According to S&P Global, this was largely driven by record dividend initiations in US tech, European banks, Japan’s auto industry, and solid growth from China. Even oil and gas companies held strong despite market volatility. Looking ahead, experts predict global dividends will hold steady at $2.3 trillion in 2025. Regionally, developed Asia, which includes Japan, Hong Kong, Australia, South Korea, and Singapore, is looking at a 3% rise in dividends this year. Europe, on the other hand, is expected to see a 3.4% decline. In emerging markets, the trends are mixed. Asia, led by China, India, and Taiwan, is on track for a 5% increase, while dividends in the Middle East and Africa could drop by 20%, mainly because Saudi Aramco’s special dividend program ended. Latin America is also expected to see a small dip of around 4%. When it comes to sectors, banks and energy companies remain the biggest dividend payers. Banks are expected to distribute around $380 billion globally, but after four years of rapid 20% growth, they are now down to just 2%. Banks are playing it safe, waiting to see how interest rates move. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best international dividend stocks. Our Methodology For this article, we used the BlackRock International Dividend ETF to filter out dividend stocks listed on US exchanges but headquartered internationally. We focused on picking stocks that were most popular among hedge funds. The list below is ranked in the ascending order of Q3 2024 hedge fund sentiment, and dividend yields are mentioned as of February 11. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here) An elderly couple receiving insulin from a pharmacist, representing healthcare company's successful pharmaceutical products. Dividend Yield as of February 11: 1.75% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61 Founded in 1923, Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) is a Danish pharmaceutical company that provides insulin, obesity medications, and hormone therapies. 2024 was a strong year for Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), with sales climbing 25% to $40.6 billion, but the company expects growth to slow in 2025. The stock has dropped 40% since last June, as investors worry about demand for obesity drugs and mixed trial results. Analysts observe that the first half of 2024 was exciting, but things cooled down when US prescription growth slowed and some drug trials underperformed. Political uncertainty, especially with Trump’s election, has also made investors nervous. In 2024, Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) raised its total dividend per share by 21.3% to DKK 11.40, which includes an interim dividend of DKK 3.50 distributed in August. This is the 29th consecutive year of dividend growth at NVO. Novo Nordisk is one of the best dividend stocks on our list. Looking ahead to 2025, the company expects capital expenditures of around DKK 65 billion but has no plans for share repurchases. In 2025, Novo Nordisk expects a free cash flow of around DKK 75 to 85 billion and sales growth of 16-24% at constant exchange rates. According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 61 hedge funds held stakes in Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), compared to 67 funds in Q2. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the biggest stakeholder in the company, with 13.3 million shares worth $1.58 billion. Overall NVO ranks 4th on our list of the best international dividend stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best International Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) stands against the other international dividend stocks. Dividend stocks have been grabbing investors' attention for a while now. According to JP Morgan, over the last two decades, global dividends per share have increased at an annual rate of 5.6%, but analysts expect this to rise to 7.6% in the future, driven by historically low payout ratios. During the 2020 pandemic, many companies cut dividends, but as earnings have recovered, especially in Big Tech and AI, dividends have not kept up. With payout ratios at 25-year lows, simply returning to normal could add 2% annual growth over the next five years. After slowing down post-COVID, global dividend growth made a surprising comeback last year, increasing 8% and adding an extra $180 billion in payouts despite ongoing economic and geopolitical challenges. According to S&P Global, this was largely driven by record dividend initiations in US tech, European banks, Japan’s auto industry, and solid growth from China. Even oil and gas companies held strong despite market volatility. Looking ahead, experts predict global dividends will hold steady at $2.3 trillion in 2025. Regionally, developed Asia, which includes Japan, Hong Kong, Australia, South Korea, and Singapore, is looking at a 3% rise in dividends this year. Europe, on the other hand, is expected to see a 3.4% decline. In emerging markets, the trends are mixed. Asia, led by China, India, and Taiwan, is on track for a 5% increase, while dividends in the Middle East and Africa could drop by 20%, mainly because Saudi Aramco’s special dividend program ended. Latin America is also expected to see a small dip of around 4%. When it comes to sectors, banks and energy companies remain the biggest dividend payers. Banks are expected to distribute around $380 billion globally, but after four years of rapid 20% growth, they are now down to just 2%. Banks are playing it safe, waiting to see how interest rates move. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best international dividend stocks. Our Methodology For this article, we used the BlackRock International Dividend ETF to filter out dividend stocks listed on US exchanges but headquartered internationally. We focused on picking stocks that were most popular among hedge funds. The list below is ranked in the ascending order of Q3 2024 hedge fund sentiment, and dividend yields are mentioned as of February 11. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here) An elderly couple receiving insulin from a pharmacist, representing healthcare company's successful pharmaceutical products. Dividend Yield as of February 11: 1.75% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61 Founded in 1923, Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) is a Danish pharmaceutical company that provides insulin, obesity medications, and hormone therapies. 2024 was a strong year for Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), with sales climbing 25% to $40.6 billion, but the company expects growth to slow in 2025. The stock has dropped 40% since last June, as investors worry about demand for obesity drugs and mixed trial results. Analysts observe that the first half of 2024 was exciting, but things cooled down when US prescription growth slowed and some drug trials underperformed. Political uncertainty, especially with Trump’s election, has also made investors nervous. In 2024, Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) raised its total dividend per share by 21.3% to DKK 11.40, which includes an interim dividend of DKK 3.50 distributed in August. This is the 29th consecutive year of dividend growth at NVO. Novo Nordisk is one of the best dividend stocks on our list. Looking ahead to 2025, the company expects capital expenditures of around DKK 65 billion but has no plans for share repurchases. In 2025, Novo Nordisk expects a free cash flow of around DKK 75 to 85 billion and sales growth of 16-24% at constant exchange rates. According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 61 hedge funds held stakes in Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), compared to 67 funds in Q2. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the biggest stakeholder in the company, with 13.3 million shares worth $1.58 billion. Overall NVO ranks 4th on our list of the best international dividend stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Best VR Porn Games to Play in 2025
URL: http://chicagoreader.com/adult/vr-porn-games/
Time Published: 2025-02-12T05:11:42Z
Full Content:
VR porn games have taken adult entertainment to the next level, thanks to huge leaps in headset technology and production quality. Gone are the days of static screens, now, you can step inside the action with hyper-realistic 3D visuals, smooth animations, and responsive gameplay that puts you in control. Whether curious or a longtime fan, VR offers a completely new way to experience adult content, making it more immersive and interactive than ever. If you haven’t tried VR porn yet, now’s the perfect time to dive in and see what all the hype is about! To save you the trial and error, we’ve put together the ultimate list of the 10 Best VR porn games on the market. We’ve done deep dives into the top ten, breaking down what makes them stand out, and rounded up the rest as honorable mentions. Expect cutting-edge technology, jaw-dropping realism, immersive storylines, and erotic encounters that push the limits of virtual pleasure. Ooh la la! Is it all fun and games? While VR porn games offer immersive experiences, it’s essential to remember that they also come with potential downsides, particularly in how they can affect players’ socialization, relationships, and worldview. One major concern is social isolation. Because VR can feel incredibly realistic, some users may find themselves spending more time in virtual relationships rather than engaging with real-world connections. Over time, this could lead to difficulty in forming and maintaining personal relationships, as interacting with AI-driven characters is often easier and less demanding than dealing with real people. Another issue is the reinforcement of unrealistic expectations. Many VR adult games allow for complete customization and control, something that simply isn’t possible in real-world relationships. This can create distorted perceptions of intimacy, where players expect perfect responses, unrealistic bodies, or total dominance over interactions, which can lead to dissatisfaction with real-life partners. The Impact on Attitudes Toward Women and Femme-Presenting People Another potential downside of VR porn games is how they reinforce misogynistic attitudes or unrealistic expectations toward women and femme-presenting people. Many of these games prioritize male-centered fantasies, often portraying women as hypersexual, submissive, or endlessly accommodating without emotional needs or boundaries. Over time, frequent exposure to these dynamics can shape unrealistic or harmful views on real-life relationships. It’s possible that players may come to expect one-sided interactions that don’t require mutual respect or effort. Yikes! Additionally, some games promote power imbalances, reinforcing a false sense of intimacy that is inherently based on dominance and control, rather than consent and connection. While fantasy has its place, repeated exposure without critical thinking can blur the line between healthy kinks and problematic beliefs. For those already struggling with social interactions, this can potentially deepen resentment or entitlement, particularly toward women who don’t conform to these scripted, fantasy-based behaviors. Engaging with VR porn games doesn’t automatically lead to misogynistic beliefs, but it’s important to critically examine the content, challenge harmful narratives, and balance virtual experiences with real-world perspectives on intimacy, agency, and respect. But it’s not all bad VR porn games also offer unique social and personal benefits, beyond just entertainment. For some, they provide a safe space to explore fantasies, build confidence, and understand personal desires without pressure. Multiplayer games foster social connections, allowing users to interact with others in a low-stress environment. VR can also enhance long-distance relationships, creating shared intimate experiences despite physical distance. When balanced with real-world interactions, VR porn games can be a fun, engaging, and even confidence-boosting outlet. 1.

Try these: Choosing the right adult VR game depends on what kind of experience you’re looking for. Here are some key factors to consider: VR Compatibility Not all VR games work with every headset. Check if the game supports your specific device (e.g., Oculus, HTC Vive, Valve Index, PSVR). Some games also run in desktop mode if you don’t have VR gear. Level of Interactivity Do you want a passive viewing experience (like 360° videos) or a fully interactive game with AI-driven characters, physics-based interactions, and player choices? Graphics & Animation Quality Some games focus on highly detailed, realistic models, while others go for a stylized or anime-inspired look. Consider what visual style appeals to you. Customization Options Many games allow you to modify characters, outfits, and scenarios. If personalizing the experience is important, look for a game with strong customization features. Multiplayer vs. Solo Experience Some games, like 3DXChat, emphasize social interaction, while others are single-player-focused. Decide if you want a solo experience or a multiplayer world with real-time interactions. Teledildonics Support If you’re interested in haptic feedback devices, check if the game is compatible with interactive toys like Lovense or Kiiroo for a more immersive experience. Storyline & Gameplay Depth Some games offer deep narratives and role-playing elements, while others are more focused on quick, no-strings-attached experiences. Choose based on whether you prefer a story-driven game or a casual encounter. Common questions about this new and exciting erotic technology. Are VR porn games safe to download and play? As with any software, it’s best to download from official websites or trusted platforms to avoid malware. Always check reviews, system requirements, and privacy settings before installing. What do I need to play adult VR games? To play adult VR games, you’ll need a VR-compatible headset (like Oculus Quest, HTC Vive, or Valve Index), a VR-ready PC (for high-end games), and enough storage space for downloads. Some games also offer non-VR modes for standard screens. What are the best VR headsets? The best headset depends on your budget and preferences. High-end options like the Valve Index and HTC Vive Pro offer top-tier visuals and tracking, while more affordable headsets like the Oculus Quest 2 provide wireless freedom and solid performance. Many PC-based games also support Windows Mixed Reality headsets. Can I play VR games without a VR headset? Yes! Some games offer a desktop mode where you can play with standard controls and a monitor. However, you won’t get the same level of immersion as you would in VR. Do VR games require an internet connection? It depends on the game. Single-player experiences usually work offline, while multiplayer games (like 3DXChat) need an active internet connection for real-time interaction with other players. Are VR porn games multiplayer or single-player? Both options exist! Games like 3DXChat offer multiplayer experiences where you can interact with other players, while games like Dominatrix Simulator focus on single-player immersion with AI-driven characters. Can I customize characters and experiences? Many adult VR games offer deep customization, allowing you to adjust character appearances, outfits, and even personalities. Some also let you modify environments and interaction styles. Do VR porn games support teledildonics? Many do, yes! Some games sync with interactive sex toys (check out Lovense or Kiiroo) to provide haptic feedback, making in-game actions feel more realistic. Are there VR porn games with more intellectual or story-driven gameplay? Absolutely! Games like XStoryPlayer and Dominatrix Simulator feature narrative-driven experiences, where your choices affect the outcome. These are great if you prefer an interactive story over casual encounters. How realistic are the animations and physics in adult VR games? It varies by game. Some use advanced physics engines for realistic movements and interactions, while others prioritize a stylized or fantasy aesthetic. Games that support teledildonics also add an extra layer of realism with synchronized haptic feedback. Love them or hate them, VR porn games have revolutionized the way people engage with adult content, offering unparalleled interactivity, and personalization. With advancements in VR headset technology these experiences have evolved far beyond traditional adult media, and who knows where they will take us next! When enjoyed in moderation, VR porn games can be a fun, confidence-boosting outlet, allowing users to safely explore desires, improve social skills in virtual spaces, or even strengthen connections in long-distance relationships. The addition of teledildonics further enhances realism, bridging the gap between fantasy and physical sensation. Of course, as with all media, critical engagement is key. Some VR porn games reinforce harmful stereotypes or unrealistic portrayals of women and relationships, so always remain critical of your consumption. It’s essential to recognize the difference between fantasy and reality, boundaries and consent, and to balance virtual experiences with real-life connections for healthy perspectives on intimacy. Ultimately, VR porn games are a thrilling and ever-evolving frontier in adult entertainment. Whether you’re a casual player or a dedicated enthusiast, they offer a unique way to engage with sexuality, pushing the boundaries of pleasure and personal exploration. As technology continues to evolve, so too will the experiences available, making this an exciting space to watch, and play in, for years to come.

Title: Is Unilever PLC (UL) the Safest Dividend Stock in the UK?
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unilever-plc-ul-safest-dividend-035350534.html
Time Published: 2025-02-12T03:53:50Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Safest Dividend Stocks in the UK. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) stands against other safest dividend stocks in the UK. In recent years, investors have increasingly shifted away from UK equities, favoring global stocks, particularly high-growth sectors like US technology. The UK stock market is shrinking at its fastest pace in over a decade, largely due to a wave of takeovers involving London-listed companies. Bloomberg data showed that around 45 firms have been delisted from the London market in 2024 through mergers and acquisitions, reflecting a 10% rise from last year’s total. This marks the highest level of delistings since 2010. At the same time, the value of deals involving UK companies has climbed 81% this year, surpassing $160 billion. Over the last ten years, the British index has delivered an annual total return of 6%, significantly lagging behind the 13% return of the broader US market. Analysts attribute this weaker performance to sluggish earnings growth, political uncertainty within the UK, and the lack of a dominant technology sector. However, a key factor has been the sharp drop in valuations as investors have increasingly moved away from UK stocks. According to Goldman Sachs, the issue is not a lack of foreign investor interest—who currently account for roughly two-thirds of the UK market capitalization—but rather the low engagement of domestic investors in UK equities. Also read: 10 Best Annual Dividend Stocks To Buy Now That said, several factors seem to be contributing to a shift in investor sentiment. In November 2024, UK equity funds saw inflows after more than three years of continuous monthly withdrawals and a large sell-off leading up to the Budget. According to data from Calastone, retail investors invested a net £317 million into UK-focused stock funds that month. This marks a significant change, halting a streak of 41 months of net outflows, during which over £25 billion had been pulled from these funds since May 2021. Analysts also believe that the UK stock market may be on the verge of recovery, although the exact timing and pace of this shift are unclear. In this context, dividend stocks are crucial. Focusing on stocks with growing dividends can offer stability and consistency across different market conditions. These stocks also provide long-term growth potential, compounding returns as share prices recover. The UK market offers some of the highest dividend yields among major markets, with the “Footsie” yielding 3.46%, and the FTSE 250 offering slightly lower but still attractive yields. This setup enables investors to focus on high-growth areas, like smaller companies, while enjoying the benefit of increasing dividends. According to BlackRock, UK market dividends are currently growing at a rate of 2-3%, roughly in line with long-term inflation. Companies with growing dividends typically have strong cash flows, allowing them to increase payouts over time. Janus Henderson’s 2023 annual dividend report highlighted a significant increase in dividend growth, revealing that the UK paid out roughly $86 billion in dividends last year, up from $63.1 billion in 2020. Looking ahead, the UK’s stock market index is projected to distribute about £83.6 billion in dividends in 2025, marking a 6.5% rise from the £78.5 billion expected in 2024. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best FTSE dividend stocks. For this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds as of Q3 2024 to find FTSE stocks that are also traded on US exchanges. Our focus was on companies that have strong dividend policies and consistently distribute dividends to their shareholders. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of hedge funds’ sentiment toward them. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 22 Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL), established in 1860 and based in London, is a multinational consumer goods company with operations across Asia Pacific, Africa, the Americas, and Europe. The company provides a wide range of products, including hair and skincare items, soap, fabric care products, cooking aids, and ice cream. Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) has decided to abandon its plans to sell its €15 billion ice cream division to private equity firms and will now focus on achieving an independent public listing for the unit. Earlier in 2023, in March, the consumer goods giant announced its intention to spin off its ice cream business and gauge interest from private equity buyers for well-known brands like Ben & Jerry’s, Magnum, and Wall’s. In the first half of 2024, Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) saw a 4.1% increase in sales on an underlying basis, supported by three consecutive quarters of positive volume growth. Pricing adjustments aligned with expectations, showing a steady decline. The improvement in gross margins allowed the company to invest more in innovation, significantly boosting overall profitability. Operating profit reached €6.1 billion, marking a 17.1% year-over-year increase. Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) reported robust performance in its cash segment, with free cash flow reaching €2.2 billion during the period. By the end of the first half, the company’s cash and cash equivalents totaled €4.97 billion, an increase from €4.1 billion at the end of December 2023. It currently offers a quarterly dividend of $0.4755 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.2%, as of February 10. Overall, UL ranks 7th on our list of safest dividend stocks in the UK. While we acknowledge the potential for UL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than UL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

February 11, 2025 22:31 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Feb. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important March 25, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1.” Defendants’ statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants’ statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk’s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

February 11, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, Feb. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of TELUS International (Cda) Inc. (NYSE:TIXT), Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), and ModivCare, Inc. (NASDAQ: MODV). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. TELUS International (Cda) Inc. (NYSE:TIXT) Class Period: February 16, 2023 - August 1, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: March 31, 2025 The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants allegedly failed to disclose to investors: (1) the Company’s AI Data Solutions offerings required the cannibalization of its higher-margin offerings; (2) that Telus International’s declining profitability was tied to the Company’s drive to develop AI capabilities; (3) that Telus International’s shift toward AI put greater pressure on the Company’s margins than previously disclosed; and (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. For more information on the TELUS International class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/TIXT Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) Class Period: November 2, 2022 - December 19, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: March 25, 2025 The Complaint alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Novo Nordisk’s projected successful outcome of Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1,” while avoiding discussions centered around dosage tolerability; (2) Novo Nordisk’s repeated optimistic claims that CagriSema would achieve at least 25% weight loss in the REDEFINE-1 study fell short of reality; and (3) the utilization of the “flexible protocol” limited the study’s ability to effectively provide weight loss data on the dosage tested, suggesting either that tolerability was significantly worse than anticipated, resulting in patients titrating down their dosages to avoid complications, or that the patient selection process was rushed, leading to the onboarding of patients that did not desire to even achieve the 25% weight loss Novo Nordisk sought to demonstrate. For more information on the Novo Nordisk class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/NVO Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) Class Period: September 28, 2023 - December 18, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: March 10, 2025 The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants allegedly made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) demand for Micron's products in consumer markets, especially the Company's NAND products, had significantly deteriorated; (ii) accordingly, Defendants had overstated the extent to which demand for Micron's products had recovered, particularly in consumer markets and for its NAND products, and/or had overstated the sustainability of demand for such products, as well as the normalization of inventory for such products; and (iii) as a result, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. For more information on the Micron class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/MU ModivCare, Inc. (NASDAQ: MODV) Class Period: November 3, 2022 - September 15, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: March 31, 2025 The Class Action alleges that, during the Class Period, Defendants made misleading statements and omissions regarding the ability of its contracts to stabilize cash flow. As the alleged truth about ModivCare's business reached the market, the price of ModivCare's stock suffered significant declines, harming investors. For example, on September 16, 2024, before market hours, ModivCare filed a press release on a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission, titled "ModivCare Provides Financial Update." Therein, the Company revised its 2024 Adjusted EBITDA guidance range from $185-$195 million to $170-$180 million, "primarily due to NEMT segment pricing accommodations made to strategically retain and expand key customer relationships." On this news, the Company's stock price fell $1.40 or nearly 10%, from $14.12 per share on September 15, 2024, to close at $12.72 per share on September 16, 2024, on unusually high trading volume.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks fell on Wednesday as investors digested a hotter-than-expected January inflation reading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell around 0.8%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) slipped 1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) pulled back more than 1.1%. The January Consumer Price Index (CPI) out Wednesday showed headline consumer prices rose more than forecast in January as core prices reversed last month's easing. On a "core" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices in January climbed 0.4% over the prior month, higher than December's monthly gain, and 3.3% over last year, also up from last month. Read more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards The hotter-than-expected inflation reading pushed back investor bets on interest rate cuts in 2025. As of Wednesday morning, markets were pricing just one interest rate cut after pricing two for most of the year. At the same time, markets are on alert for more policy surprises from Trump, who is expected to announce reciprocal tariffs on many countries before the end of the week. Meanwhile, investors combed through a fresh batch of earnings for clues to Corporate America's resilience. Kraft Heinz (KHC) shares slid after the packaged food maker's 2025 profit outlook fell short. But CVS Health (CVS) stock got a boost as investors welcomed a smaller drop in quarterly profit than expected. On the after-hours docket, Reddit (RDDT) results come amid sky-high Wall Street expectations. Robinhood's (HOOD) report is also in focus after the stock touched a three-year high. US stocks fell on Wednesday as investors digested a hotter-than-expected January inflation reading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) were all off about 1%. New data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics out Wednesday showed that a key inflation metric rose more than anticipated in January. On a "core" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, the January Consumer Price Index (CPI) climbed 0.4% over the prior month, an acceleration from December's 0.2% monthly gain and above the 0.3% economists had expected. On an annual basis, prices rose 3.3%, above the 3.1% economists had projected. Headline consumer prices also rose more than expected. The CPI increased 3% over the prior year in January, an uptick from December's 2.9% annual gain in prices. The yearly increase was above the 2.9% economists had expected. The index rose 0.4% over the previous month, ahead of the 0.3% increase seen in November and also on par with economists' estimates. Read more here. The S&P 500's (^GSPC)' record run could face a setback, according to JPMorgan Market Intelligence. The team estimates the index may drop up to 2% if consumer prices (CPI) rise 0.4% or more in January from the previous month. With CPI data due at 8:30 a.m. New York time, markets are on edge. A slightly hotter print could challenge the bullish outlook on US equities. The consensus estimate is for a 0.3% rise in month-on-month CPI. Stocks in Europe trod water on Wednesday, mirroring the muted tone in markets as investors prepared for a fresh reading on US consumer inflation. The pan-European Stoxx 600 (^STOXX) index inched up less than 0.1%, staying in range of fresh record highs thanks to solid earnings from the likes of Heineken (HEIA.AS, HEINY). In individual benchmarks, Germany's DAX (^GDAXI) rose 0.3%, while the CAC (^FCHI) in Paris traded flat. London's FTSE 100 index (^FTSE) hugged the flat line. Gold (GC=F) continued to pull back from a recent all-time high on Wednesday, as traders assessed Jerome Powell's message that the Fed isn't in a hurry to cut interest rates. Prices of gold bullion dropped below $2,890 an ounce, falling for a second day, after a record-setting run toward the key $3,000 level. Meanwhile, gold futures slid almost 1% to around $2,906 an ounce, with the shine coming off the non-interest-bearing asset as the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) rose. Prices for the metal have surged in recent days as investors sought out less risky assets in light of President Trump's push for tariff hikes.

The trio's collaboration, which was detailed by the MoonPay President Keith Grossman on the ”When Shift Happens” podcast, required MoonPay CEO Ivan Soto-Wright to “sign away his life” and the company to “promise” it had no liens on its reserve funds. “The volumes were just gigantic,” Grossman said, “All of the liquidity that we use to sort of wire the crypto was locked in BlackRock accounts in a traditional finance sort of manner… and it's Saturday.” How to borrow $160m in $USDC on a holiday weekend @KeithGrossman, president of enterprise at @Moonpay, reveals the crazy story behind how he managed to borrow $160m with @novogratz and @bgarlinghouse’s help in order to make sure the $TRUMP launch would succeed… And the… pic.twitter.com/8zKugL2idN — MR SHIFT 🦁 (@KevinWSHPod) February 11, 2025 The crypto funds it did have handy were being used up rapidly thanks to the Trump meme coin team’s direction that users could use mobile meme coin trading app, Moonshot, for which MoonPay is the exclusive crypto payments provider. Moonshot simplifies the meme coin buying process, allowing users to sign up with an email address, and allowing them to fund their accounts with credit or debit cards. The app eschews the complexities that crypto novices may face with trading on-chain via decentralized exchanges, making it an ideal option for newcomers. Therefore, when new users were looking to buy the TRUMP token on the app, they were exchanging their funds for MoonPay’s crypto reserves, notably stablecoin USDC, which was then used to purchase Trump’s meme coin on the Solana blockchain. If the company didn't have the liquidity to continue facilitating purchases of the token, then new consumers—of which MoonPay says it onboarded 750,000 of during the week of the TRUMP launch—may not have been able to gain access to the token. That may have hindered the token’s rapid growth in the early days, and impacted other MoonPay users as well. Grossman said the app would’ve said, “Sorry, doesn’t work,” had MoonPay run out of funds. To avoid the issue, Grossman said that he and Soto-Wright worked with MoonPay CFO Mouna Siala to forecast the amount of funds it would require, with the initial estimate of $50 million quickly doubling to $100 million after reevaluating the token’s growth in the first 24 hours. With its reserves locked in traditional financial systems, Grossman said he texted Galaxy’s Mike Novogratz, and after a brief conversation, a loan was agreed upon and underway, forcing MoonPay’s teams to scramble on paperwork while verifying it had the funds to pay back a loan thanks to a connection through BlackRock. But the $100 million wasn’t enough. As demand continued to surge for TRUMP the following day, Grossman said that MoonPay turned to Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse. “We underestimated the demand of this Trump token,” the MoonPay team told Garlinghouse, per Grossman. The Ripple chief agreed to help if MoonPay could get Novogratz to agree to the arrangement, given the previous deal in place—and ultimately, Grossman said, the additional $60 million was sent by Ripple to Galaxy, and then ultimately transferred to MoonPay. As traditional financial players came online in Europe and the United States on the following Monday and Tuesday, MoonPay was able to reestablish access to its funds, paying back its loans in full by Tuesday afternoon according to Grossman. The TRUMP token saw more than $20 billion in trading volume on average across its first five days after launch, according to data from CoinGecko, growing quickly to a fully diluted valuation of more than $73 billion in less than 48 hours. In the days after its launch, Trump’s meme coin gained spot listings from notable centralized exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, further aiding the ability for inexperienced users to gain access to the token. A MoonPay representative confirmed to Decrypt that Grossman’s telling of the situation was accurate, though representatives from Galaxy and Ripple did not immediately reply to Decrypt’s requests for comment. TRUMP is now trading at $15.37, down more than 79% from its all time high.

Title: Gold Miners or NVIDIA? You Choose…
URL: https://dailyreckoning.com/gold-miners-or-nvidia-you-choose/
Time Published: 2025-02-11T23:00:56Z
Full Content:
By Greg Guenthner Posted February 11, 2025 You have a choice… You can either own Stock A that’s down 10% on the year amid negative headlines. Or you can own Stock B trading at record highs with a 17% return year-to-date. Perhaps it seems like a no-brainer. I prefer to buy strength and sell weakness, so I know I would take Stock B any day. Headlines aside, Stock A’s near-term drawdown puts it at a disadvantage right off the bat. Plus, I find it difficult to pass up new all-time highs. But once we pull back the curtain on our mystery stocks, the choice is far from cut and dry. If you haven’t already guessed, Stock A is Nvidia (NVDA), the market darling that has lost its sparkle. All eyes have been on NVDA for over a year, and it has only intensified (if that’s possible) following the DeepSeek fiasco. To be clear, I’m not bearish on Nvidia. I think it’s the same great company it was three weeks ago. I’m simply looking for opportunities that could provide strength and stability as uncertainty spreads across the market. Opportunities like Stock B: Alamos Gold (AGI). I know we’ve all had our fair share of war stories involving gold mining stocks. But before you start throwing rotten tomatoes, please hear me out… Gold is hitting record highs. And if the shiny yellow rock’s advance measures up to past secular bulls, this rally has legs! Check out the gold chart zoomed out to the mid-1970s. Notice the explosive rallies followed by prolonged trendless markets. After ripping roughly 750% during the 70s, gold went nowhere for my entire youth into early adulthood (almost 25 years). Of course, that changed during the 2000s when gold jumped from $250 bucks to $2,000. Another bout of lifeless action mired precious metal markets until last year. Today, gold is printing record highs. But it’s up a mere 150% off its 2015 low compared to the 650%+ gains of previous bull cycles. Some might attribute gold’s lackluster rally to the real store-of-value asset: Bitcoin. Perhaps. But I view Bitcoin and crypto generally as tech stocks. I’ve never noticed a sustained flight to safety into Bitcoin. Plus, crypto has a strong tendency to trend with the S&P 500 technology sector. My best guess as to why gold hasn’t hit $5k lands somewhere between “no one is paying attention” and “no one wants a dumb yellow rock.” Both work. However, rising gold prices will eventually capture more eyes creating a positive feedback loop as more investors turn to gold — ultimately Making Gold Great Again. Of course, by then it will be too late. Sure, you might capture the last leg or two of the rally, but you’ll also catch the increased volatility. The final stages of commodity bull markets are notoriously violent. Now is the time to consider precious metals, especially mining stocks. Here’s why… During the 2000s bull run, Hecla Mining (HL) gained 2,200% while Agnico Eagle Mines (AEM) cruised to a cool 3,300%. These numbers might sound similar to the performance of your favorite tech stock — and they should! Mining stocks become the ultimate speculative growth trade during gold bull markets. And most mining names are trading well below past cycle highs. Here’s gold and the Junior Gold Miners ETF (GDXJ) side by side: GDXJ has yet to break above its 2020 high, let alone its 2011 peak. Today, it’s bebopping around $50–$130 below its all-time high set during the last bull run. Imagine the face-ripping rallies across the mining space if and when GDXJ starts to catch toward gold. They’ll look just like Nvidia’s rally off the 2022 lows. A handful of names are already moving. Iamgold (IAG) has climbed 600% over the past two years and its rally has only accelerated since gold’s breakout last year. However, names such as IAG break the mold. The broader mining space has some serious ground to cover… You don’t need to chase $50M market-cap companies — or $500M market-cap companies for that matter. Plenty of solid businesses operate within the metal and mining space. Alamos Gold, Stock B from earlier, touts a $9B market cap. It’s also been around since 2003, which means it survived a full cycle. I like that! And, of course, it’s posting all-time highs. You could also keep it classy by trading one of the bellwethers, like Agnico Eagles Mines (AEM). It broke out of a multi-decade base last week to a new record high. Plus, it’s mined metals and minerals since 1957 and carries a market cap of $47.5B. If you’re feeling lucky and want to take a swing with a five-letter ticker, you will find plenty of gold miners to choose from. I prefer to sleep at night, so I lean toward the larger and more established companies. But Wesdome Gold Mines (WDOFF) is the exception as it teases fresh two-year highs. Could WDOFF post NVDA-like gains? It might if gold continues to rally. Bottom line: Taking a gold position today is taking a position in near-term strength. It’s buying an asset increasing in value — before the crowd shows up and spoils the fun. Don’t get me wrong, I like trading AI stocks as much as anyone else. I simply prefer holding the strongest assets as the market merry-go-round kicks into high gear.

Title: Dave Portnoy Holds Millions In Bitcoin And XRP, But Here's Why He Concluded His Heart Is 'Too Big For This Space'

Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy is doubling down on his commitment to the meme coin Stool Prisondente (CRYPTO: JAILSTOOL), even as traders question its future. What Happened: Portnoy, who initially invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in the token, insists he remains committed, despite the coin's struggles. In an X post Monday evening, he emphasized his dedication, saying, “The fact I'm still putting my own money into #Jailstool cause I don't want people losing money shows that my heart is too big for this stupid space. I need a blacker heart. Rise #Jailstool rise.” His statement comes after scrutiny from crypto traders, some of whom argue that Jailstool's decline has hurt retail investors. Don't Miss: Coinbase’s latest promo gets you up to $200 in crypto (Seriously!) — Here's everything you need to know to take advantage of this offer. ‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum. However, Portnoy maintains he's stayed true to his word, refusing to take early profits and continuing to support the project. "I put 100's of thousands of my own money into #Jailstool and promised up to 1 million more as it grew," Portnoy wrote in another post. "I coulda cashed out for 6 million. I didn't. But I'm not just gonna promote forever for free while sharks eat Minos. I've done exactly what I promised to do like I always do. 100% transparent." The price of Jailstool crashed around 82% on Monday evening European time to 2 cents, after making a high of 21 cents a day earlier, according to CoinGecko data. Trending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it? Why It Matters: Portnoy's approach has divided the crypto community. Some traders see his investment as a genuine attempt to back the community, while others remain skeptical about his long-term credibility in the space. Crypto analyst Stats said that Jailstool has nearly returned to its pre-promotion price, raising concerns about the effectiveness of Portnoy's marketing. "His marketing plays didn’t work out. People lost real money (which is 100% their own fault). But I think his credibility in this space is pretty ruined," he wrote. Others, like Kaleo, speculated that Portnoy might keep investing in Jailstool to try and stabilize its price. "With how much he’s talked about ‘not even thinking of selling this until it hits >$500M,' feels like there’s a solid chance he lets his pride get the best of him," Kaleo tweeted, predicting that if Portnoy loses money, he'll turn against meme coins altogether. See Also: BlackRock is calling 2025 the year of alternative assets. One firm from NYC has quietly built a group of 60,000+ investors who have all joined in on an alt asset class previously exclusive to billionaires like Bezos and Gates. Despite the backlash, Portnoy remains a major investor in Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and XRP (CRYPTO: XRP), recently revealing that he holds $1.5 million in Bitcoin and $1.3 million in XRP. His Bitcoin investment followed a conversation with Strategy Inc. (NASDAQ:MSTR) chairman Michael Saylor, who convinced him of Bitcoin's long-term value. During their interview, Saylor explained Bitcoin through sports analogies, saying, "Satoshi created a game that is rigged in favor of the individual... Bitcoin is that game." Portnoy, once a skeptic, has since embraced Bitcoin, stating, "I’m gonna bet it and set it, not trading." However, his latest Jailstool debacle has reignited doubts about his role in crypto, with many traders now questioning whether he should be taken seriously in the space.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Top 10 AI Stocks to Watch In February. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against other top AI stocks to watch in February. Barry Bannister, Stifel’s chief equity strategist, said in a latest program on CNBC that the macroeconomic factors are finally catching up to the AI-led bull market. He expects inflation to remain sticky and no further rate cuts from the Federal Reserve in the short term. The analyst also rejected the notion that the massive tech selloff after the launch of DeepSeek was a buying opportunity. “Over 30 years ago, we used to joke about how technology was such a displacement event business where new competitors would come in and destroy the entrenched stocks, that it deserved a lower multiple because of that. It’s a short life cycle business that’s got a very short competitive advantage period. But investors forgot about that. They bid up the stocks. The growth relative to value large-cap total return, one divided by the other on a 10-year compound basis, reached the absolute outer limits of the past 90 years. And that exact limit line is exactly where it peaked—the price earnings multiple and the outperformance of growth. So, for us, it’s just a very bubbly market that’s just gotta take some air out of it.” READ ALSO 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we chose 10 AI stocks currently making moves in the market. With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Copyright: prykhodov / 123RF Stock Photo Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 286 Jessica Inskip, Director of Investor Research at StockBrokers, explained in a latest program on Schwab Network her top three reasons to be bullish on Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). “I really do like Amazon, and there’s three primary reasons. First and foremost, of course, is AI. They have AI-driven cloud growth as AI agents are being developed, and that’s extremely important. The other is the impending TikTok ban. A ban may not be imminent, but platform diversification certainly is. One of the next innovations that I think we’ll see with the e-commerce space is the use of short-form video. That’s the next innovation that could lead to retail margin expansion with e-commerce sales from the Amazon front. Then the third, and maybe overlooked, is the AWS operational cost. I think that would be lowered actually with a stronger US dollar. The US dollar, as we see, is strengthening. I heard your previous guest even say that as well, and since many of AWS’s operational costs tend to be outside of the US, therefore that stronger dollar would actually just naturally help lower those operational costs. So, a lot working for Amazon in terms of margin expansion.” Simply beating earnings estimates is not enough for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) anymore, and the impact of high expectations will continue to weigh on the stock as growth cools. Nvidia’s forward P/E ratio for the fiscal year ending January 2026 is around 31. An EPS surprise of 8.5% was not able to help the stock. A similar trend occurred following the second-quarter earnings after a 5.6% EPS surprise. It’s difficult to see Nvidia maintaining a mid-70s gross margin by the end of 2026. Over the last two quarters, Nvidia has already reported a drop in its gross margin from 78% to 74.5%. Then there’s competition. Amazon (AMZN) recently disclosed its Trainium 3 chip, which is set to be released by the end of 2025. The chip is expected to be twice as fast with 40% more power efficiency than the previous generation, manufactured on TSMC’s (TSM) cutting-edge N3 technology. Vulcan Value Partners stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q4 2024 investor letter: “There were five material contributors to performance: Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Salesforce Inc., Live Nation Entertainment Inc., Carlyle Group Inc., and Alphabet Inc. Amazon.com is a dominant, world class company with powerful secular tailwinds in place including its e-commerce penetration, digital advertising growth, and the cloud transition. Amazon reported strong results during the quarter. The market is beginning to reward the company for its untapped margin opportunity in the core retail business as its consolidated operating margins expanded.” Overall, AMZN ranks 1st on our list of top AI stocks to watch in February. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Square Online

You’ve probably been on the customer side of the Square Online e-commerce platform many times, whether tapping your card on a Square terminal in a coffee shop or buying items from an online store. Square is just as easy to use on the business side. You can start selling products within minutes of signing up, and the service's many store customization options, handy photo editing app, unlimited storage and bandwidth, social media integrations, and robust video tutorials make it easy to recommend. However, Square Online has one weak spot compared with the competition: Its 24/7 customer support is paywalled behind its most expensive tier. Our Editors' Choice winners for e-commerce, Shopify and Wix Stores, pull slightly ahead with their around-the-clock customer service across all plans. Square has three e-commerce tiers: Free, Plus, and Premium. The Free tier is good if you want to test the e-commerce waters and don't mind the inability to apply your company's brand. Free subscribers get SEO tools, and the ability to sync with Square POS terminals, sell on social media, and accept card payments. However, Free lacks Square’s robust website themes, meaning you're locked to its default aesthetic. Strangely, Free subscribers cannot set item quantity limits, so a single customer can clear your stock. Despite Square’s Free tier being fairly lightweight regarding features, it stands apart from the competition by simply existing. The cheapest tiers for Shopify and Wix start at $29 and $27, respectively, per month. Neither has a free version. Next is the Plus tier, which costs $29 per month. This plan lets you leverage Square's website design tools and themes to give your online shop a unique visual identity. In addition, you can create customer accounts, whip up QR codes for items like menus and pre-orders, or create subscriptions. Helpful analytics and statistics are available when you need a deep dive into sales data. Building upon Plus, the Premium tier costs $79 per month and offers real-time shipping rates. It's also the tier where the walled-off 24/7 customer support kicks in (more on that in a bit). Premium has unlimited storage and monthly data transfers like every other Square tier. Square charges 2.9% and 30 cents per transaction. The Premium tier drops the rate to 2.6% plus 20 cents per transaction. You can sample the Free plan using Square's 14-day trial. However, the trial isn't available with paid plans unless you do a workaround by signing up for Free and then upgrading. The trial requires you to keep a credit card on file. Once you select a tier and create login credentials, Square asks basic questions to determine how your customers receive their orders (shipping via Square, pickup, or in-house delivery). After that, Square presents its dashboard. This dashboard is sleek and easy to navigate. In a nice touch, it has a video tutorial checklist that walks you through the packing, shipping, and customization options. I appreciated that the tutorials were front and center. Plus and Premium members can build their websites using templates. Once you select one, you can customize the website for web and mobile use. You can apply different fonts and colors, add drop shadows to your buttons, and round out the corners of your windows—it all gets pretty granular. The stock template options are attractive, but it's good to know you can tailor them to your brand's specificities. The most important feature of an e-commerce platform is the ability to upload items to your stock. Square Online makes this a breeze. Clicking the Items tab takes you to your backend catalog, where you can add digital and physical items to your shop. Photo Studio by Square is a companion app for iOS devices (it lacks an Android version). It's included with your subscription and is useful for snapping product photos. You can easily photograph an item, remove the background, change the background to a preset image, and even add effects like a drop shadow. Afterward, simply add the product's price and description, and upload the data to the online store. Photo Studio and Square Online sync almost instantly. Although it's not an Adobe Photoshop replacement, the app does the job if you don't need studio-quality images. That said, a cheap lightbox and an iPhone can take you a long way. Square accepts all major credit cards, Square gift cards, Apple Pay, and Google Pay. The e-commerce platform also accepts Square POS, a system that simplifies importing orders, items, and inventory. In addition, Square Online has an application programming interface (API), so developers can create third-party add-ons outside the Square App Marketplace. If you don't want to do that, the Square App Marketplace contains dozens of apps in 16 categories, including Accounting, Booking & Scheduling, and Loyalty & Rewards. Website uptime is one of the most important aspects of an online store. If your site is down, clients or customers cannot find you or access your products or services. Square strives for 100% guaranteed uptime, but the company acknowledges it's an impossible promise. To mitigate this, Square offers transparency by letting you know when outages occur. Subscribers can sign up for downtime alerts, and Square's hardware lets you accept payments in an offline mode. Square also has a website, isSquareUp.com, that lets you check for outages. If you’re having an issue with your online store, you need help quickly. Square Online has customer support, but you can only access its phone lines from Monday to Friday, 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. PT, if you have the Free or Plus plans. You can contact Square via email (the company's website says a response may take 24 to 48 hours) or web chat (which leverages a bot to answer questions outside of phone support hours). If you have the Premium tier, you can access 24/7 customer support. It's good that perk exists for those who pony up, but I'd like to see all subscribers receive this benefit. Shopify and Wix Stores have that, after all. With user-friendly features that empower you tailor your online store to your exact specifications, Square Online is an attractive service for any business. It's an especially easy sell if you're already invested in the Square ecosystem. The main drawback is limited customer service hours unless you subscribe to the Premium tier. Thanks to 24/7 customer support with every tier, Shopify and Wix Stores inch past Square to remain our Editors' Choice winners. PCMag is obsessed with culture and tech, offering smart, spirited coverage of the products and innovations that shape our connected lives and the digital trends that keep us talking.

Title: Elon Musk’s Now $42 Billion Poorer This Month—As Scrutiny On Trump Ties Grows

Tesla stock’s steep losses in early 2025 have cut tens of billions of dollars away from the net worth of the world’s richest man, the electric vehicle maker’s CEO Elon Musk, whose outspoken role in President Donald Trump’s administration draws questions about what it may mean for Tesla. Musk talks at an October rally for Trump in New York. Shares of Tesla declined 6.3% to $328.50 in Tuesday trading, closing at its lowest share price since Nov. 15. Catalyzing Tuesday’s drop were advancements in autonomous driving from its Chinese EV rival BYD and a skeptical note from Oppenheimer analysts led by Colin Rusch warning Musk’s “political activity risks consumer backlash.” The Oppenheimer note, which referenced “concerning” January sales in China and Europe, comes a day after Stifel analysts led by Stephen Gengaro similarly warned “the negative downturn in consumers' perception of Elon Musk could result in a ‘headwind to sales’ for Tesla,” which inspired a 3% loss in Monday trading for Tesla shares. Tesla stock is now down 18.8%, or more than $76 per share, in February, declining almost 32% from its all-time closing high of $479.86 set Dec. 17. Nobody has been affected more on a gross basis by the Tesla slump than its largest shareholder, Musk, who owns nearly 13% of the company and a further 9% equity award pending legal appeal (Forbes discounts Musk’s 9% bonus by 50% in its valuation to reflect its legal uncertainty). Musk was worth $378.8 billion Tuesday, according to Forbes’ latest calculations – a $42.8 billion decrease from his $421.6 billion net worth at the end of January – though he remains about $130 billion wealthier than the next richest person on the planet, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. $12.5 billion. That’s how much Musk’s fortune declined during Tuesday’s Tesla slump as the 53-year-old registered his lowest end-of-day net worth since Dec. 10. The Oppenheimer analysts wrote they believe “Musk's political activity has fans in certain circles, but that his public life risks alienating consumers and employees as the Trump administration tests the limits of its power.” Musk’s more than $150 billion estimated Tesla stake is the biggest contributor to his net worth, while his stakes in his private multi-billion-dollar companies SpaceX, X and xAI make up a majority of the rest of his fortune. Tesla stock is still up about 30% since Election Day, though the initial rally has lost steam as the company’s fourth-quarter earnings fell short of Wall Street consensus forecasts and its car sales in Europe and China declined. After donating nearly $290 million toward Trump and other GOP causes ahead of the 2024 election, Musk has played a critical role in the opening weeks of Trump’s second term, most notably heading the DOGE agency aimed at significantly pulling back the federal government’s footprint. Musk submitted a $97.4 billion bid Monday to buy the nonprofit arm of OpenAI, a competitor to his generative artificial intelligence startup, led by rival Sam Altman. Musk’s offer is “a distraction from TSLA's challenges,” wrote Rusch. Musk and Altman cofounded OpenAI in 2015 before a messy breakup over the company’s mission. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: This corner of the stock market could be an under-the-radar winner of the AI spending boom

Wall Street is assessing the impact of Big Tech's massive capex plans for this year, but there is another corner of the stock market that's set to benefit from big AI spending, Morgan Stanley said. According to Morgan Stanley, the spending race among AI "hyperscalers" is an overlooked tailwind for retail sector stocks like Walmart and Target. "Retail is on the cusp of a technology leap with AI, data, and automation. While retailers may not pursue AI infrastructure investments similar to tech companies, the tech capex boom suggests retailers are on the verge of and should benefit from a technology inflection," equity analyst Simeon Gutman wrote. This year's combined $300 billion of announced AI investing between Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta, might not seem like a development set to directly impact retailers, but Morgan Stanley predicts is is likely to lead to a boost in capex among retailers who can afford it. That's as the spending boom will offer big-box stores investing opportunities to improve in-store experiences, advertising, and automation. Those best equipped to invest will see market shares gain, a trend likely to appear amid coming earnings reports. "The big should keep getting bigger and at a faster pace," the analysts wrote. Capital expenditures among retailers are projected to reach $55 billion, marking an average of around 7% year-on-year growth in 2025. Walmart, Costco, Target, Kroger, and Home Depot account for about 69% of total spend in hard, soft, and food retail. Walmart will lead the cohort in capex spening. Estimated to spend $22 billion this year, Walmart's expenditures are four times larger than what Costco is forecast to spend. Bank of America holds a $110 price target for Walmart stock, expecting improved profitability as well as digital advertising and marketplace growth. One challenge could pose a risk Gutman's thesis — cheaper AI allows smaller retailers to join in on AI growth. The possibility has emerged amid the recent introduction of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI that is supposedly cheaper and as capable as Silicon Valley tech. Its implications have sparked doubt about Big Tech's AI spending, briefly causing a trillion-dollar market wipeout last month. If DeepSeek does discount AI expenditures, under-the-radar retail names aren't the only ones set to win out. This scenario would make software stocks also worth buying. "That said, we do not think this will be the case in the near-term and, for now, retailers best equipped to spend should be able to widen their advantages," Gutman wrote.

Title: 3 new reasons to dump Magnificent 7 stocks

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. With the often-hot Magnificent Seven trade on the skids less than two months into the year, it may be time to exit stage left before the selling picks up. "Over the last several years we have maintained the view, that it was prudent for long-only US equity managers to be at least market-weight the Mag 7. Today, our views have evolved to the point where we are changing our mind and believe lowering exposure is prudent," Trivariate Research founder and CEO Adam Parker said in a new note Tuesday. The Magnificent Seven trade of Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) has underwhelmed of late. Only one of the big-cap tech components — Meta — has posted double-digit gains out of the box, more in line with the sector's usual strong performance. Amazon is the only other Mag Seven component to be up on the year to the tune of 5.2%, slightly ahead of the 3.5% increase for the S&P 500 (^GSPC). Alphabet, Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Tesla are all down year to date, with an average drop of 3% based on Yahoo Finance's calculations. Tesla is the worst performer, off by 17% this year. Reasons for the sell-off range from weakening sales (Tesla) to rising fears tech companies are spending too much to build AI infrastructure (the rest of the Mag Seven). Veteran markets expert Parker thinks now is a good time for investors to reduce exposure for three reasons. For one, the Street is unlikely to stop scrutinizing how much is being spent on capex for AI in 2025 and 2026. Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet are slated to spend a cumulative $325 billion in capital expenditures and investments this year, Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports. This would mark a 46% increase year over year for the four tech stalwarts. Amazon alone sees $104 billion in capital expenditures this year, well above prior analyst forecasts of $80 billion to $85 billion. The stocks have tended to react negatively to these bold spending commitments, points out Parker. "There is no question either way that the high capital spending will continue to come under increasing scrutiny until investors can better understand the return on today’s massive investments," says Parker. Valuation on Mag Seven stocks — despite their sell-off — also remains a concern for Parker. Parker's research shows the relative price to forward earnings multiple of the Mag Seven versus the rest of the S&P 500 is at a 42% premium. That's toward the upper range of its 25-year average. Warns Parker, "The high beta and increasingly high capital intensity combined with the elevated valuation of the Magnificent 7 is, in our judgment, an increasing cause for concern." Podcast: Buy, sell, or hold Mag 7 darling Nvidia? And lastly, the stocks just look too over-owned by investors. "We are apprehensive of the elevated beta-adjusted exposure of the Mag 7 vs. the top 500 US equities excluding the Mag-7. Today, the aggregate exposure of the Mag 7 is 31.3%, or almost a third of the market cap opportunity is Mag-7. However, on a beta-adjusted basis the current exposure of the Mag-7 is 44.7%. This means that a portfolio manager who owns in market-weight all the Magnificent 7 stocks has nearly half their fund’s beta-adjusted exposure in these stocks! This remains near highs of the last 25 years," Parker said. One bonus reason Yahoo Finance found when studying Parker's research: The stocks have an outsized exposure to all-out Wall Street bullishness. Only 4.8% of the 504 analyst recommendations on the Mag Seven are a Sell, Parker's team found. With the investment thesis on the Mag Seven changing, the uber-bullishness could prove to be misaligned with reality. — Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Reasons for the sell-off range from weakening sales (Tesla) to rising fears tech companies are spending too much to build AI infrastructure (the rest of the Mag Seven). Veteran markets expert Parker thinks now is a good time for investors to reduce exposure for three reasons. For one, the Street is unlikely to stop scrutinizing how much is being spent on capex for AI in 2025 and 2026. Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet are slated to spend a cumulative $325 billion in capital expenditures and investments this year, Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports. This would mark a 46% increase year over year for the four tech stalwarts. Amazon alone sees $104 billion in capital expenditures this year, well above prior analyst forecasts of $80 billion to $85 billion. The stocks have tended to react negatively to these bold spending commitments, points out Parker. "There is no question either way that the high capital spending will continue to come under increasing scrutiny until investors can better understand the return on today’s massive investments," says Parker. Valuation on Mag Seven stocks — despite their sell-off — also remains a concern for Parker. Parker's research shows the relative price to forward earnings multiple of the Mag Seven versus the rest of the S&P 500 is at a 42% premium. That's toward the upper range of its 25-year average. Warns Parker, "The high beta and increasingly high capital intensity combined with the elevated valuation of the Magnificent 7 is, in our judgment, an increasing cause for concern." Podcast: Buy, sell, or hold Mag 7 darling Nvidia? And lastly, the stocks just look too over-owned by investors. "We are apprehensive of the elevated beta-adjusted exposure of the Mag 7 vs. the top 500 US equities excluding the Mag-7. Today, the aggregate exposure of the Mag 7 is 31.3%, or almost a third of the market cap opportunity is Mag-7. However, on a beta-adjusted basis the current exposure of the Mag-7 is 44.7%. This means that a portfolio manager who owns in market-weight all the Magnificent 7 stocks has nearly half their fund’s beta-adjusted exposure in these stocks! This remains near highs of the last 25 years," Parker said. One bonus reason Yahoo Finance found when studying Parker's research: The stocks have an outsized exposure to all-out Wall Street bullishness. Only 4.8% of the 504 analyst recommendations on the Mag Seven are a Sell, Parker's team found. With the investment thesis on the Mag Seven changing, the uber-bullishness could prove to be misaligned with reality. — Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

CLARY/AFP via Getty Images) Are you getting over a *cough cough* cold today? If so, you’re one of the 22.6 million U.S. employees who were planning to miss work the Monday after the Super Bowl, a 40% increase from last year, according to The Harris Poll data from UKG. That number includes folks who planned to call in sick––even if they aren’t actually ill––as well as those who planned to “ghost” their employer by skipping work and not telling them. Some have pre-planned their absence, with 12.9 million taking PTO and 4.8 million swapping shifts with coworkers. Even then, an additional 12.9 million said they would be late to work on Monday. Talk about last-minute play calls. For those who did show up to work, productivity may have been down to start the week. The poll found that about 40% of those who watched the game and went to work would be distracted by media coverage of the game on Monday, up from 28% last year. While the scale of these absences is record-breaking, the phenomenon isn’t new. About 43% of employed Americans believe the Monday after the Super Bowl should be a national holiday. Indiana is even taking steps to enshrine that idea into law: A bill was introduced in the state’s legislature last week that would make the day a state holiday. The number of workers calling out sick on Monday wasn’t the only record broken during the Super Bowl: While the Kansas City Chiefs failed to beat the Philadelphia Eagles to secure a three-peat, the game was the most-watched matchup in Super Bowl history. Fox garnered 126 million viewers across platforms, including its free streaming service Tubi. Happy reading, and hope you all have a lovely week!

Deep Dive: Employee Confidence Starts The Year On A Sour Note Employee confidence on their employer's business outlook has fallen to a February 2024 low, driven by economic fears and a new presidential administration. One month into 2025 and employees are not confident in the business outlook for their employers, according to a new Glassdoor report. Layoffs, economic fears and a new presidential administration are to blame. It’s a new year and employee confidence is once again going down. According to Glassdoor’s employee confidence index, which measures workers’ ratings of their employer’s six-month business outlook (either positive, negative or neutral), only 45.1% of U.S. employees have a positive view on their employer’s future. That’s the lowest percentage since last February, when the index hit its lowest since Glassdoor began tracking it in 2016. The weak sentiment comes on the heels of January’s jobs report that saw 143,000 non-farm jobs get added to the economy, lower than analyst expectations. It’s part of the reason as to why sentiment is low––economic anxieties, which rose in January, and news of layoffs have rattled workers. Those working in government and public administration positions lost the most confidence, according to Glassdoor, falling 2.8 percentage points compared to December. The legality of various Trump Administration policies affecting federal workers, including buyout offers, funding cuts and the effective closure of entire agencies like USAID, have made federal workers uneasy about their future. Full return-to-office plans and funding for state offices has also been put into question. That’s without counting the impact on federal contractors who’ve had their contracts and funding frozen, if not cut completely. Other industries, however, have seen an increase in confidence compared to last year. Insurance saw the biggest gain during a month filled with news of natural disasters and subsequent coverage questions. Aerospace and defense also saw a 5% increase in confidence from last year. Employee confidence levels also tend to differ based on seniority. Mid-level employees continue to feel the most anxious about the future and experienced the largest drop-off in confidence compared to other seniority levels, according to the data. In efforts to reduce costs and flatten out organizations, middle managers are often the first on the chopping block. News from the world of work “Financial loyalty at VC firms has never been weaker,” an endowment leader recently told Forbes. It’s part of a larger movement of venture capital partners leaving blue-chip firms (think Lightspeed, Sequoia and a16z) to start their own funds. Meet venture’s new guard. The U.S. added 143,000 non-farm jobs in January, lower than analysts estimated and the weakest January total since 2016. Unemployment, however, topped expectations, though January did mark the ninth-consecutive month of at least 4% unemployment. These numbers are more of an indicator of the job market President Trump is inheriting, rather than any impact he’s had on it thus far. While at least 65,000 federal workers have accepted the “deferred resignation” offer from the new administration, the deadline was again paused by a federal judge on Monday until the president “responds” to the issues at the heart of the several lawsuits brought on by federal workers unions. Google is the latest major employer to roll back its DEI initiatives. On Wednesday, the company said it would remove all of its diversity hiring targets, before removing cultural observances like Pride Month and Black History Month from Google Calendar. All in all, over a dozen major companies have pared back or removed references to DEI in their 2024 annual reports. Amazon employees are increasingly worried about their career trajectories as the company flattens middle management roles in an effort to cut costs, according to Bloomberg. Those looking to climb the corporate ladder have been told to consider “horizontal development,” in other words, acquiring different skills with no promotion. Are workplace feuds the new trend for increased PR? Billionaires Elon Musk and Sam Altman have been squabbling it out in the media over the funding to President Trump’s Stargate program. While their supposed feud dates back to 2015, when both Altman and Musk were among the cofounders of OpenAI, the public comments picked up again this year. Meanwhile, Super Bowl halftime performer Kendrick Lamar’s feud with Drake not only took center stage on Sunday, but has also won the rapper multiple Grammy Awards.

Title: The Raging Debate: When Will Quantum Arrive?

IBM CEO Arvind Krishna There has been considerable discussion and stock price volatility of late surrounding the expected timing of useful applications and hardware for quantum computing. One month after Google created excitement around its Willow quantum chip, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, started a food fight on Wall Street by predicting that quantum computing won’t be a significant computing paradigm for at least a decade. Quantum stocks dropped over 30%. Subsequently, Bill Gates joined in, saying, “There is the possibility that the [Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang] Not one to wade into a shouting match, IBM (a client of Cambrian-AI Research) has been quietly and steadily advancing quantum computing sciences and use cases, as explained in a series of webinars, covering quantum applications in energy, financial modeling, electronics, and health care. Last year, IBM also published the 4th edition of a dazzling coffee table book on the coming Quantum Decade. IBM probably has hundreds of scientists working on quantum developing hardware, software, and ecosystems to lead in this exotic technology. While IBM and other quantum innovators like Microsoft, Google, AWS, and startups see hundreds of applications in development today, Zuckerberg and Huang are probably looking for big-impact applications. And there aren’t any, at least not yet. The current quantum applications being developed fill specific scientific niches with little industrial and economic impact. They are important niches to the scientists who can now solve previously unsolvable problems, but they may not constitute another multi-billion-dollar market. Those applications will take much faster quantum computers and new algorithms that can exploit the hardware. IBM and its competitors are developing hardware, software tools, and algorithms that could deliver those billion-dollar applications in the next 5-10 years. Specific uses of quantum computing in physics and chemistry are already pushing research forward. Still, these experiments demand faster hardware, error correction, and new algorithms beyond the R&D setting. IBM thinks it can achieve quantum advantage sometime in the next two years - via improved performance and error mitigation techniques and increased collaboration with the HPC community. IBM also announced its plans to reach over 2,000 logical qubits. True error correction should arrive in 2029 with the Starling processor, followed by the Blue Jay processor, with 2,000 logical qubits and over a billion gates in 2033. Quantum is hard; extremely hard. Advances in cryogenics, qubit design, scaling interconnects, algorithm development, run-time tools, and applications will enable useful and perhaps pervasive quantum solutions. The inherent error rate of quantum bits is a thousand times higher than that of digital circuitry. Consequently, scaling quantum processors to thousands of qubits and dealing with the instability of those qubits creates demanding challenges. Useful Quantum Computing requires advances in the hardware and the algorithms But we are getting close to realizing significant advances as these developments take shape. The chart above explains the dynamics at play. We are currently at the beginning of quantum utility, where we can begin to see the benefits of hardware and algorithms as we progress. All quantum industry players including IBM, Amazon, Intel, Google, Microsoft, hardware startups (Alice and Bob, Atos D-Wave, Quantinuum, Rigetti, QuEra and Xanadu among others) are amongst the over 70 global quantum startups working on solving these challenges. Along the way, advances in quantum are supported and complemented by advances in classic HPC computing to support the execution of the circuits by offloading some of the execution onto the CPU and GPU or using those tools to clean the results. In fact, accelerated servers surround quantum processors, always working in tandem with classical computers In IBM’s most recent webinar, we learned how researchers apply quantum to solve Life Sciences and Health Care problems. One of the brightest application spaces for quantum is accelerating the R&D process for pharmaceuticals. The current process takes 10-15 years, billions of dollars, and yet 90% of drug candidates fail. Quantum and AI can potentially speed the process, cost less, and produce superior outcomes, potentially becoming the billion-dollar solution that Jensen and Zuckerburg seek. In drug discovery, quantum computing can speed the development and evaluation of proteins through simulation and applying machine learning. Quantum computers have the potential to simulate complex molecular interactions at an atomic level with unprecedented accuracy, allowing researchers to model drug-protein interactions more realistically, leading to the discovery of novel therapeutic compounds. Quantum algorithms have the potential to search vast chemical databases much faster than classical computers, enabling rapid identification of potential drug candidates that match specific molecular criteria. Quantum computers can also identify optimal molecular structures for specific targets, leading to improved efficacy and reduced toxicity of potential drugs. Quantum computing could speed up the screening of vast libraries of potential drug candidates, allowing researchers to quickly identify promising molecules for further testing. Quantum computing has the potential to model complex protein folding patterns and interactions at a molecular level, helping researchers identify novel drug targets that were previously undetectable. IBM is researching the applicability of quantum computing across the broad spectrum of drug ... [+] development and delivery, Quantum computing holds the potential to revolutionize healthcare and life sciences by addressing key challenges in the field. For example, quantum algorithms can integrate data to uncover critical genes, proteins, and pathways. Quantum walks can identify key proteins in cancer signaling pathways, aiding in the development of targeted therapies. Additionally, quantum methods speed the discovery of higher-order gene interactions, accelerating the understanding of polygenic diseases. Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms enhance predictions of protein and RNA structures, which are crucial for designing biologics and mRNA therapies. Quantum techniques also improve ligand-based virtual screening and simulate drug-target interactions with unprecedented accuracy, enabling better lead optimization. In clinical trials, quantum algorithms can optimize trial designs, site selection, and cohort identification, reducing costs and improving outcomes. The webinar showcased several collaborative success stories where IBM has partnered with industry leaders to demonstrate the potentially transformative power of quantum computing. A few examples: Client use cases To accelerate industry adoption further, IBM has launched the Quantum Accelerator program, which helps enterprises identify business problems suitable for quantum solutions, prototype quantum applications iteratively, and leverage IBM’s ecosystem of over 250 members and 39 innovation centers. This program is designed to support the enterprise during all their journey of quantum adoption. If you ask IBM, they will tell you it already has, albeit in small doses, while the potential wave of quantum applications will begin in earnest around 2030. Whether that is early or late depends on your expectations, and Jensen and Zuckerberg are famously impatient guys. We believe that quantum computing is poised to transform healthcare and life sciences by addressing computational bottlenecks and enabling groundbreaking innovations. From understanding disease mechanisms to optimizing drug discovery pipelines, IBM quantum’s advancements promise to unlock unprecedented opportunities in the pharmaceutical industry, reducing R&D costs, accelerating timelines, and improving patient outcomes.

Title: How Tariffs Make CFOs’ Jobs More Complex

Plus: Consumers Feel Economic Change Slowly, Planned Aluminum And Steel Tariffs Rile Allies, Vought Uses OMB To Halt CFPB, Tech Companies Invest In AI Infrastructure There’s been a huge amount of change in the last month, and from an economic standpoint, it seems to be hitting consumers slowly, but surely. Job growth is stuck, prices don’t seem to be going anywhere, and many feel they are financially worse off than a year ago. January’s jobs data from the Labor Department, released last week, significantly missed growth projections and signified the weakest start to a year in terms of new jobs since 2016. Economists were expecting 170,000 new jobs, but the report showed the addition of just 143,000. And the expectation of job losses is growing. In the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations, released this week, 14.2% of people feel a probability of losing their jobs in the next 12 months, up 2.3% from December. About a third of consumers said their household financial situation is worse off than a year ago, the Survey of Consumer Expectations shows. And while this is down slightly month-over-month, only about 19% say they are doing better than a year ago—a 3% decrease from December. Over a fifth aren’t optimistic about the economy and say they will be doing worse a year from now. January’s Consumer Confidence Index, reported two weeks ago, showed a 5.4-point decline from December. The data shows some optimism. Labor Department data showed record-high average hourly wages of $35.87, as well as an unemployment rate of 4%, down from 4.1% in December. And 36.6% feel their household finances will be better a year from now, according to the Survey of Consumer Expectations. However, there’s lots of room for improvement. Two-thirds of Americans feel that President Donald Trump administration’s policy focus so far isn’t doing enough to lower prices, according to a CBS News/YouGov poll last week. The next round of consumer price index numbers come out this week, which will show just how much prices are changing—though the consumer expectations survey shows that Americans anticipate price increases for food, gas, rent and medical care. CFOs are increasingly having issues with making projections since so many companies rely on imports, and so many different tariff threats are being quickly proposed, rescinded and taking effect. I talked to Bob Stark, global head of enablement of cash management software platform Kyriba, about how CFOs can plan in today’s circumstances. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. Workers in Camden, N.J. use a crane to load a 60,000 pound coil of steel onto a railroad car. President Donald Trump signed another round of tariffs this week: 25% on all steel and aluminum imports. “This is a big deal, the beginning of making America rich again,” Trump said as he signed the tariff orders in the Oval Office, CBS News reported. This is a familiar policy to Trump, who assessed tariffs on steel and aluminum in his first term to bolster domestic industry. Those tariffs—25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports—had several exemptions, and ended up bringing the biggest benefit to steel companies, according to a 2018 analysis from the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Allies from the EU and Australia spoke out about the planned tariffs, which are reported to go into effect next month, saying that they will harm U.S. consumers and long-established partnerships. The U.S. imports about a quarter of all of the steel it uses, and about half of the aluminum, Reuters reports. Most of the steel the U.S. imports comes from Canada, Brazil and Mexico, while the lion’s share of aluminum imports come from Canada. Several analysts have said these new tariffs will have limited benefit to the U.S.—likely just for the steel companies—and will not likely create jobs. They are also likely to raise prices for most things made from metal. Even the United Steelworkers International Union feels the tariff proposal goes too far, and wrote the U.S. needs to take a more measured approach, distinguishing trusted trade partners. The move caused significant shifts in the stock market, boosting prices of domestic metals companies, including Alcoa and U.S. Steel. It also boosted gold prices to a record high of $2,938 per troy ounce, as investors search for stability. This isn’t the only move on tariffs in the last week. Trump announced during a Friday meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba that he would announce reciprocal tariffs this week—tariffs equal to what other countries impose on U.S. goods. There’s no word yet on how those might work. Russell Vought at a confirmation hearing in January in front of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. Last Thursday, the Senate confirmed Russell Vought as the head of the Office of Management and Budget with a vote along party lines. Vought, founder of the prominent right-wing Center for Renewing America and key adviser to the Heritage Foundation’s controversial Project 2025, was considered one of Trump’s more controversial nominees because of his viewpoint of expansive executive branch control on spending. One of his first big moves is essentially halting all work of the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, taking its website offline and telling workers not come in and stop work activities. The CFPB was created in 2011 following the Great Recession and financial crisis. It’s an agency that protects consumers from unfair banking practices, but it also has deep-pocketed enemies. Elon Musk, who has been working with his Department of Government Efficiency task force to mercilessly cut perceived wasteful spending, has railed against CFPB because “there are too many duplicative regulatory agencies.” He said this in November, shortly after the agency announced more oversight of big tech companies and others offering digital funds transfers and payment wallet apps. Meta founder and CEO and billionaire Marc Andreessen also have spoken out against the agency, which has threatened action against tech companies’ use of financial data. Rendering of Meta's Sucre data center in Louisiana. AI evangelists say the technology can do a lot for companies, but to continue to grow—both revenues for companies and capabilities for users—some infrastructure investments are needed. Big companies are announcing bigger AI data center projects, with bigger budgets and footprints. Forbes’ Christopher Helman runs down many of these plans, which include not only huge facilities like Meta’s $10 billion planned Sucré data center in Louisiana—covering 4 million square feet of floor space on 2,250 acres—but enough infrastructure to power it all—$3.2 billion worth for Meta, coming from twin high-efficiency natural gas turbines. In all, Meta plans to spend $60 to $65 billion on these data centers in the next year. Meta’s not alone in these investments. Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google parent Alphabet, announced on last week’s earnings call that the next year will see about $75 billion in capital expenditures for technical infrastructure. CFO Anat Ashkenazi said that in the last quarter Google hit capacity issues with its cloud and services business, which constrained its growth. Microsoft is planning to invest $80 billion in data centers. And through a partnership announced from the White House between SoftBank, Oracle and OpenAI called “Stargate,” SoftBank will invest $500 billion in U.S. data centers during the next four years. Kyriba Global Head of Enablement Bob Stark and the Port of Los Angeles. Economic predictions were challenging for CFOs before Trump’s second presidency began, but announcements of potential tariffs on different countries and industries, and along a variety of timelines, add a lot more uncertainty to the future. I talked to Bob Stark, global head of enablement at cash management software platform Kyriba about what CFOs are going through and what they can do to prepare for the short- and long-term future. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. A longer version is available here. Tariffs were also a feature of President Trump’s first term. How similar is what’s happening right now to then? Stark: You look at what was announced around steel and aluminum, and that feels very similar to what we saw in the previous term. That said, I think the differences—and our clients had the same reaction: the blanket tariffs, the punitive tariffs, if you tariff us, then we’ll tariff you back and it’s sort of back and forth—feel a little bit more significant than what we had experienced previously. It certainly feels like an acceleration. CFOs and finance teams are definitely looking at that as a lot of different potential scenarios that you have to prepare for. It’s not as simple as: This industry is affected [with a] 25% hit, so if you’re a Canadian steel exporter, you have this problem—which is fairly predictable. You can figure what 25% looks like. Same with importers on the U.S. side. [They’re] just trying to understand what does our cost look like? They can map out demand, but it’s the back and forth and the uncertainty around that. It’s difficult to predict exactly when impacts will be felt, which is a big challenge for CFOs. Many of them are looking to provide updates to guidance quarterly. In this quarter, do we have a cashflow impact that we need to control? Do we have a liquidity challenge where we need to make some plans? Do we need to provide different or maybe more expansive hedging of FX [foreign currency exchange] because we recognize that it’s these short and sharp movements that can have a significant impact in the balance sheet and income statement reporting at the end of the quarter. There’s a lot. It’s the uncertainty of what is the actual impact. There’s so many more scenarios you have to play out in different ways that feel different than what we saw several years back when we first saw this idea of tariffs being proposed and implemented. This time around, it feels to me like some of the tariffs that are being threatened and announced are more unexpected. Is that your impression? Absolutely. It feels to a corporate CFO that there’s a daily news cycle that you have to invest more time in following. You have to then build that into your analysis and reporting. If you’re doing something as simple as: What is the impact of cashflow if this blanket tariff goes in. What’s the difference? It’s being delayed by 30 days. What does that mean? There’s a lot of uncertainty and unpredictability around that. That’s the biggest challenge for CFOs. It’s like playing that hand game with your kids. You put one down, then there’s another, and then there’s another, and then there’s another. And then suddenly you think, ‘Wow, where did this go?’ That’s the part that’s really difficult to predict and build into an analysis. When the CEO is calling you because they just saw this on CNBC, and they’re asking the question: What’s the impact on our cash flow? Do we need to change our guidance? You have to juggle not just one or two different possibilities, but [there’s] probably three or four different scenarios you need to model against the same data, and then you have to be in a position to answer with precision on demand. And, ‘I’ll get back to you tomorrow’ is not an acceptable response. It’s ‘I’ll tell you right now, if these tariffs go through, this is what the impact is. If they’re delayed out 30 days, if they’re delayed out six months…’ Those are the scenarios that you have to be able to report to the board with confidence so that everyone's prepared. How do you think a company can make its way through the next four years? There’s three things that CFOs can do, aside from watching all the news and being able to utilize AI to summarize the things that they can’t watch live. Once they’re armed with that insight and understanding of sentiment, they’re in a position to do three things. Number one: FX. Those sharp, short-term movements can be the difference between hitting and missing guidance. Every CFO has to be able to quantify the impact of currency on the balance sheet, income statement and cash flow. If they’re not in a position to do that, then it erodes confidence a little bit. No one wants choppiness. They want certainty, and they want at least three months—ideally more—in advance. If you can eradicate the impact of FX, or mute it significantly, you’re in a better position than many of your peers. Number two: forecasting and planning. Every time there’s impactful news, CFOs need to answer: What would this mean to our cash and liquidity in the future? Finance leaders, they must have precise answers. They have to have them at the ready. They have to be available for multiple scenarios so that hypothetically speaking, they can answer a question like this: Our cash flow decreases by 30% if this tariff actually happens in the next 20 days. You need to be able to answer the question with that level of precision. That CEO and the board, they’re not waiting an hour. They’re probably not waiting five minutes either. They expect data and insights right now. The third part: Getting control over the cash lifecycle. CFOs need to be able to pull multiple levers to maintain control of their cash, especially in response to customers wanting to bring forward orders to get ahead of tariffs. That’s a perfect example of being able to have control, making sure that they can provide the structure, the systems financing to allow changes in the supply chain to occur. Also [to be able to provide control] in response to potential reshoring or recomposition of supply chains. Some of that is a little bit more longer term. That might be later in 2025 or into 2026. We recognize we just can’t compose our supply chain this way. We need to reshore this part of it. We need to eliminate this country out of our supply chain. It just doesn’t work in terms of the cost structure. Whatever that scenario looks like for them, the CFO needs to be able to put in the structure. It’s very tactical.

Title: How Tariffs Make CFOs’ Jobs More Complex

Plus: Consumers Feel Economic Change Slowly, Planned Aluminum And Steel Tariffs Rile Allies, Vought Uses OMB To Halt CFPB, Tech Companies Invest In AI Infrastructure There’s been a huge amount of change in the last month, and from an economic standpoint, it seems to be hitting consumers slowly, but surely. Job growth is stuck, prices don’t seem to be going anywhere, and many feel they are financially worse off than a year ago. January’s jobs data from the Labor Department, released last week, significantly missed growth projections and signified the weakest start to a year in terms of new jobs since 2016. Economists were expecting 170,000 new jobs, but the report showed the addition of just 143,000. And the expectation of job losses is growing. In the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations, released this week, 14.2% of people feel a probability of losing their jobs in the next 12 months, up 2.3% from December. About a third of consumers said their household financial situation is worse off than a year ago, the Survey of Consumer Expectations shows. And while this is down slightly month-over-month, only about 19% say they are doing better than a year ago—a 3% decrease from December. Over a fifth aren’t optimistic about the economy and say they will be doing worse a year from now. January’s Consumer Confidence Index, reported two weeks ago, showed a 5.4-point decline from December. The data shows some optimism. Labor Department data showed record-high average hourly wages of $35.87, as well as an unemployment rate of 4%, down from 4.1% in December. And 36.6% feel their household finances will be better a year from now, according to the Survey of Consumer Expectations. However, there’s lots of room for improvement. Two-thirds of Americans feel that President Donald Trump administration’s policy focus so far isn’t doing enough to lower prices, according to a CBS News/YouGov poll last week. The next round of consumer price index numbers come out this week, which will show just how much prices are changing—though the consumer expectations survey shows that Americans anticipate price increases for food, gas, rent and medical care. CFOs are increasingly having issues with making projections since so many companies rely on imports, and so many different tariff threats are being quickly proposed, rescinded and taking effect. I talked to Bob Stark, global head of enablement of cash management software platform Kyriba, about how CFOs can plan in today’s circumstances. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. Workers in Camden, N.J. use a crane to load a 60,000 pound coil of steel onto a railroad car. President Donald Trump signed another round of tariffs this week: 25% on all steel and aluminum imports. “This is a big deal, the beginning of making America rich again,” Trump said as he signed the tariff orders in the Oval Office, CBS News reported. This is a familiar policy to Trump, who assessed tariffs on steel and aluminum in his first term to bolster domestic industry. Those tariffs—25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports—had several exemptions, and ended up bringing the biggest benefit to steel companies, according to a 2018 analysis from the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Allies from the EU and Australia spoke out about the planned tariffs, which are reported to go into effect next month, saying that they will harm U.S. consumers and long-established partnerships. The U.S. imports about a quarter of all of the steel it uses, and about half of the aluminum, Reuters reports. Most of the steel the U.S. imports comes from Canada, Brazil and Mexico, while the lion’s share of aluminum imports come from Canada. Several analysts have said these new tariffs will have limited benefit to the U.S.—likely just for the steel companies—and will not likely create jobs. They are also likely to raise prices for most things made from metal. Even the United Steelworkers International Union feels the tariff proposal goes too far, and wrote the U.S. needs to take a more measured approach, distinguishing trusted trade partners. The move caused significant shifts in the stock market, boosting prices of domestic metals companies, including Alcoa and U.S. Steel. It also boosted gold prices to a record high of $2,938 per troy ounce, as investors search for stability. This isn’t the only move on tariffs in the last week. Trump announced during a Friday meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba that he would announce reciprocal tariffs this week—tariffs equal to what other countries impose on U.S. goods. There’s no word yet on how those might work. Russell Vought at a confirmation hearing in January in front of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. Last Thursday, the Senate confirmed Russell Vought as the head of the Office of Management and Budget with a vote along party lines. Vought, founder of the prominent right-wing Center for Renewing America and key adviser to the Heritage Foundation’s controversial Project 2025, was considered one of Trump’s more controversial nominees because of his viewpoint of expansive executive branch control on spending. One of his first big moves is essentially halting all work of the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, taking its website offline and telling workers not come in and stop work activities. The CFPB was created in 2011 following the Great Recession and financial crisis. It’s an agency that protects consumers from unfair banking practices, but it also has deep-pocketed enemies. Elon Musk, who has been working with his Department of Government Efficiency task force to mercilessly cut perceived wasteful spending, has railed against CFPB because “there are too many duplicative regulatory agencies.” He said this in November, shortly after the agency announced more oversight of big tech companies and others offering digital funds transfers and payment wallet apps. Meta founder and CEO and billionaire Marc Andreessen also have spoken out against the agency, which has threatened action against tech companies’ use of financial data. Rendering of Meta's Sucre data center in Louisiana. AI evangelists say the technology can do a lot for companies, but to continue to grow—both revenues for companies and capabilities for users—some infrastructure investments are needed. Big companies are announcing bigger AI data center projects, with bigger budgets and footprints. Forbes’ Christopher Helman runs down many of these plans, which include not only huge facilities like Meta’s $10 billion planned Sucré data center in Louisiana—covering 4 million square feet of floor space on 2,250 acres—but enough infrastructure to power it all—$3.2 billion worth for Meta, coming from twin high-efficiency natural gas turbines. In all, Meta plans to spend $60 to $65 billion on these data centers in the next year. Meta’s not alone in these investments. Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google parent Alphabet, announced on last week’s earnings call that the next year will see about $75 billion in capital expenditures for technical infrastructure. CFO Anat Ashkenazi said that in the last quarter Google hit capacity issues with its cloud and services business, which constrained its growth. Microsoft is planning to invest $80 billion in data centers. And through a partnership announced from the White House between SoftBank, Oracle and OpenAI called “Stargate,” SoftBank will invest $500 billion in U.S. data centers during the next four years. Kyriba Global Head of Enablement Bob Stark and the Port of Los Angeles. Economic predictions were challenging for CFOs before Trump’s second presidency began, but announcements of potential tariffs on different countries and industries, and along a variety of timelines, add a lot more uncertainty to the future. I talked to Bob Stark, global head of enablement at cash management software platform Kyriba about what CFOs are going through and what they can do to prepare for the short- and long-term future. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. A longer version is available here. Tariffs were also a feature of President Trump’s first term. How similar is what’s happening right now to then? Stark: You look at what was announced around steel and aluminum, and that feels very similar to what we saw in the previous term. That said, I think the differences—and our clients had the same reaction: the blanket tariffs, the punitive tariffs, if you tariff us, then we’ll tariff you back and it’s sort of back and forth—feel a little bit more significant than what we had experienced previously. It certainly feels like an acceleration. CFOs and finance teams are definitely looking at that as a lot of different potential scenarios that you have to prepare for. It’s not as simple as: This industry is affected [with a] 25% hit, so if you’re a Canadian steel exporter, you have this problem—which is fairly predictable. You can figure what 25% looks like. Same with importers on the U.S. side. [They’re] just trying to understand what does our cost look like? They can map out demand, but it’s the back and forth and the uncertainty around that. It’s difficult to predict exactly when impacts will be felt, which is a big challenge for CFOs. Many of them are looking to provide updates to guidance quarterly. In this quarter, do we have a cashflow impact that we need to control? Do we have a liquidity challenge where we need to make some plans? Do we need to provide different or maybe more expansive hedging of FX [foreign currency exchange] because we recognize that it’s these short and sharp movements that can have a significant impact in the balance sheet and income statement reporting at the end of the quarter. There’s a lot. It’s the uncertainty of what is the actual impact. There’s so many more scenarios you have to play out in different ways that feel different than what we saw several years back when we first saw this idea of tariffs being proposed and implemented. This time around, it feels to me like some of the tariffs that are being threatened and announced are more unexpected. Is that your impression? Absolutely. It feels to a corporate CFO that there’s a daily news cycle that you have to invest more time in following. You have to then build that into your analysis and reporting. If you’re doing something as simple as: What is the impact of cashflow if this blanket tariff goes in. What’s the difference? It’s being delayed by 30 days. What does that mean? There’s a lot of uncertainty and unpredictability around that. That’s the biggest challenge for CFOs. It’s like playing that hand game with your kids. You put one down, then there’s another, and then there’s another, and then there’s another. And then suddenly you think, ‘Wow, where did this go?’ That’s the part that’s really difficult to predict and build into an analysis. When the CEO is calling you because they just saw this on CNBC, and they’re asking the question: What’s the impact on our cash flow? Do we need to change our guidance? You have to juggle not just one or two different possibilities, but [there’s] probably three or four different scenarios you need to model against the same data, and then you have to be in a position to answer with precision on demand. And, ‘I’ll get back to you tomorrow’ is not an acceptable response. It’s ‘I’ll tell you right now, if these tariffs go through, this is what the impact is. If they’re delayed out 30 days, if they’re delayed out six months…’ Those are the scenarios that you have to be able to report to the board with confidence so that everyone's prepared. How do you think a company can make its way through the next four years? There’s three things that CFOs can do, aside from watching all the news and being able to utilize AI to summarize the things that they can’t watch live. Once they’re armed with that insight and understanding of sentiment, they’re in a position to do three things. Number one: FX. Those sharp, short-term movements can be the difference between hitting and missing guidance. Every CFO has to be able to quantify the impact of currency on the balance sheet, income statement and cash flow. If they’re not in a position to do that, then it erodes confidence a little bit. No one wants choppiness. They want certainty, and they want at least three months—ideally more—in advance. If you can eradicate the impact of FX, or mute it significantly, you’re in a better position than many of your peers. Number two: forecasting and planning. Every time there’s impactful news, CFOs need to answer: What would this mean to our cash and liquidity in the future? Finance leaders, they must have precise answers. They have to have them at the ready. They have to be available for multiple scenarios so that hypothetically speaking, they can answer a question like this: Our cash flow decreases by 30% if this tariff actually happens in the next 20 days. You need to be able to answer the question with that level of precision. That CEO and the board, they’re not waiting an hour. They’re probably not waiting five minutes either. They expect data and insights right now. The third part: Getting control over the cash lifecycle. CFOs need to be able to pull multiple levers to maintain control of their cash, especially in response to customers wanting to bring forward orders to get ahead of tariffs. That’s a perfect example of being able to have control, making sure that they can provide the structure, the systems financing to allow changes in the supply chain to occur. Also [to be able to provide control] in response to potential reshoring or recomposition of supply chains. Some of that is a little bit more longer term. That might be later in 2025 or into 2026. We recognize we just can’t compose our supply chain this way. We need to reshore this part of it. We need to eliminate this country out of our supply chain. It just doesn’t work in terms of the cost structure. Whatever that scenario looks like for them, the CFO needs to be able to put in the structure. It’s very tactical. Everything from bank accounts to cash management structures, the ability to sweep the and pool cash and mobilize it wherever it needs to be, to not only invest, but also repatriate cash so you can meet those cashflow objectives of the organization. There’s a lot of complexity there. Nevermind working with supply chains, working with customers to be able to pull the lever of: We’re going to pay you earlier, but it’s going to come at a cost, and as a result, we need to be able to do that. You want to get paid earlier, Mr. and Mrs. Supplier, we’ll do that, but here’s the program to do it. Same thing with accelerating receipt of cash. If you need to accelerate collections, you need a structure with that. It’s not a program that just happens like that. It’s a year in the making to put that structure in with your banks and with your finance and providers.

Title: Bitcoin Reserve proposal: Florida and North Carolina eye crypto for state treasuries

Florida and North Carolina lead U.S. states in Bitcoin adoption with Senate Bill 550. Lawmakers aim to allocate public funds into Bitcoin. As discussions about a Strategic Bitcoin [BTC] Reserve gain traction in the U.S., several states are already exploring ways to integrate Bitcoin into their financial systems. Florida is emerging as a frontrunner, with lawmakers advancing Senate Bill 550, aimed at incorporating Bitcoin into the state’s public investment strategy. Introduced by Senator Joe Gruters, the bill seeks to authorize Florida to allocate up to 10% of specific public funds into Bitcoin. This positions Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and a means of increasing financial autonomy. The Florida Bill SB 550 proposal noted, “Throughout its history, Bitcoin has greatly risen in value and is becoming more widely accepted as an international medium of exchange, and countries around the world, including the United States, hold Bitcoin within their treasury departments […] The bill further noted, Bitcoin is viewed as a hedge against inflation by sovereign nations and prominent investment advisors, including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton […] The state should have access to tools such as Bitcoin to protect against inflation.” If enacted, the legislation would empower the state’s Chief Financial Officer to manage Bitcoin holdings through qualified custodians, exchange-traded products, or direct ownership. Beyond its potential economic benefits, the initiative signals a broader shift toward Bitcoin adoption at the state level, reinforcing its role as a viable asset. Florida isn’t alone in its Bitcoin push, as interest in cryptocurrency adoption is growing beyond U.S. borders. North Carolina and South Dakota are also actively exploring Bitcoin investments, joining a growing list of states considering digital asset reserves. In North Carolina, the House Speaker’s staff recently engaged with industry advocate Dan Spuller, who asserted that the state aims to secure the “top spot” in Bitcoin reserves. Meanwhile, South Dakota Representative Logan Manhart is pushing for legislative action, emphasizing that “now is one of the few chances government has at being proactive.” Hence, with at least 18 states currently assessing Bitcoin investments, the momentum for state-level adoption of cryptocurrency continues to build. That being said, a recent Reuters report highlights a surge in crypto usage across South America, particularly in Brazil, where digital assets are playing an increasingly prominent role in financial transactions. Gabriel Galipolo, Brazil’s Central Bank Chief, noted that the country has witnessed a significant rise in cryptocurrency adoption over the past three years, with stablecoins emerging as the preferred choice for payments. While this reflects a shift toward decentralized financial systems, it also raises concerns among regulators regarding oversight and financial stability. Speaking at an event in Mexico City, Galipolo emphasized the need for a balanced regulatory framework to address these challenges while fostering innovation in the digital asset space. He said, “Most of that is to buy things and to shop things from abroad. [This] maintains some kind of opaque vision for taxation or for money laundering.” Thus, as the momentum for state-backed Bitcoin reserves gains traction, Utah is emerging as one of the top states in passing formal legislation on the matter. In fact, Dennis Porter, CEO of Satoshi Act Fund, recently suggested that Utah could be the first state to successfully implement such a policy. Additionally, in a discussion with “Simply Bitcoin” and Senator Cynthia Lummis, Porter revealed that 11 states have already introduced bills to establish strategic Bitcoin reserves, with expectations that this number could rise to 15 by year-end. This growing interest underscores a broader shift toward Bitcoin’s role in state financial strategies, signaling a potential wave of adoption that could reshape traditional investment models across the U.S. Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Ireland head coach Scott Bemand has named a 40-player extended squad ahead of the 2025 Women’s Six Nations which gets under way next month. Ireland will kick-off their Championship in Belfast on March 22nd, hosting France at Kingspan Stadium. Bemand has included eight uncapped players in the squad, including Sophie Barett, Jane Neill, Beth Buttimer and Jane Clohessy who impressed for the Ireland under-20s last season. Making the jump to senior from the Ireland under-18s panel is Alma Atagamen, while Amy Larn, Katie Heffernan and Caitriona Finn round out the uncapped contingent. Last season’s co-captain Sam Monaghan misses out through injury. “We’re delighted to select a really strong blend of 40 players to assemble and prepare for the start of the Guinness Women’s Six Nations, while also building towards Rugby World Cup 2025,” said Bemand, announcing the squad on Tuesday. “We’ll come together in Dublin next Monday and reconnect as a group, laying the foundations for the opportunities ahead. “Following on from successes during the WXV1 campaign in Vancouver, we have been impressed by the hard work and application of the players as they have returned to club action in recent months. “The focus and determination of players as they’ve attacked Celtic Challenge training with the Clovers and Wolfhounds has been particularly pleasing, and a number of players have earned their opportunity in National Camp off the back of those performances as we grow our wave. “We showed positive growth and evolution over the course of 2024 and the group are excited to get back in together to continue that work as we look towards the opening game against France in Belfast, which will provide a big challenge for us but we’re relishing the opportunity to perform in green while taking the home support along with us.” Forwards (22): Alma Atagamen (Balbriggan RFC)* Aoife Wafer (Blackrock College RFC/Leinster) Beth Buttimer (UL Bohemian RFC)* Brittany Hogan (Old Belvedere RFC/Ulster) Christy Haney (Blackrock College RFC/Leinster) Claire Boles (Railway Union RFC/Ulster) Cliodhna Moloney (Exeter Chiefs) Deirbhile Nic a Bháird (Old Belvedere RFC/Munster) Dorothy Wall (Exeter Chiefs/Munster) Edel McMahon (Exeter Chiefs/Connacht) Erin King (Old Belvedere RFC) Fiona Tuite (Old Belvedere RFC/Ulster) Grace Moore (Trailfinders Women/IQ Rugby) Jane Clohessy (UL Bohemian RFC/Munster)* Jane Neill (Old Belvedere RFC/Leinster)* Linda Djougang (Old Belvedere RFC/Leinster) Neve Jones (Gloucester-Hartpury) Niamh O’Dowd (Old Belvedere RFC/Leinster) Ruth Campbell (Old Belvedere RFC/Leinster) Sadhbh McGrath (Cooke RFC/Ulster) Siobhán McCarthy (Worcester Warriors/Munster) Sophie Barrett (Railway Union RFC/Ulster)* Backs (18): Amee-Leigh Costigan (Railway Union RFC/Munster) Amy Larn (Athy RFC)* Anna McGann (Railway Union RFC) Aoibheann Reilly (Blackrock College RFC/Connacht) Aoife Dalton (Old Belvedere RFC/Leinster) Béibhinn Parsons (Blackrock College RFC/Connacht) Caitríona Finn (UL Bohemian RFC/Munster)* Dannah O’Brien (Old Belvedere RFC/Leinster) Emily Lane (Blackrock College RFC) Enya Breen (Blackrock College RFC/Munster) Eve Higgins (Railway Union RFC) Katie Corrigan (Old Belvedere RFC) Katie Heffernan (Railway Union RFC/Leinster)* Méabh Deely (Blackrock College RFC/Connacht) Molly Scuffil-McCabe (Leinster) Nicole Fowley (Galwegians RFC/Connacht) Stacey Flood (Railway Union RFC) Vicky Elmes Kinlan (Wicklow RFC) *uncapped players March 22nd: Ireland v France, Kingspan Stadium, Belfast – 1pm March 30th: Italy v Ireland, Stadio Sergio Lanfrachi, Parma – 3pm April 12th: Ireland v England, Virgin Media Park, Cork – 4.45pm April 20th: Wales v Ireland, Rodney Parade, Newport – 3pm April 26th: Scotland v Ireland, Hive Stadium, Edinburgh – 12.15pm Sign up to the Irish Times weekly rugby digest for the view from the press box with Gerry Thornley © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: CEO testifies on federal agencies as lawmakers clash on Musk

Getty Images As business leaders testified on regulatory challenges and the need to rein in federal agency power, House Democrats criticized Elon Musk and the Trump administration's cuts to federal agencies. Axon Enterprise CEO Rick Smith testified Tuesday before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Administrative State, Regulatory Reform and Antitrust, detailing the significant hurdles his company faced during a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) investigation into a 2018 acquisition. Axon sued the FTC in federal district court, challenging the constitutionality of the agency's investigative and adjudicative process. In April 2023, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled in Axon's favor, and the FTC dismissed its case. Axon develops law enforcement technology, including body-worn cameras. Smith said agencies like the FTC should not have the power to act as "prosecutor, judge and jury." "The unchecked power of the government led to serious consequences for my company, for my employees and deeply for me, personally," Smith said. "The agency wields unchecked powers in ways that can crush innovation, stifle economic growth and deny basic constitutional rights." The Trump administration has waged war against federal agencies and their authority, from freezing the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to halting work at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which has cases against companies including Walmart, Capital One and JPMorgan Chase. President Donald Trump also signed an executive order in January launching the 10-to-1 initiative, meaning that for any new rule an agency proposes, it must eliminate 10 others. "It's no secret that regulatory burdens have reached an all-time high," Rep. Scott Fitzgerald (R-Wis.), the subcommittee chair, said during Tuesday's hearing. "The number of rules that agencies create is overwhelming." However, Democrats on the committee spoke against tech entrepreneur Elon Musk's access to sensitive data held by federal agencies as he leads the federal agency overhaul through his leadership of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency. Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), the subcommittee ranking member, said Musk is usurping Congressional authority and that there is "no check and no balance from the Republican Congress." "As we speak, Elon Musk and his band of near-teenaged accomplices are systematically working their way through the executive branch, knocking down agency after agency, while undermining the rule of law and shredding the constitution along the way," he said. Axon spent years in a legal battle with the FTC, challenging the constitutionality of its processes, Smith said. Axon acquired what Smith described as a small, failing body camera competitor in May 2018 for $13 million. He said the company had been attempting to sell for 18 months, but other competitors declined to buy it. Smith said the acquisition resulted in a "disproportionate government response" and the FTC demanded that the company license its intellectual property to create a "clone competitor." During Axon's dealings with the FTC, Smith said he learned that during the past 20 years, the FTC had won 100% of its cases in its in-house forum. The FTC can use an internal process called an adjudicative proceeding with administrative law judges instead of going to federal court to resolve cases. "This is bigger than one company or one case," Smith said. "Every American, whether an individual or a small or large corporation, should have the right to a fair trial before an independent judge." Magatte Wade, an entrepreneur from Senegal in West Africa and a hearing witness, voiced concerns about overregulation in the U.S., something she said has negatively affected Senegal. Wade is known for speaking against overregulation in Africa. "Even in the U.S., it is difficult for a business person to be fully compliant with all the laws," she said. "In Senegal, I usually have to pay lawyers to make sure I'm compliant all the way. It costs a lot of money and a lot of time and makes me very noncompetitive." Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, said Musk's access to agency data and potential business competitor information should be a higher priority for Congress than a hearing about regulatory reform. Raskin described Musk's attempts to halt work at agencies like CFPB as "scandalous." "That's what we should be having a hearing about, not some academic conversation about the administrative state," he said. Wade said Raskin's words concerned her. She said regulation is a significant topic that merits a Congressional hearing. "As an entrepreneur, my time is valuable," she said. "I came here because I thought we were going to talk about the regulatory state and why it matters. I'm deeply offended by what you said there." While regulations are essential in achieving policy objectives such as protecting public health and the environment, regulatory reform can "reduce unnecessary burdens on businesses and consumers," said Patrick McLaughlin, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution, and a hearing witness. "When regulations pile up over time without systematic review, this regulatory accumulation has costly consequences," he said. "Compliance becomes more complex, businesses face mounting overhead costs and entrepreneurs struggle to navigate the maze of over 1 million regulatory restrictions that are currently on the books."

Title: Ozempic and other weight-loss meds may be linked to conditions that could lead to blindness, study says

Popular diabetes and weight-loss drugs, including Ozempic (NVO-2.74%) and Zepbound (LLY+0.29%), may have a potential link with several eye conditions that can cause vision loss, according to a new investigatory review published recently in the scientific journal JAMA Ophthalmology. The study focused on nine patients that received prescriptions for semaglutide, the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic and Wegovy , or tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro and Zepbound. Seven of the patients developed a rare eye condition known as NAION, a condition in which blood flow in the optic nerve is reduced leading to sudden and irreversible blindness. The condition is the most common optic nerve disease in the United States, affecting up to 10 out of 100,000 older Americans every year, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Another patient developed bilateral papillitis — the swelling of both optic nerve heads. And the ninth patient developed paracentral acute middle maculopathy — the loss of blood flow to a part of the retina. The study authors hypothesized that the conditions were a result of rapid changes in blood sugar levels caused by the drugs, “rather than a toxic effect of the drugs.” “Patient safety is a top priority for Novo Nordisk, and we take all reports about adverse events from use of our medicines very seriously,” a Novo Nordisk spokesperson told Quartz. “This also relates to eye conditions, which are well-known comorbidities for people living with diabetes.” The spokesperson added that Novo Nordisk has conducted an analysis across clinical trials of GLP-1 meds, the class of drugs that semaglutide belongs to, looking at NAION diagnoses and has found no evidence of a causal link between the drugs and the eye condition. Additionally, the spokesperson clarified that NAION is not listed as a known adverse drug reaction for the company’s branded semaglutide products including Ozempic and Wegovy, according to their official labels. Eli Lilly did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Quartz. The study’s lead author, Bradley Katz — an opthlamologist and professor at the University of Utah, told MedicalNewsToday that the researchers are not recommending anyone to stop using the popular medications. “What we are recommending is that if you experience a change in your vision while using one of these drugs, you should consult the prescribing doctor and see an ophthalmologist,” Katz said. This review follows two studies from last year that also found a link between semaglutide and NAION. According to the study from December, diabetes patients using Ozempic were found to be over twice as likely to develop NAION compared to those taking other diabetes medications. Still, the study determined that the overall incidence of the condition was exceptionally low, with just 1.4 additional cases per 10,000 patient-years of observation — calculated as the number of patients multiplied by the years they were monitored — among those taking Ozempic compared to users of other diabetes medications. If the risk remains consistent over time, a type 2 diabetes patient taking Ozempic for 20 years would face a 0.3% to 0.5% likelihood of developing NAION, according to the study.

Title: Do Our Courses Need An Update To Reflect The Workings Of Information Businesses?

1936: British actor and director Charles Chaplin (1889 - 1977), wearing overalls and holding a ... [+] wrench, sits on an enormous set of gears in a still from Chaplin's film, 'Modern Times'. (Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images) Syllabi at management schools and senior management at perhaps many businesses don’t fully appreciate how information businesses work. I was chatting with a successful Silicon Valley venture capitalist last week about how we may have under-invested in understanding the impact of technology on our economy. The VC suggested, “macroeconomic modeling generally treats technology as an external parameter like Total Factor Productivity, rather than as an endogenously determined, explicitly engineered system. As a result, conventional models struggle to address the most critical structural issues facing the U.S. and global economy. They neither integrate short-run dynamics with long-run growth considerations nor capture how digital technologies — AI, 5G, robotics, 3D printing, zero-cost digital services — are developed, diffused, and shaped by policy and market forces. This limitation leaves unexplored how these technologies affect productivity, output, time use, education, skill requirements, and well-being.” The VC sounds more professorial than me but I am not a macro-economist and hence say much about the above statement. However, I suspect the same sentiment applies at the micro level to technology companies or information businesses, more broadly. I suspect that we have not updated our syllabi and course offerings at management schools as much as we should have, after the U.S. lost its crown as a manufacturing powerhouse. I compared the list of course offerings in say 1998 when I started teaching with what is offered today by top business schools. I found a few changes but nothing radical seems to have been restructured. So, what was taught in 1998 and to a great extent today? I conjecture we mostly teach management insights, as practiced in the manufacturing era. There was a fair degree of excitement about management theories as applied to manufacturing processes back in the day. I am thinking of Fredrick Taylor’s scientific management theories, the Hawthorne experiments, the Japanese ideas of Total Quality Management, lean manufacturing, and GE’s six sigma mindset. None of these ideas, perhaps formulated explicitly for the manufacturing age, fully apply or explain how information companies operate. Consider a summary of these ideas and how these apply or not to the modern information giants: Frederick Taylor is widely recognized for “time and motion” studies conducted in the 1880s where he observed the specific steps a worker takes to lay bricks and the time it takes to go through these steps. The idea is to optimize the number of steps and time taken to accomplish the task. More broadly, Taylor is known for two big ideas: (i) scientific management, based on evidence and observation, as opposed to gut feel and rules of thumb; and (ii) the conflict between management and labor is somewhat unnecessary as both parties would benefit with better productivity which would manifest as higher wages and higher profits. Taylor emphasized standardized tools and procedures. He wanted managers to set specified goals and assign tasks to workers to motivate workers to perform better. He argued that workers should be paid a bonus of 30% to 100% of wages for learning to do the job as per the principles of scientific management. Taylor also advocated individual work and productivity and was somewhat skeptical of group work. Taylor suggested choosing the worker with the right aptitude as such a worker would be far more productive than the average worker. He also pushed for rest pauses and shorter working hours, especially if the task is hard. Taylorism is perhaps the precursor to a lot of what is taught in operations research, human relations and cost accounting courses in B schools. I suspect Amazon relied on time and motion studies to understand how to optimize packing boxes in their distribution centers. The idea of choosing the right worker with aptitude for the job is an established tenet in HR (Human Relations) groups all over the world. The Hawthorne studies are credited with recognizing the influence of human relations or social factors in motivating workers. The Hawthorne researchers found the workers’ response to a managerial intervention is a function of the attitudes the workers bring to their job, the informal work group they belong to, their personal history and their social situation at work. Worker culture in big tech companies is widely discussed. Netflix’s culture deck, which potentially owes its inspiration to the early Hawthorne studies, is legendary in Bay area circles. The deck emphasizes the freedom to excel, deciding which worker is a keeper and paying them a premium over their market wage, the idea that the best workers are 10X better than average, and that teams ought to be highly aligned in their goals but only loosely coupled to stay nimble. The Total Quality Management way of thinking aims to make quality the concern of every member of the firm. Customers are the focus of all activities of the firm and improvements in quality are directed at improving customer satisfaction. Such a focus is expected to lead to better financial performance in two ways: (i) in the manufacturing process, we are expected to encounter fewer defects and rework leading to lower costs and more dependable processes and hence better earnings; and (ii) in the product market, more focus on quality is expected to lead to higher market share, less elastic demand, higher prices and hence higher earnings. The idea of lean manufacturing, a related concept, is to deliver a quality product to the customer at a reasonable cost. Incidentally, Trevor Harris, my co-author and emeritus professor at Columbia Business School, tells me that Edward Deming, another CBS professor, pioneered the thinking behind TQM and even the Six-Sigma movement. I don’t know whether Tesla follows TQM and lean manufacturing but I did come across a help wanted ad from Tesla looking for a quality engineer whose job description sounded similar to what a TQM engineer would do. In a 1997 annual letter Jack Welch sent to GE stockholders, he explains: "Six Sigma project work consists of five basic activities: Defining, Measuring, Analyzing, Improving and then Controlling processes. These projects usually focus on improving our customers’ productivity and reducing their capital outlays, while increasing the quality, speed and efficiency of our operations….The Six Sigma quality initiative, very briefly, means going from approximately 35,000 defects per million operations, which is average for most companies, including GE, to fewer than 4 defects per million in every element in every process that this company engages in every day.” Welch goes on to explain how Six Sigma works with the “A” leaders in each function of the company: “In finance, for example, “A’s” will be people whose talents include, but transcend, traditional controllership. The bigger role is one of full-fledged participant in driving the business to win in the marketplace — a role far bigger than the dreary and wasteful budget “drills” and bean counting that once defined and limited the job. In engineering, “A’s” are those who embrace the methodology of Design for Six Sigma. “A” engineers can’t stand the thought of “riding it out” in the lab, but rather relish the rapid pace of technological change and continually re-educate themselves to stay on top of it. In manufacturing, “A” players will be people who are immersed in Six Sigma technology, who consider inventory an embarrassment, especially with a whiff of deflation in the air — people who understand how to drive asset turns and reduce inventory while at the same time increasing our readiness to serve the customer. In sales, “A” players will use the enormous customer value that Six Sigma generates to differentiate GE from the competition, to find new accounts, and to refresh and expand the old ones — as contrasted with “C” players whose days are spent visiting “friends” on the “milk-run” circuit of customer calls.” Amazon reportedly relied on Six Sigma type ideas to reduce the error rate on their package delivery to minuscule levels considering that they processed 5.9 billion packages in 2023. As stated, modern information businesses, such as Amazon, Google, Meta, Netflix, and Uber, rely on many of these ideas inspired by manufacturing. But these tech businesses also do not seem to fit the traditional mold of management theories well. In a seminal paper written around 2001, Hal Varian discusses ways in which the “new economy” information businesses are different from traditional manufacturing firms: Not quite. Let me start with my home field. Trevor Harris points out that statutory reporting, that is done once a quarter in a rigid regulation bound format, is a relic of a bygone era. Good businesses have a dashboard to track the key KPIs that matter for value creation. Why don’t we ask firms to disclose that dashboard on a more frequent cadence to investors? Of course, there are concerns about proprietary costs and so on, but I have not seen many creative conversations about how to leverage technology and/or better reflect the economics of technology and information businesses in our textbooks and syllabi. For another smaller illustration of this problem, our textbooks treat intangible assets in a somewhat rule-oriented framework. The FASB says X and not X. So, we explain that in the text but rarely take the conversation to the next level to consider how technology creates value. My co-authors and I have a few modest contributions in this area, generally lamenting how little information about value creation potential of technology spending is shared with the investing public and the absence of data to calculate unit economics or lifetime value of a customer but much more needs to be done. I have not seen a good treatment of how cost accounting should think about supply and demand side economies of scale, standards, systems effects and computer mediated transactions. A critic may argue that the basics of cost accounting have not changed. But one must wonder whether the field is stuck around the time manufacturing left the U.S. for Asia. Have we updated thinking in cost accounting for the bundled information products, why some of Amazon’s divisions are never supposed to make money (free shipping, Kindle) so that they can cross-sell other products in the retail store, how does Amazon price the time of developers working on features and software products or how does a firm value its data or the data acquired in an M&A transaction? What kind of cost data does an Amazon, or an Uber collect? Do they conduct cost-volume-profit analyses to determine breakeven sales quantity for a product, given the extent of bundling and portfolio type thinking necessary to accomplish this? How does Amazon calculate the lifetime value of a customer? How is common overhead across segments and how did that practice potentially fund Amazon’s internal capital markets such as books leading to video to music to third party selling to AWS? How does one think about budgeting and sales and cost variances for a modern tech business? A related problem in finance has been the persistent puzzle on how to value intangibles. Absence of even modest accounting data to perform such valuations is a big hindrance. Do frameworks such as real options plausibly explain the valuations of a Tesla or an Amazon or an Nvidia? How does one stress test or falsify these black box valuations? Have the low-interest rate environments, coincidental with the rise of Big Tech, defaulted us to faith-based valuations? How has corporate finance changed with the rise of information businesses? Is capital less of a constraint than skilled labor? How does one come up with capital budgeting for information products or bundled systems? How has cash and liquidity management changed? Has big data and AI improved scenario planning and hence enabled better capital allocation? Has granular data made it easier to dissect why some acquisitions succeeded while others failed? Now, I stray into areas that are not my own and hence rely on observation, as opposed to deep analysis. Marketing and Operations Research are arguably the two disciplines in a B school that have adapted and embraced the practices of Big Tech firms better than other units. There are tons of classes on digital marketing, social influencers, ad platforms, AI offered by these two groups. Human Relations: Jensen Huang’ statement illustrates the profound change that HR groups are/will experience in the near future: “In a lot of ways, the IT department of every company is going to be the HR department of AI agents in the future.” That is, the IT departments of the future will train and “onboard” AI agents as though these were employees to ensure that such agents work to enhance human workers’ productivity. Recruiting is already mediated by AI algorithms, for better or for worse. Work from home, enabled by technology, is not going away. This is already creating profound challenges on how to integrate younger workers into a company. Many of these workers were hired on a zoom call and will potentially not get promoted by senior leaders who don’t know them as individuals or human beings. Ironically, I would suggest that we need to invest more in traditional HR. Do our newer leaders have the training and outlook to look a worker in the eye and say to them in a respectful way that they are being laid off? If they did, we would not come across so many cases of mass layoffs via email or zoom. Our slowness, in the B school, to adapt and teach management practices of Big Tech or enabled by technology in general, would be less of a concern if these considerations only mattered to a handful of tech giants. But that is certainly not the case. I routinely come across senior managers of companies that are both enthusiastically and reluctantly digitizing without fully understanding the profound change that Varian’s forces will have on their firms. This is not to say that people have not worked on documenting management practices at Amazon or the other technology firms. I have not seen a book or a manual or a coherent framework that one can hand to future managers of non-digital firms to prepare for a digital/tech leavy/information dense tomorrow.

The VC suggested, “macroeconomic modeling generally treats technology as an external parameter like Total Factor Productivity, rather than as an endogenously determined, explicitly engineered system. As a result, conventional models struggle to address the most critical structural issues facing the U.S. and global economy. They neither integrate short-run dynamics with long-run growth considerations nor capture how digital technologies — AI, 5G, robotics, 3D printing, zero-cost digital services — are developed, diffused, and shaped by policy and market forces. This limitation leaves unexplored how these technologies affect productivity, output, time use, education, skill requirements, and well-being.” The VC sounds more professorial than me but I am not a macro-economist and hence say much about the above statement. However, I suspect the same sentiment applies at the micro level to technology companies or information businesses, more broadly. I suspect that we have not updated our syllabi and course offerings at management schools as much as we should have, after the U.S. lost its crown as a manufacturing powerhouse. I compared the list of course offerings in say 1998 when I started teaching with what is offered today by top business schools. I found a few changes but nothing radical seems to have been restructured. So, what was taught in 1998 and to a great extent today? I conjecture we mostly teach management insights, as practiced in the manufacturing era. There was a fair degree of excitement about management theories as applied to manufacturing processes back in the day. I am thinking of Fredrick Taylor’s scientific management theories, the Hawthorne experiments, the Japanese ideas of Total Quality Management, lean manufacturing, and GE’s six sigma mindset. None of these ideas, perhaps formulated explicitly for the manufacturing age, fully apply or explain how information companies operate. Consider a summary of these ideas and how these apply or not to the modern information giants: Frederick Taylor is widely recognized for “time and motion” studies conducted in the 1880s where he observed the specific steps a worker takes to lay bricks and the time it takes to go through these steps. The idea is to optimize the number of steps and time taken to accomplish the task. More broadly, Taylor is known for two big ideas: (i) scientific management, based on evidence and observation, as opposed to gut feel and rules of thumb; and (ii) the conflict between management and labor is somewhat unnecessary as both parties would benefit with better productivity which would manifest as higher wages and higher profits. Taylor emphasized standardized tools and procedures. He wanted managers to set specified goals and assign tasks to workers to motivate workers to perform better. He argued that workers should be paid a bonus of 30% to 100% of wages for learning to do the job as per the principles of scientific management. Taylor also advocated individual work and productivity and was somewhat skeptical of group work. Taylor suggested choosing the worker with the right aptitude as such a worker would be far more productive than the average worker. He also pushed for rest pauses and shorter working hours, especially if the task is hard. Taylorism is perhaps the precursor to a lot of what is taught in operations research, human relations and cost accounting courses in B schools. I suspect Amazon relied on time and motion studies to understand how to optimize packing boxes in their distribution centers. The idea of choosing the right worker with aptitude for the job is an established tenet in HR (Human Relations) groups all over the world. The Hawthorne studies are credited with recognizing the influence of human relations or social factors in motivating workers. The Hawthorne researchers found the workers’ response to a managerial intervention is a function of the attitudes the workers bring to their job, the informal work group they belong to, their personal history and their social situation at work. Worker culture in big tech companies is widely discussed. Netflix’s culture deck, which potentially owes its inspiration to the early Hawthorne studies, is legendary in Bay area circles. The deck emphasizes the freedom to excel, deciding which worker is a keeper and paying them a premium over their market wage, the idea that the best workers are 10X better than average, and that teams ought to be highly aligned in their goals but only loosely coupled to stay nimble. The Total Quality Management way of thinking aims to make quality the concern of every member of the firm. Customers are the focus of all activities of the firm and improvements in quality are directed at improving customer satisfaction. Such a focus is expected to lead to better financial performance in two ways: (i) in the manufacturing process, we are expected to encounter fewer defects and rework leading to lower costs and more dependable processes and hence better earnings; and (ii) in the product market, more focus on quality is expected to lead to higher market share, less elastic demand, higher prices and hence higher earnings. The idea of lean manufacturing, a related concept, is to deliver a quality product to the customer at a reasonable cost. Incidentally, Trevor Harris, my co-author and emeritus professor at Columbia Business School, tells me that Edward Deming, another CBS professor, pioneered the thinking behind TQM and even the Six-Sigma movement. I don’t know whether Tesla follows TQM and lean manufacturing but I did come across a help wanted ad from Tesla looking for a quality engineer whose job description sounded similar to what a TQM engineer would do. In a 1997 annual letter Jack Welch sent to GE stockholders, he explains: "Six Sigma project work consists of five basic activities: Defining, Measuring, Analyzing, Improving and then Controlling processes. These projects usually focus on improving our customers’ productivity and reducing their capital outlays, while increasing the quality, speed and efficiency of our operations….The Six Sigma quality initiative, very briefly, means going from approximately 35,000 defects per million operations, which is average for most companies, including GE, to fewer than 4 defects per million in every element in every process that this company engages in every day.” Welch goes on to explain how Six Sigma works with the “A” leaders in each function of the company: “In finance, for example, “A’s” will be people whose talents include, but transcend, traditional controllership. The bigger role is one of full-fledged participant in driving the business to win in the marketplace — a role far bigger than the dreary and wasteful budget “drills” and bean counting that once defined and limited the job. In engineering, “A’s” are those who embrace the methodology of Design for Six Sigma. “A” engineers can’t stand the thought of “riding it out” in the lab, but rather relish the rapid pace of technological change and continually re-educate themselves to stay on top of it. In manufacturing, “A” players will be people who are immersed in Six Sigma technology, who consider inventory an embarrassment, especially with a whiff of deflation in the air — people who understand how to drive asset turns and reduce inventory while at the same time increasing our readiness to serve the customer. In sales, “A” players will use the enormous customer value that Six Sigma generates to differentiate GE from the competition, to find new accounts, and to refresh and expand the old ones — as contrasted with “C” players whose days are spent visiting “friends” on the “milk-run” circuit of customer calls.” Amazon reportedly relied on Six Sigma type ideas to reduce the error rate on their package delivery to minuscule levels considering that they processed 5.9 billion packages in 2023. As stated, modern information businesses, such as Amazon, Google, Meta, Netflix, and Uber, rely on many of these ideas inspired by manufacturing. But these tech businesses also do not seem to fit the traditional mold of management theories well. In a seminal paper written around 2001, Hal Varian discusses ways in which the “new economy” information businesses are different from traditional manufacturing firms: Not quite. Let me start with my home field. Trevor Harris points out that statutory reporting, that is done once a quarter in a rigid regulation bound format, is a relic of a bygone era. Good businesses have a dashboard to track the key KPIs that matter for value creation. Why don’t we ask firms to disclose that dashboard on a more frequent cadence to investors? Of course, there are concerns about proprietary costs and so on, but I have not seen many creative conversations about how to leverage technology and/or better reflect the economics of technology and information businesses in our textbooks and syllabi. For another smaller illustration of this problem, our textbooks treat intangible assets in a somewhat rule-oriented framework. The FASB says X and not X. So, we explain that in the text but rarely take the conversation to the next level to consider how technology creates value. My co-authors and I have a few modest contributions in this area, generally lamenting how little information about value creation potential of technology spending is shared with the investing public and the absence of data to calculate unit economics or lifetime value of a customer but much more needs to be done. I have not seen a good treatment of how cost accounting should think about supply and demand side economies of scale, standards, systems effects and computer mediated transactions. A critic may argue that the basics of cost accounting have not changed. But one must wonder whether the field is stuck around the time manufacturing left the U.S. for Asia. Have we updated thinking in cost accounting for the bundled information products, why some of Amazon’s divisions are never supposed to make money (free shipping, Kindle) so that they can cross-sell other products in the retail store, how does Amazon price the time of developers working on features and software products or how does a firm value its data or the data acquired in an M&A transaction? What kind of cost data does an Amazon, or an Uber collect? Do they conduct cost-volume-profit analyses to determine breakeven sales quantity for a product, given the extent of bundling and portfolio type thinking necessary to accomplish this? How does Amazon calculate the lifetime value of a customer? How is common overhead across segments and how did that practice potentially fund Amazon’s internal capital markets such as books leading to video to music to third party selling to AWS? How does one think about budgeting and sales and cost variances for a modern tech business? A related problem in finance has been the persistent puzzle on how to value intangibles. Absence of even modest accounting data to perform such valuations is a big hindrance. Do frameworks such as real options plausibly explain the valuations of a Tesla or an Amazon or an Nvidia? How does one stress test or falsify these black box valuations? Have the low-interest rate environments, coincidental with the rise of Big Tech, defaulted us to faith-based valuations? How has corporate finance changed with the rise of information businesses? Is capital less of a constraint than skilled labor? How does one come up with capital budgeting for information products or bundled systems? How has cash and liquidity management changed? Has big data and AI improved scenario planning and hence enabled better capital allocation? Has granular data made it easier to dissect why some acquisitions succeeded while others failed? Now, I stray into areas that are not my own and hence rely on observation, as opposed to deep analysis. Marketing and Operations Research are arguably the two disciplines in a B school that have adapted and embraced the practices of Big Tech firms better than other units. There are tons of classes on digital marketing, social influencers, ad platforms, AI offered by these two groups. Human Relations: Jensen Huang’ statement illustrates the profound change that HR groups are/will experience in the near future: “In a lot of ways, the IT department of every company is going to be the HR department of AI agents in the future.” That is, the IT departments of the future will train and “onboard” AI agents as though these were employees to ensure that such agents work to enhance human workers’ productivity. Recruiting is already mediated by AI algorithms, for better or for worse. Work from home, enabled by technology, is not going away. This is already creating profound challenges on how to integrate younger workers into a company. Many of these workers were hired on a zoom call and will potentially not get promoted by senior leaders who don’t know them as individuals or human beings. Ironically, I would suggest that we need to invest more in traditional HR. Do our newer leaders have the training and outlook to look a worker in the eye and say to them in a respectful way that they are being laid off? If they did, we would not come across so many cases of mass layoffs via email or zoom. Our slowness, in the B school, to adapt and teach management practices of Big Tech or enabled by technology in general, would be less of a concern if these considerations only mattered to a handful of tech giants. But that is certainly not the case. I routinely come across senior managers of companies that are both enthusiastically and reluctantly digitizing without fully understanding the profound change that Varian’s forces will have on their firms. This is not to say that people have not worked on documenting management practices at Amazon or the other technology firms. I have not seen a book or a manual or a coherent framework that one can hand to future managers of non-digital firms to prepare for a digital/tech leavy/information dense tomorrow.

Title: Who Owns the World? The Boom-Bust Bailout Process that Placed Nations in Debt

Time Published: 2025-02-11T15:42:36Z

There are systemic aspects about the banking, monetary, and economic system that are not taught in the schools and universities of the world and are rarely discussed on corporate owned news and media networks. Knowledge of these aspects is absolutely essential for everyone in the world that wishes to understand how the economic world ‘actually’ works and how worldwide society has been brought to the brink of financial ruin (currently almost all governments of the world are in vast debt) while the vast resources of human productivity and of nature are continually exploited by a small group of people that control these systems. See also the book Demonic Economics and the Tricks of the Bankers. This article explores: Without GDP growth the (privately owned) debt-money banking system fails. The real reason governments prioritise GDP growth is so that sufficient tax monies can be collected so that interest can be paid to the international banking system. Governments often maintain that the ultimate purpose of economic GDP growth is in fact to improve wellbeing. This is not in fact so. John Jopling (RIP) of the Foundation for the Economics of Sustainability wrote in 2003: “The real reason why governments regard growth as desirable is that, with a debt-based money system, if the economy does not grow, it collapses. This is something all politicians are naturally and rightly extremely keen to avoid. Growth is an absolute imperative imposed on governments by the nature of the current money system. Thus, it is in the nature of the money system, not the choice of government, that growth must be maintained.”[1] Governments are buried under the lie, they do not admit or have the awareness that the need for GDP growth is imposed by the debt-money system controlled by private banks nor that the creation of debt money by private banks is unnecessary and is against the public interest (because governments could create and issue debt-free money themselves as has been done in the past). It is rarely acknowledged by politicians that the main reason for the constant drive for GDP growth is to pay interest to the banking system. The Foundation for the Economics of Sustainability has stated: “The way in which the global economic system is designed automatically ensures that the economy operates in such a way that: a. inequality is bound to increase, b. the economy is unstable and c. the economy is blind to the limits of natural resources and the need for humanity to live in symbiosis with the rest of the natural world.” – The Foundation for the Economics of Sustainabilit[2] GDP growth is prioritised by governments and debt-money is the basis of the banking system – yet both are significant drivers of environmental degradation, resource depletion, and social inequity. A government prioritises growth, yet whether it is ‘good’ growth or ‘bad’ growth is not the focus (good growth would not impact on environmental and social resilience.) The pseudo-science of neo-classical economics (that all governments adhere to) proposes that increased GDP growth can reduce pollution in what is called the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC). This EKC argument is false. The EKC posits that pollution increases with economic growth in the early stages of development and that beyond a certain level of development the trend reverses, and economic growth improves environmental conditions by creating the resources to do so. However, the EKC has never been validated. Vastly excessive consumerism has been required to keep the system from derailing. The debt-money system increases and reduces the availability credit at will often creating ‘boom, bust and bailout’ cycles – this means that the economic system is unstable by nature. If sufficient loans are not repaid to a commercial bank it will become insolvent. This has happened in many countries, for example in various countries in Europe during the banking crisis of 2008. . The collapse of Lehman Brothers (headquarters pictured), the fourth-largest U.S. investment bank, on September 15, 2008, is often considered the climax of the 2008 financial crisis. (Licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0) . [Aside: Bear in mind that these private banks never held the original monies in the first place, and, the cruel bait and switch is that it is actually the people that are the grantors of credit when they sign a mortgage or loan (a promise to pay), however, the bank typically never pays back the grantor of the credit. Including interest one typically pays the bank about twice the amount of the loan or mortgage. Yet, the bank does not pay equity for that promissory note, and presumes that we have abandoned our securities]. Typically a national government then intervenes to bail out those commercial banks, being under pressure to do so from the international banking system. Furthermore, by controlling the availability of credit the private banking cartel created boom-bust-bailout cycles, at will, which placed nations in further debt. For example, the European Central Bank (ECB) exerted pressure on the Irish government to bail out private banks and unsecured bondholders in 2010. In 2012 RTE, Ireland’s National Television Service reported that the ECB informed an Irish Government Minister that “a bomb will go off in Dublin” if Anglo bondholders are not paid. “He [Minister for Transport and Tourism, Leo Varadkar] said that the Troika told the Government that “we don’t want you to default on these payments, it is your decision ultimately but a bomb will go off; and the bomb will go off in Dublin and not in Frankfurt.” – RTE reporting Minister Varadkar’s comments 22nd January 2012. [Note: The Troika is a term used to describe the European Commission (EC), the European Central Bank (ECB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).] Furthermore, a letter was sent by the ECB to pressure the Irish Government to accept a bailout. In that letter then ECB head Jean-Claude Trichet told Ireland in November 2010 that it would not extend further emergency funding to the country’s banks if Dublin did not sign up to a bailout, according to the letter which was finally released after years of lobbying. The so-called global banking crises of 2008 represented an opportunity for a re-evaluation of the values that our banking system and economic system are based on. Moreover, it represented an ideal opportunity for transition toward a more sustainable, resilient, just, and, perhaps even, a more ethical society. Alas, this opportunity was spurned, and almost all governments bailed out the banks. This results in increased taxes, national austerity measures and/or the privatisation of national assets due to conditionalities on credit. For example, in Ireland the government must pay around €6 billion to €10 billion per annum in interest on the national debt of €235 billon[3] – a significant portion of this debt (€85 billion) was incurred due to bailing out private commercial banks in Ireland in 2008[4]. To understand the magnitude of this debt if you convert into U.S. dollars and lay $1 bills on top of each other they would make a pile 28,581 km, or 17,760 miles high. These debts will never be fully repaid and the annual interest payments alone are, in effect, a never-ending shackle of debt servitude and a form of slavery for the Irish people. Similar bailout situations have occurred in many other countries worldwide. “There are two ways to conquer and enslave a nation. One is by the sword. The other is by debt.” – U.S. President John Adams The banking system can and does control the availability of credit (i.e., debt-money loans). It can expand or contract the availability of credit in a nation or worldwide. Over the past decades the more credit that is available the more an economy is likely to grow (there are also other factors including the availability of a cheap energy source, such as oil). When the availability of credit is contracted/reduced by the banking system the money supply shrinks, the availability of money to repay loans plus interest is reduced, foreclosures begin to occur and the economy may start to shrink rather than grow. This expansion and contraction of credit is known as the business cycle. “The fact that the necessary growth can be achieved only by increasing the total level of debt makes the economy heavily dependent on confidence… The economy therefore constantly moves between boom and bust; it is systemically unstable.” – John Joplin and Roy Madron, authors of ‘Gaian Democracies’[5] “The bankrupt country must borrow from international banks and the IMF, which impose a condition of debt relief that the national government may not issue its own money. If the government tries to protect its resources or its banks by nationalizing them for the benefit of its own citizens, it is branded communist, socialist or terrorist and is replaced by one that is friendlier to free enterprise.” – E.H. Brown, Author of the book ‘The Web of Debt’ Author Bob Djurdjevic associates these cycles, which have been experienced by many countries, to what he calls the Wall Street dominated New World Order terrorists: “The Wall Street dominated New World Order (NWO) Empire is being built by colonizing other countries with foreign loans or investments. When the fish is firmly on the hook, the NWO financial terrorists pull the plug, leaving the unsuspecting victim high and dry. And begging to be rescued. In comes the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Its bailout recipes – privatisation, trade, liberalization and other austerity reforms – amount to seizing the target countries’ natural resources, and turning them over to the NWO elites – just as surely as the British Empire did by using cruder methods.” – Bob Djurdjevic, Chronicles Journal[6] The boom-bust-bailout process can be summarised, as follows: Many people’s perceptions are that social programs are targeted to assist poorer people lower down the socio-economic scale. However, the 2008 banking crisis in Europe and the U.S. was a clear example of socialism for the banks and extremely wealthy bondholders. The failing banks that were reckless with their lending and investment practices still got “rewarded” with vast quantities of government bailout monies because they were regarded as “too big to fail”. The attempted justification for such bailouts is that it is in the people’s interests that the banks are kept alive. However, in reality it is the working-class and middle-class tax-payers that are typically forced to shoulder the disproportionate brunt of the bailout, which is in effect a huge transfer of people’s labour and money to the already mega-wealthy bondholders and private owners of the banks. In summary, a private-banking cartel has been able to create booms and busts and drive nations into bankruptcy and bailout using the Problem, Reaction, Solution approach or the Hegelian Dialectic. The reality of this flawed monetary system became apparent to many millions of people in 2008 when the so-called banking crises hit in the U.S. and in Europe. As usual, it was the people that were forced to pay for the debts of privately owned banks. In Ireland, the debts of the private banks were the controversially guaranteed by the Irish government, thereby placing the debt burdens onto the Irish citizens. According to a poll by the Irish Independent in 2010 a substantial majority of the Irish people wanted the State to default on debts to bondholders (See endnote 38). Furthermore, as I noted in a blog in 2010 [7] the people of Ireland did not agree to the use of billions of their monies being used to bail out privately owned banks. There was no national referendum on the issue. The bailout of the private banks by the Irish government prompted much public anger, yet, the mainstream media in Ireland appeared to be generally aligned with the government narrative. A number of commentators and bloggers had criticised the government’s bailout plans to no avail. For example, the following is an extract from an article titled “We must face down the jackals who control the international banking system to save our nation and protect our children’s future” by Robert Pye, a former Irish Department of Finance Analyst: “THERE IS considerable truth in the view that Ireland is no longer a sovereign state but an impoverished suburb of Brussels. Four million people are mired deep in a collective debt that is not of their own making… They call us PIIGS (Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain) because that is what you do with a pig: tie him upside down, slit his throat and drain him dry. Well, I for one reject this disgusting epithet. I also reject utterly the despicable arrogance with which this country is being treated, and the servile ineptitude of those who pose as our leaders. Unless we take a stand and defend our sovereignty, our integrity and our children, we will be destroyed as a nation.”[8] Richard Douthwaite (1942 – 2011) an economist and writer, wrote a relevant article in relation to the planned bailout in Ireland titled “Bailout talks: four truths Ireland can’t ignore”[9]. The following is an extract: “Ireland’s negotiations with the ECB and the IMF are perhaps the most important talks that this country has engaged in… If Ireland has to pay interest on the loans being negotiated at a rate which exceeds the rate at which the economy grows over the next few years, it will make the country’s situation worse, not better… The ECB bears a large share of the responsibility for the regulatory failure which led to the property bubble… There is a Plan B. Ireland doesn’t have to take anything that is offered. It can leave the euro quickly and easily… If the deal offered by the ECB/IMF negotiators is unsatisfactory, the Irish government can simply announce… a new currency… and all wages, rents, debts and other payments are to be paid in harp with immediate effect… After the announcement the government would issue itself with the new currency on a debt-free basis so that it no longer needed to borrow to cover its budget deficit… Ireland has no alternative but to renege on the guarantees and to build itself a future within the EU but outside the eurozone.” An article on broadsheet.ie in 2010 titled “The Senior Bondholders: An Analysis”[10] provided an analysis of who the bondholders actually were that were benefitting from the Irish tax-payer funded government bailout of privately owned insolvent banks. Many of the bondholders were privately held banks “mostly” owned by extremely wealthy individuals. An extract from the article is as follow: “SO…. on one side we have Ireland whose bond holders, its people, have between them a total GDP wealth of 0.207 trillion euros. Who are being FORCED, against their will, to pay Anglo Irish bank’s debts to its bond holders, who between them hold 20.8 Trillion euros. The people of Ireland are paying to, and protecting the wealth and power of, people who have 100 times more wealth!… So who are they? Well many of the bond holders are privately held banks, which list their activities as asset management for off-shore, non-resident and high value individuals.” The following is also a relevant excerpt from an article[11] written by author and blogger Charles Hugh Smith in November 2010 that summarises the situation and the opportunity Ireland had to dis-empower “the vampire banks” which had the world by the throat: “When a nation such as Ireland is running a State deficit equal to 32% of GDP, austerity cannot generate the stupendous surpluses needed to make good the vast sums which are already lost… Ireland, and indeed the world, will survive if all the vampire banks are liquidated. That is the end-state, and “buying time” just increases the misery of the citizens who have been yoked to save their “betters.” Ireland, please drive a stake through the heart of the vampire banks which have the world by the throat. By defaulting, you would be doing the world (and your own nation) an immense favor.” The following extract from a wiki project[12] describes the different responses to the debts of private banks in Iceland and Ireland. Iceland is an interesting example of how a country can stand up against the IMF. “The “Icelandic Solution” involved repudiation. Private banks were allowed to fail and social security measures for the poor and indebted were increased… The UK went so far as to trigger anti-terrorism legislation against Icelandic banks in a bid to pressure Iceland to pay out claims against its private banks… Self-interested bankers are therefore often desperate to avoid government debt default, and generally much prefer an economy to be strangled by debt rather than be freed of it… The Irish government on the other hand, guaranteed private bank debt and in doing so subjected the taxpayers of that country to decades of payments for debts that were not incurred on their behalf or for their benefit. This could be interpreted as theft through the taxing of future generations tomorrow to pay off creditors of private bankers today. Many commentators have observed that in 2010. Iceland recovered much faster than other countries such as Ireland.” When you get a mortgage, loan, or a credit card, the debt money is created out of thin air when you sign on the dotted line of the contract, yet you will have to work (maybe for years) to generate the money to pay back to the bank plus interest – in essence, this is a form of slavery as the bank never had the money in the first place. Income tax monies collected by governments from the people is one of the methods used to service the debt governments owe to the international finance system, money that was originally created entirely from nothing by privately-owned mega-banks. “Federal income tax was instituted specifically to coerce taxpayers to pay the interest due to the banks on the federal debt. If the money supply had been created by the government rather than borrowed from the banks that created it, the income tax would have been unnecessary. … There is a way out of this morass. The early American colonists found it and so did Abraham Lincoln and some other national leaders: the government can take back the money-issuing power from the banks. “ – Ellen Brown, Author of the book ‘The Web of Debt’ “Between usury and taxes the consumer is really played for a sucker. God’s law permits no property tax for it is discriminatory… It discourages stability and brings about a shifting, irresponsible citizenry with no ties to the land. Under our present system, accident, sickness, or old age easily dispossesses a man of his home but in no way reduces his expense….” – Dr. Franklin Snook, Author of America Needs the Divine Law Over decades the power to create debt-money has resulted in the power to own, control and manipulate the assets of the material world, as well media and politics. Those that control the money creation process wield the power to control the corporate media and own the material world, regardless of which political party is elected, or which system is utilised (capitalism, socialism, communism, etc). This mean that many aspects of our lives are in reality controlled from a moneyed source not from a democratic source. This power grab was achieved not by creating more value, but by fully controlling the source of money and the world of finance. A pyramid of control has existed. The higher up you go the closer you get to the source of money creation. At the bottom level we are all going about our daily lives. At the next level up are governments. These are people who are given a monopoly on force and use it to tax and control the population whether or not we agree. The election of new government leaders via representative democracy is an illusion of people power. The vast regulatory systems of government in essence never change. But who controls the governments? It is not the people of the nations that control governments, this is evidenced by the banking bailouts in Europe after 2008. There was no referendum on the subject, the governments simply complied with the wishes of international private banking corporations. At the next level up are the mega corporations and at the next level beyond the corporations is the privately owned worldwide banking cartel. Over decades the mega-corporations have acquired the world’s resources and controlled the markets. To do so they needed access to cheap money. The mega corporations got their loans at special rates from the mega banks. We can conclude that those who control the mega banks ultimately control the mega corporations. “Whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce.. when you realise that the entire system is very easily controlled, one way or another, by a few powerful men at the top, you will not have to be told how periods of inflation and depression originate.“ – James Garfield (20th President of the U.S. – assassinated 1881). “The … bankers rule the world through debt, which is money they create out of nothing. They need world government to ensure no country defaults or tries to overthrow them. As long as private bankers, instead of governments, create money the human race is doomed. These bankers and their allies have bought everything and everyone.” – Henry Makow, Author Also note the comments of Congressman Charles McFadden, Chairman, House Banking and Currency Committee, June 10, 1932: “Some people think the Federal Reserve Banks are U.S. governments institutions. They are not… they are private credit monopolies which prey upon the people of the U.S. for the benefit of themselves and their foreign and domestic swindlers, and rich and predatory money lenders… These twelve private credit monopolies were deceitfully foisted upon this Country by the bankers who came here from Europe and repaid us our hospitality by undermining our American Institutions… The sack of the United States by the FED is the greatest crime in history. Every effort has been made by the FED to conceal its powers, but the truth is the FED has usurped the government. It controls everything here and it controls all foreign relations. It makes and breaks governments at will.” – Congressman Charles McFadden. The major shareholders in the commercial banks are other banks and asset management companies and trusts. For example, asset management company Blackrock has large shareholdings in mega-banks Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan Chase and other banks[13], yet those same banks have major shareholdings in Blackrock. The list of shareholders is diversified amongst various privately owned financial and asset management corporations. In essence, all these various financial entities are interlocked and own each other – the current dominant worldwide privately owned financial orthodoxy is one large self-reinforcing entity under the tentacles of many financial corporations. A study[14] was conducted at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, Switzerland, on the relationships between 37 million companies and investors worldwide, and there is a ‘super-entity’ of just 147 tightly knit mega-corporations that controls 40 percent of the entire global economy. and all of their ownership was held by other members of the super-entity. According to James B. Glattfelder, one of the authors of the study: “In effect, less than 1 per cent of the companies were able to control 40 per cent of the entire network,” Most were financial institutions and included Barclays Bank, JPMorgan Chase & Co, and The Goldman Sachs Group. The dominant players appear to be the banking families that have been operating private banking for generations. The involvement of certain banking families in private banking for generations is mentioned in books including ‘The Web of Debt’ by Ellen Brown, chair of the U.S. Public Banking Institute. Families that are often mentioned in relation to the banking industry include the Rothschild banking dynasty[15] (associated with US Trust owned by Bank of America), The Rockefeller world business empire (associated with Citigroup), the Schiff’s, the Morgan’s[16] (associated with Morgan Stanley, etc.), and the Warburg’s. Author Dean Henderson writes in an article[17]: “The Four Horsemen of Banking (Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo)… According to company 10K filings to the SEC, the Four Horsemen of Banking are among the top ten stock holders of virtually every Fortune 500 corporation… One important repository for the wealth of the global oligarchy that owns these bank holding companies is US Trust Corporation – founded in 1853 and now owned by Bank of America. A recent US Trust Corporate Director and Honorary Trustee was Walter Rothschild… [18]” Furthermore, according to Ellen Brown, chairperson of the Public Banking Institute in the U.S. asset management companies, such as Blackrock, literally own much of the U.S. and the world. She states: “BlackRock has a controlling interest in all the major corporations in the S&P 500, it professes not to “own” the funds. It just acts as a kind of “custodian” for its investors — or so it claims. But BlackRock and the other Big 3 ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) vote the corporations’ shares; so from the point of view of management, they are the owners. And as observed in a 2017 article from the University of Amsterdam titled “These Three Firms Own Corporate America” they vote 90% of the time in favor of management.”[19] In a 2018 review titled “Blackrock – The Company That Owns the World’[20], a multinational research group called Investigate Europe concluded that BlackRock “undermines competition through owning shares in competing companies”. The major shareholders of Blackrock are all mega-banks and financial corporations, such as Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citi Group, Wells Fargo and Company, Morgan Stanley, and other various other banks[21]. So, privately owned commercial banks own Blackrock and the other major asset management companies that own most of the world. Author Karen Hudes, who worked in the legal department of the World Bank for more than 20 years, has cited the above Swiss study during an interview with the New American[22] pointing, out that a small group of entities, mostly financial institutions and especially central banks, exert a massive amount of influence over the international economy from behind the scenes. According to Hudes “What is really going on is that the world’s resources are being dominated by this group,” and that “corrupt power grabbers” have managed to dominate the media as well. According to Hudes, the power grabbers also dominate the organizations that control the creation and flow of money worldwide and control the finances of virtually every nation in the world. These organizations include The World Bank, the IMF and central banks, such as the Federal Reserve, all of which are unelected and unaccountable. Author E.H. Brown states that: “Secrecy has been maintained because the robber barons have been able to use their monopoly over money to buy up major media, educational institutions, and other outlets of public information. While Rockefeller was buying up universities, medical schools, and the Encyclopedia Britannica, Morgan bought up newspapers… By 1983,.. fifty corporations owned half or more of the media business. By 2000, that number was down to six corporations, with directorates interlocked with each other and with major commercial banks.[23]” For more information see also the book Demonic Economics and the Tricks of the Bankers. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: Who Owns the World? The Boom-Bust Bailout Process that Placed Nations in Debt

There are systemic aspects about the banking, monetary, and economic system that are not taught in the schools and universities of the world and are rarely discussed on corporate owned news and media networks. Knowledge of these aspects is absolutely essential for everyone in the world that wishes to understand how the economic world ‘actually’ works and how worldwide society has been brought to the brink of financial ruin (currently almost all governments of the world are in vast debt) while the vast resources of human productivity and of nature are continually exploited by a small group of people that control these systems. See also the book Demonic Economics and the Tricks of the Bankers. This article explores: Without GDP growth the (privately owned) debt-money banking system fails. The real reason governments prioritise GDP growth is so that sufficient tax monies can be collected so that interest can be paid to the international banking system. Governments often maintain that the ultimate purpose of economic GDP growth is in fact to improve wellbeing. This is not in fact so. John Jopling (RIP) of the Foundation for the Economics of Sustainability wrote in 2003: “The real reason why governments regard growth as desirable is that, with a debt-based money system, if the economy does not grow, it collapses. This is something all politicians are naturally and rightly extremely keen to avoid. Growth is an absolute imperative imposed on governments by the nature of the current money system. Thus, it is in the nature of the money system, not the choice of government, that growth must be maintained.”[1] Governments are buried under the lie, they do not admit or have the awareness that the need for GDP growth is imposed by the debt-money system controlled by private banks nor that the creation of debt money by private banks is unnecessary and is against the public interest (because governments could create and issue debt-free money themselves as has been done in the past). It is rarely acknowledged by politicians that the main reason for the constant drive for GDP growth is to pay interest to the banking system. The Foundation for the Economics of Sustainability has stated: “The way in which the global economic system is designed automatically ensures that the economy operates in such a way that: a. inequality is bound to increase, b. the economy is unstable and c. the economy is blind to the limits of natural resources and the need for humanity to live in symbiosis with the rest of the natural world.” – The Foundation for the Economics of Sustainabilit[2] GDP growth is prioritised by governments and debt-money is the basis of the banking system – yet both are significant drivers of environmental degradation, resource depletion, and social inequity. A government prioritises growth, yet whether it is ‘good’ growth or ‘bad’ growth is not the focus (good growth would not impact on environmental and social resilience.) The pseudo-science of neo-classical economics (that all governments adhere to) proposes that increased GDP growth can reduce pollution in what is called the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC). This EKC argument is false. The EKC posits that pollution increases with economic growth in the early stages of development and that beyond a certain level of development the trend reverses, and economic growth improves environmental conditions by creating the resources to do so. However, the EKC has never been validated. Vastly excessive consumerism has been required to keep the system from derailing. The debt-money system increases and reduces the availability credit at will often creating ‘boom, bust and bailout’ cycles – this means that the economic system is unstable by nature. If sufficient loans are not repaid to a commercial bank it will become insolvent. This has happened in many countries, for example in various countries in Europe during the banking crisis of 2008. . The collapse of Lehman Brothers (headquarters pictured), the fourth-largest U.S. investment bank, on September 15, 2008, is often considered the climax of the 2008 financial crisis. (Licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0) . [Aside: Bear in mind that these private banks never held the original monies in the first place, and, the cruel bait and switch is that it is actually the people that are the grantors of credit when they sign a mortgage or loan (a promise to pay), however, the bank typically never pays back the grantor of the credit. Including interest one typically pays the bank about twice the amount of the loan or mortgage. Yet, the bank does not pay equity for that promissory note, and presumes that we have abandoned our securities]. Typically a national government then intervenes to bail out those commercial banks, being under pressure to do so from the international banking system. Furthermore, by controlling the availability of credit the private banking cartel created boom-bust-bailout cycles, at will, which placed nations in further debt. For example, the European Central Bank (ECB) exerted pressure on the Irish government to bail out private banks and unsecured bondholders in 2010. In 2012 RTE, Ireland’s National Television Service reported that the ECB informed an Irish Government Minister that “a bomb will go off in Dublin” if Anglo bondholders are not paid. “He [Minister for Transport and Tourism, Leo Varadkar] said that the Troika told the Government that “we don’t want you to default on these payments, it is your decision ultimately but a bomb will go off; and the bomb will go off in Dublin and not in Frankfurt.” – RTE reporting Minister Varadkar’s comments 22nd January 2012. [Note: The Troika is a term used to describe the European Commission (EC), the European Central Bank (ECB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).] Furthermore, a letter was sent by the ECB to pressure the Irish Government to accept a bailout. In that letter then ECB head Jean-Claude Trichet told Ireland in November 2010 that it would not extend further emergency funding to the country’s banks if Dublin did not sign up to a bailout, according to the letter which was finally released after years of lobbying. The so-called global banking crises of 2008 represented an opportunity for a re-evaluation of the values that our banking system and economic system are based on. Moreover, it represented an ideal opportunity for transition toward a more sustainable, resilient, just, and, perhaps even, a more ethical society. Alas, this opportunity was spurned, and almost all governments bailed out the banks. This results in increased taxes, national austerity measures and/or the privatisation of national assets due to conditionalities on credit. For example, in Ireland the government must pay around €6 billion to €10 billion per annum in interest on the national debt of €235 billon[3] – a significant portion of this debt (€85 billion) was incurred due to bailing out private commercial banks in Ireland in 2008[4]. To understand the magnitude of this debt if you convert into U.S. dollars and lay $1 bills on top of each other they would make a pile 28,581 km, or 17,760 miles high. These debts will never be fully repaid and the annual interest payments alone are, in effect, a never-ending shackle of debt servitude and a form of slavery for the Irish people. Similar bailout situations have occurred in many other countries worldwide. “There are two ways to conquer and enslave a nation. One is by the sword. The other is by debt.” – U.S. President John Adams The banking system can and does control the availability of credit (i.e., debt-money loans). It can expand or contract the availability of credit in a nation or worldwide. Over the past decades the more credit that is available the more an economy is likely to grow (there are also other factors including the availability of a cheap energy source, such as oil). When the availability of credit is contracted/reduced by the banking system the money supply shrinks, the availability of money to repay loans plus interest is reduced, foreclosures begin to occur and the economy may start to shrink rather than grow. This expansion and contraction of credit is known as the business cycle. “The fact that the necessary growth can be achieved only by increasing the total level of debt makes the economy heavily dependent on confidence… The economy therefore constantly moves between boom and bust; it is systemically unstable.” – John Joplin and Roy Madron, authors of ‘Gaian Democracies’[5] “The bankrupt country must borrow from international banks and the IMF, which impose a condition of debt relief that the national government may not issue its own money. If the government tries to protect its resources or its banks by nationalizing them for the benefit of its own citizens, it is branded communist, socialist or terrorist and is replaced by one that is friendlier to free enterprise.” – E.H. Brown, Author of the book ‘The Web of Debt’ Author Bob Djurdjevic associates these cycles, which have been experienced by many countries, to what he calls the Wall Street dominated New World Order terrorists: “The Wall Street dominated New World Order (NWO) Empire is being built by colonizing other countries with foreign loans or investments. When the fish is firmly on the hook, the NWO financial terrorists pull the plug, leaving the unsuspecting victim high and dry. And begging to be rescued. In comes the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Its bailout recipes – privatisation, trade, liberalization and other austerity reforms – amount to seizing the target countries’ natural resources, and turning them over to the NWO elites – just as surely as the British Empire did by using cruder methods.” – Bob Djurdjevic, Chronicles Journal[6] The boom-bust-bailout process can be summarised, as follows: Many people’s perceptions are that social programs are targeted to assist poorer people lower down the socio-economic scale. However, the 2008 banking crisis in Europe and the U.S. was a clear example of socialism for the banks and extremely wealthy bondholders. The failing banks that were reckless with their lending and investment practices still got “rewarded” with vast quantities of government bailout monies because they were regarded as “too big to fail”. The attempted justification for such bailouts is that it is in the people’s interests that the banks are kept alive. However, in reality it is the working-class and middle-class tax-payers that are typically forced to shoulder the disproportionate brunt of the bailout, which is in effect a huge transfer of people’s labour and money to the already mega-wealthy bondholders and private owners of the banks. In summary, a private-banking cartel has been able to create booms and busts and drive nations into bankruptcy and bailout using the Problem, Reaction, Solution approach or the Hegelian Dialectic. The reality of this flawed monetary system became apparent to many millions of people in 2008 when the so-called banking crises hit in the U.S. and in Europe. As usual, it was the people that were forced to pay for the debts of privately owned banks. In Ireland, the debts of the private banks were the controversially guaranteed by the Irish government, thereby placing the debt burdens onto the Irish citizens. According to a poll by the Irish Independent in 2010 a substantial majority of the Irish people wanted the State to default on debts to bondholders (See endnote 38). Furthermore, as I noted in a blog in 2010 [7] the people of Ireland did not agree to the use of billions of their monies being used to bail out privately owned banks. There was no national referendum on the issue. The bailout of the private banks by the Irish government prompted much public anger, yet, the mainstream media in Ireland appeared to be generally aligned with the government narrative. A number of commentators and bloggers had criticised the government’s bailout plans to no avail. For example, the following is an extract from an article titled “We must face down the jackals who control the international banking system to save our nation and protect our children’s future” by Robert Pye, a former Irish Department of Finance Analyst: “THERE IS considerable truth in the view that Ireland is no longer a sovereign state but an impoverished suburb of Brussels. Four million people are mired deep in a collective debt that is not of their own making… They call us PIIGS (Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain) because that is what you do with a pig: tie him upside down, slit his throat and drain him dry. Well, I for one reject this disgusting epithet. I also reject utterly the despicable arrogance with which this country is being treated, and the servile ineptitude of those who pose as our leaders. Unless we take a stand and defend our sovereignty, our integrity and our children, we will be destroyed as a nation.”[8] Richard Douthwaite (1942 – 2011) an economist and writer, wrote a relevant article in relation to the planned bailout in Ireland titled “Bailout talks: four truths Ireland can’t ignore”[9]. The following is an extract: “Ireland’s negotiations with the ECB and the IMF are perhaps the most important talks that this country has engaged in… If Ireland has to pay interest on the loans being negotiated at a rate which exceeds the rate at which the economy grows over the next few years, it will make the country’s situation worse, not better… The ECB bears a large share of the responsibility for the regulatory failure which led to the property bubble… There is a Plan B. Ireland doesn’t have to take anything that is offered. It can leave the euro quickly and easily… If the deal offered by the ECB/IMF negotiators is unsatisfactory, the Irish government can simply announce… a new currency… and all wages, rents, debts and other payments are to be paid in harp with immediate effect… After the announcement the government would issue itself with the new currency on a debt-free basis so that it no longer needed to borrow to cover its budget deficit… Ireland has no alternative but to renege on the guarantees and to build itself a future within the EU but outside the eurozone.” An article on broadsheet.ie in 2010 titled “The Senior Bondholders: An Analysis”[10] provided an analysis of who the bondholders actually were that were benefitting from the Irish tax-payer funded government bailout of privately owned insolvent banks. Many of the bondholders were privately held banks “mostly” owned by extremely wealthy individuals. An extract from the article is as follow: “SO…. on one side we have Ireland whose bond holders, its people, have between them a total GDP wealth of 0.207 trillion euros. Who are being FORCED, against their will, to pay Anglo Irish bank’s debts to its bond holders, who between them hold 20.8 Trillion euros. The people of Ireland are paying to, and protecting the wealth and power of, people who have 100 times more wealth!… So who are they? Well many of the bond holders are privately held banks, which list their activities as asset management for off-shore, non-resident and high value individuals.” The following is also a relevant excerpt from an article[11] written by author and blogger Charles Hugh Smith in November 2010 that summarises the situation and the opportunity Ireland had to dis-empower “the vampire banks” which had the world by the throat: “When a nation such as Ireland is running a State deficit equal to 32% of GDP, austerity cannot generate the stupendous surpluses needed to make good the vast sums which are already lost… Ireland, and indeed the world, will survive if all the vampire banks are liquidated. That is the end-state, and “buying time” just increases the misery of the citizens who have been yoked to save their “betters.” Ireland, please drive a stake through the heart of the vampire banks which have the world by the throat. By defaulting, you would be doing the world (and your own nation) an immense favor.” The following extract from a wiki project[12] describes the different responses to the debts of private banks in Iceland and Ireland. Iceland is an interesting example of how a country can stand up against the IMF. “The “Icelandic Solution” involved repudiation. Private banks were allowed to fail and social security measures for the poor and indebted were increased… The UK went so far as to trigger anti-terrorism legislation against Icelandic banks in a bid to pressure Iceland to pay out claims against its private banks… Self-interested bankers are therefore often desperate to avoid government debt default, and generally much prefer an economy to be strangled by debt rather than be freed of it… The Irish government on the other hand, guaranteed private bank debt and in doing so subjected the taxpayers of that country to decades of payments for debts that were not incurred on their behalf or for their benefit. This could be interpreted as theft through the taxing of future generations tomorrow to pay off creditors of private bankers today. Many commentators have observed that in 2010. Iceland recovered much faster than other countries such as Ireland.” When you get a mortgage, loan, or a credit card, the debt money is created out of thin air when you sign on the dotted line of the contract, yet you will have to work (maybe for years) to generate the money to pay back to the bank plus interest – in essence, this is a form of slavery as the bank never had the money in the first place. Income tax monies collected by governments from the people is one of the methods used to service the debt governments owe to the international finance system, money that was originally created entirely from nothing by privately-owned mega-banks. “Federal income tax was instituted specifically to coerce taxpayers to pay the interest due to the banks on the federal debt. If the money supply had been created by the government rather than borrowed from the banks that created it, the income tax would have been unnecessary. … There is a way out of this morass. The early American colonists found it and so did Abraham Lincoln and some other national leaders: the government can take back the money-issuing power from the banks. “ – Ellen Brown, Author of the book ‘The Web of Debt’ “Between usury and taxes the consumer is really played for a sucker. God’s law permits no property tax for it is discriminatory… It discourages stability and brings about a shifting, irresponsible citizenry with no ties to the land. Under our present system, accident, sickness, or old age easily dispossesses a man of his home but in no way reduces his expense….” – Dr. Franklin Snook, Author of America Needs the Divine Law Over decades the power to create debt-money has resulted in the power to own, control and manipulate the assets of the material world, as well media and politics. Those that control the money creation process wield the power to control the corporate media and own the material world, regardless of which political party is elected, or which system is utilised (capitalism, socialism, communism, etc). This mean that many aspects of our lives are in reality controlled from a moneyed source not from a democratic source. This power grab was achieved not by creating more value, but by fully controlling the source of money and the world of finance. A pyramid of control has existed. The higher up you go the closer you get to the source of money creation. At the bottom level we are all going about our daily lives. At the next level up are governments. These are people who are given a monopoly on force and use it to tax and control the population whether or not we agree. The election of new government leaders via representative democracy is an illusion of people power. The vast regulatory systems of government in essence never change. But who controls the governments? It is not the people of the nations that control governments, this is evidenced by the banking bailouts in Europe after 2008. There was no referendum on the subject, the governments simply complied with the wishes of international private banking corporations. At the next level up are the mega corporations and at the next level beyond the corporations is the privately owned worldwide banking cartel. Over decades the mega-corporations have acquired the world’s resources and controlled the markets. To do so they needed access to cheap money. The mega corporations got their loans at special rates from the mega banks. We can conclude that those who control the mega banks ultimately control the mega corporations. “Whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce.. when you realise that the entire system is very easily controlled, one way or another, by a few powerful men at the top, you will not have to be told how periods of inflation and depression originate.“ – James Garfield (20th President of the U.S. – assassinated 1881). “The … bankers rule the world through debt, which is money they create out of nothing. They need world government to ensure no country defaults or tries to overthrow them. As long as private bankers, instead of governments, create money the human race is doomed. These bankers and their allies have bought everything and everyone.” – Henry Makow, Author Also note the comments of Congressman Charles McFadden, Chairman, House Banking and Currency Committee, June 10, 1932: “Some people think the Federal Reserve Banks are U.S. governments institutions. They are not… they are private credit monopolies which prey upon the people of the U.S. for the benefit of themselves and their foreign and domestic swindlers, and rich and predatory money lenders… These twelve private credit monopolies were deceitfully foisted upon this Country by the bankers who came here from Europe and repaid us our hospitality by undermining our American Institutions… The sack of the United States by the FED is the greatest crime in history. Every effort has been made by the FED to conceal its powers, but the truth is the FED has usurped the government. It controls everything here and it controls all foreign relations. It makes and breaks governments at will.” – Congressman Charles McFadden. The major shareholders in the commercial banks are other banks and asset management companies and trusts. For example, asset management company Blackrock has large shareholdings in mega-banks Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan Chase and other banks[13], yet those same banks have major shareholdings in Blackrock. The list of shareholders is diversified amongst various privately owned financial and asset management corporations. In essence, all these various financial entities are interlocked and own each other – the current dominant worldwide privately owned financial orthodoxy is one large self-reinforcing entity under the tentacles of many financial corporations. A study[14] was conducted at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, Switzerland, on the relationships between 37 million companies and investors worldwide, and there is a ‘super-entity’ of just 147 tightly knit mega-corporations that controls 40 percent of the entire global economy. and all of their ownership was held by other members of the super-entity. According to James B. Glattfelder, one of the authors of the study: “In effect, less than 1 per cent of the companies were able to control 40 per cent of the entire network,” Most were financial institutions and included Barclays Bank, JPMorgan Chase & Co, and The Goldman Sachs Group. The dominant players appear to be the banking families that have been operating private banking for generations. The involvement of certain banking families in private banking for generations is mentioned in books including ‘The Web of Debt’ by Ellen Brown, chair of the U.S. Public Banking Institute. Families that are often mentioned in relation to the banking industry include the Rothschild banking dynasty[15] (associated with US Trust owned by Bank of America), The Rockefeller world business empire (associated with Citigroup), the Schiff’s, the Morgan’s[16] (associated with Morgan Stanley, etc.), and the Warburg’s. Author Dean Henderson writes in an article[17]: “The Four Horsemen of Banking (Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo)… According to company 10K filings to the SEC, the Four Horsemen of Banking are among the top ten stock holders of virtually every Fortune 500 corporation… One important repository for the wealth of the global oligarchy that owns these bank holding companies is US Trust Corporation – founded in 1853 and now owned by Bank of America. A recent US Trust Corporate Director and Honorary Trustee was Walter Rothschild… [18]” Furthermore, according to Ellen Brown, chairperson of the Public Banking Institute in the U.S. asset management companies, such as Blackrock, literally own much of the U.S. and the world. She states: “BlackRock has a controlling interest in all the major corporations in the S&P 500, it professes not to “own” the funds. It just acts as a kind of “custodian” for its investors — or so it claims. But BlackRock and the other Big 3 ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) vote the corporations’ shares; so from the point of view of management, they are the owners. And as observed in a 2017 article from the University of Amsterdam titled “These Three Firms Own Corporate America” they vote 90% of the time in favor of management.”[19] In a 2018 review titled “Blackrock – The Company That Owns the World’[20], a multinational research group called Investigate Europe concluded that BlackRock “undermines competition through owning shares in competing companies”. The major shareholders of Blackrock are all mega-banks and financial corporations, such as Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citi Group, Wells Fargo and Company, Morgan Stanley, and other various other banks[21]. So, privately owned commercial banks own Blackrock and the other major asset management companies that own most of the world. Author Karen Hudes, who worked in the legal department of the World Bank for more than 20 years, has cited the above Swiss study during an interview with the New American[22] pointing, out that a small group of entities, mostly financial institutions and especially central banks, exert a massive amount of influence over the international economy from behind the scenes. According to Hudes “What is really going on is that the world’s resources are being dominated by this group,” and that “corrupt power grabbers” have managed to dominate the media as well. According to Hudes, the power grabbers also dominate the organizations that control the creation and flow of money worldwide and control the finances of virtually every nation in the world. These organizations include The World Bank, the IMF and central banks, such as the Federal Reserve, all of which are unelected and unaccountable. Author E.H. Brown states that: “Secrecy has been maintained because the robber barons have been able to use their monopoly over money to buy up major media, educational institutions, and other outlets of public information. While Rockefeller was buying up universities, medical schools, and the Encyclopedia Britannica, Morgan bought up newspapers… By 1983,.. fifty corporations owned half or more of the media business. By 2000, that number was down to six corporations, with directorates interlocked with each other and with major commercial banks.[23]” For more information see also the book Demonic Economics and the Tricks of the Bankers. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: Why Tesla's stock has been cratering

Elon Musk may be President Trump's first buddy, but Tesla (TSLA) investors have swung back to focusing more on the company's fundamentals than the billionaire's close proximity to the Resolute desk. Their decision? To send Tesla's stock tumbling less than two months into 2025. Shares of the electric vehicle maker led by Musk are down 28% to $349.18 since hitting a record high on Dec. 18, 2024, weeks after the Election Day win for Trump. The stock is the worst-performing member of the closely watched "Magnificent Seven," which includes Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Google (GOOG), and Apple (AAPL). At the time, enthusiasm was running high that Musk's fierce support of Trump would unlock big-time profits as driverless cars would get quicker approval — among other bullish lines of thinking. But since reaching that peak, Tesla's stock has fallen below its key 50-day moving average, according to Yahoo Finance data. The next test of investor sentiment on Tesla is coming at $334, or the 100-day moving average. Should the stock break below that important support level, it could have a clear shot to the 200-day moving average of $286. Tesla's 52-week low is $142.05 hit on April 22, 2024. "Given the considerable run up in the shares as performance and expected future performance have by equal measure deteriorated, we sense a high risk of mean reversion (including by potential catalysts that may be difficult to foresee at present) and for this reason continue to recommend caution with regard to an investment in Tesla shares," JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote in a new client note. Brinkman is one of the most bearish sell-side analysts on Tesla, with an Underperform rating and $135 price target. The reasons Tesla's stock is under pressure are numerous. For one, numbers on Tesla sales from important overseas markets have come in soft to kick off the year. The readings have triggered some concerns in Tesla circles that Musk's close proximity to Trump is damaging its brand. Tesla sold 63,238 vehicles in China in January, according to new data released this week from China Passenger Car Association (CPCA). The figure marked a steep 33% drop from December. Australia's Electric Vehicle Council (EVC) reported Tesla's overall sales fell 33% year over year in January. Meanwhile, fresh tariffs from President Trump stand to raise costs for Tesla and other EV makers. On Monday, Trump signed two executive orders imposing new 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum. Both steel and aluminum are key raw materials used by Tesla. Trump's new trade war with China doesn't help either — a 2023 study by Nikkei found that 40% of the suppliers for materials used in Tesla's batteries are Chinese companies. "Changes in government and economic policies, incentives or tariffs may also impact our production, sales, cost structure and the competitive landscape," Tesla pointed out in its latest 10-K filing. And lastly, Tesla's fourth quarter left a lot to be desired. The company's EPS missed analyst estimates by a penny. Automotive sales fell 8% year over year due to price cuts across the Tesla vehicle lineup. "They missed their 2024 delivery guidance, which we knew about a month ago. Their margins were pretty weak ... And, if we're reading this correctly, the full self-driving rollout in Europe and China is not going to happen in the first quarter," Canaccord Genuity managing director George Gianarikas said on Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief, calling the results "kind of squishy." Yahoo Finance data shows analysts have aggressively marked down earnings per share estimates on Tesla for 2025 and 2026 in the wake of the lackluster earnings report. "Tesla faces a variety of risks given its broad reach. On automotive, we believe the largest risk is demand softness/stagnation related to EV fatigue and/or competition," Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu pointed out in a note.

Elon Musk may be President Trump's first buddy, but Tesla (TSLA) investors have swung back to focusing more on the company's fundamentals than the billionaire's close proximity to the Resolute desk. Their decision? To send Tesla's stock tumbling less than two months into 2025. Shares of the electric vehicle maker led by Musk are down 28% to $349.18 since hitting a record high on Dec. 18, 2024, weeks after the Election Day win for Trump. The stock is the worst-performing member of the closely watched "Magnificent Seven," which includes Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Google (GOOG), and Apple (AAPL). At the time, enthusiasm was running high that Musk's fierce support of Trump would unlock big-time profits as driverless cars would get quicker approval — among other bullish lines of thinking. But since reaching that peak, Tesla's stock has fallen below its key 50-day moving average, according to Yahoo Finance data. The next test of investor sentiment on Tesla is coming at $334, or the 100-day moving average. Should the stock break below that important support level, it could have a clear shot to the 200-day moving average of $286. Tesla's 52-week low is $142.05 hit on April 22, 2024. "Given the considerable run up in the shares as performance and expected future performance have by equal measure deteriorated, we sense a high risk of mean reversion (including by potential catalysts that may be difficult to foresee at present) and for this reason continue to recommend caution with regard to an investment in Tesla shares," JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote in a new client note. Brinkman is one of the most bearish sell-side analysts on Tesla, with an Underperform rating and $135 price target. The reasons Tesla's stock is under pressure are numerous. For one, numbers on Tesla sales from important overseas markets have come in soft to kick off the year. The readings have triggered some concerns in Tesla circles that Musk's close proximity to Trump is damaging its brand. Tesla sold 63,238 vehicles in China in January, according to new data released this week from China Passenger Car Association (CPCA). The figure marked a steep 33% drop from December. Australia's Electric Vehicle Council (EVC) reported Tesla's overall sales fell 33% year over year in January. Meanwhile, fresh tariffs from President Trump stand to raise costs for Tesla and other EV makers. On Monday, Trump signed two executive orders imposing new 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum. Both steel and aluminum are key raw materials used by Tesla. Trump's new trade war with China doesn't help either — a 2023 study by Nikkei found that 40% of the suppliers for materials used in Tesla's batteries are Chinese companies. "Changes in government and economic policies, incentives or tariffs may also impact our production, sales, cost structure and the competitive landscape," Tesla pointed out in its latest 10-K filing. And lastly, Tesla's fourth quarter left a lot to be desired. The company's EPS missed analyst estimates by a penny. Automotive sales fell 8% year over year due to price cuts across the Tesla vehicle lineup. "They missed their 2024 delivery guidance, which we knew about a month ago. Their margins were pretty weak ... And, if we're reading this correctly, the full self-driving rollout in Europe and China is not going to happen in the first quarter," Canaccord Genuity managing director George Gianarikas said on Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief, calling the results "kind of squishy." Yahoo Finance data shows analysts have aggressively marked down earnings per share estimates on Tesla for 2025 and 2026 in the wake of the lackluster earnings report. "Tesla faces a variety of risks given its broad reach. On automotive, we believe the largest risk is demand softness/stagnation related to EV fatigue and/or competition," Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu pointed out in a note.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- Even in a market where artificial intelligence winners are rewarded, Meta Platforms Inc. shares stand out. Most Read from Bloomberg Why American Mobility Ground to a Halt Saudi Arabia’s Neom Signs $5 Billion Deal for AI Data Center SpaceX Bid to Turn Texas Starbase Into City Is Set for Vote in May Cutting Arena Subsidies Can Help Cover Tax Cuts, Think Tank Says The Facebook parent’s record 16-day rally has been driven by all manner of news — even the kind that has pressured its megacap rivals — pushing its valuation toward $2 trillion for the first time. “I have long viewed Meta as the biggest beneficiary of AI outside of maybe Nvidia, and I think more people are coming around to that idea,” said Conrad van Tienhoven, a portfolio manager at Riverpark Capital. While the likes of Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc. face questions on when they will see a return on their billions spent on AI, “Meta spent the money on AI solutions that have had an immediate impact on how it targets and measures ads, the outcome of which has been faster growth and a higher average revenue per user.” The stock fell 0.8% on Tuesday, but the 16-day rally represented the longest winning streak of any current Nasdaq 100 Index component going back to 1990, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It added more than 17% over the surge, bringing its market capitalization above $1.8 trillion. Despite the gain, it remains one of the cheapest big tech plays. The string of catalysts has been remarkable. In January, Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said the company plans to invest as much as $65 billion on AI projects in 2025, much more than had been expected. While capex plans have come under increased scrutiny, Meta’s target reinforced the perception it is investing from a place of strength. While tech was rocked by the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup that claimed strong performance despite costing less and requiring fewer chips, Meta shares climbed. Investors took DeepSeek’s success as a validation of open-sourced models, as employed by Meta’s Llama. The firm’s results underlined how AI is flowing through to its financials, improving how ads are targeted to its billions of users. Zuckerberg said 2025 would be a “really big year” for AI. Then, Meta on Monday began notifying staff of job cuts as it focuses on AI talent. Zuckerberg has also made some high-profile changes that have served to better align Meta with the Trump administration. The stock’s streak began before the inauguration in January. The recent strength stands in contrast to Alphabet, the other major player in online advertising, which disappointed with its results, putting shares in negative territory for the year, compared with Meta’s gain of about 22%. “Meta is really ahead of its competitors in proving that the capex it is pouring into AI is working, which is why investors continue to gravitate toward it,” said Jim Polk, head of equity investments at Homestead Advisers. “It has shown that AI is having an impact on user engagement, on margins, whereas Alphabet still needs to prove its capex is working and that its market share in search won’t be eroded.” Revenue growth at Meta is seen rising almost 15% in 2025, before modestly decelerating over the subsequent years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. However, net earnings growth is seen accelerating from 6.2% this year to 15% in 2026. The extraordinary length of Meta’s rally has brought its 14-day relative strength index to about 77, notably over the level of 70 that signals to some technical analysts that a stock is overbought. However, even with the streak, Meta’s valuation doesn’t scan as especially high. The company currently trades at nearly 27 times forward earnings, the highest level for shares since 2020, but in line with the Nasdaq 100. Among the Magnificent Seven group of tech stocks, only Alphabet Inc. trades at a lower multiple. “It’s in algo heaven because it’s one of the few large cap stocks that had a perfect quarter,” said Rhys Williams of Wayve Capital Management. “Models really like reasonably priced stocks where fundamentals are solid.” Meta’s current success represents a dramatic turnaround from just a couple years ago, when shares cratered amid its strategic pivot to focusing on the metaverse, along with a privacy-policy change from Apple Inc. that diminished Meta’s ability to target ads, and negative user trends, especially amid competition from TikTok. Those concerns have all been reduced. Meta’s AI investments have offset the impact of Apple’s policy and contributed to improved user engagement, and while TikTok remains a significant competitor, its future is uncertain ahead of a US ban that could go into effect in early April. “Right now I suspect the market is pricing in TikTok not being banned in the U.S., but if the ban does go through, it would be a huge positive for Meta,” Polk said. “I don’t know how likely it is, but that is something that could keep the rally going.” Tech Chart of the Day Tesla Inc. shares are extending losses for a fifth consecutive session, edging lower in Tuesday trading. Elon Musk’s net worth fell below $400 billion for the first time in two months, dragged down by the slide in Tesla’s share price. In recent weeks the stock has been weighed down by bad sales reports from around the world, while Chinese rival BYD has upped the ante through its smart-driving strategy. Top Tech Stories A group of investors led by Musk has offered to buy the nonprofit that controls OpenAI for $97.4 billion, escalating a clash between the Tesla chief executive and the artificial intelligence company he co-founded. Stripe Inc. is in discussions to arrange sales of stock by employees at a $85 billion valuation, people familiar with the matter said, a deal that could help the Silicon Valley payments startup regain some of the capitalization it lost during a post-Covid slump. Saudi Arabia’s Neom, the megacity being developed on the Red Sea coast, secured a $5 billion investment from a local firm to establish an AI data center. Elon Musk’s net worth fell below $400 billion for the first time in two months, dragged down by a double-digit slide in Tesla Inc.’s share price. Meta Platforms Inc. began notifying staff of job cuts on Monday, kick-starting a process that will terminate thousands of people as the company cracks down on “low-performers” and scours for new talent to dominate the AI race.

Title: The impact of Trump's tariffs is already being felt

Hello there! Business Insider saw a list of nearly 30 staffers at the White House DOGE office. The group, which is helping Elon Musk embark on a massive reshaping of the federal government, consists of mostly early and mid-career professionals. In today's big story, new tariff plans spell trouble for Canada while the trade war is already impacting influencer marketing. What's on deck Markets: The consultants and podcasters trying to demystify how the world's largest hedge funds are run. Tech: Meta's performance-based cuts don't mean it's done hiring. Business: President Trump's buyout plan for federal workers is still on pause. But first, more trade trouble. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Another day. Another tariff. President Donald Trump is targeting steel and aluminum with his latest tariff plans, enacting a 25% tax on the metal imports. That's set to have a big impact on Canada, a top supplier of both steel and aluminum to the US, writes Business Insider's Allie Kelly and Madison Hoff. Mexico, Brazil, the United Arab Emirates, and China are also big metal exporters to the US. What's bad for our trading partners is good for some American companies. Before the tariffs were even official, shares of US Steel still jumped as much as 6% on Monday. The trade taxes are a double win for local steel producers, writes Matthew Fox, as it will limit foreign companies' ability to flood the US market with lower-priced steel while also giving them the flexibility to raise their prices. Investors in gold have also been big winners, as precious metals could be hit with tariffs next. More broadly, gold has been viewed as a safe haven amid constant uncertainty over the threat of new tariffs. The impact of tariffs is already being felt in another corner of the economy. Some fashion brands are pausing influencer campaigns and blaming it on US tariffs, write BI's Amanda Perelli, Dan Whateley, and Geoff Weiss. Halara and Shein are pausing some campaigns as they assess what the tariffs will mean for their businesses. It's yet another blow to an industry grappling with the threat of a TikTok ban. But it's also far from the only market facing tariff-related headaches. If things escalate to the point where countries implement retaliatory tariffs on the US, S&P 500 firms could see an 8% hit to their earnings, according to Bank of America. A lot of the concerns over tariffs remain speculative, though. And some have long dismissed Trump's trade plans as a negotiation tactic to obtain better trading terms. But even if that's the case, the uncertainty surrounding what will and won't happen continues to cause problems. Nike had the buzziest Super Bowl ad on social media, data shows. 1. Sorry, coffee drinkers. Your morning cup of joe might start costing more. Eggs aren't the only breakfast staple under pressure. Coffee prices are expected to climb this year thanks to supply snags that could exacerbate the shortage of beans, BofA analysts said. Last week, Arabica coffee prices closed at an all-time high of $4.04 per pound — and analysts said they expect coffee retail prices to keep going up. 2. Video game stocks are looking to notch a new high score. Pent-up demand for long-awaited releases like Grand Theft Auto 6 and the Nintendo Switch 2 is boosting video game companies' shares. The Global X Video Games & Esports ETF is up 12% this year, far outstripping the S&P 500's 3% year-to-date return. 3. Demystifying big-name hedge funds. Former portfolio managers are launching podcasts, Substacks, and consulting firms to assist with talent development and offer an inside look at top funds like Citadel and Point72. These voices also give prospective PMs and analysts a reality check on what it really takes to succeed at those companies. (Hint: It's a lot of hard work.) 1. Meta speeds up hiring despite layoffs. As the social media giant slashes thousands of low performers from its workforce, Meta is also expediting its hiring process for engineers. It's specifically focused on machine-learning, according to an internal memo. 2. AI is Gen Z's work buddy. A growing number of Gen Z workers leverage AI at the office, from drafting emails to conducting research. While AI's proponents say it can free up their time to focus on higher-level responsibilities, others caution against relying too heavily on the technology. Still, older workers need to keep pace. 3. The Elon Musk v. Sam Altman feud continues. Musk and a group of investors submitted an unsolicited offer to buy "all assets" of OpenAI Inc. for $97.4 billion. "It's time for OpenAI to return to the open-source, safety-focused force for good it once was," Musk wrote. Altman quickly dismissed the offer, leading to a back-and-forth exchange between the two on X. 1. Former federal workers for hire … but not too many yet. As a judge continues to pause the federal worker buyout plan, economists are weighing in on what the resignations could mean for the labor market. So far, the number of people who accepted the offer is relatively low, and many may plan to retire anyway. But things could heat up further as federal funding tightens. 2. How Fox is (sort of) getting back with its exes. YouTube isn't the only media company betting on podcasts. Fox Corp. bought Red Seat Ventures, a podcasting company that happens to handle production and ad sales for former Fox News stars Tucker Carlson, Megyn Kelly, and Bill O'Reilly. BI's Peter Kafka breaks down the move. 3. TikTok Shop challenges Amazon with its new subscription feature. In the latest move to compete with its e-commerce peers, TikTok Shop is testing a subscription feature, similar to Amazon's subscribe-and-save tool, that would allow users to repeatedly receive products in exchange for a discount. The feature would help sellers lock in recurring revenue and manage shipment amid sale surges from viral videos. Amazon has more than 750,000 robots working in its fulfillment centers. Here are some of the things they can do. Senate Finance Committee hearing on Donald Trump's nominee for US trade representative.

Title: Archer Aviation raises $300 million in BlackRock-backed funding

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Reuters) - Air-taxi maker Archer Aviation said on Tuesday it has raised $300 million in a funding round that consisted of institutional investors including accounts managed by BlackRock. Archer expects the capital raise to help it accelerate the development of its hybrid aircraft platform and further reinforce its balance sheet. "We are raising additional capital to help us invest in critical capabilities like composites and batteries to help enable us to capture this opportunity and more," CEO Adam Goldstein said. The additional capital brings Archer's total liquidity to about $1 billion currently, the company said on Tuesday. The company's statement did not disclose the valuation at which the new capital was raised. The latest fundraising comes amid a cash crunch in the electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) industry, driven by technological and regulatory challenges. However, analysts believe Archer is well positioned to endure these difficulties and achieve certification. The company previously raised $430 million in December through an equity offering that had defense technology company Anduril and existing investors such as United Airlines and Stellantis, as well as new backers such as Wellington Management and Abu Dhabi investment holding company 2PointZero, participate in the fundraising. Santa Clara, California-based Archer said in its preliminary fourth-quarter results that its adjusted operating expenses were in line with its forecast range of $95 million to $110 million. It also said it does not expect its total adjusted operating expenses for the first quarter of 2025 to materially increase above its Q4 guided range.

It’s a trend that is already heating up in aerospace. Take Archer Aviation, a California-based startup building eVTOLs (electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles). Until very recently, Archer’s go-to-market strategy was an air taxi network across several cities in the U.S. and abroad. Archer’s focus is now more acutely on defense, and it has attracted fresh capital to further that mission. The company, which went public in September 2021 via a special purpose acquisition merger (SPAC), on Tuesday announced a $300 million equity raise from institutional investors like BlackRock and Wellington. The raise brings Archer’s total funding to around $3.36 billion. This fresh capital comes off the back of a $430 million round in December to fund its new Archer Defense program. As part of that program, Archer signed an exclusive deal with weapons manufacturer Anduril to jointly develop a hybrid gas-and-electric-powered VTOL aircraft for critical defense applications. Together, the two are targeting a program of record from the Department of Defense, which is a budgeted acquisition program with guaranteed funding over a set period. “As we dug into the work we were doing on the defense front, we realized that the market was a lot larger than we initially expected, both in terms of scope as well as timing,” Nikhil Goel, Archer’s chief commercial officer, told TechCrunch. “We’re the only company in the space that I think is targeting a sizable defense program of record,” Goel continued. “So we really want to be strategic with the investments we’re making and go full steam ahead on this.” Rivals in the space like Joby Aviation and Beta Technologies also have military contracts to test their aircraft for surveillance, logistics, and reconnaissance missions. Archer has such contracts with the military, but what it’s chasing now via the program of record is guaranteed funding, a path to scale, and a serious competitive moat. Goel confirmed that the $300 million from investors will mainly be used to accelerate the work Archer is doing with Anduril to build a hybrid craft (VTOL), though he didn’t share any updates on the company’s bid with the DOD. Archer’s decision comes at a moment of industry momentum. The Trump administration has vowed to “rapidly field emerging technologies” like AI, drones, and counter-drone systems to modernize the military. The very qualities that make eVTOLs perfect for urban and regional flight are also attractive for defense use cases. Cruising at 300 feet, Archer Aviation’s electric aircraft, Midnight, makes less noise than a passing car on the highway. In an urban environment, it blends into other transportation sounds in a way that helicopters cannot. “The sound profile is why we are so well positioned to [build aircraft] for defense,” Goel said. “If you look at the traditional helicopters that the defense industry uses, they’re very loud and have very noticeable heat signatures. And so that makes helicopters not a great fit for more discreet missions.” Archer’s Midnight is built with 12 sets of engines and propellers – six in the front, six in the back. That distributed propulsion among smaller rotors that spin slightly slower — rather than a single large main rotor and tail rotor that operate at high speeds — creates much less noise. VTOLs are also designed to transition from a vertical lift to a winged horizontal flight like an airplane. When in forward flight, the Midnight generates all the lift from the wing, rather than from downward thrust, which also reduces overall rotor noise, Archer’s CEO and founder Adam Goldstein told TechCrunch during a recent flight demonstration. While Archer is gunning to supply the defense industry with aircraft, the company still intends to launch its first limited commercial air taxi network in late 2025 in the United Arab Emirates. In 2026, Archer says it will expand air taxi services to several other cities and countries, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, South Korea, and India. The company has partnered with major airlines to facilitate air taxi networks like United, Southwest, and IndiGo. In November 2024, a joint venture from Japan Airlines and Sumitomo conditionally agreed to purchase up to $500 million worth of electric aircraft from Archer. But 2026 isn’t that far away, and Archer has pushed out its timelines before. That’s partly because Archer is still working toward validating the safety of its eVTOLs and securing the necessary certification from the Federal Aviation Administration. In the U.S., eVTOL companies need to secure type certification to approve the design of an aircraft, production certification to prove they can mass-produce a vehicle that meets its approved design, and airworthiness certification to ensure an aircraft is safe for flying. Goel says Archer is far along in the process for those certifications but has yet to receive any of them. Nor has Archer flown with a pilot in its aircraft yet, which is a necessary step toward testing the aircraft with passengers. He adds that Archer will put a pilot in one of its Midnights “imminently.” The process of certifying aircraft and scaling production is an expensive one. Construction on Archer’s Georgia factory, built with its strategic investor, Stellantis, is nearly complete, with production expected to begin this quarter. Archer hopes to build 650 aircraft annually by 2030. For this year, though, Archer’s goal is to produce eight to 10 aircraft between the Georgia facility and its prototype facility in California. Goldstein told TechCrunch back in October that most of the capital expenditures to get the factory up and running have already been spent, so the focus is on scaling Midnight eVTOLs while also developing the hybrid defense aircraft. Today’s raise brings Archer’s total liquidity to well over $1 billion, extending its runway for “multiple years” through commercialization and the initial phases of defense work, according to Goel. Archer has yet to share its 2024 fourth-quarter and full-year earnings, but the company’s total operating expenses hit $385 million in the first three quarters of the year, or $281 million on an adjusted basis. Archer anticipated adjusted operating expenses for Q4 to be between $95 million and $110 million. It’s not yet clear how much Archer’s development of a hybrid aircraft for warfare will increase the company’s expenses.

UPDATED 08:30 EST / FEBRUARY 11 2025 by Duncan Riley Electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft company Archer Aviation Inc. announced today that it has raised $300 million in new funding via an equity capital raise. The $300 million in funding, raised through a securities purchase agreement, came from Blackrock Inc. and other leading institutional investors. The funding will be used to strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow the company to accelerate the development of its hybrid aircraft platform, particularly for defense applications. While perhaps better known for its attempts to bring a flying taxi to market — which it is still pursuing — Archer has more recently shifted much of its focus to the defense sector. The company announced that it had signed a partnership with Anduril Industries Inc., a startup active in the defense sector, in December, alongside an announcement that it had raised $430 million to develop military aircraft. Archer’s main offering, be it one still under development, is an electric flying taxi dubbed Midnight. The aircraft offers vertical takeoff and landing and is powered by propellers that can cover up to 100 miles per trip at a top speed of 150 miles per hour. Notably, Archer signed a $142 million contract to deliver six Midnights to the U.S. Air Force in July 2023. The aircraft, which can carry approximately 1,000-pound payloads, offers the U.S. military a rapid response aircraft with effectiveness across a wide range of mission profiles, from personnel transport and logistics support to rescue operations and more. As part of its shift into defense, Archer also launched a dedicated unit, Archer Defense, to develop next-generation aircraft for defense applications. The first product from the division is planned to be a hybrid-propulsion vertical-take-off-and landing aircraft. The proceeds from the equity raise today are planned to be used for the development of next-generation aircraft manufacturing capabilities related to the new aircraft, including batteries and composites, with the remainder of the funding going for general corporate purposes. “The opportunity for advanced vertical lift aircraft across defense appears to be substantially larger than I originally expected,” said Archer founder and Chief Executive Adam Goldstein. “As a result, we are raising additional capital to help us invest in critical capabilities like composites and batteries to capture this opportunity and more.” THANK YOU Archer Aviation raises $300M from Blackrock to expand defense sector focus F5 targets AI-era IT challenges with ADC 3.0 reference architectures Cisco embeds security services in new line of programmable switches Amplitude integrates in-app surveys into its behavioral analysis platform Consortium led by Elon Musk makes $97.4B offer for OpenAI NXP buys Kinara for $307M to power AI workloads at the network edge Archer Aviation raises $300M from Blackrock to expand defense sector focus EMERGING TECH - BY DUNCAN RILEY . 1 MIN AGO F5 targets AI-era IT challenges with ADC 3.0 reference architectures AI - BY DUNCAN RILEY . 2 HOURS AGO Cisco embeds security services in new line of programmable switches INFRA - BY PAUL GILLIN . 5 HOURS AGO Amplitude integrates in-app surveys into its behavioral analysis platform AI - BY PAUL GILLIN . 8 HOURS AGO Consortium led by Elon Musk makes $97.4B offer for OpenAI AI - BY MARIA DEUTSCHER . 14 HOURS AGO NXP buys Kinara for $307M to power AI workloads at the network edge AI - BY MIKE WHEATLEY . 14 HOURS AGO

Posted on 02/11/2025 5:23:56 AM PST by hardspunned KYIV, Feb 11 — US President Donald Trump floated the idea that Ukraine "may be Russian someday”, as his Vice President JD Vance gears up to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky later this week. Pushing for an end to the nearly three-year war with Russia, Trump discussed the conflict in an interview with broadcaster Fox News that aired yesterday. "They may make a deal, they may not make a deal. They may be Russian someday, or they may not be Russian someday,” he said. Trump also emphasised reaping a return on investment with US aid to Ukraine, suggesting a trade for Kyiv’s natural resources, such as rare minerals. (Excerpt) Read more at malaymail.com ...

There have been many a great power that were forced to leave a territory, not because they were driven out, but because it became too costly to stay.

Title: Forbes Daily: Why Elon Musk And Tesla Could Have A Perception Problem

Full Content:
Today’s Forbes Daily newsletter covers El Segundo’s defense tech movement, Trump’s funding violation, Eric Adams update, Tesla’s negative perception, Musk’s bid to buy OpenAI and more. A key line item in Meta’s plan to invest $65 billion in AI this year is 2,250 acres of flat farmland in northeast Louisiana. There, the tech giant has begun work on a $10 billion data center in Richland Parish, the grandest of Meta’s 20 data centers worldwide. The center will need 2.23 gigawatts of 24/7 electricity, enough to power more than 2 million homes. That seems like a lot, but even if AI efficiency significantly improves, the energy-hogging technology will still need those server farms and some, thanks to a dynamic known as Jevons Paradox, which predicts that increased efficiency causes increased demand. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved A federal judge ruled Monday that the Trump Administration violated his order calling for a stop on spending freezes for a broad range of federal funds—the latest in a slew of legal actions against the president and cost-cutting czar Elon Musk. The judge ordered the Trump Administration to “immediately restore frozen funding” that Congress approved. A top Justice Department official asked federal prosecutors to drop their case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, multiple outlets reported Monday. Adams faces charges based on allegations that he received illegal donations from the Turkish government for his 2021 mayoral campaign. But in recent weeks, Adams has gotten publicly closer to President Donald Trump, meeting with him at Mar-a-Lago and attending the inauguration last month. Charlie Javice JPMorgan bought fintech startup Frank in 2021, but just a year later claimed its founder Charlie Javice invented millions of customers to close the deal. Now, the Forbes 30 Under 30 alum will stand trial in a New York federal court, and prosecutors have said the case will serve as a cautionary tale for early-stage CEOs and aspiring tech founders everywhere. As Tesla CEO Elon Musk grows further embedded in the White House, his electric vehicle company’s public perception is weighing on shares, according to polling by investment research firm Stifel. “The negative downturn in consumers’ perception of Elon Musk … potentially results in a headwind to sales,” a Stifel analyst wrote as the firm lowered its price target for the stock. Gold hit another record high Monday, extending a yearslong rally as President Donald Trump’s tariffs upend global trade policy and investors search for a safe haven. Gold is up 44% over the last year, by far the best-performer across a basket of 12 leading global asset classes over the period, according to the BlackRock Investment Institute. Abu Dhabi-based startup AppliedAI has raised one of the region’s largest early-stage venture funding rounds. Founder and CEO Arya Bolurfrushan’s pitch is that his AI, and human reviewers, can process complex medical billing records or insurance claims faster and more accurately than traditional outsourcing companies. Elon Musk and other investors made a $97.4 billion unsolicited bid to buy the nonprofit group that controls OpenAI, escalating a longstanding feud between Musk and OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman. Altman quickly rejected the offer, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, and mocked Musk on X. Elon Musk Democrats and student loan borrowers have raised concerns about reports suggesting billionaire Elon Musk and his DOGE associates may have access to sensitive student loan information at the Department of Education. Students at University of California schools filed a federal lawsuit against the Education Department arguing DOGE’s access to that data violates federal laws that maintain strict privacy regulations around sensitive financial aid information. But despite some posts circulating on TikTok, borrowers are unlikely to receive any financial relief if Musk’s access is ruled unlawful. Last week, Musk attacked a Wall Street Journal reporter on X after she revealed that a 25-year-old DOGE staffer had a history of racist and pro-eugenics online posts. But he confused the journalist with another from Politico, illustrating again how misinformation has run rampant on X under his ownership. Fox drew 126 million viewers for its broadcast of Super Bowl LIX on Sunday across platforms, according to multiple outlets, marking the most-watched matchup in Super Bowl history. The record-breaking viewership included audiences who tuned into Fox’s free streaming platform Tubi, which generated 13.6 million viewers. Photographs of some of those taken hostage by Hamas during the October 2023 attack. Hamas said it will delay the next planned release of Israeli hostages and accused Israel of not following the terms of its ceasefire agreement, a move that could potentially disrupt the ceasefire that paused the 15-month war in Gaza. Since the ceasefire went into effect on January 19, both Hamas and Israel have accused the other of violating its terms. After President Donald Trump signed an order placing 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from all countries on Monday, the president of the European Commission issued a statement expressing regret at the decision. Ursula von der Leyen said the tariffs were “bad for business, worse for consumers,” and warned that the “unjustified tariffs on the EU will not go unanswered—they will trigger firm and proportionate countermeasures.” Two storms this week are expected to dump snow across the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions, and major airlines are allowing some travelers to rebook their flights without a fee. Winter Storm Harlow will bring heavy snow over the Central Plains and Ohio Valley into the Mid-Atlantic on Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service, followed by Winter Storm Iliana, which will develop Tuesday night in the Plains before spreading eastward. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Monday announced Fort Liberty in North Carolina will be renamed once again to Fort Bragg—the base’s previous name, which was changed in 2023 as a part of a Pentagon effort to rescind special honors given to officials linked to the Confederacy. However, Hegseth said the new name does not honor the Confederate general Braxton Bragg, but that it pays tribute to Private First Class Roland L. Bragg, a World War II veteran who was awarded the Silver Star and Purple Heart for “exceptional courage during the Battle of the Bulge.” ILLUSTRATION BY EMILY SCHERER FOR FORBES; PHOTOS BY ANDY RYAN, TAEK-SANG JEONG/GETTY IMAGES TOPLINE A new generation of startups in El Segundo, California, which has become the center of Silicon Valley’s defense tech movement, are leaning into a MAGA-fied, pro-Christian, mostly male-led vision of Silicon Valley. El Segundo’s founders, or self-identified ‘Gundo bros,’ are commanding the attention of some of the biggest venture capital outfits around. Lux Capital, Andreessen Horowitz and Point72 Ventures are among those who have backed more than half a dozen founders from Discipulus Ventures’ first cohort alone. They’re pouring money into seed-stage companies Durin, which is developing autonomous drilling equipment for the mining industry; Rune Technologies, which is building software for military units to manage supply chains; and Vanguard Defense, which is building a data product for electronic warfare. Now, Discipulus has launched its own fund to back the second cohort of entrepreneurs that it plans to host for a weeklong event in coming months, raising $6 million from investors. It’s a small fund, but one with big Y Combinator-style ambitions that align with the Trump Administration’s priorities. For Augustus Doricko, one of several very online Gundo bros, this second Discipulus cohort is further evidence of a shift away from an era of investment in consumer apps and B2B solutions toward a new one that favors America’s national security interests and military prowess. WHY IT MATTERS It’s a so-called “vibe shift” that has inspired a MAGA-fied, pro-Christian vision of Silicon Valley tightly aligned with Elon Musk and the Trump Administration’s goals. The billionaire venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, for example, has backed a venture firm called New Founding, which is building a Christian real estate enclave, and hopes to be part of an effort to “forge new models and institutions that can shape the direction of Western civilization.” MORE The Tech Bros Powering Silicon Valley’s Military Fever Dream With Energy Drinks, God And Nicotine Early data from the IRS shows this tax season is off to a sluggish start, though the average tax refund is up. There’s been confusion among taxpayers amid recent changes at the IRS, including a hiring freeze: 13,177,000: The number of individual income tax returns the IRS has received in 2025, a 14% drop from early 2024 34.8%: The decline in web visits to IRS.gov from last year $1,928: The average refund per taxpayer as of January 31, an increase of 38% compared to this time last year Women’s fatigue is often underestimated due to gender bias, but unrecognized fatigue can lead to burnout, decreased productivity and long-term health issues. It’s critical that managers lead by example and prioritize incorporating short, regular breaks, and normalize taking mental health days. When companies prioritize rest, they can cultivate a culture that supports employee well-being and promotes productivity.

Title: Why the Federal Reserve could shock the markets this summer: Economist

Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts. If there is shock coming to markets, it could arrive this summer. And it could be in the form of a rate hike from the Federal Reserve. Apollo Global Management chief economist Torsten Slok says the US economy is already running at a healthy 3% Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth pace, supported by high stock prices, investments in AI data centers by the likes of Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN), and strong defense spending. Layering on Trump tariffs would add fuel to the economic fire and drive up inflation, warns the veteran economist. "So if with that backdrop we have policies that are now lifting inflation modestly from an already too high level, then my view would certainly be that then maybe we are not done with the Fed hiking rates. There is a risk that we could still have a rate hike later this year," Slok told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen in below). Slok believes that should inflation accelerate as tariffs take hold, the first rate hike from Fed could come at its mid-June meeting. More may follow, Slok says, which could surprise a market that has settled into the view of the Fed standing pat on rates this year — if not lowering them further. "If we have a significant increase in inflation because of a strong economy and potentially some policies that give a modest lift to inflation, then you could have several hikes later this year," Slok added. The seeds for a renewed bout of inflation are being planted. On Monday, president Trump signed two executive orders imposing new 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum. Last Tuesday, the president imposed a 10% tariff on all Chinese imports on top of existing tariffs on the country. China retaliated, placing tariffs on select chips and metals. It also began investigating Google (GOOG) and blacklisted US apparel brands Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, operated by PVH Corp. (PVH). Trump recently agreed to pause 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico for 30 days. Estimates on the impact of tariffs on inflation vary, but economists agree there will some consequences. A new report from Deutsche Bank economists project the steel and aluminum tariffs alone could boost the core personal expenditures price index (PCE) — a key read on inflation — by 0.4%. Should the tariffs on Mexico and Canada go through, inflation could rise more than 3.5%, Deutsche Bank said. On this front, Goldman Sachs economists estimated "long-term" 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico imports could lift the PCE by 0.7% and hurt GDP by 0.4%. Slok says the market hasn't priced in the prospect of rate hikes yet. The markets would be forced to adjust their profit estimates lower, explained Goldman Sachs chief US strategist David Kostin. If the US implements sustained tariffs on exports consistent with those currently outlined, it would likely cut earnings per share for the S&P 500 by 2% to 3%, Kostin found. “If company managements decide to absorb the higher input costs, then profit margins would be squeezed. If companies pass along the higher costs to end customers, then sales volumes may suffer. Firms may try to push back on their suppliers and ask them to absorb part of the cost of the tariff through lower prices," said Kostin. — Three times each week, I field insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

Title: Bitcoin’s MVRV score nears danger zone – Are short-term holders at risk?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoins-mvrv-score-nears-danger-zone-are-short-term-holders-at-risk/
Time Published: 2025-02-11T12:30:44Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin’s short-term MVRV shows investors are still in profit but a drop cannot be ruled out. The Short-Term Holder (STH) MVRV score for Bitcoin [BTC] recently dropped to 1.05. This crucial threshold indicated investors were just above the break-even point. The drop in the MVRV score suggested a potential cooling-off in buying enthusiasm among short-term holders. Despite this decline, the score remaining above 1 implied that the selling pressure may not be as intense yet. This could potentially prevent another drop. Source: Bitcoin Magazine PRO The STH’s approximate cost basis of around $92,000 serves as a critical support level for the market. BTC could drop to $92K, but if it maintains above this cost basis, it could indicate continued confidence among short-term investors, supporting stable prices or an uptrend. Conversely, if the MVRV score falls below 1, it could signify that most STHs are at a loss. This could lead to increased selling pressure as investors attempt to minimize losses. This scenario would put the $92,000 support level at risk of breaking down, possibly triggering a sharper decline in Bitcoin’s price. Further analysis shows that Bitcoin continued with its pattern of interacting frequently with liquidity zones. This pattern persisted, with BTC initially maintaining levels just above the long clusters before inevitably dipping to sweep the liquidity at $95,000. However, the recurrent tests of these liquidity pools suggested a bearish undertone as the price failed to sustain higher levels, especially near the $100,100 short liquidity zone. Source: Hyblock Capital This consistent pull towards lower liquidity zones, now below $94K, signals a potential setup for further drops, potentially down to the $92,000 level, crucial for short-term holders (STHs). If Bitcoin continues this pattern, the $92K level could soon play a pivotal role. Breaking below this level could lead to a shift in market sentiment, possibly causing short-term holders to capitulate, adding downward pressure on the price. Conversely, a successful defense of this level might reinforce confidence, possibly stabilizing or driving up prices as accumulation occurs at these lower levels. Lastly, this drop is supported by the fact that the prices declined despite significant purchases by Michael Saylor’s, MicroStrategy, and BlackRock, alongside the movement of 14,000 dormant Bitcoins. These large transactions might have signaled a potential increase in supply, even if not immediately sold, causing uncertainty and thus a price drop. Source: CryptoQuant Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2025–2026 If these Bitcoins are seen as long-term holds, not sell-offs, it might suggest less selling pressure. This could potentially stabilize or boost the price. Future price moves hinge on whether these Bitcoins stay off exchanges. This could indicate a bullish outlook if viewed as a store of value.

Disclaimer: The below article is sponsored, and the views in it do not represent those of ZyCrypto. Readers should conduct independent research before taking any actions related to the project mentioned in this piece. This article should not be regarded as investment advice. Digital currencies experienced an unanticipated decline in February 2025, yet there are hidden prospects. As many pull back, smart eyes focus on a few cryptocurrencies that exhibit potential and resilience. This article reveals top choices like XYZVerse, Ondo, and Solana. Find out how these tokens could produce remarkable gains amid the market decline and defy the trend. XYZ is your unique VIP pass to a revolution driven by memes and sports. Consider it the XYZVerse ecosystem’s MVP, where cryptocurrency aficionados can profit greatly from the rising demand for meme currencies. However, every revolution requires a hero—someone prepared to overcome all obstacles and elevate the $XYZ token to the top. That hero is XYZepe, the masked warrior, the steadfast $XYZ holding, the genuine believer, whose goal is to propel XYZVerse to the top of CoinMarketCap. The goal is to demonstrate that underdogs can achieve greatness. The XYZVerse ecosystem is expected to grow as millions more sports lovers prepare to play, and your rewards will be incredible! Here is an example of a highlight reel moment: XYZVerse has been named the Best NEW Meme Project, highlighting its enormous potential in the meme coin space. The indisputable leaders in the cryptocurrency space are meme coins, and XYZ is poised to overtake them. With a current price of $0.002, $XYZ is still a cheap cryptocurrency gem that could increase to $0.1 during the last presale phase. Victory, however, requires commitment, strategy, and a fighter prepared to battle to the end. XYZepe is taking $XYZ to a legendary level with the community’s support, even if he knows the challenge ahead. Thanks to its fully vetted workforce, rock-solid protection in the form of audited smart contracts, and impending listings on key CEX and DEX platforms, XYZ is already ahead of the game. Here, the first mover advantage is crucial; if you enter the market before the crowds do, you stand to gain far larger profits! In the realm of cryptocurrencies, Cardano is attracting attention. This blockchain infrastructure is adaptable and long-lasting, designed for smart contracts. This implies it contributes to developing new cryptocurrency tokens, games, and defi apps. ADA, its native coin, is a formidable rival to Ethereum’s ETH. Users can stake their ADA on the network, store value, and make payments. Cardano’s green approach is what sets it apart. It uses Ouroboros, a proof-of-stake mechanism far more energy-efficient than other people’s conventional proof-of-work models. Cardano’s technology is cutting-edge. It is divided into two layers: one for smart contracts and one for transactions. It can process up to a million transactions per second because of this split. Cardano launched native tokens in March 2021, enabling safe and inexpensive smart contract interactions. This establishes Cardano as a pioneer in scalability and efficiency. ADA is appealing in the present market cycle, particularly for consumers seeking sustainable solutions. Despite the established status of coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Cardano may have an advantage in the ever-changing cryptocurrency market due to its emphasis on sustainability and scalability. Solana is turning heads in the blockchain arena, focusing on speed and scalability. Competing with giants like Ethereum and Cardano, Solana offers a foundation for stand-out decentralized applications. Its unique architecture delivers faster transactions and flexible development options across multiple programming languages. At the core of this ecosystem is SOL, Solana’s native cryptocurrency. SOL isn’t just a token; it powers transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards those who support the network. The potential of SOL is tied to the impressive capabilities of the Solana platform. Solana doesn’t rely on sharding or second-layer solutions to scale, unlike some networks. This design choice attracts developers seeking a high-capacity network that can handle bustling products and services. SOL looks increasingly attractive in the current market cycle, where scalability and transaction speed are crucial. While the crypto market is crowded, SOL’s strong technology and ambitious approach make it a standout option among digital currencies. Avalanche is a brand-new, quick, and environmentally friendly blockchain technology. It can complete transactions in less than two seconds and process up to 4,500 transactions per second. This implies that money can be sent and received almost instantly. Additionally, users can design their own subnets—customizable networks—with Avalanche. It employs a unique approach to transaction agreement, combining traditional and modern techniques for increased speed and security. The platform’s three primary components—X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain—cooperate to handle smart contracts and transactions. The token that drives Avalanche is called AVAX. It facilitates the operation of subnets, pays for transactions, and stakes the network to keep it secure. Speed and minimal fees are crucial in the current market, and Avalanche satisfies these requirements. AVAX enables quick, affordable, and environmentally friendly transactions compared to other cryptocurrencies—a significant factor as more people become concerned about the environment. Developers and companies seeking adaptable solutions may be drawn to Avalanche’s bespoke token and blockchain creation capabilities. Platforms like Avalanche that prioritize speed, scalability, and sustainability may become increasingly significant as the cryptocurrency market develops. Ondo Finance is making waves by blending the reliability of tradfi with the efficiency of blockchain technology. It does this by tokenizing stable, income-generating assets like US Treasuries. This means more people can access high-quality products that were once out of reach. Ondo has two main parts: an asset management arm that creates these tokenized products and a technology arm that builds DeFi protocols to make them work better and reach more people. In a market where trust and security are significant concerns, Ondo stands out by partnering with well-known firms like BlackRock and using Coinbase for custody. It sets high standards for transparency and closely follows legal rules. One of its notable products, USDY, offers stablecoin accessibility with the added yield benefit from US Treasuries and bank deposits. This approach could appeal to those looking for regulated and transparent options in the crypto space. As the market evolves, Ondo’s focus on real-world assets and compliance might make it an interesting player compared to other more volatile coins. ADA, SOL, AVAX, and ONDO are solid choices, but XYZVerse stands out. As the first all-sport meme coin, it aims for 20,000% growth by uniting sports fans in crypto.

URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/food/restaurants/2025/02/11/michelin-starred-restaurants-in-ireland-2025-the-complete-guide/
Time Published: 2025-02-11T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
The Michelin Guide says: “Mickael Viljanen’s basement restaurant is a stylish, elegant spot decorated with eye-catching art. Superb service complements cooking that focuses on prime luxury ingredients – like Donegal lobster or Limousin sweetbreads – and sees classic French techniques combined with subtle modern touches. Mickael’s creativity and personality shine through in perfectly balanced, immaculately executed dishes with sublime natural flavours and beautiful presentation. The Irish Coffee is made in the diningroom and is, like everything else, an experience to remember.” chapteronerestaurant.com The Michelin Guide says: “Chef Ahmet Dede’s warm, inviting restaurant in this West Cork coastal village is a masterful marriage between his Irish surroundings and his Turkish heritage. Superb local produce is the bedrock of the cooking, enhanced by skilful, judicious spicing which delivers multiple layers of authentic Turkish flavours while never overpowering the core ingredients – as with a refined take on street food ‘îçli köfte’. The charismatic Ahmet and his mostly Turkish brigade deliver their dishes with pride, while co-owner Maria runs the service with a friendly charm.” customshousebaltimore.com The Michelin Guide says: “There’s a slightly magical feel to this stylish, cosy restaurant. With just a handful of tables, it makes for a personal dining experience, with Damien Grey and his small team offering a genuinely warm welcome and explaining the dishes personally. The surprise tasting menu showcases bold, original dishes centred around the five tastes – salty, savoury, sweet, bitter and sour – which come together in perfect harmony. First-class ingredients are present throughout, treated with precision and strong modern technique by the chefs. Excellent wine pairings further enhance the experience.” liathrestaurant.com The Michelin Guide says: “This iconic restaurant has been thriving since 1981, thanks to both the eponymous chef and the exceptional team he has around him. It sits hidden away within a Georgian town house and oozes sumptuousness and sophistication thanks to features such as a gilt barrel ceiling and handcrafted marquetry. The accomplished cooking isn’t to be upstaged, however: it is French at heart yet has a restrained modernity and showcases some bold yet superbly balanced flavours. The Irish ingredients are certainly luxurious and the baba flambé with your choice of rum provides an inviting, classical way to finish.” restaurantpatrickguilbaud.ie The Michelin Guide says: “In the Manor House of this breathtaking resort, you’ll be warmly welcomed by the kitchen team before enjoying a procession of original and elaborate snacks which more than hint at the quality of the surprise menu in store. The striking and sophisticated dishes showcase the best of the local larder alongside more international flavours which highlight the chef’s time and travels in Asia; the sauces are superlative. Dishes are often finished off at your table in the elegant diningroom. This is an experience to remember.” terre.ie [ Terre restaurant review: One of the best – and most expensive – meals I’ve ever eatenOpens in new window ] The Michelin Guide says: “It takes some doing for a restaurant to stand out when it’s in a hotel as beautiful as this. Ballyfin Demesne is a spectacular, lovingly restored Regency-era manor house that screams luxury at every turn. The opulence continues into the diningroom, where the chefs serve fittingly impressive dishes. Broths, purées and sauces are a real highlight and underline the technical skill of the kitchen team, be it a rich, glossy reduction or a roasted onion consommé with bags of flavour. Charming and attentive service completes the rather special picture.” ballyfin.com The Michelin Guide says: “Lignum is Latin for ‘wood’ and, as such, it’s the ancient method of cooking over an open flame which takes centre stage at this immensely likeable restaurant. It’s housed in a modern barn conversion which has a distinctly Scandic vibe, from the large windows and minimalist furnishings to the roaring fire and throws on the chairs. The wood-fired cooking lends a delicious smoky dimension to the creative dishes, which – informed by the chef’s heritage – blend ingredients from Ireland (such as sweet lobster tail) and Italy (Amalfi lemon). It all comes in the form of a surprise tasting menu.” lignum.ie The Michelin Guide says: “We all need a little luxury in our lives and this beautiful restaurant in the heart of the impressive Carton House mansion ticks all the boxes. The breathtaking room features a high curved ceiling, Greek Corinthian columns, ornate plaster cornicing and sweeping banquettes, while the menu matches it for opulence with an abundance of first-rate produce, be it Union Hall crab or Achill lamb. The cooking is rooted in the chefs’ strong classical technique, but some wildcard flavour combinations work wonders thanks to their fine judgment.” cartonhouse.com The Michelin Guide says: “The high ceilings and original plasterwork of this restored landmark building contribute to the appeal of the contemporary restaurant within. The well-travelled, Australian-born chef prepares a surprise menu and, while there are multiple global techniques and influences at play, the focus of the dishes remains firmly on the top-notch main ingredients. There are seats at the counter for those wanting to see how the beautifully composed dishes are created, and the wine pairings are a great way to go.” dolierstreetrestaurant.com [ D’Olier Street review: This new restaurant has a great team. They should stop being cautious, let rip and enjoy the rideOpens in new window ] The Michelin Guide says: “A vaulted ceiling and flagstone floors combine with sumptuous, colourful furnishings at this striking restaurant that provides a fair amount of both character and luxury. It helps, of course, that it’s located in the cellars of Cashel Palace, a magnificent Palladian manor house which was once home to the Archbishops of Cashel. Desserts are a highlight among cooking that keeps a focus on each central ingredient, which is then skilfully enhanced with complementary flavours. Service comes from an impeccable team, who work with the utmost pride.” cashelpalacehotel.ie Michelin Guide says: “A charming 200-year-old cottage houses this rural restaurant that counts the Atlantic Ocean as its neighbour. The lovely terrace allows you to enjoy a spectacular sunset over drinks, before moving inside to the characterful interior with stone floors, cookery books and rustic wooden tables. Wonderful Irish produce – such as superbly fresh, beautifully roasted Aran monkfish – is used in equally impressive dishes that are clean and modern, with no unnecessary frills.” homesteadcottagedoolin.com [ Homestead Cottage review: An incredibly beautiful new restaurant from a talented chefOpens in new window ] The Michelin Guide says: “Aniar means ‘from the west’ and indeed the local area is a key inspiration for both the ‘back-to-nature’ cooking and the chic, moody décor here. The micro-seasonal menus are finalised based on the day’s locally sourced produce, which is showcased in pure, delicate and well-balanced dishes such as exceptional raw beef dressed with top-notch nasturtium oil. The cooking cleverly blends traditional and modern techniques, while contrasts in texture, temperature and acidity are also a feature. Many courses are served by the chefs themselves, some with accompanying poems.” aniarrestaurant.ie The Michelin Guide says: “This vibrant little restaurant with a lively spirit boasts an open kitchen, from which you’ll find the chefs engaging with guests and delivering some of the dishes themselves. The modern set menu features top class Irish produce at the height of season and each main ingredient is given the space to shine. Dishes are stripped-back, flavours are bold and servings are generous: this is cooking that comes from the heart. Start with an aperitif while you enjoy the delicate snacks.” bastible.com [ Bastible review: Want to try a Michelin star restaurant in Ireland? This is the place to startOpens in new window ] The Michelin Guide says: “Set in the very centre of town, Bastion is a contemporary restaurant owned and run by a talented couple: Paul McDonald cooks, while his wife Helen looks after the service. A large bar splits the room in two and twinkling candles add a welcoming touch. Paul is Scottish born but his cooking has a strong Irish base. Natural flavours are kept to the fore and local seafood is a highlight. The skilfully prepared, exacting dishes take on a modern style and often exhibit a playful, innovative element, while at the same time showing depth in their flavours and textures.” bastionkinsale.com The Michelin Guide says: “This long-standing restaurant is owned and run by experienced chef Garrett Byrne – who really knows his craft – along with his partner, Brid Hannon, who provides relaxed, friendly service. The modern interior is sleek, with curved banquettes, spot-lit dark wood tables and striking local artwork hanging on the walls. Top quality Irish ingredients are showcased in richly flavoured, classic dishes: you won’t find foams or smears on your plate here – just confidently cooked, skilfully balanced dishes, with exemplary plating, saucing and seasoning.” campagne.ie The Michelin Guide says: “There’s a laid-back feel to this sweet, intimate restaurant where the shelves are laden with wine, mead and all manner of jars full of produce marinating, curing or fermenting. Skeaghanore duck is among the County Cork produce championed on the constantly evolving tasting menu, where skilfully prepared dishes show a great understanding of textures and tastes, and are pleasingly understated in their pure, natural flavours. Smaller growers are present in the wine pairings, while they make their own juices and cordials for the non-alcoholic option.” restaurantchestnutwestcork.ie The Michelin Guide says: “Set in a prime spot on the second floor of The Fitzwilliam Hotel, overlooking St Stephen’s Green, is this chic, elegant restaurant with subtle 1930s overtones. Pink and green hues and pretty flower arrangements bring a certain softness to the surroundings; in contrast, Andy McFadden’s cooking is characterised by boldness – both in its flavours and textures – and his experience shines through in creative, modern dishes which are skilfully prepared and artfully presented.” gloversalley.com The Michelin Guide says: “Located in the Cliff House Hotel – a modern, glass-fronted building which, unsurprisingly, hugs the cliffside – this restaurant benefits from a stunning view across Ardmore Bay. Fortunately, the cooking is a match for its surroundings, taking exceptional Irish produce and building on it using skilled technique and a smattering of global influences. Terrific lobster caught in Ardmore Bay, for example, might come with rogan josh sauce and garlic naan for a distinctly Indian touch. Throughout the cooking, the dishes are attractively presented without being showy.” cliffhousehotel.ie The Michelin Guide says: “The 1,500-acre Mount Juliet Estate, now housing an impressive country house hotel, is one of the best examples of Georgian architecture in Ireland; it still boasts its original stuccowork and hand-carved marble fireplaces, and its luxurious, high-ceilinged restaurant comes with all the comfort and elegance one would expect. John Kelly’s boldly flavoured, visually impressive dishes are skilfully prepared, underpinned by ingredients from the estate, the county and the coast. The excellent desserts – such as a beautiful hazelnut and chocolate confection – provide a memorable finish.” mountjuliet.ie The Michelin Guide says: “Hidden away in the Cathedral Quarter is this urban, industrial-style restaurant named after a 200-year-old secret society. It’s a simply furnished place, run with palpable enthusiasm by a young team. Chef Gareth McCaughey’s philosophy is to source top ingredients, prepare them well and not overcomplicate things, as proven by the surprise tasting menu spotlighting superb Irish produce like Kilkeel scallops and Wicklow venison. The wine list offers an interesting selection of low-intervention, natural, organic and biodynamic wines, all available by the glass.” themuddlersclubbelfast.com The Michelin Guide says: “This restaurant inside the impressive Adare Manor has all the grandeur you would expect, with wood-panelled walls, lavish chandeliers and a glass-enclosed terrace with views over the 850 acre grounds. The assured, refreshingly understated cooking champions top Irish ingredients, with dishes comprising just 3 or 4 components and allowing each one the room to make an impression. Combinations are refined and well-balanced, and great attention is given to the finer details. The wine list is a labour of love and offers a superb range by the glass.” adaremanor.com The Michelin Guide says: “From the terrific buzz in the air to each element of the carefully constructed tasting menu, dining at this understated restaurant is such a pleasant experience. The starting point for the cooking is always the ingredients, with only the very best selected – and in some cases grown – by the kitchen team. This top-notch produce is elevated by the refined, expertly balanced accompaniments – an approach which is clear in dishes like superb Orkney scallop paired with a curry oil that is beautifully judged in both aroma and flavour.” oxbelfast.com The Michelin Guide says: “You’ll find charming chef-owner Keelan Higgs working calmly in the open kitchen of this tiny restaurant. The long, narrow room has a funky style and the relaxed atmosphere is helped along by brother Aaron and the laid-back service team. Highly original yet unfussy dishes burst with freshness and flavour, and many are cooked over the open fire; Keelan loves this concept, as no two dishes will ever be exactly the same. The 6 course ‘Chef’s Choice’ menu is divided into Snacks, Cold, Warm, Pasta, Mains and Finish, and the monthly changing, mostly organic wine list is passionately compiled.” varietyjones.ie © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

The trouble started when an ex-director, Suet Meng Chay, transferred a 12 per cent stake—nominally valued at ₹10.28 crore—to an NRI based in Dubai, Jahangir Panikkaveettil Perumbarambathu, for a token amount of just $1. He was supposedly a stranger, who Sebi suspects to be linked to the promoter family through Meta. This token-dollar transfer set off an alleged pump-and-dump strategy orchestrated through connected entities to artificially inflate the stock price. This enabled the NRI as well as the promoter, and connected entities to sell shares at a higher value, the regulator observed. A series of early-morning buy orders at the upper circuit limits were seen driving the share price from a low of around ₹22.50 to an astronomical high of ₹267.50 within two months—even though the company’s financials showed negligible revenue and virtually no business activity. “At the dollar-rupee conversion rate of ₹83.75, this made the purchaser richer by $328.60 million (₹2752 crore) at the company’s peak market capitalization of ₹22,700 crore. The said transaction not only appears to be too good to be true, but also raises the possibility of FEMA violations,” said SEBI’s whole-time member Ashwani Bhatia in the interim order. Bhatia said that the case painted a picture of “absurdities and anomalies,” and required interim action before another pump and dump takes place and more innocent investors lose money and burn their fingers. He noted that the number of public shareholders has nearly doubled in six months to 6,106 as on December 31, 2024. “There is a real risk of the noticees off-loading their shares at the cost of investors, who get drawn to the shares of the company seeing high valuations and volumes and would end up getting duped and taken for a ride…Further, action needs to be taken promptly to prevent more money leaving the shores of India through sale of shares by the NRI shareholder,” the order said. The regulator will be conducting a detailed investigation in the matter by May 15. In the meantime, Sebi has directed the NRI to provide a full inventory of his assets, investments, and bank accounts, as well as freeze any debits in his accounts.

Title: Can AI Fix Succession Planning?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomaspremuzic/2025/02/11/can-ai-fix-succession-planning/
Time Published: 2025-02-11T08:30:22Z

Succession planning sign and figurines with arrows. Few decisions in business and leadership matter more than choosing the right successor. When done well, it ensures continuity, preserves institutional knowledge, and often propels an organization to new heights. When done poorly, it can lead to instability, lost value, and even outright failure. Consider the success stories: Tim Cook taking over from Steve Jobs at Apple, seamlessly continuing and even accelerating the company’s trajectory, boosting the company’s market cap from around $340B under Steve Jobs to over $3T now (if you invested $10,000 of Apple stock at the start of Cook's tenure you would have around $160,000 right now). The figures are similarly impressive for Satya Nadella’s impact at Microsoft, who arguably had a bigger strategic and innovation effect by not just rejuvenated the company, but also shifting its focus first from Windows to cloud computing, and more recently and AI (anticipating the current AI boom). Even Pope Francis’s ascension after Pope Benedict XVI’s resignation demonstrated the power of a well-managed leadership transition, bringing fresh energy and a sense of modernity and empathy (not to mention an instant PR upgrade) to the Vatican, a 2,000-year institution. Contrast that with the pitfalls of poor succession planning. Since legendary Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson retired, the club has been cycling through multiple coaches (seven and still counting) without much financial or sporting success, and the decline appears to be ongoing. In the corporate world, J.C. Penney’s appointment of Ron Johnson as CEO led to a dramatic and costly strategic misfire. And in the hit show Succession, the fictional Roy family’s lack of a clear plan for leadership leads to chaos, power struggles, and a tanking stock price, which makes for great television but a horrific case study in succession. Back in the real-world, succession stories captivate the public’s attention. Bernard Arnault, the chairman and CEO of LVMH and one of the richest people in the world, is known to have been interviewing each of his five children for the big job, fostering speculation about his eventual successor. In recent years, Warren Buffett announced his successor, but at 94, Buffett still maintains a hands-on role in managing Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. As for Jamie Dimon, there is seemingly no end to the uncertainty about his successor. These cases all highlight the same truth: leadership transitions can make or break an organization. The Science and Art of Succession Planning At its core, succession planning is part science and part art. The science is well established: industrial-organizational psychology offers robust and reliable frameworks for assessing leadership potential, ensuring a data-driven approach to selection, and derisking the process (including the significant probability that incompetent men become leaders). Predictive analytics, performance reviews, and evidence-based competency models help organizations make objective choices. Yet, the process is also partly an art — navigating internal politics, winning over key stakeholders, and crafting a shared vision for the future. As in any other area of life, AI has the potential to bring rigor and objectivity to the science while enhancing the human aspects of the art. Here’s how: 1. Evaluating Past Performance Beyond Politics The barrier to data-driven succession planning is contamination in past performance data, which corrupts a proper examination of candidates’ track record and potential, introducing invisible biases in the process, and contaminating candidates’ “score” with politics, subjectivity, and noise (the nefarious 9-box grid, the unreliable supervisor or managerial ratings, and the political high-potential nominations). AI can mitigate this by analyzing vast amounts of historical performance data, including predictive signals usually missed by the “naked” human eye, and finding hidden patterns that connect each candidate with different success profiles. By measuring real contributions—financial results, operational efficiencies, strategic insights, and even mining granular signals, such as language, meta-data, the depth and breadth of social networks, and markers of leadership style and dynamics — AI can cut through biases, ensuring the most qualified leaders rise to the top based on merit, not alliances. To be sure, asking AI to predict who would normally be nominated in a given organization will probably not result in an upgrade from past and current candidates, but rather more of the same (which is rarely the right choice when it comes to effective successions). 2. Expanding the Talent Pool for More Inclusive Assessments Historically, succession planning has been limited to a narrow group of insiders, often overlooking diverse and high-potential candidates among unconventional or outgroup profiles. AI-driven talent identification can analyze broader datasets to uncover hidden gems, ensuring organizations consider leaders from different backgrounds, functions, and geographies. In essence, innovations in assessments have leveraged AI to improve the candidate experience, reduce test-taking time, and increase the speed and efficiencies of putting a much larger sample of potential candidates through the assessment. Since quantity leads to quality, making assessment inclusive will generally improve the quality of your final choice, as well as increasing the range of candidates and profiles you can shortlist. 3. Using Passive Data to Predict Leadership Success AI can leverage passive data—communication patterns, collaboration metrics, and behavioral insights — to assess leadership traits. The work of David Stillwell, Sandra Matz and Michal Kosinski demonstrates how AI can infer personality traits and leadership potential from digital footprints, as well as internal company data not historically seen as critical to leadership talent. In essence, you want leaders to be smart, driven, and ethical, and each of these foundational ingredients of leadership potential can be broken down into narrower traits (e.g., expertise, curiosity, learning ability, motivation, conscientiousness, EQ, people-skills, integrity) that are expressed, display and reflected in people’s online behaviors (captured by internal company data or in the external digital universe). By incorporating these insights, organizations can move beyond traditional assessments and gain a more holistic view of a candidate’s fit. In fact, even generative AI and large language models provide an easy way to access the public reputation of many senior leaders. For instance, try prompting ChatGPT to give you a leadership and personality profile for Elon Musk, Donald Trump, or Angela Merkel, and you will see there is not much left for a traditional executive assessment to add (same goes for many less famous leaders, including those mentioned at the beginning of this article). 4. Debiasing Leadership Selection Unconscious and conscious biases remain a significant issue in leadership transitions, including when succession planning is driven by a desire to enhance “culture-fit” (which is a subliminal and politically legitimized way to perpetuate the existing organizational biases that confer privilege to the historical in-group, the status-quo, and the ruling elite). AI can flag potential biases in hiring and promotion decisions, ensuring selections align with data rather than stereotypes. For example, when AI is trained to predict who would get promoted and it recommends a surplus of Middle-aged white male engineers, it is accurate exposing existing biases in the organization. Humans are (usually) very good at learning, but very bad at unlearning. Conversely, AI is good at both learning and unlearning. Thus, we can train AI to not just identify the kind of leader who has succeeded in the past, but the kind of leader we would need for the future, if we simply program or prompt it to seek for relevant signals of potential while ignoring irrelevant signals. In contrast, humans will never be able to ignore a candidate’s gender, age, race, social class, or attractiveness, all of which conflates and distorts their choices. By training algorithms on diverse, high-performing leadership examples, companies can create models that prioritize competence and potential over legacy and favoritism, increasing meritocracy (which even those who have jumped on the anti-DEI bandwagon should appreciate). Ethical Considerations Of course, AI is not a magic bullet. Ethical concerns around data privacy, algorithmic bias, and transparency must be addressed. AI should be a tool to enhance human judgment, not replace it. Leaders must ensure AI is used responsibly—applying it as a guide rather than a dictator. The one advantage here, is that AI does not need to be perfect in order to bring about progress. In fact, all it must do is to produce an improvement over the status-quo, which is a very low bar. Indeed, even in its current form AI is less biased than humans – not because AI is perfect, but because humans are biased by design. With AI, as with any other technology, the goal is not instant perfection, but incremental improvements over the current state-of-affairs, and finding better ways of being wrong. To be sure, there are no reasons whatsoever to have confidence in humans eliminating their own biases, but human ingenuity and expertise has been able to create a tool, a technology, that may well de-bias human decision making – but we must open to not just having ethical and competent humans involved in the design and auditing of these algorithms, but also remove them from the decision-making look (as they are often more likely to introduce than eliminate biases). The Future of Leadership Selection AI won’t eliminate the need for human intuition and relationship-building in succession planning, but it can elevate decision-making. By focusing on objective performance evaluation, expanding candidate pipelines, leveraging behavioral insights, and reducing bias, AI has the potential to make leadership transitions smoother, fairer, and more effective. The future of leadership isn’t about human vs. machine. It’s more likely human with machine — using AI as a partner in one of the most crucial tasks any organization faces: securing its next great leader. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Climate reporting presents brands with an opportunity – if it’s done right
URL: https://www.thedrum.com/opinion/2025/02/11/climate-reporting-presents-brands-with-opportunity-if-it-s-done-right

Advertisement The Drum Network article This content is produced by The Drum Network, a paid-for membership club for CEOs and their agencies who want to share their expertise and grow their business. February 11, 2025 | 8 min read Listen to article 4 min Climate Transition Plans will become crucial for comms teams thanks to the EU’s directive on ESG, says Olly Lawder at Revolt. See these plans as an opportunity to align company values and let the world – and your investors – know about the great work you do. Climate Transition Plans (CTPs) allow companies to creatively communicate their roadmap to net zero, says Lawder / Explore with Joshua via Unsplash The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) has raised the bar on Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) reporting. It’s estimated that 50,000 companies with a presence in the EU will have to comply with the directive, which requires companies to share information on their monitoring of many ESG issues. The directive is purposefully technical, and this complexity can create a hurdle for communication and engagement. But an opportunity does exist in the shape of the Climate Transition Plan (CTP). The CTP is a mandatory part of the reporting and offers companies an opportunity to creatively communicate their roadmap to net zero. And while marketers may not be creating CTPs, they will certainly be communicating them. The CTP translates sometimes intangible and distant net zero goals into a credible, granular, and powerful business strategy to show to stakeholders. As a mandatory part of CSRD, businesses shouldn’t view the CTP as simply a compliance exercise but as an opportunity to stand out and deliver. Knowing that businesses will be heavily focused on CTPs this year with CSRD coming into force, Revolt conducted quantitative research with over 400 marketing and PR leaders in the US who work at companies with offices in the EU. The aim was to find out just how much marketers know about the directive and whether they will embrace the creative opportunities that CTPs present in their marketing and communications. Reassuringly, we found that nearly 96% of marketeers are aware of CTPs. Given the importance and ramifications of CSRD, we were not surprised by this. However, 30% report that they are either unaware if their company has a CTP or that their company is not developing one. This is a worryingly high percentage, and clearly more needs to be done to ensure that all companies are aware of their climate transition responsibilities. The good news is that all respondents agree – either strongly or somewhat – that CTPs represent good comms opportunities. But when asked about the extent of communications planning around CTPs for the next 12 months, only a third of respondents said they have a specific plan for communicating transition plans. Additionally, 65% reported that CTP communication was not in the broader communications plan, and 71% said they hadn’t budgeted for CTP communications. So, while there is a good understanding of the marketing opportunity with CTPs, there is a real gap in terms of actually making it happen. When we addressed this with respondents, we found a variety of reasons for the slow or lacking movement in communicating CTPs. Concern about accidentally greenwashing is the number one barrier to creatively engaging on climate transition plans. This was followed by a perceived difficulty in engaging audiences in what some consider a ‘depressing topic,’ as well as audiences lacking interest in the subject matter. Other reasons included the complexity of the issues and marketers feeling out of their comfort zone with the topic. However, these barriers can and should be overcome. I believe that there are three things marketers and corporate affairs teams should keep in mind to ensure effective communication of transition plans. Advertisement Climate change isn’t a future concern; it’s already upon us – and investors are looking to invest in businesses that build resilience to climate risks and are ready to take on climate opportunities. Almost 99% of leading global insurance companies have now set a low-carbon transition objective within their investment portfolios, according to Blackrock. While CTPs existed before CSRD, they lacked granularity. The new directive will create a groundswell of information that investors will look at, including the disclosure of climate-related risks, transition-related opportunities, investment plans for low-carbon technologies, impacts on staff, scenario-planning, and financial allocation for activity. The CTP is an opportunity to translate your net-zero strategy into a powerful investment story – a story of resilience, adaptability, and competitive advantage that only your business can offer investors. It forms part of an ongoing dialogue and is a way to update investors on your transition progress. Advertisement Every stakeholder plays a role in delivering on your CTP, but none is as important as your employees. Employees are potential champions and crucial implementers of your transition strategies. Employees play a role across all three principles of the CTP – Ambition, Action, and Accountability – and they act as change agents who can ensure the CTP does not just live in a document. Showcasing how individual roles directly contribute to broader goals creates a compelling narrative that will help retain talent who see sustainability as a personal mission rather than a corporate imperative. To transition successfully, businesses will need people with the right skill sets and CTP comms that hero employees – and show that measurable impact can help to attract future talent who value sustainability. Catch up on the most important stories of the day, curated by our editorial team. Stay up to date with a curated digest of the most important marketing stories and expert insights from our global team. Learn how to pitch to our editors and get published on The Drum. For effective transition planning, businesses must engage their value chain because, in most cases, Scope 3 emissions (all indirect emissions relating to business activity, excluding utilities) represent the largest portion of a business’s carbon footprint. So, while CTPs are individual to each business, they can only be achieved with systemic change across suppliers and geographies. It’s important that CTPs deliver and communicate a detailed and quantifiable picture of the value chain, including its most opaque areas. View the CTP not as a supplier compliance checklist but rather a communication device to highlight a shared purpose between your business and your value chain. Move toward storytelling that demonstrates genuine partnership and success stories, collaborative decarbonization efforts, and, in turn, acts as a confidence-builder for other stakeholders too, including investors. CTPs will become a critical element of the comms suite around reporting going forward, and with the first CSRD disclosures being made in 2025, the time to engage is now. Plans will be scrutinized, so get ready to be vocal and to defend and uphold them, but do not see your comms solely as a form of defense. Instead, engaging and ambitious comms are your opportunity to inspire stakeholders, catalyze investment and innovation, and ensure your plans progress into reality. Revolt The world is on fire.

Title: Why is the United States economy so much stronger than Europe’s?

Forget about Donald Trump for a moment and consider why the US economy is so much stronger than Europe’s. Most agencies earmark growth of 2.5-3 per cent for the US economy this year against 1 per cent in Europe. And that 1 per cent looks shaky. It may also be revised down if US tariffs against the EU materialise. [ Trump tariffs threaten Ireland’s service economy too ] Without a significant boost in investment – particularly in infrastructure and green technologies – Europe risks falling further behind the US and the global economy, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is warning. There are several reasons for Europe’s flagging performance and the US’s better-than-expected one. Europe has been more impacted by the energy crisis for one (higher energy costs have dented manufacturing output in Europe’s largest economy Germany, which has also been impacted by weaker Chinese demand). The prospect of tax cuts and less regulation in the US appears to be having an equal and opposite effect on the other side of Atlantic. But these potentially short-term trends aside, there is an endemic productivity gap between the US and Europe. Productivity is one of those glaze-over economic phenomena, but it underpins performance and explains better than any other the reason why the US leads much of the world when it comes to technology. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last month, the head of the IMF, Kristalina Georgieva, gave perhaps the most cogent explanation for the productivity gap between the US and Europe. “The US is marching ahead with high productivity because capital markets allocate money to dynamic firms ... because technology turns into business investment and grows into companies fast and because the US has an abundance of cheap energy,” she said. Her point was echoed by Larry Fink, chief executive of investment giant BlackRock. “Any entrepreneur, any small company, any large company can find capital and that foundation of capital – raising allows much more entrepreneurialism, much more creativity,” he said. The strength of the US’s capital markets allows the US to modify, rebuild itself, change direction faster than any other economy, he said.

Not sure why they are so cheap but they are 50% off the already bargain price and it's also possible to schedule a delivery for any day this week. Bear in mind you might be taking a risk of it being out of stock if scheduling for Valentine's Day. Price is $11.04 + $1.99 Delivery Fee + $1.10 Service fee for a total of $14.13. Pink roses are even cheaper, $12.93 for 10 delivered. Tried in a couple of different states and seems to be available everywhere I've checked. $0 Delivery Fee on your First Order. Referrer receives something too (Likely free delivery on next order). Cannot be stacked with new user signup codes. Not in SA. These guys deliver free anywhere. $12.99 delivery fee for me lol Still a bargain if you compare what others are charging. $15.99 delivery for me Couldn't find Harris Farm Markets in Brisbane, QLD - there is one a suburb over, so a little surprised. Oh well. I tried Sydney (city) and Gold Coast (Southport) was the same price. Can't find Clayfield store. Automatically chooses Redfern. Same! Didn't have the pick up option for West End - so I put in Harris Farms as the delivery address with the instructions to meet me out the front of the store. Fingers crossed. I'm in Zillmere and it worked for me (assume it's the Clayfield store). Managed to get 50% a large bouquet ($35 down from $70) and added a block of chocolate to get it over $40 to save an additional $20. Spent less than $25 to get both! Oof, nice. I can't even find this item at the Clayfield store at all, is it still there? How? I'm in North Lakes and can't seem to order - delivery not availabe. Username checks out. Delivered on Valentine’s Day? You can schedule a delivery for then as you can with any Uber Eats delivery. (At your own risk ofc) Thanks OP!! Ordered now let's see if they show up in the next hour as the app says they will!! Don't forget to add an eggplant/cucumber/zucchini for an extra $0.59!!! Does she need something to make up for what you lack?! :) Yes Then just pay $0.59, forgo the flowers. Great deal. You can schedule delivery for Friday (Valentine’s Day). What a win! Scheduled but what are the odds of these being delivered on valentines day! My guess is 'slim' but you never know, Harris Farm have pretty good customer service in my experience. You would hope that they would hold back the stock for delivery for those orders already made. No clue what these roses will look like when or if the come on Friday but worth a gamble! Ps make sure you say refund if out of stock to avoid any replacements at higher prices. Thanks op Any clue where the option/setting is to do this in the UE app? I stumbled onto it at checking my scheduled orders. what these roses will look like Got them delivered a couple hours ago. They looked really nice. Was braced for a lot less. Plain wrap, no extra frills. ( But I only got 9, not 10 ☹️ ). Is it the same price in store? Could go for some mortadella Looks like it's $22 in store, where I checked anyway No love for Melburnians! And no —- either! 40 flowers for $28.60 Thanks OP Time to sell them on the side of a busy road. How did you get $20 off ? This targeted deal Girlfriend is either gonna be really disappointed or really impressed. Either way I can't lose You never loose to GF. You lose when she becomes wife So, always win by staying as her BF ? A win win if you can 😄 @Username Taken: You believe you win; she wins with the lawyers. yeah i thought i was winning when GF became wife but nope lol Do these come wrapped in paper at the stems or how are they sent out. Mine came as a bouquet in paper. Not showing as an available SKU for Harris Farms Chatswood/Willoughby. Might be expired/OOS. On checkout page is states: "promotions are estimates, not guaranteed, and may depend on item and promotion availability in store, you will be charged the in-store price for available items in your cart". Is that mean if schedule on Friday and no 50% off promotion on that day, you will get charge full price? Nothing says I love you more than having an unwashed man with pungent B.O arrive with flowers… This is why you should always use a delivery driver. Or have a shower. $15.99 delivery in Canberra $6.49 for me ($0 as UberOne) for delivery from Harris Majura. You could try pickup? $4 service fee. Free delivery for me since I spent $30. Getting it delivered from Majura Park $17 delivery for me (uber one) Make sure you're ordering from Majura Park Harris Farm lol Yes, indeed I tried a Weston Creek address and a city address and both saying too far. Wth If you're an UberOne member apparently there's no delivery fee. I'm not and the delivery fee is $15.99. Nice - 40 roses delivered for $26.18! (20x Red + 20x Pink, less $20 off $40 spend promo with free delivery for Uber One!). I give this ~10% chance of showing up, but if it does then that's a huge win! Thanks OP! Fingers crossed DD does a repeat of last year's deal with the free flowers from Coles :P $15.49 delivery fee. Does Uber One cover the delivery fee for stores that are farther away? Legend Pink roses are even cheaper OP can't work out why he is single OP made it this year and shared ozb with 50% off 'bedroom ticket'. Ordered. Cancelled… I am single and just ordered a bunch of roses for myself Western Sydney was out of stock and double the price. CBD worked A-OK. Hope they are delivered! Thanks OP Woah nice price. Thanks Tried ordering from a few stores in Sydney and wouldn't let me check out, said I had to cancel my order. Ordered two bunches of 10 long stem red roses. Got two bunches of 5 long stem pink roses. Have raised a support case with Uber Eats. Harris Farm Boronia Park in Sydney. How did they come, curious if it comes in paper or how the bottom is wrapped. Thanks They came wrapped in plastic cellophane type stuff, bottoms exposed, placed in a paper Harris farm bag Getting jipped with colour and quantity. FrankGrimes has a right to vent ! Yes same happened with me - ordered red then pink arrived. Not sure if the uber eats rider picks them or they are picked and bagged by the store? Either way, they were refunded, just follow the links to report an issue with the order and take a picture I reported it last night but have heard nothing back from Uber Eats support. Useless Strange! Mine seemed to be refunded immediately (and automatically) with no fuss Anybody know of some good options like this but in Melbourne? $6.99 delivery fee for me (Canberra) :( Item replaced - Sydney. What was yours replaced with? Not a cat I hope :D Haha nothing with a tail. Use this to chase tail. Just a heads up, it comes with the pricing sticker attached. It's also wrapped in a black piece of plastic with the flower sticking out the top Thanks for the info, does it come with any name/payment details aswell? In my case just in a Harris Farm brown paper grocery bag within which was the 10 stem bouquet. Ordered the red bouquets, got white. Went through Uber Eats to complain, got a refund immediately- minus $1.99 delivery. $1.99 for the 10 long stems white roses, yes please. Winning Easy enough to dye them red! Winning! Do you have a picture? Was it the original price or the discounted price on the sticker? Original price $15.99 just for delivery in Sydney - crazy. Not if you’re 20km from the nearest Harris Farm.. I got $2.99 delivery fee in Sydney, however it was deducted (I don't have Uber One) and only $1 service fee charged. I was able to choose the date and the tile slot. 10 stem bunch of Blue Iris for $7.64 delivered. That's almost free. Free delivery. Booked to tomorrow arvo. 15 yrs married and no flowers, let's see if this yr is a winner. Too far from store :(, won’t even allow me to enter pickup Harris Farm? Uber Eats? where is the nutritional value on this? Roses out of stock in Qld but ordered a different bunch + choccies and chippies, total $30. Mrs will be stoked. Which store? West end Uber one but also paid more at checkout (NSW) Thought I’d get in early and order today. Flowers were unavailable (red roses) selected colored roses which was an upsell. Waited and order wasn’t cancelled anyway. Maybe plan ahead or have plan b ready. Ended up getting 2 bunches from QE foodstores for 50% off.. not a bad alt or choice if available to you. Worked out cheaper than Harris Farm with good options. Not available in regional area (Northern NSW) and the price has also changed to $24.80. The price of all of the flowers have gone up today compared to yesterday. I had some in my cart to order this morning and the discounted price had gone up over $4 per bunch. Was ordering multiple bunches of different flowers. All have gone up in price, some quite significantly. Can anyone comment on the quality of these ? Ordered two bunches for my girlfriend and wife. They have def overhauled the stock this morning with the Valentines options. Still some value to be found. Just got 20 roses and 10 tulips for $27 delivered to my office tomorrow. Will mix myself and leave in the garage Thurs night to give on Fri morning.

February 10, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, Feb. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz (NASDAQ:KSPI), Applied Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:APLT), Nextracker Inc. (NASDAQ:NXT), and MGP Ingredients, Inc. (NASDAQ: MGPI). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz (NASDAQ:KSPI) Class Period: January 19, 2024 - September 19, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 18, 2025 According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz continued doing business with Russian entities, and also providing services to Russian citizens, after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, thereby exposing the Company to the undisclosed risk of sanctions; (2) the Company engaged in undisclosed related party transactions; (3) certain of the Company’s executives have links to reputed criminals; and (4) as a result, defendants’ statements about Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. For more information on the Kaspi class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/KSPI Applied Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:APLT) Class Period: January 3, 2024 - December 2, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 18, 2025 The complaint alleges that on November 27, 2024, Applied Therapeutics issued a press release announcing that it had received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) for the New Drug Application (NDA) for govorestat, the Company’s lead drug candidate. The CRL indicated that the FDA completed its review of the application and determined that it was unable to approve the NDA in its current form citing deficiencies in the clinical application. Following this news, the price of Applied Therapeutics’ common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $10.21 per share on November 26, 2024, Applied Therapeutics’ stock price fell to $8.57 per share on November 27, 2024 before falling further to $2.03 on November 29, 2024 and $1.75 per share on December 2, 2024, a total decline of more than 80%. After market hours on December 2, 2024, Applied Therapeutics disclosed it received a “warning letter” from the FDA referring to the clinical trial issues underlying the CRL. Applied Therapeutics’ disclosure of the “warning letter” prompted a further decline in the stock price as investors discovered the seriousness and severity of the Company’s clinical trial errors. From a closing market price of $1.75 per share on December 2, 2024, Applied Therapeutics’ stock price fell to $1.69 per share on December 3, 2024 before falling further to $1.38 per share on December 4, 2024 and $1.29 per share on December 5, 2024. For more information on the Applied Therapeutics class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/APLT Nextracker Inc. (NASDAQ:NXT) Class Period: February 1, 2024 - August 1, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 25, 2025 The filed complaint alleges that defendants made false statements and/or concealed that: (a) the impact of project delays on Nextracker's business, financial results, and prospects was far more severe than represented to investors; (b) permitting and interconnection delays had materially impaired Nextracker's ability to convert backlog into revenue at historical conversion rates; (c) Nextracker had been unable to offset the negative impact from project delays through increased client demand and the purported ability to pull forward its other projects in the manner represented by defendants; (d) Nextracker did not possess the competitive advantages which purportedly shielded it from industry-wide headwinds or the ability to effectively offset the adverse effects of project delays as claimed by defendants; and (e) as a result of (a)-(d) above, defendants lacked a reasonable basis for their positive statements about Nextracker's business, financial results, and prospects. For more information on the Nextracker class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/NXT MGP Ingredients, Inc. (NASDAQ: MGPI) Class Period: May 4, 2023 - October 30, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 14, 2025 MGPI is a manufacturer of hard liquors such as tequila, bourbon, rye, whiskey, vodka, and gin. MGPI sells the spirits it produces under its own brands as well as to other alcohol distributors and brands. Prior to the Class Period, sales of hard liquors, such as those produced and sold by MGPI, increased dramatically in the wake of COVID-19. However, as quarantines ended, sales of hard liquors slowed across the alcoholic beverage industry, and a backlog of inventory began to increase. The Complaint alleges that during the Class Period, MGPI falsely assured investors that its projections and statements accounted for the industry slowdown and that it was well-positioned to avoid a buildup of inventory. The Company also claimed that its projected sales took these industry trends into account. MGPI announced on October 17, 2024, that a slowdown in demand and an excess in inventories would undermine sales. This revelation caused the Company’s stock to plummet 29.5%. Then, less than two weeks later, on October 31, 2024, Defendants revealed that its excess inventory would have an even greater impact than previously reported. This caused the Company’s stock to drop another 14.7%, to a close of $49.04 per share on October 31, 2024. In total, MGPI’s share price declined nearly 50% on these two disclosures, wiping out hundreds of millions of dollars in market capitalization and damaging investors.

Title: Bitcoin And Politics Merge: Florida Moves Toward State Crypto Investment

The American state of Florida could be one of the pioneering local governments that allows a percentage of its state funds for cryptocurrency investments, particularly Bitcoin. Florida Senator Joe Gruters has filed a bill that would permit the US state to use 10% of its funds to buy Bitcoin. This political backing could entice other American states to build their own cryptocurrency investments. My state of Florida introduces a Bitcoin investment bill! 💪 If passed Florida’s CFO may allocate up to 10% of public funds to invest in $BTC or other digital assets. Thank you Senator Joe Gruters 🫡 pic.twitter.com/nF0SoTbT96 — Lucidvein (@Lucidvein) February 8, 2025 Gruters introduced a legislative measure that would allow Florida to invest in Bitcoin using state funds to combat inflation. The senator said that Senate Bill 550 proposed to permit Florida’s chief financial officer to use up to 10% of its funds to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The bill aims to incorporate Bitcoin into state financial planning in the US, a legislative action that could reshape state authorities’ investment funds strategy and lead to other states adopting crypto. Gruters eyes that the proposed bill would help financial planners of Florida to hedge against inflation. “Inflation has eroded the purchasing power of assets held in state funds managed by the Chief Financial Officer, and this erosion diminishes the value of the state’s reserves, affecting the financial stability and economic security of this state, its taxpayers, and its residents,” Gruters said. The senator explained in the bill that inflation has “eroded the purchasing power of assets” managed by the state’s chief financial officer, adding that the state is responsible for safeguarding “Florida’s financial resources” against inflation and economic uncertainties. Hence, the American senator explained that Florida should have access to tools like Bitcoin to protect state funds from inflation. Once Gruter’s proposed legislation was enacted, it would be beneficial to the state in several ways. Analysts said that investing in Bitcoin would diversify Florida’s state assets, adding that the state would incorporate in its portfolio an asset that historically provides high returns but with significant volatility. Market observers added that this crypto legislation would help turn Florida into a blockchain hub that promotes cryptocurrency innovation, further establishing Florida as a crypto-friendly state. Florida might become the model state for adopting Bitcoin in state financial planning, making BTC adoption in government finance a reality. Crypto analysts also see that Florida’s success could encourage other states to follow its lead and start incorporating digital assets into their financial systems.

Title: Stock market today: Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq futures slip as Trump's tariffs and inflation prey on minds

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stock futures edged lower on Tuesday as investors braced for more tariff policy shifts from President Donald Trump and focus turned to inflation with testimony from Federal Chair Jerome Powell on deck. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) moved 0.2% lower, while S&P 500 futures (ES=F) dropped 0.3%. Contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) pulled back 0.4%, after a winning day on Wall Street. Markets have taken a cautious tone in the wait for Trump to reveal the plan for universal like-for-like tariffs promised for announcement midweek. The president on Monday imposed 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports from March 4, putting further pressure on top trading partners Canada and Mexico. Investors are trying to gauge how far Trump's tariff threats will translate into action, as they worry about the potential impact of trade war on corporate earnings, the global economy, and on inflation in particular. Amid the uncertainty, gold (GC=F) set a fresh record — the latest in a series — as investors sought out less-risky assets, before retreating on Tuesday. Given that, markets are looking to Powell's two-day testimony in Congress, starting Tuesday in the Senate, for any hint to the Fed's thinking how the tariffs could affect price pressures. With inflation seen as persistent, the countdown is already on for January's Consumer Price Index reading on Wednesday and its wholesale counterpart on Thursday. Markets are seeking insight into whether conditions are right for interest-rate cuts, though a looming tariff impact could cloud any sign of recent easing. In tech, an Elon Musk-led bid to buy OpenAI captured Wall Street's attention as AI spending fears continue to weigh on the Magnificent Seven. The AI nonprofit's CEO Sam Altman shot down the unsolicited offer of $97.4 billion, a significant undershoot of its valuation. Meanwhile, Meta (META) began to lay off workers as part of CEO Mark Zuckerberg's pledge to cut thousands of jobs in a pivot to finding AI talent. On Tuesday, Coca-Cola earnings are expected to show a quarter of growth in the company's battle with PepsiCo. Wall Street anticipates Q4 revenue of $10.67 billion and earnings per share of $0.52. Super Micro Computer (SMCI), Lyft (LYFT), and DoorDash (DASH) are also set to report results later. Gold (GC=F) continues to reap the benefits of uncertainty in stock markets. President Donald Trump's 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum have pushed the safe-haven asset back to an all-time high for the second consecutive week. Bullion touched an all-time peak above $2,921 an ounce, maintaining momentum from a 1.7% boost in the day's session prior. Bloomberg reports: Sign in to access your portfolio

February 10, 2025 19:00 ET | Source: Skyharbour Resources Ltd Skyharbour Resources Ltd Vancouver, BC, Feb. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Skyharbour Resources Ltd. (TSX-V: SYH) (OTCQX: SYHBF) (Frankfurt: SC1P) (“Skyharbour” or the “Company”), is pleased to announce that, further to its news release dated November 4th, 2024, closing has occurred on the option agreement (the “Agreement”) with Hatchet, whereby Hatchet Uranium Corp. (“Hatchet”) may acquire an 80% interest in the Company’s 17,606 ha Highway Uranium Property (the “Optioned Property”) and a 100% interest, subject to a claw-back provision for Skyharbour, in the Company’s Genie, Usam and CBX/Shoe Uranium Projects (the “Purchased Property”). The properties total 66,358 ha and are all located in the Athabasca Basin of Northern Saskatchewan, Canada. The Agreement on the Optioned Property provides Hatchet an opportunity to earn an 80% interest in the claims over a three-year period by fulfilling combined cash, share issuance and exploration expenditure commitments of CAD $3,345,000. For the Purchased Property, Skyharbour will also receive units in the capital of Hatchet consisting of a share and a warrant (“Hatchet Units”) equal to 9.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of Hatchet. Highway, Genie, Usam, CBX and Shoe Project Map:https://skyharbourltd.com/_resources/images/Sky_Highway.jpg Terms of the Optioned Property: The Optioned Property, Highway, consists of nine (9) mineral claims comprising approximately 17,606 hectares. Hatchet may acquire an 80% interest in the Optioned Property by (i) issuing common shares in the capital of Hatchet (“Shares”) having an aggregate value of CAD $1,050,000; (ii) making aggregate cash payments of CAD $245,000; and (iii) incurring an aggregate of CAD $2,050,000 in exploration expenditures on the Optioned Property over a three-year period, as follows: (1) Deemed pricing of Shares is based on the twenty (20) day volume weighted average price on the stock exchange in which Hatchet shall list its Shares for trading, being either the TSX Venture Exchange or the Canadian Securities Exchange (“Deemed Price”) or the last sale price, if not listed on a stock exchange at the time of issuance. In the event that the issuance of any Shares pursuant to the above would result in the Company holding 10% or more of the outstanding Shares of Hatchet, Hatchet will issue that number of Shares which would result in the Company receiving 9.9% of the issued and outstanding Shares post-issuance and will pay cash in lieu of the Shares for the difference. The Company shall retain a 2% net smelter returns royalty from minerals mined and removed from the Optioned Property, of which Hatchet may purchase one-half, being 1%, at any time for $1,000,000. Terms of the Purchased Property: The Purchased Property consists of twenty-five (25) mineral claims comprising approximately 66,358 hectares across the Genie, Usam and CBX/Shoe projects. Hatchet has acquired a 100% interest in the Purchased Property by, on the date of closing (the “Closing Date”), paying the Company $25,000 and issuing to the Company such number of Units in the capital of Hatchet equal to 9.9% of the issued and outstanding shares immediately following the issuance. Each Hatchet Unit shall be comprised of one Share and one share purchase warrant, entitling Skyharbour to purchase one additional Share for a period of three years at a price that is a 25% premium to the deemed value of the Shares in both years 1 and 2, and then increases to a 50% premium to the issuance value of the Shares in year 3. The Company shall retain a claw-back provision whereby, within 90 days after the 3rd anniversary of the Closing Date, the Company may elect by written notice to Hatchet of its intention to purchase back a twenty-five percent (25%) interest in the Purchased Property by, within 90 days of delivery of such notice, incurring exploration expenditures or paying cash in lieu of to fund future exploration, equivalent to fifty percent (50%) of the total amount that Hatchet had spent during the term that is three years from the Closing Date in exploration expenditures on the Purchased Property. If Hatchet has not incurred any exploration expenditures during the three years following the closing date, then Skyharbour shall automatically receive the 25% interest in the Property. The Company shall also retain a 2% net smelter returns royalty from minerals mined and removed from the Purchased Property, of which Hatchet may purchase one-half, being 1%, at any time for $2,000,000. One of the conditions precedent for Hatchet prior to closing on both agreements was to close a financing for minimum gross proceeds of $1,500,000 which is now complete. Furthermore, Hatchet will proceed to list on the TSX Venture Exchange or the Canadian Securities Exchange or will have sold its interest to or combined with a similarly listed issuer. If this is not complete within 18 months, Hatchet’s right to acquire the Purchased Property will terminate. If after 12 months Hatchet has not listed then it shall pay Skyharbour a monthly fee of $10,000 until such conditions are satisfied or an aggregate of $60,000 has been paid, whichever occurs first. Highway Property Summary: The Highway Uranium Project consists of nine claims covering 17,606 hectares, approximately 41 km south of the Rabbit Lake Mine and 11 km southwest of Uranium Energy Corp.’s (UEC, formerly UEX) West Bear U and Co-Ni Deposits. Highway 905 runs through the property, providing excellent access for exploration and the project is in close proximity to regional infrastructure. There has been limited modern exploration carried out on the project but there is the potential for high-grade basement-hosted and unconformity-related uranium mineralization. Highway Property Map:https://skyharbourltd.com/_resources/images/Sky_Highway.jpg‎ The project is underlain by Wollaston Supergroup metasedimentary gneisses (pelitic to psammopelitic and psammitic to meta-arkosic) folded around and overlying an Archean felsic gneiss dome which outcrops in the southwestern portion of the property and cores a northeast trending antiformal fold nose. The Highway Project is located approximately 7 km east of the present-day margin of the Athabasca Basin but is believed to have been covered by Athabasca sandstone in the past. Genie Property Summary: The Genie property consists of five claims totalling 16,930 ha, and is located approximately 48 km northeast of Cameco’s Eagle Point Uranium Mine (Rabbit Lake Operation) and 40 km north of Wollaston Lake Post. The project is underlain by Wollaston Superground metasedimentary gneisses and Archean granitoids, with highly prospective pelitic to psammopelitic gneisses (including graphitic varieties) and several north-trending faults related to the Tabbernor fault system being mapped on the property. The project lies outside the current extent of the Athabasca Basin, but is believed to have been overlain by now-eroded Athabasca sandstones in the past and has the potential for high-grade basement-hosted and unconformity-related uranium mineralization. The property is underlain by a series of linear magnetic highs (interpreted as granitoids) and magnetic lows (interpreted as metasedimentary gneisses), cross-cut by a highly magnetic northwest-trending Mackenzie Diabase dyke. Genie Property Map:https://skyharbourltd.com/_resources/images/Sky_Genie.jpg Previous work on the Genie project includes limited diamond drilling (three historical drill holes, of which one was abandoned in overburden) and a variety of airborne and ground geophysical surveys, prospecting, geological mapping, lake sediment and overburden sampling, and soil sampling. Most of this exploration work took place between 1966 to 1980, prior to the advent of modern geophysical methods and geological models, but in 2014 part of the Genie property was covered by a helicopter-borne DIGHEM magnetic, electromagnetic, and radiometric survey. The survey showed a strong central EM conductor following a magnetically inferred contact on the two northeastern most claims, which is locally disrupted by several moderately conductive N-S trending structural breaks, inferred to be faults. This strong conductor is highly prospective for uranium mineralization, and drilling done in 1969 and 1971 has confirmed the presence of graphitic and sulfide-containing pelitic gneisses on the property. Lake sediment samples also collected at Genie during the 2014 exploration program, contained up to 63.3 ppm U, further showcasing the prospectivity of the property. Usam Property Summary: The Usam Project consists of twelve claims totalling 40,041 ha and is located approximately 16 km northeast of Cameco’s Eagle Point Mine (Rabbit Lake Operation). The project has numerous EM conductors that are associated with significant magnetic lows of the Wollaston Domain. While the project is outside the current confines of the Athabasca Basin, the area was overlain by Athabasca sandstones historically. Basement rocks on the property include Wollaston Supergroup metasediments and Archean granitoid gneisses, with highly prospective pelitic to psammopelitic gneisses (including graphitic varieties) making up the largest proportion of the basement rocks. Several north-trending faults related to the Tabbernor fault system cross-cut the property. Usam Property Map:https://skyharbourltd.com/_resources/images/Sky_Usam.jpg Previous work on the project includes diamond drilling (12 holes), lake sediment sampling, soil sampling, geological mapping, ground and airborne geophysics, marine seismic, prospecting, and other geochemical sampling, the majority of which was done in the 1980’s and 1970’s. Modern exploration of the property has been limited to geophysics and ground prospecting. As such there is a significant untested potential on the project. Trenching on Cleveland Island uncovered up to 0.31% U3O8 in mineralized pegmatite, and diamond drilling on Gilles Island intersected anomalous uranium, indicating that the basement rocks underling the Usam property are fertile sources of uranium in addition to containing pegmatite- and granite-hosted U-Th-REE mineralization. There are also several sedimentary-hosted base metals (i.e. Cu and Zn) showings on the project and in the surrounding area, which show similarities to the sedimentary-hosted Cu mineralization previously discovered by Rio Tinto and its partners at the Janice Lake Project further southwest in the Wollaston Domain. CBX/Shoe Property Summary: The CBX property has been recently expanded through staking to include five additional claims adjoining the previously staked CBX and Shoe properties, which have been combined to include a total of seven claims covering 8,777 hectares. The 609 ha Shoe property has remained unchanged, with both CBX and Shoe now consisting of eight non-contiguous claims totalling 9,386 hectares. CBX/Shoe Property Map:https://skyharbourltd.com/_resources/images/Sky_Shoe.jpg‎ The new claims lie approximately 6.5 km to 25 km northeast of the Eagle Point uranium mine and cover the northern shore of Wollaston Lake including parts of Cunning Bay. Outcrop exposure on the property is poor, but historical mapping and drilling shows that the newly expanded CBX project is underlain by a mixture of Wollaston Supergroup metasedimentary gneisses, Hudsonian intrusives, and Archean felsic gneisses of the Western Wollaston Domain. Similar lithologies host uranium mineralization at the Rabbit Lake operation, including the Eagle Point deposit, and other uranium deposits in the Athabasca Basin and surrounding regions. The CBX and Shoe properties have had historical exploration, including airborne and ground geophysical surveys, lake sediment, soil, and spruce geochemical surveys, till sampling, prospecting, geological mapping, and a marine seismic survey, but the majority of this work took place in the 1960’s to 1980’s, with limited modern exploration work being carried out on a small portion of the CBX and Shoe properties. Grant of Incentive Stock Options: Skyharbour also announces that the Company has granted 3,500,000 incentive stock options (the "Options") to officers, directors and consultants of the Company. The Options are exercisable at $0.40 per share for a period of five years from the date of grant. The Options have been granted under and are governed by the terms of the Company's Incentive Stock Option Plan. Qualified Person: The technical information in this news release has been prepared in accordance with the Canadian regulatory requirements set out in National Instrument 43-101 and reviewed and approved by Serdar Donmez, P.Geo., VP of Exploration for Skyharbour as well as a Qualified Person. About Skyharbour Resources Ltd.: Skyharbour holds an extensive portfolio of uranium exploration projects in Canada's Athabasca Basin and is well positioned to benefit from improving uranium market fundamentals with interest in thirty-six projects covering over 614,000 hectares (over 1.5 million acres) of land.

Title: AI Replacement? Meta Cuts 3,600 Jobs To Focus On AI Talent

WASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 31: Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, testifies before the Senate Judiciary ... [+] Committee at the Dirksen Senate Office Building on Jan. 31, 2024 in Washington, D.C. The committee heard testimony from the heads of the largest tech firms on the dangers of child sexual exploitation on social media. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) Perhaps the biggest threat to our jobs isn’t AI — but other, more talented people. Or so seems to be the case with Meta’s latest batch of layoffs. The tech giant is about to cut thousands of employees as part of a larger effort to phase out “low-performers” and rope in fresh meat for its AI expansion, Bloomberg reported. Affected workers were notified via email earlier today. According to Bloomberg’s sources, Meta is handing severance packages that include 16 weeks of pay in addition to two weeks of additional pay for each year of service. Employees with performance reviews that merited a bonus are expected to still get one, and staffers are still entitled to stock awards as part of the upcoming vesting cycle later this month. U.S. employees will be first to be notified of the layoffs, with international colleagues expected to be informed later, although the timeline for that is uncertain. Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg announced the cuts will affect about 5% of the workforce — about 3,600 people — starting with hires that “aren’t meeting expectations.” The plan is to use the resources from the layoffs to power its AI development and focus on securing the “strongest talent.” After a long streak of staving off layoffs, this marks yet another round of cuts at Meta. Notably, the company parted ways with thousands of employees in 2022 and 2023. For his part, Zuckerberg has previously spoken about Meta’s plans to inject billions into building out its AI infrastructure, which will power multiple products and services across its lineup, including but not limited to Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook and Threads. That’s hardly a surprise considering the speed at which Meta’s rivals like Amazon, Google and OpenAI are accelerating their AI efforts. DeepSeek’s entry into the fray has only further heated up the AI race for supremacy. As Sam Altman reflected in a recently penned essay on AI, “the intelligence of an AI model roughly equals the log of the resources used to train and run it.” Zuckerberg seems to be of the same mind — hence why Meta is shuffling spending around to lure in more AI talent.

Title: Meta Workforce Reductions Expected to Continue Through February

Meta began notifying employees affected by its previously announced job cuts on Monday (Feb. 10). The company’s emails notifying those who were being let go marked the beginning of a process that is expected to continue through the end of Meta’s performance cycle that goes to the end of February and result in terminations of as many as 3,600 employees, Bloomberg reported Monday. While U.S. staffers are being notified Monday, international employees could learn later, according to the report. With this headcount reduction, Meta aims to lay off “low performers” before adding new talent that will aid the company’s competitiveness in the artificial intelligence market, the report said. It was reported in January that Meta planned to cut about 5% of its workforce and that the employees affected by the cuts would be notified Feb. 10. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote at the time in an internal message, per a CNBC report: “Meta is working on building some of the most important technologies of the world. AI, glasses as the next computing platform and the future of social media. This is going to be an intense year, and I want to make sure we have the best people on our teams.” It was reported Friday (Feb. 7) that AI investments by the four biggest tech firms — Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft — jumped 63% last year and will jump again in 2025 to reach a combined capital expenditure that could surpass $320 billion. Executives at these companies are pledging to up their investments in AI, pushing aside worries about the massive amounts they’re spending on the technology. This year will also be a decisive one for Meta’s metaverse efforts. It was reported Feb. 3 that Meta Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth told employees in Reality Labs — the home of Meta’s metaverse and wearables products — that “this year likely determines whether this entire effort will go down as the work of visionaries or a legendary misadventure.” During Meta’s latest earnings call, Zuckerberg told analysts that while the number of users of the company’s Quest and Horizon offerings has been growing, “we’re going to know a lot more about Horizon’s trajectory by the end of this year.” We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Bird flu creates short supply of eggs and prices keep rising

WESTCHESTER COUNTY, New York (WABC) -- Iris Katz arrived at the Trader Joe's in Hartsdale on Monday on a mission to buy some eggs. The mission failed. "Not even hard-boiled eggs," Katz said. "I'll try other places?" Even if she found the eggs, Trader Joe's now limits sales to one dozen per customer. "To ensure that as many of our customers who need eggs are able to purchase them when they visit Trader Joe's," said a company spokesperson. The short supply and the ever-present demand for eggs mean price hikes for consumers. According to the USDA, the average price of a dozen eggs is now $7.95, up from $3.30 this time last year. "I really noticed around December. The price was crazy. And normally, around the holiday times, it always goes down," shopper Dina Rose said. The egg shortage and resulting price hikes are the direct result of the highly contagious bird flu, which has decimated the number of egg-laying hens. Governor Kathy Hochul said inspectors recently detected bird flu at seven live poultry markets in Queens, the Bronx and Brooklyn. The governor has ordered two live markets in Westchester County to close, clean, and disinfect their premises. The same order applies to markets in Nassau and Suffolk counties, even though inspectors never detected bird flu at those locations. "It was $6.99 for a dozen, and I said forget about it. So my daughter buys at Costco, and she buys a bunch of them," shopper John Esposito said. We visited the Costco in Yonkers. They had eggs in stock at the cost of $8.49 for two dozen, but Costco also issued a limit of 3 cartons per customer. Analysts say stabilizing the egg supply centers on containing the bird flu outbreak and repopulating the number of egg-laying hens. They estimate that the process could take months. ---------- * Get Eyewitness News Delivered * Follow us on YouTube * More local news * Send us a news tip * Download the abc7NY app for breaking news alerts Have a breaking news tip or an idea for a story we should cover?

February 10, 2025 17:15 ET | Source: ValOre Metals Corporation ValOre Metals Corporation VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Feb. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ValOre Metals Corp. (“ValOre”; TSX‐V: VO; OTCQB: KVLQF; Frankfurt: KEQ0) today provided an update on developments concerning Hatchet Uranium Corp. (“Hatchet”), in which ValOre currently holds an approximate 51.5% partially diluted ownership interest. ValOre, further to its news releases dated November 4th, 2024, and February 5th, 2025, announces that closing has now occurred on the option agreement (the “Agreement”) with Skyharbour Resources Ltd. (“Skyharbour”), whereby Hatchet may acquire an 80% interest in Skyharbour’s 17,606 ha Highway Uranium Property (“Highway”) and a 100% interest, subject to a claw-back provision for Skyharbour, in Skyharbour’s Genie, Usam and CBX/Shoe Uranium Projects (the “Purchased Properties”) totalling 66,358 ha, all located to the northeast of the Athabasca Basin, northern Saskatchewan, Canada. The Agreement on Highway provides Hatchet an opportunity to earn an 80% interest in the related claims over a three-year period by fulfilling combined cash, share issuance and exploration expenditure commitments of CAD $3.345 million. Terms of Highway Property Agreement: Highway, now consists of nine (9) mineral claims comprising approximately 17,606 hectares, due to the recent addition of five (5) mineral claims comprising 8,267 ha. Hatchet may acquire an 80% interest in Highway by (i) issuing common shares in the capital of Hatchet (“Shares”) having an aggregate value of CAD $1,050,000; (ii) making aggregate cash payments of CAD $245,000; and (iii) incurring an aggregate of CAD $2,050,000 in exploration expenditures on Highway over a three-year period, as follows: (1) Deemed pricing of Shares is based on the twenty (20) day volume weighted average price on the stock exchange in which Hatchet shall list its Shares for trading, being either the TSX Venture Exchange or the Canadian Securities Exchange (“Deemed Price”) or the last sale price, if not listed on a stock exchange at the time of issuance. In the event that the issuance of any Shares pursuant to the above would result in Skyharbour holding 10% or more of the outstanding Shares of Hatchet, Hatchet will issue that number of Shares which would result in Skyharbour receiving 9.9% of the issued and outstanding Shares post-issuance and will pay cash in lieu of the Shares for the difference. Skyharbour shall retain a 2% net smelter returns royalty from minerals mined and removed from Highway, of which Hatchet may purchase one-half, being 1%, at any time for $1,000,000. Terms of the Purchased Properties: The Purchased Properties consists of twenty-five (25) mineral claims comprising approximately 66,358 hectares across the Genie, Usam and CBX/Show projects. Hatchet acquired a 100% interest in the Purchased Properties by, on the date of closing (the “Closing Date”), paying Skyharbour $25,000 and issuing to Skyharbour such number of units in the capital of Hatchet (“Hatchet Units”) equal to 9.9% of the issued and outstanding Shares immediately following issuance. Each Hatchet Unit shall be comprised of one Share and one share purchase warrant, entitling Skyharbour to purchase one additional Share for a period of three years at a price that is a 25% premium to the deemed value of the Shares in both years 1 and 2, and then increases to a 50% premium to the issuance value of the Shares in year 3. Skyharbour shall retain a claw-back provision whereby, within 90 days after the 3rd anniversary of the Closing Date, Skyharbour may elect by written notice to Hatchet of its intention to purchase back a twenty-five percent (25%) interest in the Purchased Properties by, within 90 days of delivery of such notice, incurring exploration expenditures or paying cash in lieu of to fund future exploration, equivalent to fifty percent (50%) of the total amount that Hatchet had spent during the term that is three years from the Closing Date in exploration expenditures on the Purchased Properties. If Hatchet has not incurred any exploration expenditures during the three years following the closing date, then Skyharbour shall automatically receive the 25% interest in the Purchased Properties. Skyharbour shall also retain a 2% net smelter returns royalty from minerals mined and removed from the Purchased Properties, of which Hatchet may purchase one-half, being 1%, at any time for $2,000,000. One of the conditions precedent for Hatchet prior to closing on both agreements was to close a financing for minimum gross proceeds of $1,500,000 which is now complete. Furthermore, Hatchet will proceed to list on the TSX Venture Exchange or the Canadian Securities Exchange or will have sold its interest to or combined with a similarly listed issuer. If this is not complete within 18 months, Hatchet’s right to acquire the Purchased Property will terminate. If after 12 months Hatchet has not listed then it shall pay Skyharbour a monthly fee of $10,000 until such conditions are satisfied or an aggregate of $60,000 has been paid, whichever occurs first. Highway Property Summary: The Highway Uranium Project consists of nice (9) claims covering 17,606 hectares, approximately 41 km south of the Rabbit Lake Mine and 11 km southwest of Uranium Energy Corp.’s (UEC, formerly UEX) West Bear U and Co-Ni Deposits. The Highway Project is located approximately 7 km east of the present-day margin of the Athabasca Basin but is believed to have been covered by Athabasca sandstone in the past. Highway 905 runs through the property, providing excellent access for exploration and in close proximity to regional infrastructure. There has been limited modern exploration performed on the project but there is the potential for high-grade basement-hosted-uranium mineralization. The project is underlain by Wollaston Supergroup metasedimentary gneisses (pelitic to psammopelitic and psammitic to meta-arkosic) folded around and overlying an Archean felsic gneiss dome which outcrops in the southwestern portion of the property and cores a northeast trending antiformal fold nose. Figure 1: Highway Property Location MapGenie Property Summary: The Genie property consists of five claims totalling 16,930 ha, and is located approximately 48 km northeast of Cameco’s Eagle Point Uranium Mine (Rabbit Lake Operation) and 40 km north of Wollaston Lake Post. The project is underlain by Wollaston Superground metasedimentary gneisses and Archean granitoids, with prospective pelitic to psammopelitic gneisses (including graphitic varieties) and several north-trending faults related to the Tabbernor fault system being mapped on the property. The project lies outside the current extent of the Athabasca Basin, but is believed to have been overlain by now-eroded Athabasca sandstones in the past and has the potential for high-grade basement-hosted uranium mineralization. The property is underlain by a series of linear magnetic highs (interpreted as granitoids) and magnetic lows (interpreted as metasedimentary gneisses), cross-cut by a highly magnetic northwest-trending Mackenzie Diabase dyke. Previous work on the Genie project includes limited diamond drilling (three historical drill holes, of which one was abandoned in overburden) and a variety of airborne and ground geophysical surveys, prospecting, geological mapping, lake sediment and overburden sampling, and soil sampling. Most of this exploration work took place between 1966 to 1980, prior to the advent of modern geophysical methods and geological models, but in 2014 part of the Genie property was covered by a helicopter-borne DIGHEM magnetic, electromagnetic, and radiometric survey. The survey showed a strong central EM conductor following a magnetically inferred contact on the two northeastern most claims, which is locally disrupted by several moderately conductive N-S trending structural breaks, inferred to be faults. This strong conductor is highly prospective for uranium mineralization, and drilling done in 1969 and 1971 has confirmed the presence of graphitic and sulfide-containing pelitic gneisses on the property. Lake sediment samples also collected at Genie during the 2014 exploration program, contained up to 63.3 ppm U, further showcasing the prospectivity of the property. Figure 2: Genie Property Location MapUsam Property Summary: The Usam Project consists of twelve claims totalling 40,041 ha and is located approximately 16 km northeast of Cameco’s Eagle Point Mine (Rabbit Lake Operation). The project has numerous EM conductors that are associated with significant magnetic lows of the Wollaston Domain. While the project is outside the current confines of the Athabasca Basin, the area was overlain by Athabasca sandstones historically. Basement rocks on the property include Wollaston Supergroup metasediments and Archean granitoid gneisses, with highly prospective pelitic to psammopelitic gneisses (including graphitic varieties) making up the largest proportion of the basement rocks. Several north-trending faults related to the Tabbernor fault system cross-cut the property. Previous work on the project includes diamond drilling (12 holes), lake sediment sampling, soil sampling, geological mapping, ground and airborne geophysics, marine seismic, prospecting, and other geochemical sampling, the majority of which was done in the 1980’s and 1970’s. Modern exploration of the property has been limited to geophysics and ground prospecting. As such there is a significant untested potential on the project. Trenching on Cleveland Island uncovered up to 0.31% U3O8 in mineralized pegmatite, and diamond drilling on Gilles Island intersected anomalous uranium, indicating that the basement rocks underling the Usam property are fertile sources of uranium in addition to containing pegmatite- and granite-hosted U-Th-REE mineralization. There are also several sedimentary-hosted base metals (i.e. Cu and Zn) showings on the project and in the surrounding area, which show similarities to the sedimentary-hosted Cu mineralization previously discovered by Rio Tinto and its partners at the Janice Lake Project further southwest in the Wollaston Domain. Figure 3 – Usam Property Location Map CBX/Shoe Property Summary: The CBX property has been recently expanded through staking to include five additional claims adjoining the previously staked CBX and Shoe properties, which have been combined to include a total of seven claims covering 8,777 hectares. The 609 ha Shoe property has remained unchanged, with both CBX and Shoe now consisting of eight non-contiguous claims totalling 9,386 hectares. The new claims lie approximately 6.5 km to 25 km northeast of the Eagle Point uranium mine and cover the northern shore of Wollaston Lake including parts of Cunning Bay. Outcrop exposure on the property is poor, but historical mapping and drilling shows that the newly expanded CBX project is underlain by a mixture of Wollaston Supergroup metasedimentary gneisses, Hudsonian intrusives, and Archean felsic gneisses of the Western Wollaston Domain. Similar lithologies host uranium mineralization at the Rabbit Lake operation, including the Eagle Point deposit, and other uranium deposits in the Athabasca Basin and surrounding regions. The CBX and Shoe properties have had historical exploration, including airborne and ground geophysical surveys, lake sediment, soil, and spruce geochemical surveys, till sampling, prospecting, geological mapping, and a marine seismic survey, but the majority of this work took place in the 1960’s to 1980’s, with limited modern exploration work being carried out on a small portion of the CBX and Shoe properties.

We recently published a list of 10 AI News Updates You Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against other AI news updates you should not miss. Europe is putting itself on the artificial map with France and the United Arab Emirates having agreed to a framework accord for a 1 gigawatt data center dedicated to artificial intelligence. The French presidency said in a statement that the center will be the core of a new AI “campus” and will have up to 1 gigawatt of capacity, “which represents investments of 30 to 50 billion euros”. READ ALSO: Top 10 AI Stocks Trending On Wall Street and 12 High-Flying AI Stocks This Week The move is said to be a part of a larger AI agreement signed between French President Emmanuel Macron and his UAE counterpart Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in Paris. President Emmanuel Macron hosted his Emirati counterpart on Thursday. “The two leaders expressed their desire to create a strategic partnership in the field of AI and committed to exploring collaborations on projects and investments supporting the development of the AI ​​value chain”. According to the leaders, the investments would go into both French and Emirati AI and would include buying advanced chips, building data centers, talent development, and establishing virtual data embassies to secure AI and cloud systems in both countries. France is also going to be hosting the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Summit at the Grand Palais on February 10-11, 2025. The country has deemed the summit a “wake-up call” for Europe in the global race for AI. “The summit comes at exactly the right time for this wake-up call for France and Europe, and to show we are in position” to take advantage of the technology, an official in Macron’s office told reporters. Attendees at the summit will include Sam Altman, head of OpenAI, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Nobel Prize winner Demis Hassabis, who leads the company’s DeepMind AI research unit, amongst many other industry leaders, government officials, and similar figures from around the world. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 286 Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is an American technology company offering e-commerce, cloud computing, and other services, including digital streaming and artificial intelligence solutions. On February 7, RBC Capital analyst Brad Erickson raised the firm’s price target on the stock to $265 from $255 and kept an “Outperform” rating on the shares. The analyst told investors in a research note that the company’s Q4 results were mixed with a slight miss on third-party seller services and advertising revenues. There is also an implied $100B+ capex guide. These factors outweigh the company’s solid figures from Amazon Web Services (AWS) and continued EBITDA outperformance. The firm also stated that Amazon.com shares are “crowded” and the AI “spend money to make money” debate will undoubtedly continue, but AWS’s high margin growth and further network cost efficiencies will help the company grow its earnings at a level that justifies its valuation. Overall, AMZN ranks 1st on our list of AI news updates you should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Shares of natural food company Hain Celestial (NASDAQ:HAIN) fell 22.5% in the morning session after the company reported weak fourth-quarter results: its revenue, EBITDA, and EPS missed significantly. The company attributed the weak performance to "poor in-store performance in snacks, driven by marketing and promotion effectiveness, and supply chain challenges." Overall, this was a poor quarter. The shares closed the day at $4.19, down 10.3% from previous close. The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Hain Celestial? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free. Hain Celestial’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 32 moves greater than 5% over the last year. But moves this big are rare even for Hain Celestial and indicate this news significantly impacted the market’s perception of the business. The biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 6 months ago when the stock gained 31.3% on the news that the company reported strong second-quarter results. Hain Celestial blew past analysts' EPS expectations, and its organic revenue growth also outperformed Wall Street's estimates. Looking ahead, guidance was promising, with FY'25 organic sales expected to be flat (vs. -2% decline recorded in FY'24). Similarly, adjusted EBITDA is expected to grow by mid-single digits, year on year, while free cash flow is expected to be at least $60m. Zooming out, this was a fantastic quarter, which is being reflected in the significant stock move. Hain Celestial is down 30.7% since the beginning of the year, and at $4.16 per share, it is trading 58.4% below its 52-week high of $10 from February 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Hain Celestial’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $156.86.

Hain Celestial (HAIN) delivered earnings and revenue surprises of -33.33% and 4.37%, respectively, for the quarter ended December 2024. Do the numbers hold clues to what lies ahead for the stock? The segment generated about 3% of the company’s net sales during its most recent quarter, with the majority of its business coming from snacks, beverages and meal prep. Hain Celestial's Q2 organic sales fall 7% year over year. Yet, it is aiming to streamline its operations and create long-term value for shareholders.

Title: Novo Nordisk (NVO) Faces Securities Class Action After Weight Loss Therapy Trial Data Disappoints, Analyst Questions Trial’s Design – Hagens Berman

February 10, 2025 14:13 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) is facing a class-action lawsuit from investors who allege the pharmaceutical giant misled them about the prospects of its experimental obesity drug, CagriSema. Hagens Berman urges investors who purchased Novo Nordisk shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge of the trial and its design to contact the firm’s attorneys. Class Period: Nov. 2, 2022 – Dec. 19, 2024Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Mar. 25, 2025 Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/nvo Contact the Firm Now: NVO@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Securities Class Action: The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713, accuses the company and certain top executives of securities violations related to disclosures about the drug’s Phase 3 trial, dubbed REDEFINE-1. The plaintiffs, representing investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities between Nov. 2, 2022, and Dec. 19, 2024, claim the company misrepresented the likelihood of CagriSema achieving at least 25% weight loss in the study. The suit alleges that Novo Nordisk created a “false impression” of reliable data supporting this projection, while downplaying concerns about dosage tolerability. Specifically, the lawsuit contends that the company’s “repeated optimistic claims” about CagriSema’s potential fell short of reality. It further argues that the trial’s “flexible protocol,” which allowed patients to adjust their dosage, hampered the study’s ability to accurately assess weight loss at the tested dosage. This, the suit suggests, indicates either worse-than-anticipated tolerability, forcing patients to lower their doses, or a rushed patient selection process that included individuals not aiming for the targeted 25% weight loss. The complaint highlights the company’s December 20, 2024, announcement of headline results from the REDEFINE-1 trial. The disclosure revealed that the study utilized a flexible dosing protocol and that, after 68 weeks, only 57.3% of patients on CagriSema were on the highest dose, compared to 82.5% for cagrilintide and 70.2% for semaglutide, the other drugs being compared. Following this announcement, Novo Nordisk’s stock price dropped nearly 18%, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs argue this decline demonstrates the impact of the alleged misrepresentations on investors. Shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the complaint’s allegations. “We’re examining whether Novo Nordisk may have intentionally misled investors about the trial’s design and potential tolerability issues,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The Magnificent Seven has turned into the Stupendous One as AI spending fears weigh on sentiment. The usually reliably hot Magnificent Seven trade of Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) has underwhelmed more than one month into 2025. Only one of the big-cap tech components — Meta — has notched double-digit gains out of the box. In fact, shares of Meta have risen for 15 straight sessions through Monday — bringing its year-to-date advance to a stellar (or stupendous...) 20%. Amazon is the only other Mag Seven component to be up on the year to the tune of 5.9%, slightly ahead of the 3.4% increase for the S&P 500 (^GSPC). Alphabet, Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Tesla are all down year to date, with an average drop of 3% based on Yahoo Finance's calculations. Tesla is the worst performer on the year, down 6% as it has been hit with less-than-inspiring sales news from across the world. Tariff concerns have also weighed on the stock, similar to other auto plays like General Motors (GM) and Ford (F). Digging deeper, six out of seven Mag Seven members have reported fourth quarter earnings so far: All but Meta are down since their reports. Alphabet is down the most at 10.4%, as the Street reacted very negatively to its initial 2025 outlook. "Price reactions suggest growing concerns around monetization vs. capex for hyperscalers," said BofA strategist Savita Subramanian in a client note on Monday. To Subramanian's point, the capital expenditure numbers being tossed for 2025 by Big Tech to build out AI infrastructure have been eye-popping — and have caught investors off guard. Collectively, they have the Street worried about whether profit margins for the Mag Seven hit a short-term peak in 2024. Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet are slated to spend a cumulative $325 billion in capital expenditures and investments this year, Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports. This would mark a 46% increase year over year for the four tech stalwarts. Amazon alone sees $104 billion in capital expenditures this year, well above prior analyst forecasts of $80 billion to $85 billion. RBC Capital Markets analyst Brad Erickson warned last week Mag Seven names such as Amazon are "crowded" trades and that the "AI 'spend money to make money' debate will undoubtedly continue." The question now beginning to circulate on the Street is if Mag Seven weakness bleeds into the broader market. If so, it could have an outsized impact on stocks not directly tied to tech. The combined weighting of the Mag Seven within the S&P 500 surged from 21.9% in 2020 to over 30% in 2024, the highest concentration ever recorded, according to data from First Trust. "While the main S&P 500 index has been able to hold up incredibly well in the face of the Mag 7 weakness, should the market get further concerning news on tariffs, and/or inflation, the indices could be susceptible for a much larger decline than we have seen thus far given the overall weakness from the top-weighted names. In addition, should these names remain under pressure that likely puts a 'cap' to the index upside in the shorter-term given their importance," explains 22V Research strategist Jeff Jacobson. A near-term test for the Mag Seven bulls will come with Feb. 26 earnings from Nvidia, says Jacobson. — Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The Magnificent Seven has turned into the Stupendous One as AI spending fears weigh on sentiment. The usually reliably hot Magnificent Seven trade of Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) has underwhelmed more than one month into 2025. Only one of the big-cap tech components — Meta — has notched double-digit gains out of the box. In fact, shares of Meta have risen for 15 straight sessions through Monday — bringing its year-to-date advance to a stellar (or stupendous...) 20%. Amazon is the only other Mag Seven component to be up on the year to the tune of 5.9%, slightly ahead of the 3.4% increase for the S&P 500 (^GSPC). Alphabet, Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Tesla are all down year to date, with an average drop of 3% based on Yahoo Finance's calculations. Tesla is the worst performer on the year, down 6% as it has been hit with less-than-inspiring sales news from across the world. Tariff concerns have also weighed on the stock, similar to other auto plays like General Motors (GM) and Ford (F). Digging deeper, six out of seven Mag Seven members have reported fourth quarter earnings so far: All but Meta are down since their reports. Alphabet is down the most at 10.4%, as the Street reacted very negatively to its initial 2025 outlook. "Price reactions suggest growing concerns around monetization vs. capex for hyperscalers," said BofA strategist Savita Subramanian in a client note on Monday. To Subramanian's point, the capital expenditure numbers being tossed for 2025 by Big Tech to build out AI infrastructure have been eye-popping — and have caught investors off guard. Collectively, they have the Street worried about whether profit margins for the Mag Seven hit a short-term peak in 2024. Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet are slated to spend a cumulative $325 billion in capital expenditures and investments this year, Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports. This would mark a 46% increase year over year for the four tech stalwarts. Amazon alone sees $104 billion in capital expenditures this year, well above prior analyst forecasts of $80 billion to $85 billion. RBC Capital Markets analyst Brad Erickson warned last week Mag Seven names such as Amazon are "crowded" trades and that the "AI 'spend money to make money' debate will undoubtedly continue." The question now beginning to circulate on the Street is if Mag Seven weakness bleeds into the broader market. If so, it could have an outsized impact on stocks not directly tied to tech. The combined weighting of the Mag Seven within the S&P 500 surged from 21.9% in 2020 to over 30% in 2024, the highest concentration ever recorded, according to data from First Trust. "While the main S&P 500 index has been able to hold up incredibly well in the face of the Mag 7 weakness, should the market get further concerning news on tariffs, and/or inflation, the indices could be susceptible for a much larger decline than we have seen thus far given the overall weakness from the top-weighted names. In addition, should these names remain under pressure that likely puts a 'cap' to the index upside in the shorter-term given their importance," explains 22V Research strategist Jeff Jacobson.

February 10, 2025 13:09 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, Feb. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in Novo Nordisk A/S ("Novo" or the "Company") (NYSE: NVO) of a class action securities lawsuit. CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Novo investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/novo-nordisk-a-s-lawsuit-submission-form?prid=127887&wire=3 NVO investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, on December 20, 2024, Novo issued a press release announcing the below-expected results of their “REDEFINE 1” trial, “a 68-week efficacy and safety trial investigating subcutaneous CagriSema.” The trial showed that patients treated with CagriSema exhibited weight loss of 22.7% after 68 weeks, well short of Novo’s targeted expectation of at least 25% weight loss. The press release further indicated that participant patients were permitted to modify their own dosage during the trial and, as a result, only 57.3% of patients treated with CagriSema were on the highest dosage contemplated by the study. Following this news, Novo’s stock price fell by $18.44 per share to close at $85.00 per share. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Novo during the relevant time frame, you have until March 25, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff.

Title: Work at the Mill Or, the Story of Digital Equipment Corporation

Time Published: 2025-02-10T17:39:28Z
Full Content:
Kenneth Harry Olsen was born on the 20th of February in 1926 in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and he grew up in nearby Stratford. In the 1930s and 1940s when Olsen was a teenager, the electronics industry for the average person was essentially the radio industry. For Olsen, his window into that world was magazines, particularly Popular Mechanics and Popular Science. In the most common text books of the time, the topic stopped at the spark-gap transmitter, but Olsen was a voracious reader on the topic. He had a hungry mind, and he loved to experiment. Despite his lust for technology, he never had quite enough money to get the necessary components to satisfy his ambitions, but he worked with what he had. The greater Bridgeport area was a machine tool manufacturing hub, and most young men were somewhat expected to learn the trade and get some experience in the machine shops. Olsen definitely did so, but that work didn’t satisfy him and interest in electronics didn’t waiver. Like so many young men at that time, Olsen was drafted on account of the Second World War at the age of eighteen. He went into the US Navy with his Boot Camp at the Great Lakes. He then went to Chicago where he got an education in the electronics of the time, followed by still more education and training at Monterey in California, and then still more on Treasure Island in San Francisco Bay. Olsen stated that all of the men in this program with him were rather excited and that they enjoyed the program. Nearly all of these young men were to be technicians on US Navy ships maintaining and repairing the new electronic systems being installed such as radar, radio, and even analogue computers for antisubmarine uses. The first part of his enlistment was spent sitting in camp, and then going on a troop ship. When the war came to its end, he was sent to China for a bit assigned to an admiral’s staff. He spent some time on a couple of cruisers maintaining communications for that admiral. He had the opportunity to see a bit of China and Korea, but there was quite a bit of time spent idle on the ship. During that time, he and some of the other sailors did some electronics experimentation, not all of which was exactly by the book. For example, they built a switching system for the radio that would automatically start a motor generator to allow them to send communications with higher power than would normally be available just so they needn’t wake any of the mechanical guys. Olsen left the Navy in 1946 and he enrolled at MIT in February of 1947 with several other veterans. He went for four terms without any vacation, and he was recruited to work at the MIT computer laboratory. Up to this point, Olsen had no concept of a computer at all just like most people on Earth. There, he worked on Whirlwind for the Office of Naval Research. His largest contribution to Whirlwind was the Memory Test Computer, which as the name would imply, tested the core memory of the Whirlwind computer (originally, Whirlwind used electrostatic memory tubes but was upgraded to core memory after Jay W. Forrester invented it {though magnetic core memory was invented by many people independently around the same time}). Whirlwind was a 2000 square feet monster weighing in at 20,000 pounds. It was comprised of 5000 vacuum tubes, had a 16bit word, and had the equivalent of 4KB of memory. This computer consumed more the 100kW. Olsen graduated with his BS in electrical engineering in 1950. Before enrolling in graduate school, Olsen took a summer off and traveled to Finland. His parents’ neighbor had had a Finnish girl, Eeva-Liisa Aulikki, who was a visiting student, stay with them. Olsen liked her and he failed in his initial pursuit. Yet, Olsen was a determined man. He got a job at a ball bearing factory in Goteberg. He courted her, he proposed, and she said yes. At the time, it wasn’t all that easy for a Finnish person to immigrate to the USA, and while Olsen now had a fiance, he couldn’t easily bring her to the States. He came back to school, and he visited her that following December. This time, he wasn’t leaving without his fiance. He stayed in Finland for six weeks. This put him behind in school, but he was able to keep his job and his enrollment. The two returned, and were married. Olsen completed his MS in electrical engineering in 1952, and he set about building a transistorized computer. While MIT approved the project, they didn’t make it easy for him. The school set the terms that he could hire approximately zero people and that he could have approximately zero space. Olsen considered these constraints seriously, but he then realized that these terms weren’t as rigid as one might assume. While he could hire no one, he could have people volunteer to help him, and while he couldn’t have space, he realized that hallways weren’t exactly counted as “space.” He and three others setup in the hall outside of his office and put a few walls around it. After a short time, they traded their makeshift area for a spot in the basement, and they then discovered that part of the Lincoln Laboratory’s basement was unfinished, just a bare dirt floor. Well, Olsen managed to convince someone to pour concrete, another someone to put in a light colored floor, and they painted the concrete masonry walls. They put in enough lighting to make their new location the brightest of any in the lab building. The computer that Olsen and his team built in that basement was the TX-0. It was far smaller than Whirlwind, and it was slightly faster. This machine used a vector display like its larger sibling, but it was a fully transistorized 18bit computer, had a 16bit address range for its core memory, and it could use a light pen. The TX-0 was finished in 1956. Almost immediately, work began on a much larger and more ambitious machine, the TX-2. Olsen was working on the hardware for that, but he became impatient with the team designing the logic. It was in 1957 that he chose to leave. He had some well reasoned confidence in his choice. Olsen wanted to start a company that sold small, transistorized, interactive computers. The TX-0 showed that interactive computing was more appealing to people than the prior batch paradigm. While people would queue for hours for time on the TX-0, they largely ignored the larger and more powerful machines that ran batch. Much of this is likely due to turn around time. Programming typically involves making quite a number of mistakes. With your typical IBM of the era, you’d bring your program in on a stack of cards, they’d be read, the program would be run, and you’d come by the next day to pickup the result. Given the likelihood of having made a mistake, it could take a week or two to get the intended results. With an interactive computer, the turn around was immediate. Olsen had the idea, and a colleague from MIT, Harlan Anderson, was with him. Right away, Ken Olsen’s brother, Stan, was brought in. Stan Olsen went about trying to secure some funding. This wasn’t easy. There was a bit of a recession setting in, and most major financial companies weren’t thrilled at the prospect of funding a computer startup. They eventually found out that American Research and Development Corporation was a company founded to do just this. AR&D was founded by General Georges Doriot and was one of the first venture capital firms. They’d had some of their other computer investments fail, and even they, who opened shop for this express purpose, weren’t too excited. They were willing to invest, but they had some advice. First, they suggested that the new company drop the “computer” from Digital Computer Corporation, and so the company name became Digital Equipment Corporation. Second, they advised that the group change their expected profit. The three had started with an estimate of 5% but they bumped that to 10%. Finally, AR&D suggested that they aim to have an extremely quick return, and so DEC promised results in a year. AR&D was a bit unusual, but they fit DEC extremely well. They believed (or at least Doriot did) that investments should be long-term, not just buying and selling at the first opportunity for profit. They’d stick it out until the company was successful or until the company failed. Essentially, AR&D was patient, and they believed in really giving it a go with their investments, and Doriot would mentor companies when such was desired. The company planned to sell circuit modules before attempting to sell complete computers, and Olsen had largely worked out the technological side of that. The real first step then was to create the financial plan for the company. Olsen and Anderson did so, and they presented that plan to AR&D who provided them with $70,000 which would be around $786,000 in 2025 dollars. With that money, the infant DEC of three men bought the equipment they would need, made some silk screens, etched boards and dipped them in solder. Everything. They were extremely careful with their money, and they learned quite a bit. While they did learn how to handle accounting and business operations, they chose to spend some of their limited funds on secretaries, accountants, and other supporting roles. The company setup their company in the old Assbet Woolen Company’s mill in downtown Maynard, Massachusetts. As the company grew, they took over all nineteen buildings on the site, and the company purchased the building in 1974 for $2.2 million. In 1958, DEC released the Digital Laboratory Module line. These were essentially printed circuit boards in extruded aluminum housings with germanium transistors mounted to them. These were circuits based on those that had been used in the TX-2. While the intent was to have these on an engineer’s workbench, Digital also offered a rack-mount case that would hold nine modules. Versions of these were made running at different speeds: 500kHz, 2MHz, 10MHz. In the first year, the company had $94,000 in revenue from module sales which would be roughly equivalent to $1,055,000 in 2025 dollars. The company made good on its promise to post profits in a year. These modules were then used by DEC itself to build whole machines. The first of these was a memory test machine. Yet, this wasn’t what brought the company its first hit. That honor goes to the Programmed Data Processor-1 or PDP-1. Of this machine, Ken Olsen said: The goal of the PDP-1 was to introduce a new type computer to the world. In the tradition that was developed at MIT where the computer was very simple, very fast, relatively inexpensive. In this case, $110,000 with only 4000 words of memory. Because it was simple, easy to use, interactive with the cathode ray tube and light pen, it could be used by an individual. Someone could afford to sit there and use the computer like we do a personal computer today. You could also use the same equipment interactively with equipment, that is, with a machine or a telephone system because the price was relatively low. $110,000 thirty years ago was a lot of money, but computers then cost one, two and three million dollars, so it was relatively inexpensive. And it did open up new applications that people hadn't thought of before. The PDP-1 was built of DEC modules, and it was based directly upon the TX-0 and TX-2. The design was extremely simple, it was easy to use, and it was interactive. As for technical specifications, it was built of 2700 transistors and 3000 diodes. While the transistors could switch at roughly 5MHz the actual CPU speed was about 187kHz which resulted in most instructions completing in around 10.7 microseconds. This means the PDP-1 could manage around 93,458 operations per second though for simple additions this could be up to 100,000. The machine shipped with 4K words (18bit) of memory standard which would be equivalent to 9.2KB, but could be upgraded to 65,536 words. Setting the PDP-1 apart from pretty much all other computers of its day were lack of need for special power considerations, subflooring, air conditioning, and other accommodations. Interestingly, the temperature of the PDP-1 was controlled by the computer itself to maintain a temperature of between 50 and 110 degrees Fahrenheit. The system shipped in four cabinets and occupied a total of 17 square feet of space. It weighed in at about 1600 pounds. Standard equipment was a PDP-1 with 4K words RAM, a paper tape reader, a typewriter with on-line input and output, and a paper tape punch. Optionally, the customer could purchase a CRT, a light pen, card punch and card reader, tape drives and tape controllers, more memory, and multiply/divide accelerator cards. The math accelerators would have been absolutely essential for many customers when one considers that the average time for a division without an accelerator was about 600 microseconds. As you can likely infer, storage was primarily on paper tape. For “finished” results the paper tape output could be taken to a Flexowriter for offline printing. DECtape drives were available by the time the first PDP-1 was formally accepted, and some PDP-1 installations added these. The first delivery of a PDP-1 was to Bolt, Beranek and Newman in November of 1960 with formal acceptance in 1961 (at latest by April). BBN’s PDP-1 was then used for research projects that they undertook for both government and private industry. A total of 53 PDP-1 systems are known to have been delivered but 55 were made, and one of those was a donation to MIT. The PDP-1 is among the most important computers to have ever been made. It was the birthplace of the text editor, word processor, interactive debugger, computer chess, Spacewar!, and while not the first, it was the birth place of what was certainly among the earliest time sharing systems (BBN TS). Even music was made with the PDP-1. Using four flip-flops controlled directly by the PDP-1’s processor, the PDP-1 could play music in four-part harmony prepared by Peter Samson’s Harmony Compiler. It was with the PDP-1 that hacker culture truly started (though the TX-0 and TX-2 were the most absolute origin). Yet, even that doesn’t fully describe the importance of the PDP-1. It was the first commercial computer that emphasized user interaction over the efficient use of computer cycles. In this sense, the PDP-1 was the first personal computer. Naturally, due to the price tag, there were likely zero PDP-1s bought explicitly for use by a single person, but it brought about that model of use. Emphasizing this, we again have the words of Ken Olsen: … we believed computers should be fun. They were exciting. They could do so many things. The opportunities were just without bounds. In 1960, DEC had around 117 employees, and they finished the year with $1.3 million in revenue. In 1962, DEC introduced the PDP-4. For the most part, the PDP-4 was a smaller and cheaper version of the PDP-1. Primarily, the PDP-4 used slower memory, was priced at $65,000, and weighed in at 1090 pounds. Over time, DEC sold 54 PDP-4s. With the PDP-1 and PDP-4 on the market, the company’s profits for 1962 were $807,000 on sales of $6.5 million. Some may wonder what happened to PDP-2 and PDP-3. The PDP-2 was designed as a 24bit machine, but the design was never completed. The PDP-3 was a 36bit machine, and only one was ever made as far as I can tell and then not by DEC. The lone PDP-3 was built in 1960 at CIA’s Scientific Engineering Institute in Waltham, Massachusetts, and it was called CASINO (Computer Able to Select INternal Orders). In From RAINBOW to GUSTO by Paul A. Suhler, I found the following: As the amount of radar testing at the Ranch increased, the scientists at SEI decided that the data had become too much to process by hand. To speed things up, they decided that a computer would be needed. The difficulty was that no computer within their budget was available off the shelf. So they decided to build their own. In October 1960, the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) had produced a specification for the PDP-3, a new system in their line of programmable data processor minicomputers. Ed Rawson took charge of the project and with the help of Chuck Corderman and Jay Lawson designed and built a PDP-3 using standard DEC logic modules. Because disk drives were not available, a tape loop running through an Ampex tape drive held intermediate results; eventually, the tape loop was replaced with a drum memory. The project was run like a homebrew computer project, with more emphasis on getting the machine and software to run rather than on making it well documented and easy to use. The design evolved so rapidly that when one of the engineers returned after a two-week absence, he didn’t recognize it. The design evolved away from the original PDP-3 architecture, and it came to be called CASINO. Eventually the system worked. Radar data were recorded by EG&G at the Ranch on 1 inch wide data tapes and shipped to SEI. The data could be processed correctly, but the computer could usually only be operated with Rawson looking over the user’s shoulder. Eventually, the PDP-3 was discarded; one computer engineering textbook stated that in the early 1980s it was running somewhere in Washington state, but the author of that book could not confirm it. There is an unconfirmed report that it was donated to a Boy Scout troop and eventually given to Dow Chemical for disposal. It was the only example of a PDP-3 ever built. DEC themselves lacked the resources to build the PDP-3, and the one customer who actually bought one was the Air Force’s Cambridge Research Laboratory. DEC arranged to provide them with two PDP-1s instead. In the early 1960s, DEC was approached by Chalk River Nuclear Laboratories in Canada. The lab asked DEC to bid on a special purpose computer, but DEC responded with the offer to build an extremely simple general purpose computer that could accomplish the goals they had in mind. This was the impetus for the PDP-5, and its design was based on the LINC from from MIT’s Lincoln Laboratory. This machine was quite different from DEC’s prior computers. It had 12bit words, a maximum of 32,768 words of memory, and just eight instructions. With so few instructions, just 3 bits of a word were used for op-codes. In its base configuration (with just 1024 words of memory), the PDP-5 was a single cabinet, nineteen inches wide, with 150 printed circuit boards each containing over 900 transistors. It weighed in at 540 pounds. The PDP-5 was first shown to the public on the 11th of August in 1963 at WESCON. Pricing for the PDP-5 started at just $27,000, and DEC produced over 100 of them. For 1963, DEC made a profit of $1,180,197 on revenues of $9,906,968. The PDP-6, released in 1964, was Digital’s first large computer. This machine used a 36bit word just like the big machines from IBM, and unlike most big machines of that era, it had a time sharing system as standard. The PDP-6 did, however, retain 18bit addressing meaning that machine was limited to the equivalent about 1MB of RAM which was implemented using magnetic cores. The exceptions to core memory were the processor registers which were implemented with transistors. The base model was configured with 32,768 words of memory, equivalent to about 144K. The advantage of the 36bit nature of the machine is most readily seen in two 18bit addresses being stored in a single memory location, meaning that two 18bit addresses could be read and written with a single operation. The typical PDP-6 weighed between 1300 and 1700 pounds, and pricing ranged from $120,000 to $300,000. In the highest end configuration, a PDP-6 would have had both a disk drive and several tape drives. With dual DECtape drives, a PDP-6 could support around four users, and with a disk drive one could support around twenty users. Given the expensive price, not many were sold (just 23). Despite the low sales volume, the PDP-6 was one of the most important computers for the history of the industry due to its software. The PDP-6 shipped with an operating system called PDP-6 Monitor that would become TOPS-10 with version 5.01 in 1970. It is from TOPS-10’s command line interface that the design for Gary Kildall’s CP/M would emerge; a legacy that continues with Windows’ use of / for switches and thus \ for paths. If that isn’t enough, it is also on the PDP-6 that MIT’s Incompatible Timesharing System (ITS) would begin its life. Another development in 1964, DEC began redesigning their machines with Flip-Chip modules. These Flip-Chips were the replacement for their previous System Modules, and they cost less. The first versions were four inches long and two and half inches wide. These Flip-Chips allowed system designers to work at a higher level than discrete transistors or diodes (think gates). Over time, these came in varying sizes, used ICs instead of individual transistors, and saw price reductions. The first Flip-Chips had a cost between $350 and $750 in series A (DACs, amplifiers, etc), and a cost between $15 and $57 for series B (logic). The first system to be redesigned was the PDP-4 which was introduced as the PDP-7 in December of 1964 at a price of $72,000. Digital produced something around 120 PDP-7s over time, and this was the machine on which UNIX was written. Memory cycles for this machine were just 1.75µs, and addition took just for 4µs. An original PDP-7 weighed in at 1100 pounds. Units began shipping in November of 1964. Success forced some changes at DEC. Initially, the company didn’t hire folks formally trained or educated in computing, and it didn’t have much structure. Partially, there just weren’t a ton of people with experience in the field, but also the company didn’t have a ton of money. Then, there’s the fact that given the simplicity of DEC’s earliest hardware, there wasn’t much need for incredibly experienced people. So long as a person were generally bright, he/she could be trained on the machines quickly. The earliest hardware was simple enough to be thoroughly understood by a single person, and often with little need for any kind of reference once that understanding were gained. Once the company was successful, they had the money to hire the best and brightest minds in the industry, and they did. By this point, DEC’s reputation for excellence, outstanding value per dollar, and customer focus was building if not firmly established. That DEC would listen to customer needs and tailor machines to those needs was part of that reputation. Yet, internally, DEC was also innovating. In 1964, the company had a bit of a crisis. With large amounts of growth both internally and externally, the various parts of the company weren’t working well together and this led to shipment delays. Profits for 1964 dropped to $900,000 on revenues of $10,909,565. Olsen then restructured the company to have a team of product line managers. Each product line manager was essentially running a company within a company and competed against the others (usually in a friendly manner). Each manager was expected to take full responsibility for the product line under his/her supervision. For non-managerial employees and managers alike, they were encouraged to innovate, encouraged to challenge quotidian ideas, and they were encouraged to keep quality at the center of their work. Unlike most companies of that time, DEC also embraced diversity. People who previously weren’t exactly welcomed in the industry found their places at DEC. The company hired people of all races, both male and female, and even those with learning disabilities. Many DEC employees have stated that their time at Digital was their best experience in the industry. With the versatility, low price, and ease of use offered by DEC’s computers, the company would often sell their machines without any visible branding to other computer vendors such as Intersil. Those company may make some changes or additions and then sell them as their own. The company also sold tape drives, disk drives, terminals, and other peripherals to OEMs, and this had the weird result of DEC at one time being both the largest purchaser of disk drives and the largest seller of disk drives. The second system to get the Flip-Chip treatment was the PDP-5, which was introduced to the world as the PDP-8 on the 22nd of March in 1965 at a price of $18,500. For that price, a customer received a machine capable of 333,000 instructions per second. Over 50,000 PDP-8s were sold, and this is likely due to the simplicity of the instruction set as well as being the first computer available for less than $20,000. As the machine got revisions, that price eventually fell to just $8000. Getting the system built in high volumes at a low cost took some work. DEC studied household appliances and automobiles to get ideas, and Olsen himself went to discount stores and spent hours studying washing machines, dryers, and stoves. In particular, the switch handle idea came from a Maytag dryer and slip-on connectors came from automobiles. The PDP-9 was released in 1966. This was another 18bit machine, and it was capable of roughly double the performance of the PDP-7. This was the first DEC machine to make extensive use of microcode which was implemented in read-only core memory. Microinstructions in the PDP-9 were 36bits wide. This machine had many hardware options among which were multiply/divide, shifting, memory extension control (which provided bank switching), memory management (including a register to set the boundary between protected and un-protected memory), and a DMA controller. It weighed in at 750 pounds, and most installations would have had a paper tape reader, paper tape punch, DECtape for the OS and data storage, and a console teleprinter. Of course, DECtape was not in the base configuration, and other optional peripherals included drum memory, disk, and CRT. The PDP-9 outsold the PDP-7 by quite a margin with 445 units having made it into customer locations. The LINC-8 was first made in 1966 as well, and it was weird. This machine contained both a PDP-8 processor and a LINC processor. While these could not be run simultaneously, one could switch between LINC mode and PDP-8 mode. When the machine was in PDP-8 mode, the LINC processor was halted until the PDP-8 processor wanted something to be handled by the LINC processor. At that point, an interrupt switched the machine to LINC mode to perform the desired action. The reasons for this setup were several; all of the interrupts for either mode were handled exclusively by the PDP-8 processor, the LINC processor provided DMA to the PDP-8 processor, and the processors were extremely different. The LINC is 12bit one’s complement, and the PDP-8 12bit two’s complement. In 1967, the PDP-10 (also known as the DECsystem-10) made it to market running TOPS-10. This was the successor to the PDP-6 and as such was a 36bit machine capable of running programs for the PDP-6. It was capable of the twice the performance of the 6, and it could handle timesharing, batch, and real-time operation. In the final years, PDP-10s were sold as DECSYSTEM-20 and ran TOPS-20. Of course, some of these would run ITS (at MIT), TENEX (at BBN), the CompuServe time-sharing system (CompuServe had some PDP-10s operating until at least 2007), and WAITS (at Stanford) depending upon where they were installed. The PDP-10 sold far better than the 6 and could be found at Universities and research institutions around the world with something like 1500 having been sold. While early PDP-10s were made with Flip-Chips, later models were made with ECL, and still later with TTL and the Am2901. Being both relatively inexpensive and rather powerful, these machines were used extensively in building the early ARPANET. Other notable parts of this machine’s legacy are seen in its use to write Adventure by Will Crowther, Empire by Walter Bright, and Zork by Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling. Of course, there’s also Altair BASIC written by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on a PDP-10 at Harvard. As of 1968, DEC had grown to 2600 employees, had $57,339,400 in revenue, $6,856,690 in profits, and $36,496,876 in assets. Both revenues and employees would nearly double in 1969. The PDP-12 was released in 1969 as the successor to the LINC-8. It weighed in at 600 pounds. It sold decently for a laboratory specific machine with 725 units total being sold over its lifetime. The machine shipped with OS/12 based upon OS/8, and it also shipped with software for data acquisition, mass spectrometry, Fourier analysis, storage management, support for several different peripheral devices, and display. The PDP-12 was shipped with two LINCtape drives, a display, and I/O ports for laboratory equipment interface. Purchasers of a PDP-12 could also take advantage of a two week programming course at DEC’s mill in Maynard, or other sites in Palo Alto, Reading in the UK, Cologne in Germany, or Paris in France. Just as the PDP-12 was a laboratory machine, DEC released the PDP-14 for industrial controls. While it was essentially a programmable logic controller, it could interface with a PDP-8. It was 12bit with 4K words of memory, and the processor had seven 12bit registers. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, DEC’s growth in the market led to some changes. The company began placing manufacturing plants in urban areas and hiring and training local residents. The company expanded manufacturing to Ireland in 1971 and costs were reduced in 1973 when Ireland was admitted to the European Common Market. The PDP-11 had been formally specified by January of 1969. It was a 16bit machine with base RAM of 4K and prices starting at $10,800. It had no dedicated input or output instructions, nor did it have load or store. Instead, the PDP-11 used the move instruction for these purposes. This quirk combined with memory mapped I/O means that data could be moved directly from input device to an output device, or to memory, or to a register. At this machine’s beginning, core memory was used, and by its end, microprocessors and DRAM were standards. The first model released was the PDP-11/20. This machine was implemented with TTL on quad-width, extended length cards (though a few dual width, standard length cards were used as well). It was the first DEC machine to implement the UNIBUS connecting the processor, memory, and peripheral devices (though this was supplanted by the QBUS in later models). This first PDP-11 was the only one in the line to utilize discrete logic rather than microcode. The first 11/20 shipped in June of 1970. It was limited to one-bit shift operations, lacked hardware support for multiplication and division, and didn’t have hardware floating point. If one wanted such capabilities, they were available with the optional Extended Arithmetic Element which would attach to the UNIBUS. The PDP-11 line gained 18bit addressing in 1973 with the 11/40 and 11/45, and 22bit addressing with the 11/70 in 1975. The 11/70 was similar to the 11/45 but with its 22bit addressing could support more memory (up to 4MB). It also had a 2KB cache, and support for high speed storage. AT&T bought quite a number of 11/70s and became DEC’s single largest customer for some time. The PDP-11’s processor was implemented in LSI in the autumn of 1975 as the LSI-11 (four chips), and brought the QBUS with it. This shipped in the PDP-11/03. The very last non-LSI model was the 11/44 in 1979, while the 11/23 of 1979 was the first to use the F-11 which was the second LSI version of the PDP-11’s processor. It was implemented in two chips on one DIP. This included memory management and floating point. The F-11 was superseded by the J-11, a high-performance, CMOS, PDP-11 CPU in two chips on a single DIP. This could optionally be used with the FPJ11 floating point unit and an external cache. The F-11 debuted with the 11/73 and it was clocked at 15MHz. The final PDP-11 models were the 11/93 and the 11/94 in 1990. These were both 22bit machines clocked at 18MHz. The 11/93 used the QBUS and the 11/94 used the UNIBUS. Many different operating systems were available for the PDP-11. From DEC, one could get DOS-11, RSX-11 (real-time, heavily influenced VMS), RSTS/E (time sharing, descendant of RSTS-11, written in BASIC, could execute BASIC or programs [and their environments] written in other languages), RT-11 (somewhat similar to OS/8), or IAS (Interactive Application System, could be time-sharing, multi-user [time-sharing without protection], or real-time; based on RSX-11). Yet, the PDP-11 also had UNIX (first through seventh editions), System III, 2.9 BSD, 2.10 BSD, 2.11 BSD, and many more. A bit more than 600,000 PDP-11s were sold over the machine’s production lifetime. The PDP-11 became, as Olsen described it, a corporate strategy. While they still had their larger machine with the PDP-10, special purpose machines for industrial and research applications, the company’s focus was primarily on the PDP-11. With the PDP-11 on the market, revenues for 1970 hit $135,408,000, income hit $14,400,000, and the employee count reached 5800. The final 18bit machine from DEC was the PDP-15, the successor of the PDP-9. This was the only 18bit machine from DEC to be implemented entirely in TTL, and it shipped with 4K words of memory in the base model 15/10 or with 24K words and two disks in the 15/40. Memory addressing for the PDP-15 was 17bits. It had options for multiply/divide and floating point, with multiply/divide being standard on all models except the base model 15/10. It had memory management with protected and un-protected modes. As with all other DEC machines, there were many peripherals available. The first PDP-15 was delivered in December of 1970, and it would go on to sell roughly 790 units until its discontinuation in 1979. DEC released the VT05 computer terminal in 1970 made with discrete logic. It could display upper-case ASCII at 72 columns and 20 rows, with forward scrolling, and with direct cursor addressing. While this sounds extremely limited (and it was), it was decently speedy at 110 to 2400 baud, and it could accept video input and display it beside text. In 1974, the VT05 was replaced by the VT50, which was itself replaced the following year with the VT52. The VT50 could handle 80 columns and 12, and the VT52 doubled the number of rows to 24. The VT52 also added support for all of the ASCII character set, and it included 32 graphics characters. It had bidirectional scrolling. The VT52’s logic was made with ICs as opposed to discrete logic, and it had far faster communication at up to 9600 baud. DEC entered the Fortune 500 in 1974. In 1975, DEC began work on its successor the PDP-11. Though, this wasn’t a simple redesign effort like previous successor machines. This was a 32bit machine, Star, with a new operating system, Starlet, and it was cluster friendly. The architecture of this new computer was designed by Bill Strecker. This was the VAX (Virtual Address eXtension), and its OS was VMS designed (mostly) by Dave Cutler who’d joined DEC in 1971 at the mill in Maynard. Cutler had worked on RSX-11M for the PDP-11 released November of 1974, and as such, he was a natural fit for this effort. The project leader for VMS was Roger Gourd, and Cutler worked with Dick Hustvedt and Peter Lipman. These projects culminated in their announcement in October of 1977 as the VAX-11/780 and VMS. The processor of the 11/780 was made of TTL, ran at around 5MHz, and could achieve 1 MIPS (million instructions per second). It had a 2K cache. Microcode for the system was loaded at boot from an eight inch floppy disk connected to a PDP-11/03 that also handled both local and remote diagnostics. At launch, the system could have up to 8MB of ECC RAM, but this was later expanded to 128MB. Keeping compatibility with the prior hardware ecosystem, the VAX 11/780 used the Unibus for attaching lower speed peripherals, but to take advantage of the newer architecture it had the Massbus for high speed disk and tape drives. For the clustering feature of the VAX superminicomputer, there was the Computer Interconnect. This was a proprietary network allowing both disk sharing as well as the standup of VMSclusters (originally VAXcluster). Each machine ran its own copy of VMS, but the disk storage, lock manager, and security domain were shared among all cluster members. For proper high availability, any one node in the cluster could fail while the rest were unaffected. VMSclusters weren’t ready until May of 1983, but the feature was planned and its support present in hardware with this original VAX. The VAXen could also support the older DecNet protocol originally found on the PDP-11, and the early VAXen could run user-mode RSX-11M software from the PDP-11 via the RSX Application Migration Executive. This later became an optional add-on with VAX/VMS 4.0 called VAX-11 RSX. VMS has a three layer design. At the bottom there’s the privileged Executive, in the middle there’s the Command Language Interpreter, and at the top there’s the unprivileged utilities and run-time libraries. All unprivileged code accessed functionality of the executive through system services which would be equivalent to system calls in UNIX/Linux. These layers are well fitted to the VAX architecture, and on non-VAX hardware the needed mechanisms were emulated when not present. One absolutely astounding feature of VMS was that its first release had no known bugs. Given the system that the 11/780 was intended to replace, it will surprise approximately zero people to learn that Unix/32V, Ultrix, NetBSD, and OpenBSD were ported to the architecture in short order. Additionally, many different programming languages became available for VAX/VMS quite quickly including Fortran-77, COBOL, Bliss-32, PL/I, BASIC, PASCAL, LISP, C, and many more over the VAX’s lifetime. DEC released the VT100 terminal in August 1978. This terminal was built around an Intel 8080, had 3K RAM, 8K ROM, was capable of 80 columns by 24 rows or 132 by 14, had an 83-key detachable keyboard, bidirectional scrolling, and could support baud rates from 50 to 19,200. This terminal also supported text attributes like blink, bold, and underline. The 100 was followed by more in the line that were either cost reduced or upgraded. Of these, the VT103 was the most interesting. With newer hardware allowing the internals to be reduced in physical size, there was quite a bit of room in the casing. The VT103 used this space to add an 8-slot QBUS backplane and card cage. This allowed the owner to add a small, 16bit, LSI-11 microcomputer with optional DECtape II block-addressable cartridge tape drive to the system. The VT180 took this one step further in 1982 by added a complete 2MHz Z80, 64K RAM, two external 5.25 inch floppy disk drives, and CP/M. DEC’s terminals combined with DECwriter printers helped to make Digital one of the leading peripheral vendors in the industry. The VT100 line of terminals was extremely successful and live on in many terminal emulators today. In October of 1979, DEC opened a new factory in Westminster, thirty miles West of Maynard. The company started transferring workers to this location, and many of them complained about their inability to secure a mortgage from banks in that area. This got back to Ken Olsen who then began discussing the problem with the human resources department. This resulted in the creation of the Digital Federal Credit Union, or DCU, which charged less than the going rate for home loans and payed better interest on savings. This is a strategy that former tenant of the mill in Maynard had used for their employees back in the 1800s when the area had no bank. In 1980, Digital released the VAX-11/750. This was essentially an LSI VAX, and it was available as a rackmount unit, the 11/751. This was fully compatible with the 780 in every way. It could even boot the same disk pack. The primary downside was that it was slightly slower than its predecessor. This was followed in 1982 by the VAX-11/730. This was an even smaller version built using AM2900s. In its base configuration it included an internal disk controller, and it had two tape drives in the chassis for loading microcode. For disk drives, the machine could use an RA60 (205MB removable disk pack) or an RA81 456MB fourteen inch winchester drive. Like the other VAXen, it supported VMSclusters. Still, the target market was small offices, and this really showed with an included calendar, mail client, and wordprocessor. Cutler moved to DEC West in 1981 where he worked on the PRISM project to build a 32bit RISC ISA. In particular, he worked on MICA which was to be the OS for PRISM. This OS was unique in that it required compatibility with both VMS and UNIX, and the hope was to unify DEC’s ULTRIX (a UNIX system), and VMS. PRISM, and MICA with it, was canceled in 1988. By this time, DEC was the second largest computer company after IBM, and IBM had released the PC. While DEC had already ventured into the microcomputer space with their terminals, the company had something else they’d been developing, the Rainbow 100. This computer was first shown at the National Computer Conference in Houston in June of 1982. It contained both a Z80 and an Intel 8088 along with 64K RAM (expandable to 896K). It could use either CPU and then have the other provide some extra functions. For example the Z80 supported the floppy drive, while the 8088 handled video, keyboard, printer, and other peripherals. With those two CPUs, owners of the Rainbow 100 could run either CP/M or MS-DOS (or CP/M-86), but as the “100” implies, this machine could also act as a terminal. If equipped with the NEC-7220 graphics chip the Rainbow 100 could output a resolution up to 800 by 240 with four colors from a palette of 4096. The included floppy disk drive (the RX50) could read and write single-sided 5.25 inch floppies of 409KB. The drive could hold two disks simultaneously but could only access one at a time as the two heads were controlled by a single motor. A floppy in the top slot was inserted face-up, while a floppy in the lower slot was inserted face down. If one opted for the hard disk, it was a winchester style MFM ST-506 compatible drive of either 5MB or 10MB. Other options were a memory expansion, and communications. All Rainbow 100s had serial and parallel; they could display 80 columns by 24 rows or 132 columns by 24 rows, and they shipped with Microsoft BASIC and WordStar. Several other operating systems were ported to the system including UCSD p-System, Concurrent CP/M, VENIX, and QNX. Third party upgrades were available including an 80286 CPU upgrade, a 3.5 inch floppy drive, a clock chip with battery backup, a Navajo language ROM, memory expansions, hard disk controllers, LAN adapters, SCSI adapters, tape drives, and more. While the Rainbow 100 was initially moderately successful, the IBM PC was outselling it by quite a margin. Part of this was the Rainbow 100’s high price at $3245, but there are two far more glaring problems. First, the Rainbow 100 could run MS-DOS but it wasn’t fully compatible with the IBM PC. As a result, an owner might purchase a software package and come home only to find that it wouldn’t run. Second, the Rainbow 100 didn’t include an ISA bus. This made peripheral adapters and other expansion cards far less numerous and far more expensive. In 1983, DEC released the VAX-11/725 which was a repackaged 11/730 with an RC25 disk drive for storage. Alongside this, they released the full feature VAXcluster software and revision to DECnet supporting more than 1000 nodes. The bigger product of the year (in my opinion) was the VT200 series of terminals with the base model being the VT220. The initial price of the VT220 was $1295, and this would get a buyer a terminal based around the Intel 8051 microcontroller, 16K RAM, 24K ROM, 256 bytes of NVRAM. While the entire 200 line was compatible with the VT100, it added internationalization, and the ability to alter the character set. The VT240 added graphics support, and the VT241 added color graphics support. The VT200 series sold well and was extremely influential. The keyboard inspired the IBM Model M’s layout, and many virtual terminal emulators today are made to compatible with the VT200 series. In 1984, DEC brought several different products to market. The first of these was the VAX-11/785 which updated the 780 with modern components and roughly doubled the performance of the machine. The second was the MicroVAX I (code name Seahorse). This was the first computer DEC built with VLSI. The CPU module was made with two chips, the ALU and FPU, while the rest of the chip was made with TTL logic. This machine also implemented the QBUS between the processor and main memory. The MicroVAX I was the slowest VAX ever made. The third product released in 1984 was the VAXstation. This was a graphical workstation built with the MicroVAX I CPU clocked at 4MHz. The original VAXstation ran a proprietary GUI system on VMS that was called the VMS Workstation Software (VWS). The fourth product that year were the VAX-11/784 which was a 780 with four processors. Only four or five of these were made. The fifth that year was ULTRIX-32. This was DEC’s UNIX variant based on 4.2 BSD ported to the 32bit VAX platform. The sixth product of the year was DEC’s Rdb, a relational database management system for VMS. The seventh and final product of 1984 was the VAX 8600 (code name Venus) which was introduced on the 31st of October with shipments starting in March of 1985. The 8600 was the best selling VAX system after it launched. Its processor was clocked at 12.5MHz and implemented in ECL with a 16K cache. Memory was error corrected and could be expanded to 512MB (though the 8600 officially only supported up to 368MB). In 1985, VAX evolution certainly continued with the release of the MicroVAX II and MicroVAX II GPX. The MicroVAX II was a strong improvement over the MicroVAX bringing the system more in line with the original VAX’s performance. The GPX brought graphics support to MicroVAX II. These were also available for standard nineteen inch racks. In 1986, DEC introduced the VAX 8800 family of systems that built upon the success of the 8600. The high-end model was the 8800 with two processors and the VAXBI bus. The CPU was redesigned to be pipelined and support full SMP. There were several lower tier models like the 8700 which had just a single processor, the 8550 which was an 8700 without upgrade capability, and the 8550 which had lower performance. More SKUs in this line launched over time with updated processors in a variety of combinations, and some that were sold as clusters. In September of 1986, the VAXmate was made available. This was an IBM PC/AT compatible machine and was a replacement of the Rainbow 100. Driving this machine was an Intel 80286 CPU clocked at 8MHz, 1MB of RAM, a 1.2MB 5.25 inch floppy disk drive, and thinwire ethernet interface. The machine had the monitor integrated with chassis though it doesn’t give that look, and that monitor was a 14inch CRT of either amber or green phosphor. The VAXmate had an optional expansion box that featured ISA expansion slots and a hard disk of either 20MB or 40MB. While the VAXmate naturally ran MS-DOS, its DOS could be served from a VAX running VMS with network boot. As an interesting bit of information, the software supplied came on three disks with a virtual terminal that was compatible with the VT240, a copy of Windows 1.03, a copy of MS-DOS 3, some applications, and some fonts. While this machine was essentially an IBM AT clone, it wasn’t intended to be used as such. The true intent was for the VAXmate to serve as a terminal for a VAX system such as the MicroVAX II. When being used in this manner, the primary disk was in RAM, and the network drives of the VAX would be seen (usually) as drives starting with H and iterating down the alphabet. These logical drives were actually just subdirectories on the VAX, and this brought about some incompatibility with standard DOS tools like CHKDSK, DISKCOPY, JOIN, LABEL, RECOVER, SUBST, and SYS, but I imagine that this could have had wider implications. The issue here is that these weren’t real drives so attempting to address an absolute sector location would fail. While there were updates to both the MicroVAX and the VAX 8800 line in 1987, the big news that year was the VAXstation 2000 which was essentially a MicroVAX 2000 in a workstation configuration with graphics. It featured a MicroVAX II processor with no cache, up to 14MB of RAM, no expansion bus, but could be fitted with both a floppy drive and a hard disk. It supported VMS and ULTRIX. It was durable, it was popular, and it was reliable. The key thing to note was that this was a response to the rising popularity of UNIX workstations from the likes of Sun Microsystems and Silicon Graphics that were beginning to gain popularity at this time. The 2000 came first, and the 3000 line followed with faster processors, more memory, and more cache. The line didn’t end until a few years after the demise of DEC. At that time, the descendants of the 3000 line (including the 4000 and the 8000) could be had with an NVAX CPU (a CMOS implementation of the VAX processor, 0.75μm, three layers of aluminum interconnect, die size of 16.2 by 14.6 mm) that could be clocked as high as 170.9MHz. In 1988, following the cancellation of PRISM, Cutler began thinking about striking out on his own, but Bill Gates called to recruit Cutler and several others. This group met with Steve Ballmer shortly thereafter. According to Cutler, they quit DEC on Friday and joined Microsoft on Monday. At Microsoft, Cutler and his team built “WNT” (increment each letter by one from VMS), and the similarities between VMS and NT are unmistakable. The VMS Interrupt Priority Level became the Interrupt Request Level, the Asynchronous System Trap became the Asynchronous Procedure Call, a Fork Procedure became a Deferred Procedure Call, while some other terminology was copied verbatim. NT and VMS share similarities in many ways, but unlike VMS, NT processes can contain more than one thread of execution, NT uses access control lists for object security, NT uses its own NTFS, and NT uses the registry (a centralized hierarchical configuration database) allowing the configuration of computers over a network, among many other major differences some of which are ideas Cutler had thought about while working on MICA. When Microsoft released Windows NT, these similarities were noticed. Digital Equipment Corporation threatened litigation against Microsoft over those similarities, and the matter was settled out of court for something around $50 million (around $106 million in 2023) in August of 1995. Additionally, a rather broad alliance between the two companies was formed. Microsoft was obligated to train 1500 DEC employees from DEC’s large services division at no cost to DEC as certified NT engineers, which was more NT engineers than Microsoft itself had at the time. Additionally, Microsoft would build and maintain the Alpha port of Windows NT. As a result of these two things, DEC’s revenues on NT systems would reach roughly $450 million by 1997, and VMS customers were migrated to NT. In 1989, the very last non-microprocessor-based VAX was released, the VAX 9000. It was a true mainframe in all respects. It was fast using ECL, drank electricity as if it were free, generated enough heat to make the devil feel at home, and could hit 125 MFLOPS which would be roughly 120 times the performance of the original VAX. With the optional vector processors added to the machine, this was sold into the supercomputer market as well. Prices ranged from $1.2 to $3.9 million. As the NVAX chip was available by the time the machine went on sale, offering good performance at a far lower price with clustering capability, the VAX 9000 didn’t sell well, and it was discontinued rather quickly. The same year, Digital chose to abandon their proprietary display system, and they adopted X Windows which was released for VMS as DECwindows. In the late 1980s, UNIX workstations with RISC CPUs were competing well against DEC’s offerings. The classic CISC design of the VAX just wasn’t up to the fight. This was the origin of the PRISM and MICA projects mentioned earlier, and as already stated, those were canceled. The response to these rival workstations was the DECstation 3100 released on the 11th of January in 1989. This machine was built around the MIPS R2000 clocked at 16.67MHz, a R2010 floating point coprocessor, and had a data cache of 64K and an instruction cache of 64K. This allowed the system to reach eleven million instructions per second which would be roughly equivalent to a 486DX at 33MHz released in May of the following year. The DECstation 3100 beat the first SparcStation too (albeit by a small margin), and it had around triple the performance available from the VAXstation 3100. The machine could be configured with 4MB to 24MB of RAM, and the graphics system supported a maximum display resolution of 1024 by 864. DECstations provided 10Mbps Ethernet with ThinWire, and a 5MB per second SCSI interface with a 128K buffer for which the machine had standard internal 3.5 inch drive bays. A cost reduced version of the 3100 was released in the summer of 1989 and named the 2100. The architecture was largely the same though the CPU was clocked at 12.5MHz. Later models in this line would ship with high-end graphics including both 2D and 3D acceleration, advanced audio capabilities, and even video conferencing capabilities with picture in picture support. Given that these MIPS-based machines were meant to compete in the UNIX workstation market, VMS was never ported to them. All of these systems ran ULTRIX. These machines were a moderate market success, but they never bested Sun or SGI in that regard. They are historically notable for being the machines on which the Mach microkernel was developed, and the machines on which early NT development took place. On the 10th of January in 1991, something happened at Digital Equipment Corporation that had never happened before. The company announced that it would layoff 3450 employees by the 30th of June. This followed a voluntary severance program that ended on the 31st of December in 1990. The company had hoped that more than 6000 would leave, but only 2550 of their 123,500 strong workforce took that option. The company’s stock had almost been cut in half from a high in 1990 of a little over $95/share to just $52.62/share. The company’s terminals and microcomputers couldn’t seem to continue competing with IBM clones, and the UNIX workstations were proving far more popular than both DEC’s own minicomputers and workstations. In both the commodity market and the workstation market, all of that competition was eroding margins. In the realm of very large machines, IBM’s mainframes were still king, and that market was quickly shrinking. On the 25th of February in 1992, Digital Equipment Corporation announced the DECchip 21064 (21 for 21st century, and 64 for 64bits), code name EV4 (EV for Extended VAX and 4 for the CMOS-4 process). While many sources cite the technology in this CPU originating from PRISM, this is only partially accurate, much of it was totally new. Initial pricing started at $3375 for quantities of 100. This chip is better known by the name it adopted in 1994, Alpha 21064. The DEC Alpha microprocessors were born, and the world was treated to a 64bit RISC chip that bested all of its contemporaries. This first Alpha chip was an in-order, superscalar microprocessor. It had a seven stage integer pipeline and a ten stage floating point pipeline. The initial 21064 was built on a 0.75μm process, could be clocked from 100MHz to 200MHz, had 1.68 million transistors on the die, had a 26.6W TDP, had an 8K instruction cache, 8K datacache, and an optional off-chip cache of 128K to 16MB. The databus could be either 128bit or 64bit. The clock generator, memory management unit, parity and ECC generators and checkers were all on-chip. The chip was packaged in a 431pin PGA that measured 61.72 mm by 61.72 mm. The heatsink attached to package via to two studs that rose from the tungsten heat spreader. The first Alpha systems made available for purchase were the DEC 3000 AXP workstation series, the DEC 4000 AXP server series, and the DEC 7000 and 10000 AXP high-end server series. The workstations were shipped in rather boring, beige, UNIX pizza boxes. For the operating system, customers could choose either OpenVMS AXP or OSF/1 AXP (later Digital UNIX, and still later Tru64). Initial sales for the DECstations were rather slow, and the machines failed to meet expectations in that regard. In April of 1992, Paul Music wrote in PC Week: A major reorganization at DEC has led to a shake-up in top management and raised questions about who will succeed company founder and president Ken Olsen. The 66-year-old Olsen, who founded DEC in 1957, has no clear second-in-command and has shown no signs of stepping down or specifying an heir apparent. Analysts say he has continuously eliminated people who might succeed him, weeding out executives who become too powerful; chief financial officer James Osterhoff recently left DEC after quarreling with Olsen about the firm's financial direction. Many observers are perplexed by the minicomputer company's management moves. Olsen was clearly the force behind recent changes in the firm's structure and is reportedly increasing his involvement in day-to-day operations. He controls DEC's board of directors, and few analysts expect the board to seek his ouster. Yet, with pressure from the board, on the 17th of July in 1992, Olsen announced he’d retire after having led the company for 35 years. At this time, the company had posted declining profits for three years, and three consecutive quarters of losses. The announcement that he’d be retiring shocked many as just the previous month he’d stated: "I have no thoughts of leaving." His retirement would be effective as of the 1st of October of 1992. Robert Palmer took over as CEO with the exit of Olsen, and he promptly restructured the company into nine divisions that reported to him. This reorganization was presented to the board in June of 1993, and DEC had its first profitable quarter. This was short lived as losses continued in 1994. For 1994, the DECstation line became the AlphaStation line, and the DECchip branding was ended in favor of Alpha. The entire line received technological updates. The varying busses of former models were replaced with PCI and ISA, and RAM limits were increased to 512MB. Later that year, Digital released the Multia (later known as the Universal Desktop Box). These were sold as workstations, but they had performance more similar to a desktop of the time. These could utilize either an Alpha or Intel Pentium CPU, and they ran Windows NT. The primary limit to performance was a reduced bus width (to 64bit from 128bit) and low RAM capacity (24MB). The release of the AlphaStations and Multia somewhat shows the direction in which DEC was choosing to go, but any doubt that they were focused on Alpha would soon be dispelled by the sale of Rdb to Oracle, the sale the PDP-11 to Mentec, and the sale of disk technologies to Quantum all in 1994. In August of 1995, the company sold their terminal lines to Boundless Technologies. With new markets opening up in the computing world constantly in the 1990s, Digital wanted to make a low power version of the Alpha. For this effort, the company reached out to Apple who’d been using the ARM CPU in the Newton. Specifically, DEC’s engineers asked if Apple would be interested in a high-performance ARM chip. The company was luke-warm on the idea, but they did say that they might use such a product. DEC then reached out to Advanced RISC Machines and began a collaboration. The result of this was the StrongARM which incorporated technology from both ARM7 and Alpha. Unlike previous chip design work which had taken place at the mill, StrongARM was developed at a design center in Palo Alto, and at another location in Austin, Texas. At the location in Austin, the staff was mostly comprised of folks who’d previously left DEC for Apple and Motorola, but who’d returned for the project. The first result of this effort was the SA-110 announced on the 5th of February in 1996. Clocks for these chips ranged from 100MHz to 233MHz, and these clocks were important considering that the design was scalar, in-order, with a five-stage pipeline, and no branch prediction. Early wins came with the Apple MessagePad 2000 and the Acorn RISC PC. The other big product of 1995 wasn’t a computer at all. Paul Flaherty had been tasked with undertaking a project that would properly showcase the power of the Alpha CPU and the lines of DEC computers that sported them. He was on vacation and had an idea. Upon his return to the office, Michael Burrows (indexer) and Louis Monier (crawler) worked to make that idea a reality. On the 15th of December in 1995, DEC made the AltaVista search engine publicly accessible on the World Wide Web. The search engine ran on two machines named Scooter and Turbo Vista. Scooter had a 20GB hard disk and 1GB of RAM and it did the page fetching/crawling while Turbo Vista had 250GB hard disk and 2GB of RAM and handled the index and web serving. Naturally, these were both Alpha machines. The company took advantage of its head count to test the system with 10,000 employees trying it out prior to launch. While the minicomputer and workstation company might seem out of place on the Web, Digital had registered dec.com in 1985 and digital.com in 1993. Let us not forget, DEC’s wonderful hardware had even powered many of the earliest networks that comprised the early internet. AltaVista was success. The site had approximately 300,000 hits on its first day of public availability; by the end of the year, the count had grown to 19 million requests per day. Two years later this traffic increased to over 80 million per day. In 1997, Digital continued to trim business units. Some of their network software was sold to BEA Systems, their printer lines were sold to GENICOM, and their network business was sold to Cabletron. In May of 1997, Digital Equipment Corporation filed a lawsuit against Intel for the infringement of ten patents DEC held on Alpha technology that were being used in the Pentium line of CPUs. Intel fairly quickly made a counterclaim that DEC was in violation of fourteen patents that Intel held. The two companies reached a settlement on the 27th of October in 1997. First, Intel bought Digital’s semiconductor manufacturing and development operations for $700 million. Second, the two companies agreed to a cross licensing of patents that they each held. Third, Intel got StrongARM (later became XScale). DEC did, however, maintain ownership of Alpha, and they retained the Alpha design team. When all of this concluded, DEC was essentially the Alpha company with a few insignificant PC-like products in its portfolio, and a killer search engine that they didn’t really monetize. On the 26th of January in 1998, Digital Equipment Corporation was sold to Compaq Computer Corporation for $9.6 billion. Compaq struggled after this with a far higher headcount as a result of the acquisition and a large set of products. AltaVista was spun out from Compaq in 1999, it was then bought by the parent company of Lycos. That company was purchased by Overture who was then purchased by Yahoo! in 2003. Alpha was abandoned in favor of Merced, and Compaq itself was bought by Hewlett-Packard in 2002. DEC was a pioneering company that changed the world for the better. Many people cite the failure of the company to quickly pivot to microcomputers as the key to its demise. I disagree. Ken Olsen correctly predicted that the PC clone market was crowded. He never really had an intention to go into that market (according to his own words on the matter). What I believe he failed to see was just how fast the Intel’s microprocessors would advance in their computing power and PC compatibles with them. He wasn’t alone in that failure. All of the minicomputer and workstation vendors (for the most part) made the same error. Even many of the PC clone makers themselves could not withstand the fierce competition in the market. If anything, what I feel doomed DEC was the cancellation of PRISM and MICA and the subsequent loss of talent that followed. DEC lost time, money, and people when they cancelled that project only to resurrect pieces of it later. The other problem for DEC was that the company had grown to be far too large in headcount far too quickly. It’s very difficult to turn 100,000 people around at the same time. To me, DEC was an absolutely amazing company that lost in the competition against the IBM PC clone makers, Intel, and Microsoft. I now have readers from many of the companies whose history I cover, and many of you were present for time periods I cover. A few of you are mentioned by name in my articles.

Title: OpenAI may be trying to wean itself off Nvidia

Like the broader artificial intelligence sector, OpenAI relies on Nvidia’s (NVDA+3.33%) costly training chips to build tools like ChatGPT, but that could change — if OpenAI’s in-house chip design somehow pans out. The AI-software maker is close to finalizing its first design and intends to have Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM-2.17%) (TSMC) fabricate it, according to Reuters. Citing unnamed sources, the news outlet reported Monday that OpenAI intends to send its design to TSMC “in the next few months” and aims to mass-produce an AI-training chip with the fabricator in 2026. If OpenAI’s alternative design works out, the company would be a step closer to weaning itself off Nvidia’s coveted training chips, and in-house alternatives could empower OpenAI to negotiate better deals with suppliers, according to Reuters. Quartz reached out to OpenAI, TSMC, and Nvidia for comment on the report. OpenAI did not immediately respond, while TSMC and Nvidia declined to comment. The initial testing process alone could cost OpenAI tens of millions of dollars — a small price to pay relative to the $5 billion the company reportedly expected to burn in 2024 alone. Much of OpenAI’s expenses go to cloud-computing providers such as Microsoft (MSFT-0.11%). Nvidia’s chips power Microsoft’s AI cloud offerings, and both tech firms have invested in OpenAI. OpenAI is also working with Oracle (ORCL+0.45%) and Softbank (SFTBY-1.06%) on Stargate, a Trump-backed, Musk-bashed project to spend as much as $500 billion on AI data centers. Early in the day, Nvidia was up by more than 3% — to around $133 per share. Microsoft, meanwhile, was up 1.15% — to around $414 per share.

Since eggs have become the new measure of how our economy is doing, it’s worth noting our local Costco is completely out of them, which, if in stock, cost nearly twice as much as they did in December. (Note: It was never about the price of eggs… It’s about racism.)

Title: Disney dumps two DEI programs as investors pressure company to ax more woke initiatives: SEC filing
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/02/10/media/disney-dumps-two-dei-programs-as-investors-pressure-company/
Time Published: 2025-02-10T17:21:23Z

Disney is reportedly pulling back on its diversity, equity and inclusion policies — the latest major company to walk back the woke initiatives amid pressure from activist investors and the Trump administration. The media giant — which saw its bottom line hurt by the battle over Florida’s “Don’t Say Gay” bill — quietly dropped its “Reimagine Tomorrow” program from the DEI section of its 2024 SEC 10-K report, according to a recent regulatory filing The program, which was mentioned in its 2023 report, has a mission statement of “amplifying underrepresented voices and features some of Disney’s DE&I commitments and action,” according to its website. The initiative promised 50% of regular and recurring characters across the Disney universe would come from “underrepresented groups.” The program sparked outrage in 2022 when a company-wide Zoom call was leaked on social media. One Disney executive touted her “not at all secret gay agenda” at the company, while another boasted that the company was ditching the words “ladies, gentlemen, boys, and girls” at its theme parks in order to not alienate transgender children. Although the program’s website is still up and running, Stefan Padfield, director of the Free Enterprise Project for the National Center for Public Policy Research, told Fox News Digital on Monday that its exclusion from the SEC filing could signal change at the Mouse House. “Disney dropping [Reimagine Tomorrow] from their DEI section could mean they’re walking back their DEI investments, or it could signal they’re hiding them,” Padfield said. “Either they recognize that more litigation is coming, or it could be part of a vibe shift.” The company has also dropped its “The Disney Look” appearance guidelines from the DEI section in its SEC filing. The 2023 SEC filing stated that the guidelines were “updated to cultivate a more inclusive environment that encourages and celebrates authentic expressions of belonging among employees.” Disney did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Disney’s DEI policies were in part a reaction to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ “Don’t Say Gay” law, which barred the discussion of gender identity and sexual orientation for kids in public schools. President Trump recently ordered an end to DEI in the federal government and for its contractors, which includes many private companies. Meanwhile, companies are also under pressure from conservative critics who say DEI programs are discriminatory against non-minorities. Corporations such as Meta and John Deere have rolled back their DEI programs, while others like Apple and Costco have pushed back. Google, GM, Intel, Pepsi, Comcast, Philip Morris and others have softened or deleted their DEI language. “Where is your data that shows DEI serves the bottom line?” Padfield asked of companies that still employ DEI measures. “The concern about the scrutiny about these questions is built into this movement we’re seeing across companies. The Trump administration announced they’ll investigate nine companies for their DEI practices, and you’re seeing corporations scramble to not be among those nine,” he said. The DEI battle is also being fought in the courtroom. On Friday, Target was hit with a class-action suit, after shareholders alleged the retail giant misled investors about the risks of its DEI initiatives, which led consumers to boycott and its stock price to tank.

Title: Sen. Ron Wyden is here to stop Elon Musk

The Democrat from Oregon says ‘we’re going to use every tool’ to try and thwart Elon Musk’s DOGE. by Nilay Patel If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. The Democrat from Oregon says ‘we’re going to use every tool’ to try and thwart Elon Musk’s DOGE. by Nilay Patel If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Today, I’m talking with Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat and the senior senator from Oregon. He’s been in the Senate for almost 30 years, which makes him one of the longest-serving members of the institution. He’s also deeply involved in tech policy — in fact, he co-authored Section 230 in 1996. That’s the law that says tech platforms like Facebook, TikTok, and YouTube aren’t generally liable for what their users post, making it the law that basically allows the modern social media internet we have today to even exist. We scheduled this interview with Sen. Wyden a while ago — he’s got a new book out called It Takes Chutzpah: How to Fight Fearlessly for Progressive Change, and it’s a combination memoir and call to action for young people to take part in politics. Wyden was going to come on and talk about that book. But recent events made it vastly more important to talk about the state of our federal government and, specifically, what Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) are doing as they seize power in various federal agencies. DOGE has some level of access in the Treasury Department and now has its sights set on the Labor and Education departments, too. Numerous agencies have had their funding frozen, with workers locked out and told to resign or put on leave, all while lawsuits are being filed and courts are telling the administration to hold on. It is utter chaos, and it’s not slowing down. Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here! So I asked Sen. Wyden as bluntly as I could: What the fuck is even going on? And can Congress and the courts even keep up with it? Wyden did not mince words here; he called it a coup. You’ll hear us get into the mechanisms Musk has used to seize power in the government and why it feels like any attempts to slow this down feel so flat-footed. We also discuss whether we can trust anything these people say — Wyden basically calls bullshit on virtually every promise and declaration coming out of DOGE, especially around how much access its staffers have to sensitive data and systems. It’s the story of the moment and we dove into it. But if not for DOGE and its associated chaos, the biggest tech policy story of the moment would be TikTok, which was legally banned by an act of Congress and then upheld by the Supreme Court. But enforcement of that ban was paused for 75 days by President Donald Trump so the company could figure out how to sell itself. Right now, it’s just in a legal gray area, and that clock is ticking. So I asked Sen. Wyden, who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, what’s going on with that ban and if Trump can really just keep delaying enforcement of the law, which is also not a great legal situation. Wyden seems to think a deal can get done, and I did my best to get any hints about who might buy it. There’s a lot more in this one, including some discussion of our networks themselves and Trump’s newly censorious Federal Communications Commission, but it’s probably best to just get into it. If you pay attention, you’ll notice that Sen. Wyden manages to seamlessly plug his new book throughout this episode. Okay, Sen. Ron Wyden. Here we go. This transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Sen. Ron Wyden, welcome to Decoder. Hey, thanks for having me again. Thank you for being on. There’s an awful lot to talk about, senator. You have a new book. There are an escalating series of catastrophes in the government. There’s TikTok to talk about. It’s still banned, but unbanned in a liminal state. I want to ask you about that. I was listening to our audience, and I was talking to our staff. Can I ask you the first question in just the bluntest way that I can think of? Can I have your permission for that? Permission granted, bluntness. All right. Senator, what the fuck is going on? That is the question of the hour. It’s almost impossible to divine an answer because it moves minute to minute. Donald Trump essentially governs by whim. He gets up and out of nowhere, he will put our whole economy in play with a really colossally stupid approach to tariffs — Tariffs that he has lied nonstop to the American people about for well over a year. He always tells them that foreigners will pay the tariff. That’s factually wrong. All of the people who are listening to your program, the fans of the good work you all do, they pay the tariffs. So, this weekend was just perpetual bedlam, and foreign leaders were basically laughing at us. They were making fake promises. They knew that Trump just wanted to be able to get some kind of headline. I’m sure we’ll talk about other aspects of the bizarre nature of these times, but you probably know that last Friday, I blew the whistle — as a result of getting input from whistleblowers — that the Secretary of Treasury had signed off on giving Elon Musk access to the federal payments program, which has enormous implications for hacking, abuse, and violations of privacy. The list could go on and on. So, that’s just a little bit of the last few days. Let’s start there. Again, just hearing from our audience, our listeners, and readers of The Verge, there is a sense that what is happening right now is Donald Trump is sitting in the White House, signing executive orders that may or may not be legal, may or may not have impact, may or may not mean anything at all, talking about building hotels in Gaza. And that is all a distraction from Elon Musk and DOGE taking over the government. We’re all the way at “is this a coup?” I really want to start there. Is that where you’re at? Do you think that there’s a coup going on? I’m very troubled by the types of policies they are pursuing, that when you add them up, look and feel like a coup. The reality is we are working very hard to derail them at various steps. Let me give you a couple of examples. Last week, Donald Trump basically undertook a kind of freeze of the budget, and he wanted to do it unilaterally. There was a lot of back and forth about what authority he might possibly have. We knew there wasn’t any, but we heard him out. Then we went to court, we won, and he had to drop it. Let me give you a small snapshot of the kind of work I do. My background is working with senior citizens. I was the director of the Gray Panthers for about seven years before I got elected to Congress. So, during the freeze, I found out that the Medicaid portals, which they have in all states, were essentially off. They weren’t available for the senior citizens and the disabled to get information about their medicine, nursing homes, and the like. So, I went online immediately, and said that the whistleblowers, which were truthful, had told me about the tremendous problems being caused for the vulnerable, seniors, and the like, and that it was important for citizens to get in touch with their elected officials, community groups, and organizations and talk about why this was so unfair. Nobody voted to cause harm and discomfort to seniors and the disabled. And there was this outpouring of calls and letters. Within about three hours, the Trump people were backpedaling. By late at night, they said that it would all be fixed the next day. This is just a small snapshot from one day, but people mobilized. The whistleblowers that I work with, particularly on senior citizen issues, came through. This was something where Trump and Musk were stopped cold as they tried to abuse the federal budget. It’s a small snapshot, but it’s the kind of thing that I tried to help with. If I were to embrace it in a sentence, apropos of what the hell is going on here: Trump and Musk are ignoring the checks and balances that are the foundation of our republic. And for all practical purposes, I’d call that a coup. When you think about the mechanism that you just laid out, you heard about something that was happening that was bad because of a policy that was hastily rolled out, you mobilized some attention, there was a swarm of negative feedback for the policy, and eventually, the administration backed down. Maybe it’s fixed, maybe it’s not. This is an open question. Programs are still being unfunded, right? I will tell you on this point, we check every day to make sure that seniors can get their Medicaid, their medicine, and access to nursing home information. But your general point is correct. There’s still a flood of abuses in a whole variety of programs across the government. Can that mechanism of “I need to blow the whistle, then maybe a flood of outrage that’ll fix it, or maybe we’ll file a lawsuit and our courts will fix it” keep up with the pace and scale of the chaos happening right now? We’re going to use every possible tool: court actions, legislative actions, whistleblowers, the bully pulpit. We’re going to use it all. We are still trying to find our way through the array of remedies that we have. When my wife agreed to marry me. She said, “You aren’t a real lawyer. You worked with the Gray Panthers. So, I’ll marry you because you’re not a real lawyer.” We’re now looking through all of the legal tools to make sure that we can protect our rights. But it’s not going to be a walk in the park. In some of these areas, like with the federal payments, nobody ever even thought of doing what Trump is doing, which is why it’s so important that we stop him. Let’s talk about that for a second. Do you know how much access Elon Musk has to the overall federal government right now? Has that been quantified for you or is it just ever increasing because it’s chaos? We believe that it’s ever increasing because to a great extent, Mr. Musk tells us that it is increasing. There was a big story that there wasn’t much being done, just general information. I got asked by the press about it late last night, and I said, “You got to be kidding me. Just look at all the stuff that he claims he is doing.” The first thing he went after was a charity. It didn’t have anything to do with waste, fraud, and abuse. I believe that we will move quickly in the days ahead to build more tools for a legal strike approach. We’re talking about that as members of a Democratic caucus. I’ve been tasked particularly with promoting privacy for those concerned that their data would be peddled hither and yon in the payments system. I can tell you that from a privacy standpoint, giving out people’s home addresses and the like, this will be a horror show. There’s a big question right now over whether Musk and his team’s access to that system is read-only or if they have the ability to write code. They have said it’s read-only. There’s some reporting that says they have the ability to write code. Do you know if it’s read-only? I believe that this is data that’s being abused now. Part of this is also semantics. I’m not taking anything off the table in terms of what they’re doing. They can write code. There’s no question about that. So, you think this argument over whether or not it’s read-only is a semantic distraction? That they do have full access to the system? Correct. There is no question that this description is designed to lull people into thinking that Elon Musk is not doing what he tells people he’s doing. I mean, he tells people that he is doing all these things, and then they put out these cover-up stories about how he’s not really doing it. We have a very technical audience. They’re very worried that we have increased the surface area for cyberattacks– No question about it! Let me save you some time. No question about it! Have you heard this from our intelligence agencies? Is this something Congress is worried about? I am on the [Senate] Intelligence Committee, so I can’t say anything about that. Is the Trump administration broadly being responsive to these concerns? Because we are at risk of cyberattacks. It’s a pretty bipartisan concern. No, the Trump people aren’t telling us anything about anything. Do you think they know what Elon is doing fully? You asked me if Trump just sits in the office and issues executive orders. I think that’s largely what’s going on. I’m sure they have some conversations, but I don’t get the feeling that there are any checks and balances on Elon. That’s for sure. There’s a weird gap in every Trump administration. I think it’s even weirder here in Trump 2.0 where Republican officials will not criticize the president in public. Are they understanding or aware of the scale of the problem in private when you talk to them? They’re saying very little in the consideration of the Robert F. Kennedy Jr. nomination. For example, yesterday I brought up that our committee, the Senate Finance Committee, had passed a bipartisan measure to rein in these pharmaceutical benefit managers (PBMs) that are ripping off seniors, taxpayers, and people of all ages purchasing medicine. I pointed out that Medicare and Medicaid are under the jurisdiction of our committee and are subject to the kind of abuses that could happen with Musk and the federal payments. And they looked up. It was clear that what I said was registering them. I said, “This is important. This is something all of you have voted for.” But they’re not speaking out. In fact, yesterday, there was apparently some kind of Republican show trial where they basically all lined up and said, “Nothing to see here.” Do you think that holds? Let me put it this way. There’s no way this will be something they can just continue to stonewall. Let me give you an example. I announced five days ago that the Secretary of Treasury had given the keys to the kingdom, so to speak. Yesterday there were thousands and thousands of Americans outside the Treasury Dept. speaking out against these practices. Something like 30 members of Congress addressed this, making it clear that we were going to keep at it until we secured the protections that our citizens deserve. That happened all within five days. I give great credit to the whistleblowers. We heard a rumor that there was some activity going on with the Treasury payments, and the whistleblowers were the ones who specifically told me that Scott Bessent had signed off on giving the keys to Musk. That set of whistleblowers is largely the federal workforce, which is appalled. They’re filing their own actions from their unions as private citizens — just worker protection lawsuits. They’ve also all been told to quit their jobs, right? They’ve received these letters that say, “You should resign.” Musk famously used “fork in the road,” which is from a letter he sent when he took over Twitter. That may or may not be legal. There’s some big questions around that. Have you been hearing from that constituency? Yeah, they’d like some answers about it. You can hear the headline, “Oh, we’ll buy you out. We’ll give you all these opportunities to make a transition.” But most of the experience that the federal workforce has had with Trump — and it goes to the first administration — has not exactly been confidence building. They’d like more details about how they and their families will be affected. This is not just their current and future income, but making sure that the benefits they’ve accrued get treated fairly. What advice would you give to those workers that have received this offer? Proceed with great caution. Do you think that’s a farce as well? Do you think this is just a cover for mass layoffs? Is that something you’re worried about? Yeah! I don’t trust any of this stuff. I don’t want to sound like the old-fashioned version of a broken record, but I don’t trust any of this stuff. Often you go to these meetings and they act like they’re on the level, and then they go and do everything they want. That was the first administration, so I don’t trust any of this. When it sounds appealing and you can’t get specific answers, that ought to be a wake-up call to make sure you check. The law limits his ability to make mass layoffs, so that’s a big part of the debate too. We’re talking on a Wednesday. We usually publish Decoder interviews on Mondays. Usually, that’s fine, right? There’s two business days between us talking and publishing the conversation. Usually, not a lot happens in two days. You can be sure that a lot’s going to happen tomorrow, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Tomorrow, we have a hearing on international trade. I described some of the bizarre practices that they’ve pursued in this space, like how they keep saying that the foreigners are going to pay the tariffs but it’s going to be your listeners instead. So you bet, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, there’s no days off here with the Trump whims, as I call them. The specific question I had there involves Elon tweeting, “I work on the weekends when the other team is not in the field.” The other team that he’s describing is the federal workforce, so that is already problematic. But Congress goes into recess. People leave town on the weekends. Are you and the Democrats ready to be here all weekend to see what he’s up to? They’re making a big deal out of saying they want to work around the clock. Look, I told you that I have this book, It Takes Chutzpah. I’ve been using some of the lessons in It Takes Chutzpah all week to try and tackle the Trump administration. I was flying across the country and taking red eyes to make sure I didn’t miss a minute in the effort to blow the whistle. That was what we were doing late on Friday night, in terms of Musk being given the keys to the Treasury payments. I know the Republicans are leaving town this weekend, so they managed to find ways to set an agenda that’s favorable to them. Has the DOGE team been responsive to you or other Democrats at all throughout this period? Absolutely not. I know no one who’s being briefed on the Democratic side consistently. At all, really. Is there a way for you to get that insight as a member of Congress? We’re continuing, for example, to follow up with individuals who used to work at the Treasury and tap them for their knowledge. That’s been very helpful. Obviously, I can’t get into that. Are you planning to find a way to hold hearings on any of the committees you’re on or call Elon as a witness on any of the committees you’re on? We’re going to use every tool to excavate the information that the American people deserve. This is one of the most important issues I’ve tackled in my time in public service. It’s actually one of the first rules of Chutzpah that I spell out: “if you want to make a difference, you have to make some noise.” We’re making plenty of noise right now. We just have to keep following through until we get the job done. One of the weirder aspects with Elon Musk in all of this is that he owns a communications platform, the preferred communication platform of many members of government. Is that a problem, that he can command attention, that he can run that algorithm any way he wishes? Do you think you have to go somewhere else? There are certainly questions with respect to how he runs his operations, and there’s certainly some questions involving China as well. We’ll have some more to say about that before long. You are famously one of the authors of Section 230, which protects service providers from liability for the content their users post. Elon is the service provider. He’s also the user that is posting the content. Do you have any newer thoughts about Section 230 in all this mix? Do you think it’s doing the job the way it’s intended for it to be working? I’ve said this on your show, but I’ve always felt that the big guys — of which Elon is about the biggest — always have the biggest checking account to be able to buy what they want. Elon Musk just bought a presidential campaign. He basically was the big giver. Section 230, as you and I have talked about, is all about making sure there’s a voice for the little guy: the #MeToo [movement], Black Lives Matter, the people who probably couldn’t get a message out without what Section 230 involves. I think that Section 230 continues to be an immensely valuable tool for the person who doesn’t have a political action committee, doesn’t have power, doesn’t have a deep checkbook. We’re going to have a problem reining in the Elon Musks no matter what because they can buy the kind of government they want… at least until we get rid of things like Citizens United. The other rich guy in the mix this time is Mark Zuckerberg, who also owns several large communications platforms. He’s notably changing his moderation standards to favor the Trump administration’s desires. He’s allowing more hate speech, particularly against trans people, on his platform. That’s something that Section 230 protects, right? That platforms can moderate however they want. Ideally, you have some competition for moderation standards to push and pull and give people places to go, but we don’t really see that today, right? We see sort of a herd mentality. There’s some competition. Anybody can sue Elon right now. He posts lies himself. Section 230 protects Elon’s competitors against Trump’s FCC. There are protections, but the bottom line is that when you have somebody as rich as Musk, who literally bought a presidential campaign, you’ve got to use every tool you got, and a lot of them are not Section 230. There’s another platform in the mix that seemed very relevant during the presidential campaign, TikTok. It was banned, the law passed, the Supreme Court upheld it, and Trump paused enforcement of it. Do you think that Trump’s enforcement pause on TikTok is legal? Is that just him pushing his authority some more? I don’t think it’s legal, but here’s what I think this debate is all about. The reality is that from day one I had the same position, unlike Donald Trump. Donald Trump was against it, and now he’s for it. I always said it would be a good thing to have an American company run TikTok and have them tightly vetted. That would, for example, have limited [former Treasury Secretary] Steve Mnuchin and others who talked about getting access to it. I’m still in favor of that as a policy issue. The question now is what the courts are going to say given that there’s been an act of Congress, but I have not changed my preference once since the very beginning. What were the problems with TikTok under ByteDance that required that original ban-or-sell law? I’m on the Intelligence Committee, and the issue is the closeness to the Chinese government. That was a national security issue. There’s a lot of young people today who would say, “Sure, but then, Elon Musk is going to buy it and we see what he did to X. That is as much of a national security problem today as the Chinese government owning the algorithm.” Musk could not pass the Ron Wyden test because you would have to have a reputable American buyer who’d been thoroughly vetted. I don’t think Musk, with all his China connections, could pass the test that I’ve described. Have you heard about any buyers for TikTok so far? Rumors, but nothing that I’m going to splay out in front of a national radio audience. The reality is Trump, as he usually does, just governs by whim. He starts off by saying, “TikTok is bad.” Then he learns that there are a bunch of young people who like it, and suddenly, he’s trying all of these exotic ways to deal with it. I said from the very beginning that my first choice was to have an American buyer who could pass rigorous vetting to show that they were independent and would meet public interest standards. I don’t think Trump’s interested much in that. In fact, you’d think that at some point, he’s just going to figure out a way to hotwire a deal where he sells TikTok, in some way, to Musk directly. And if he does, that’d be about the most corrupt example I could find. That vetting process is not contemplated in the bill, right? It’s an interagency process. Yeah, this would take extra work to lock it in place, but that’s been my position from the beginning. The reason I’m focused on this is that I see a lot of danger of algorithmic ownership. You see how Musk has managed to distort the conversation on X because he owns that algorithm. I don’t know how changing the content moderation standards on Facebook and Instagram will play out, but my expectation is a lot of minority and queer creators are going to face a lot more harassment on those platforms because the rules have been changed. The algorithm will allow more things to happen. If the danger of TikTok is, the algorithm is owned by somebody– Hey, can I just make one point I think I may have misstepped on? I am not for the ban. I am for finding a way to get this right with an American buyer. Right. I guess my question is if divestiture was required due to Chinese ownership of the algorithm, which would run counter to US interests, do you think that having some amount of algorithmic transparency or privacy protections would solve that problem with American buyers as well? From our audience, what I hear is that all you really need is algorithmic transparency, and then, China should be able to do whatever it wants. Not only do you need algorithm transparency, you got a guy who’s authored a bill that moves in that direction called the Algorithmic Accountability Act, my legislation. Under a Trump administration with this Congress, do you think that will go anywhere? We’ll see. A lot of people now understand that algorithms are pretty complicated, but when you talk about protecting people’s education, healthcare, and jobs, they get interested. Sure. Trump gave 75 days, which is just a number he apparently made up, and if we hit the 75 days and he says, “I’m going to extend it again,” do you think there will be litigation, at that point, about whether the law is actually in effect? Hard to say. Would you support that? We can’t just keep indefinitely postponed enforcement of a law? I think I’ve described the path to get this done, and I’m going to keep working for that. What do you say to TikTok creators right now who don’t know if their businesses will last another 50 days? I’d tell them I’m busting my chops to get them something resembling an American buyer who’s been carefully vetted and protects their interests and all American interests. Do you think Microsoft is a good buyer? For the audio listener, Sen. Wyden looked away first before he began answering that question. Put me down as pretty dubious, but we’ll see. All right. What about Oracle? No. All right. What about Frank McCourt’s Project Liberty? No. No, across the board. Right. I think we ought to bag it on these kinds of folks. I’m just curious. Okay. Amazon? I’m just not going to get into a lineup evaluation batter by batter. In the tech world, this is everyone’s parlor game beyond “does Elon run the government.” Those are the two things everyone talks about at the parties I go to. So I’m just curious. It has to be done. The clock is running out. I think we got pretty far down the road in terms of Elon running the government and what I’m going to try to do to stop him. We probably have a ways to go in terms of TikTok, but I think I’ve spelled out what I think ought to be done. At least it’s consistent from day one. Last question on TikTok, and I promise I’ll move on to the FCC because I’m very curious for your opinion there as well. The clock is running, right? There’s only 50, 60 more days. Do you think the deal can be made in time? Yeah, but you’re really going to have to hustle to get the right kind of parties and go through the process. But yes, it’s doable. Let’s talk about the FCC again. You are a First Amendment advocate. You have said to me on this show, to people on other shows, that Section 230, which you co-authored, is really about the First Amendment, and most people’s problems with 230 are really about First Amendment-protected speech. The First Amendment, from my point of view, is under the greatest full-frontal attack I’ve ever encountered as a journalist. Could not agree more. It is bizarre to me. It’s particularly bizarre because it’s wrapped up in the language of free speech. In particular, that language comes from new FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, who is attacking CBS, NBC, ABC, and radio stations about how they’re using their spectrum and threatening to take that spectrum away. Is Congress paying attention to this? It feels like a sideshow, but to me, this is the most overt government speech regulation I’ve ever seen. It’s not getting a lot of attention in Congress, but I’m doing everything I can to light the place up around it because I share your view that a big chunk of what the Trump crowd and the far-right want to do is act in the name of free speech. They make all these proclamations about how they’re about free speech, but they’re trying to do everything possible to deny the voices they don’t agree with. Have you spoken to the chairman about the FCC? He put out a blog post today saying that he’s worried about TV commercials that are too loud, which sounds like it’s straight out of the 80s. At the same time, he’s opening inquiries into CBS News. Have you spoken to him? Have you pushed anything? I have not since his appointment, but it’s very predictable. They find something to try and make sound relevant, but it is completely irrelevant to the big question. That makes it less likely the public’s going to pick up on the big question. I’ve had 1,103 town hall meetings, and you can read about them in It Takes Chutzpah. They’re open to all, and I don’t give any speeches. I just show up and say, “For the next 90 minutes you can say your peace. Ask me any kind of question.” It is, to me, my vision of the First Amendment. My dad was a journalist and an author. Right next to me is one of his books on the Bay of Pigs, with a picture of Fidel Castro next to my dad in the book. The caption is “Peter Wyden knows more about it than we do,” coming from Castro. So, I’m a journalist kid, and I think the Founding Fathers, who said that a free press was more important than government, got it right. And I believe that. Normally you would see these big companies look at an FCC (particularly a 2025 FCC) complaining about news distortion over their broadcast spectrum, and they would just bat it away, right? They would send the lawyers, the lawyers would fight, and they would bat it away. Meta was sued by Trump himself for banning Trump while he was president, saying that was somehow a state action. Very confusing. Meta settled this case and agreed to pay Trump $25 million for his library. It seems like CBS is going to end up settling the 60 Minutes case. Hey, let me give you the real– But I’m just asking, the big companies are caving on the First Amendment. They’re the ones that should be fighting. They are caving like crazy, and nobody has caved more than Mark Zuckerberg. So Zuckerberg goes to Mar-a-Lago, and he tells Trump what he wants to hear. There aren’t going to be any fact-checkers. “Okay, Donald, just what you wanted. No fact-checkers.” He scores some points with Trump. My guess is that seeing how this was successful for Zuckerberg, a lot of the other big players are going to go down to Mar-a-Lago and look for favors also. In the process, what’s going to happen is that we’re going to re-consolidate big communications and have even fewer small voices than we had before the internet came into being. We ought to be protecting those small voices. What Zuckerberg is now a part of is doing more to help the big voices, and in effect, push the little guys out of communications. That visit by Zuckerberg to Mar-a-Lago and what he did with the fact-checkers was a god awful thing to do for the future of communications. But if Zuckerberg caves, Disney caves, and Shari Redstone caves because she wants to sell Paramount to Skydance so she rolls with the CBS lawsuit. No one shows up in court and says, “Actually, these threats violate the First Amendment.” Don’t we just lose the First Amendment? Doesn’t the pressure just work? How do you push back? We’ll have to find ways to crank up the pressure, and I’m going to do that. You have people like the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) that might step in, or other kinds of groups. ACLU. The ACLU, EFF, Ron Wyden, and those are your three. Sign me up. The argument I’ve heard from the other side — I’m not saying I agree with it, but I’ve heard it and I understand where it comes from — is that these are mercenary moves. Meta spending its time and energy fighting a First Amendment lawsuit instead of just paying the money runs the risk of them losing, right? It’s worse for Meta to roll into courts — especially all the way up to the Supreme Court, which is 6-3 conservative — and lose a First Amendment lawsuit than to just pay the money and leave the law effectively where it is, even if the norms change. Do you buy that argument? No. I think that both of them are harmful, and I think Zuckerberg is looking at buying whatever influence he possibly can because he sees it works. It’s not that complicated. Write big checks and you get influence with Trump. Carr is now targeting NPR and PBS. He’s saying that they’re technically running ads by asking for viewer support even though they’re publicly funded, and that he should look into their content. Is there a way for us to try to protect NPR or PBS? The best way to do it is by statute, and we’ll see if any of these rural Republicans whose farmers really like those services in the morning are going to stand up for them. What we’re describing is continued good business for the big guys, and they’re doing all the things possible to run out their competition. That includes virtually everything you can see. I’m trying to find new ways to get voices for people who don’t have power and clout join with a Republican trying to get more streaming services. So we’re busy looking for all the options, like getting C-SPAN out and streaming. You’re talking about rural farmers. You spoke earlier in the show about the outcry from people and Republicans backing down. Are you seeing the policy hit on some of these Republican constituents actually driving change? Are you able to reach those populations? I think a lot of people are worried that they’re fully captured by whatever TikTok right-wing influencer they see. It’s very early. I gave you some examples where we had some effect, but let me give you the bottom line here. I think very rarely does political change start in Washington, D.C. and then trickle down. I believe it’s almost always in the exact opposite direction. When people at home get concerned about access to communications they care about and whether they’re getting clobbered by tariffs, they go to their elected officials. They’ll see them in a grocery store, they’ll see them at the gas station, they’ll see them someplace and say, “What the hell are you doing? I’m getting clobbered on that.” And you end up making change. It’s a grassroots, juggernaut setting in that really changes things. I probably use that as much as any legislator. The way we were the architect of the PIPA-SOPA movement when all the power, all the money, was out trying to redesign the internet for the big guys. I organized a lot of grassroots groups, and [Sen.] Harry Reid set a date for a vote, and suddenly, 15 million texts and emails came in, and we beat all the money. You’re saying, “Do you see all of this happening yet?” When I was with the activists yesterday at the Treasury talking about trying to rein in Musk, I said, “This is really stunning.” This is less than five full days after I blew the whistle on the problem. And look, we got thousands of people and 30 legislators in the streets. So put me down as continuing to believe that citizens who mobilize can make a difference. That’s what I describe in the book. The book, for example, gives 12 rules, “Ron’s 12 Rules of Chutzpah,” that describe not just how people are looking at past examples, but how you can use the rules outlined in the book to make a difference. That was the first rule that we used yesterday: fight bad things, make a difference and speak out for good things, and above all, make noise. The book is really about pushing for progressive political change. You have a history of doing that. I think the question on everyone’s mind right now is when the other side doesn’t seem to care, and you can’t reach their constituents because they own the media platforms and their algorithms are driving all kinds of views that honestly just dismiss any concerns or turn the Democrats or any opposition at all into cartoon characters, how do you drive that kind of grassroots change? You have a lot of people who voted against their own interests here. They voted for cheaper egg prices and they’re getting Trump saying they’ll understand when terrorists drive prices up. Yeah, but they’re also catching up in a couple of weeks. Musk’s popularity numbers are really low. They’re finding out that Donald Trump tells them, “I am going to lower the prices of your groceries” — he said that point-blank — and then, he puts up a white flag of surrender a couple of weeks later and says, “Nope. Can’t do anything about it.” We’re going to build every single day between now and 2026 as many wins on the issues and matters people care about. It’s not sitting around and waiting. When we did that during the first term, we gained a few seats at the midterm. Two years later, we beat them all together. This is not going to be an easy walk in the park, but I’ve been part of efforts where I was able to beat incredible odds, which is what chutzpah is about. Chutzpah is about being bold, taking on big odds, and reaching out and finding people with all points of view. That’s what we’re going to be doing. Can you do that when you don’t own the communications networks? Just to boil the question down. Elon Musk owns Starlink in a world where– I’m talking to you, and you guys get the message. That’s true. You guys get the message out, and this guy’s working to make these changes that we’re talking about. He’s got a book that tells you how you can do more of it. There you go. I hate to hammer on it, but you can see the bigger picture. You have a Brendan Carr at the FCC putting pressure on legacy broadcast media. You have a Mark Zuckerberg and an Elon Musk telling their algorithms what to do, what kind of media to disseminate, and what’s acceptable speech and not. You have a TikTok sale in the offing that could go to a Trump loyalist. Is there an alternative media? Do you look at Bluesky and say, “Okay, decentralize social media. Provide a necessary check.” I’m on Bluesky. I love it. But if you want somebody who’s just going to say, “All I’m going to do all day is hang crepe because it’s hopeless,” I’m the wrong guy. I’m a 29-year-old Jewish kid who wanted to play in the NBA. That was a ridiculous idea. I got a scholarship, but I couldn’t get that dream, and I ended up being one of the youngest people elected to Congress by beating an incumbent. Guess who else did that not very long ago? [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez], again, beating incredible odds. So, you’re talking about ways where you can really make a difference and beat the odds. Frankly, it takes a lot of chutzpah to do it. People say it’s hard to beat the powerful and the money, but I just gave you some examples of doing it. There’s a big split right now in the tech community. You have a lot of regular workers at the big tech companies who are horrified at what’s happening, and then you have their bosses who all showed up, sat at the inauguration, and are trying to get various things out of the Trump administration. As you said, I think they realize they can just write checks and get what they want. But their interests are not aligned. I don’t think Tim Cook’s interests and Mark Zuckerberg’s interests are aligned. I don’t even think they like each other. I don’t know if Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk like each other. I think they’re pretty ferociously competitive about their rockets and general cowboy demeanors. Is that a split that you see that can be exploited for political gain here? That the interests of tech, which has now taken over, are not actually aligned? If you look at the chutzpah rule, you say you’ll work with anybody regardless of political philosophy to get the public interest. I think that if Trump equals chaos, we’ve got more to work with than people think. Have you heard from that constituency at all? From the big tech companies? What I have heard from their executives, very directly, is that they thought the Biden administration hated them, that they could not work with Biden at all. They couldn’t even get the meetings they needed or meetings with the right people. What they generally got was, “We’re going to break you up,” and then there were a lot of lawsuits aimed at breaking them up. What you might still get out of the Trump administration is, “We’ll break you up, but you might be able to buy your way out of it.” Let me tell you what I think a bunch of these big tech companies are saying. Yes, they didn’t like the policies of the Biden administration, but they’re seeing more and more particularly young people — you see it in schools, on TikTok, and the like — who want to have their own businesses. They want to be entrepreneurs. They want to be the future. I think that big businesses who don’t pay attention to the small guys that have ideas and creative approaches are making a mistake because that’s who I’m throwing in with. I’m throwing in with the little guys because I think they can make a big, big difference. Biden was a big opponent of mine in technology for 30 years. I don’t think that the Democratic Party is about being for Big Tech. I think being for small business is going to be the future of the Democratic Party. In fact, small businesses and users. The two people that I fought for in the tech space are going to be my vision for the Democratic Party going forward. You can count on that. Is there any lesson you took away from DeepSeek? The big tech companies are spending or want to spend enormous amounts of money on data centers, on energy– The real message is how important open source is. Open source communications have got to be in the ballgame. I’ve continued to push them through all my time in public life, and it’s even more important today than it was. The other lesson there is that restricting chips to China didn’t work. The Chinese companies were able to take somewhat underpowered Nvidia chips, over-optimize them, and then outcompete. Because I think we’re wrapping up pretty soon, let me just mention that the Chinese are engaged in all kinds of abusive practices. Salt Typhoon, for example. The phone companies were supposed to have secured the phones 20 years ago, and I’ve been screaming my lungs out about it. I’ll be introducing another bill on this because when this latest set of breaches took place, a bunch of conservatives in the Congress said, “This is the biggest hack in American history.” Well, I’m going to make sure that we get another debate on this whole set of abuses. My bill will be going in soon. Salt Typhoon didn’t collect a lot of attention, but this is a massive breach of the American phone system. Stunning breach! The Biden administration was telling people to use secure and encrypted communications. Why do you think that went so unnoticed? I think that a bunch of the big companies you mentioned, like Microsoft, all said that they were taking care of things and tried to lull people through it. It wasn’t until the Chinese actually got away with it that anybody woke up and said, “Oh my goodness Mildred, we’ve got a problem.” On the same note, the notion that we would ban them from having our chips and that would keep them from competing in AI? I don’t know if that worked. I am looking at DeepSeek and saying, “Well, constraint breeds creativity. They got really creative, and they built a cheaper model that performs as well as our most expensive models.” Do you think that it’s time to rethink that approach to technology limitation? I think that’s a fair judgment. We understand that we have national security interests, and we’re certainly trying to compete with these people all over the world. And rethinking this is a sensible idea. We can’t stop China from getting chips, but we can certainly notice if it’s more expensive. We can make it more expensive. To bring that all the way back around to the top. Elon Musk, who may or may not be running part of our government, has significant ties to China. It’s a huge market for Tesla. You’ll hear a bit more from me on this very soon. Can you give us a preview? Nope. I’ve got to go through all the security rules and all the rest, but you’ll hear more about it soon. Do you think whatever you have to reveal will provide the necessary momentum to stop the chaos run of Elon Musk through the government? I think people are going to pay attention to it. It’ll be an important part of the debate. Sen. Wyden, I think we’re out of time. Thank you so much for being on Decoder. This was great. Thank you for letting me ask that question so bluntly at the top as well. No, I appreciate it. You guys, really care about policy issues, and thank goodness. I’m going to ask you for your advice, and I mean this sincerely. Last question. The Verge has always only cared about policy issues. This has been a thing that we say. We write about policy, not politics, because policy is important to people. It’s real. But it seems, here in 2025, politics and policy are the same thing. Do you feel that? It certainly makes me reflect on the policy that I’ve always said. It comes up at town hall meetings all the time. I say, “The best politics is good policy because you get in a position to be able to win people over for the right reasons. The reality is that these are really serious questions that don’t lend themselves to quick thought. We have to be ready to babble on both fronts. Let’s get the best policy ideas that we can and then work like hell to have the grassroots support in order to get them passed. But here’s my pushback. It seems like right now, the politics are winning. The politics are about collecting as much attention, being as loud on social media, and being as “authentic” as you can be. That lets you do whatever harebrained policy idea you want, including announcing a takeover of Gaza from the White House. That feels like a meaningful split. How do you bring that back into alignment? I’m going to continue to say that it’s possible to make this temporary and we can move on. But it’s only going to come about with good ideas and political organizing that will have to mobilize people all across the country. I mean, you can’t fake the price of eggs. Donald Trump’s got a problem, and if we pound that issue, a specific policy matter… I am going to talk until I run out of larynx space about him saying he was going to lower food prices and then putting up the white flag of surrender two weeks later. Now, the homeowner is worried about the price of eggs and you can’t fake that stuff. We’re going to do the best policy and work like hell to make sure people know about it. This last campaign was particularly hard because we made a big candidate change very late in the game, and it’s pretty hard to get your issues out that way, and we can do better. Sen. Wyden, I’ll let you get back to work. It sounds like you have a lot to do. We’ll talk to you soon. Thanks. A podcast from The Verge about big ideas and other problems.

T-Mobile’s (TMUS+2.49%) direct-to-cell (DTC) satellite messaging service powered by Elon Musk’s Starlink is now free for anyone in the U.S., at least for a limited time, as the company looks to draw in customers. The companies have been collaborating for a few years now, promising in 2022 to deliver coverage “above and beyond anything customers have ever seen before” through a new network using Starlink’s satellites. In December, Starlink parent SpaceX finished launching the first shell of DTC satellites and won regulatory approval from the Federal Communications Commission for the service. “We’re still in the early days — I don’t want to overhype the experience during a beta test — but we’re officially putting ‘no bars’ on notice,” T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert said in a statement. “Dead zones, your days are numbered at the Un-carrier.” The service is currently in its beta trial and limited to text messages, although T-Mobile hopes to have additional functionality available by the summer. Services like WhatsApp, some mapping and trail apps, and the ability to send photos could be ready when the beta testing ends in July, T-Mobile’s head of marketing told The Washington Post. After that point, T-Mobile users will have to pay $15 per month for the Starlink service, although that fee will drop to $10 per month if they participate in the beta test during February. Customers paying for the company’s pricey Go5G Next plan will get the service for free. Verizon (VZ+1.02%) and AT&T (T+0.73%) customers will have to pay $20 per month per line. T-Mobile said on its website that it accepts users on a rolling, “first-come, first-served basis,” noting that there are limited spots available. The company says that Apple’s (AAPL+1.45%) iPhone 14 and later models, Google’s (GOOGL+0.27%) Pixel 9, REVVL’s 7, and a slew of Samsung Galaxy phones are compatible with the service, but they need to be fully updated. Motorola’s (LNVGY-5.04%) 2024 and newer models are also compatible. SpaceX has a number of partners in other nations, such as KDDI in Japan and Telstra in Australia, and worked with AST SpaceMobile (ASTS+6.88%) to launch nationwide coverage in New Zealand in late December. In October, Kyivstar said it would work with Starlink to provide “uninterrupted” service in Ukraine. Verizon and AT&T are also working with AST SpaceMobile to launch rival services. On Jan. 30, AST SpaceMobile said the FCC had approved it to begin testing its service. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

AI is causing tech sector layoffs, report claims When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. New Wall Street Journal reporting has revealed an alarming trend within the tech sector – much like sceptics anticipated years ago, artificial intelligence looks to be displacing human workers and leading to higher unemployment rates. The report found IT sector unemployment rates rose from 3.9% in December to 5.7% in January, or from 98,000 to 152,000 Janco Associates analysis of the US Department of Labor data. More broadly, 143,000 new jobs were added in January 2025 to the US economy, albeit at a slower rate than optimal. In fact, white-collar and knowledge workers are seen as the most at-risk when it comes to AI-induced job displacement. Jaco Associates CEO Victor Janulaitis commented: “Jobs are being eliminated within the IT function which are routine and mundane, such as reporting, clerical administration.” Companies are also reducing their reliance on programmers and system designers in the hope that artificial intelligence can deliver further cost savings. The number of software development job posts dropped 8.5% year-over-year in January 2025. Although last year's pattern was considerably lower than 2023, when layoffs.fyi tracked 264,000 tech sector redundancies, as estimated 152,000 tech workers still lost their jobs in 2024 – nearly as many as the 165,000 workers who lost their jobs in 2022. Recent notable job losses include Sonos (12% of its headcount), Meta (5%), Microsoft, Amazon and Google. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! The report also suggests that further corporate investment in artificial intelligence could serve as an early sign that future job cuts could come – a trend described as “cost avoidance.” However, while certain jobs may be at risk, others remain in high demand. The report reveals that certain in-person and skilled roles are in greater demand than many white-collar positions – the 'in-person' element of that trend is particularly interesting, given the widespread return-to-office mandates that have been enacted post-pandemic. It's not all bad news though – Janulaitis revealed that January’s figures, which paint a negative picture for the year ahead, could indeed be artificially inflated by many companies who are looking to implement this year’s cost-cutting measures now, rather than later. Regardless, with a further 10,800 job cuts actioned in the first five weeks of 2025 across the industry, many workers are faced with an uncertain future.

Title: Crypto News Weekly Recap: Trump’s Tariff War, the Rise of AI Meme Coins, and New P2E Games

We’re back with our weekly crypto recap. If Trump’s presidency means one thing, it’s that there’ll be no shortage of crypto news. This past week, the newly inaugurated president (along with his immediate family and friends) continued to make headlines in crypto circles. We also witnessed noteworthy developments in AI and gaming. Here’s a recap of what happened in crypto recently: Now, let’s zoom in a little. The crypto market faced turbulence, with Bitcoin ($BTC) briefly touching $92K after Trump announced 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports. Canada immediately imposed a counter-tariff, whereas Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum took a more cautious approach. However, there may be more strategic depth to Trump’s tariffs threats than immediate market reactions suggest. Specifically, it could be an attempt to weaken the dollar while maintaining low yields, thus forcing countries to shift from short-term dollar reserves to long-term Treasury bonds. Eric Trump appears to be his father’s main crypto advisor, as evident from his involvement with World Liberty Finance (WLFI) and the official $TRUMP meme coin. Last Monday, the presidential son tweeted ‘it’s a great time to add $ETH’ as the token dipped some 20% (on the back of Trump’s tariff war, that is). $ETH’s price subsequently rose from $2.3K to $2.7K. With an average $ETH purchase price of $3.3K, WLFI currently faces an unrealized loss of approximately $31M. Trump signed an executive order to establish America’s first federal sovereign wealth fund. Senator Cynthia Lummis then tweeted it’s a ‘₿ig deal,’ with the Bitcoin ₿, possibly hinting at an upcoming $BTC investment. This approach would mirror Norway’s sovereign wealth fund strategy, which already has indirect $BTC exposure through investments in companies like MicroStrategy. While Alaska and Texas have been successfully operating state-level sovereign wealth funds for some time, this is an uncharted territory for the federal government. Musk raised eyebrows with his proposal to put the US Treasury on the blockchain – all $1.5T of it. We’re talking about a blockchain that would handle everything from social security checks to federal employee paychecks. However, many are skeptical about the idea. Either way, this transition would force over 3M federal employees to start using blockchain technology and push crypto adoption to levels never seen before. Google CEO Sundar Pichai plans to invest $75B in AI, which he called a ‘small expenditure.’ It’s clear that AI is taking center stage in Google’s strategy, especially given how much of the company’s $95B revenue last year was tied to AI-related services. While Google’s yearly revenue increased 12%, Wall Street seemed jittery about this spending plan, which sent Alphabet Inc. shares down 10%. Capital inflows into the AI sector mean that AI meme coins and AI agent tokens might see more upside this year. In other crypto news, Mythical Games launched a Super Bowl promotion for NFL Rivals, its NFT mobile football game. The two-week event features 30 new player cards from the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles. In other crypto game news, a new move-to-earn (M2E) fitness app, StepMania, is now available on Telegram. It takes inspiration from StepN, a 2021 M2E game that attracted 5.6M users with its unique mechanic and sneaker NFTs. Trump’s pro-crypto strategy, shared by Eric Trump and Elon Musk, is bullish for the entire altcoin sector. That’s particularly true for AI tokens like MIND of Pepe ($MIND) in light of the current Big Tech AI race. MIND of Pepe is a self-sovereign agent that runs on Ethereum. It can analyze market data, deliver exclusive insights to its token holders, engage in discussions on social media, and even launch its own projects (including crypto games). Currently on presale, one $MIND token costs $0.0032924, but the price will increase in 14 hours. The project has raised $5.6M so far, and early adopters have staked 859B tokens at a 407% APY. After $MIND hits the ground running and lists on DEX, it could surge 10X, especially now that Eric Trump has endorsed the Ethereum ecosystem. This week, all eyes are on Trump’s crypto agenda and the AI sector. The effect of federal policy decisions on market movements is undeniable, so we can only hope the upcoming days will bring good news. Uncertainty forces investors to seek utility-focused projects like MIND of Pepe. Its data-backed market insights and ability to autonomously launch new projects make it one of the best presales in 2025. As always, however, be sure to DYOR and keep a cool head. The current crypto market is extremely volatile, so diversify your portfolio and only invest as much as you can afford to lose. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Mapping the learning curves of deep learning networks
URL: https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012286

There is an important challenge in systematically interpreting the internal representations of deep neural networks (DNNs). Existing techniques are often less effective for non-tabular tasks, or they primarily focus on qualitative, ad-hoc interpretations of models. In response, this study introduces a cognitive science-inspired, multi-dimensional quantification and visualization approach that captures two temporal dimensions of model learning: the “information-processing trajectory” and the “developmental trajectory.” The former represents the influence of incoming signals on an agent’s decision-making, while the latter conceptualizes the gradual improvement in an agent’s performance throughout its lifespan. Tracking the learning curves of DNNs enables researchers to explicitly identify the model appropriateness of a given task, examine the properties of the underlying input signals, and assess the model’s alignment (or lack thereof) with human learning experiences. To illustrate this method, we conducted 750 runs of simulations on two temporal tasks: gesture detection and sentence classification, showcasing its applicability across different types of deep learning tasks. Using four descriptive metrics to quantify the mapped learning curves—start, end - start, max, tmax—, we identified significant differences in learning patterns based on data sources and class distinctions (all p’s < .0001), the prominent role of spatial semantics in gesture learning, and larger information gains in language learning. We highlight three key insights gained from mapping learning curves: non-monotonic progress, pairwise comparisons, and domain distinctions. We reflect on the theoretical implications of this method for cognitive processing, language models and representations from multiple modalities. Deep learning networks, specifically recurrent neural networks (RNNs), are designed for processing incoming signals sequentially, making them intuitive computational systems for studying cognitive processing that involves dynamic contexts. There has been a tradition in the fields of machine learning and neuro-cognitive science to examine how a system (either humans or models) represents information through various computational and statistical techniques. Our study takes this one step further by devising a technique for examining the “learning curves” of deep learning networks utilizing the sequential representations as part of RNNs’ architectures. Just as humans develop learning curves when solving problems, the introduced method captures both how incoming signals help improve decision-making and how a system’s problem-solving abilities enhance when encountering the same situation multiple times throughout its lifespan. Our study selected two distinct tasks: gesture detection and emotion tweet classification, to illustrate the insights researchers can draw from mapping models’ learning curves. The proposed method hinted that gesture learning experiences are smoother, while language learning relies on sudden knowledge gains during processing, corroborating the findings from previous literature.

Data for conducting simulations is available from https://github.com/linuxsino/iMiGUE and https://huggingface.co/datasets/dair-ai/emotion. Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. 1 The advantages of using key point data are twofold. First, keypoint data conserves significant computing power; since each second of image sequences (i.e., matrices of pixels) may contain as many as 30 or 40 frames, running deep learning models on image sequences can be prohibitively expensive. Second, it provides better interpretability and understandability. Instead of being possible only through abstract information at the image-frame level, gesture detection can be operationalized as a sequential movement in keypoints across frames [57]. 2 The large batch size for emotion classification is due to each of its input data points using less space compared to the gesture input. 3 The spatial information arising from the gesture, specifically the keypoint coordinates in the gesture dataset, can vaguely help the model distinguish between gesture classes (e.g., hand vs. no gesture). However, this information remains a low-level cue, as the model lacks an understanding of what a complete hand gesture sequence or a no-gesture sequence looks like. Over the past decade, deep learning and neural networks have achieved remarkable performance in prediction and classification tasks in various domains, from machine translation and object recognition, to autonomous driving and reinforcement learning [1, 2]. As powerful representational learning tools, deep neural networks (DNNs) can capture complex patterns in data [1], yet understanding the nature of the information embedded in their multidimensional representations remains a challenge. Researchers have raised concerns about how DNN embeddings represent knowledge and how to holistically interpret these high-dimensional features [3–6]. Over-reliance on such models for decision-making could be detrimental in both research and applied settings due to their complexity and lack of explainability. This is particularly concerning when models rely on biased training data that does not generalize well to target tasks [7, 8]. Without a deep understanding of these models’ underlying properties, they may fail to align with the goals of their human designers. Recently, there has been a combined effort from cognitive science and deep learning to utilize representational learning to address model explainability concerns. These practices have become more prominent due to the success of large-scale models [17], especially large-language models [18]. For example, in the case of language models, examining the internal processes of the BERT Transformer-based architecture has shown that it may recapitulate common natural language processing (NLP) pipelines [19–21]. Chang and Bergen [22] found that the frequency and n-gram structure of word tokens significantly alters the training for language Transformer models learning these words. Inspired by this prior work, this paper outlines a technique for examining the learning trajectories of deep learning models, in particular recurrent neural networks (RNNs). There is historical precedent for our approach, too. McClelland, Rogers and others have studied the underlying knowledge of neural networks by tracking them as they learn [10, 23]. Despite this classic work in cognitive science, it is uncommon to see deep learning models that track progress as a way to unpack what is learned (e.g., going beyond simple RMSE curves; but see also [18], for a counterexample). We term this tracking a “learning curve,” as it resembles research on how human learners process incoming information and improve decision-making through iterations under different situations. A unique benefit with simulation is the possibility to examine many dimensions and measurements of the neural network over time. In the next section, we review recent work on interpreting DNNs and related models. We then introduce our approach based on learning curves. To date, various techniques have been proposed to interpret DNNs. For example, many model interpretability techniques provide task-specific and local explanations, such as saliency maps, attention maps, or Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), which interpret or visualize the localized influence of a region on the output. These ad-hoc approaches can be unstable, as even a minor change in a single pixel or hyperparameter can substantially affect the local relationships between input signals and output data [24]. Additionally, these local explanations fail to offer a global understanding of whether the selected architecture is well-suited to the task or how the DNN models experience learning. On the other hand, feature attribution methods like SHAP [66] and LIME [67], while conceptually easier to interpret and model-agnostic, tend to work more intuitively with interpretable dimensions typically found in structured tabular data. These methods are less effective for unstructured tasks, such as image and audio data, where feature dimensions are harder to define or interpret. While most techniques emphasize the qualitative interpretation of a model, such as what has been learned or captured by the DNN, the absence of quantifiable measurements makes cross-model comparisons in unstructured tasks particularly challenging [4, 5, 25]. We further provided a systematic description of different model explainability methods, along with their pros, cons, and use cases, as well as a comparison to our proposed approach in Table 1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313772.t001 In a foundational article on deep learning, LeCun and the colleagues [1] characterized DNNs as representation-learning methods utilizing multilayered large neural network-style models. Representations can be viewed as mental objects capturing semantic properties either observable or unobservable [26]. Different from traditional machine learning models, DNNs display remarkable flexibility and efficiency in encoding lower-level input signals, such as pixels, audio frequencies, or word tokens, into multidimensional vectors at a sophisticated level through multilayered nonlinear transformations [27]. These transformations generate multiple levels of representations that learn hierarchies of features at each layer [1]. The continuous numerical vectors (or hidden vectors) learned at each level are commonly referred to as “embeddings” and serve as dense representations of the original input data. Following this construction, numerous studies have demonstrated the correspondence between DNN-generated and real-world distributed representations among words and sentences [11, 28], speeches [29], images [9], objects [30] and scenes [31, 32]. Representational learning in DNNs offers fundamental contributions to cognitive science, as it can inform how cognitive systems process and organize knowledge, facilitating the comparison of learning processes between humans and machines [33–35]. Recently, several studies in cognitive science and neuroscience have highlighted the importance of integrative modeling between computation, human brains and behaviors [12]. Beyond comparisons of static end-point knowledge, scholars have begun exploring the potential correspondence in learning and information processing between DNNs and human cognitive systems, given that the current performance of DNNs can already approximate human performance across various domains [36–38] (see [18] for a review). For instance, the representations (i.e., embeddings) extracted from multilayered DNNs have shown significant accuracy in predicting neural and behavioral responses in humans throughout the hierarchy of learning and processing. This evidence spans multiple neural-behavioral measurements (e.g., fMRI, EEG, ECoG), modalities (e.g., visual, auditory, and language processing), and model architectures (ranging from simple embedding models like GloVe to more complex neural networks such as RNNs, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and transformer models (for further details, see [9, 11, 12, 23, 39, 40]). Given the extensive alignment observed between DNN embeddings and neural-behavioral activities, and their presumed meaningful representational mapping with human cognitive systems, an analysis of how they emerge in learning would seem important to understand these relationships. Goldstein and colleagues [11] identify the temporal correspondence between layer-by-layer embeddings in GPT-2 and evolving neural activities in language areas. However, this temporality is restricted to layerwise representations (from low-level to high-level representations) rather than how streams of signals have been received and processed by models or brains [38]. Our aim in this paper is to use temporal analysis in a systematic way by separating and tracking the time course of a network’s learning across classification tasks, thereby enhancing the understanding of the emergence of representations in DNNs. The goal of this study is to unpack the “learning curve” of DNNs through a sequence of hidden representations when the model encounters any temporal processing tasks across its training. To do so, we sample the network’s performance by using its embedding vectors to classify groups of items in its training input. This allows us to map out the progression of the network’s discriminations across these groups – how the network’s internal knowledge, in the form of embedding vectors, evolves during training. The model architecture we focus on is RNNs due to their capacity to model sequential data and time-dependent tasks [41], such as text generation, speech recognition and stock market prediction. Although other deep learning architectures, such as CNNs and Transformers, also have the capacity to process time-series data, RNNs are explicitly designed for processing sequential data, as they effectively capture temporal dependencies through their recurrent connections. CNNs excel in tasks such as image recognition by applying the kernel trick, where convolutional filters are used to extract spatial features from local regions of the input. While CNNs can be adapted to handle sequential data using techniques like 1D convolutional layers, they lack the inherent ability to capture temporal ordering in the data, as they process each segment of input independently. Transformers, on the other hand, rely on self-attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different input tokens in parallel, allowing them to capture dependencies between distant elements (i.e., tokens). This feature makes Transformers better suited for tasks where relationships between tokens are not strictly ordered in time, and their parallel processing nature is less ideal for learning tasks that require explicit temporal progression. In sum, the strict sequential processing nature of RNNs makes them an intuitive architecture for studying cognitive processing that involves dynamic, changing contexts [42]. In this study, we propose a generalizable interpretability approach that maps the global learning curves of RNNs based on changes in classification performance between embeddings and output across timesteps of the input data. This performance reflects the predictive capacity or the amount of signal captured by the embeddings in predicting the final output. In RNN modeling, each timestep generates an embedding (e.g., in language processing, each timestep represents a word). These embeddings progressively incorporate information from the beginning up to timestep t. By examining changes in classification performance between these embeddings and the output, we can capture how the information evolves over time. To provide clarity, we use the term “learning curve” in this study to denote the holistic approach and intention behind mapping the underlying processing and developmental journey of DNNs. The method we propose separates two parts of the learning curve, one based on overall training, and another based on processing within input items during training. First, the “developmental trajectory” signifies the long-term learning process of DNNs, which is simulated by the increasing number of epochs (i.e., complete passes through an entire training dataset). Second, the “(information) processing trajectory” refers to the momentary accumulation of information across all timesteps (within an epoch), extractable from the performance of the RNN layer (see Fig 1 for a conceptual illustration). We detail each of these further below. The solid curve represents an individual information processing trajectory (across timesteps). For example, as an agent receives more signals over time in one session, its prediction of the gesture increases. The bundle of dotted lines represents a developmental trajectory (across epochs). For instance, this agent improves its ability to predict incoming gestures after repeatedly encountering similar patterns. In a typical binary classification task, the starting point at t=0 is expected to be near 0.50 (and gradually increase to 1.00 across timesteps and epochs) for all epochs because no signals have been provided at the first timestep for solving the underlying task. Hence, all information processing curves in this figure have the same starting point to reflect this pattern. In practice, certain classification tasks might contain structural information even at t=0 (e.g., gesture classification contains spatial information, such as the location of keypoints, at the initial timestep, which could help solve the gesture task from the very beginning).

Each epoch contains an information processing trajectory, and the set of curves together forms a developmental trajectory. Due to the multidimensional nature of this plot, while it provides rich qualitative information about the entire model learning experience, it can be challenging for researchers to comprehend all the constructed curves at once. Therefore, beyond the visual presentation and qualitative inspection of the multi-dimensional learning curves, this study further defines four measures: start performance (start, the initial capacity of each information processing), max performance (max, the maximum performance of each information processing), time at max (tmax, when the current information processing reaches the maximum performance), and end – start performance (end – start, the overall performance gain in this information processing) – to facilitate quantitative comparisons across tasks and datasets. Our study particularly focuses on these relatively easy-to-comprehend descriptive statistics (as opposed to more complex metrics like regression coefficients) to simplify the understanding of the already multidimensional and granular nature of the constructed learning curves. To illustrate the generalizability of our approach, we chose two distinct classification tasks: (i) sentence classification and (ii) gesture detection. These tasks differ widely in terms of their modalities. We predicted this would lead to variation in the underlying data generation processes and associated cognitive processing for each modality. In particular, gesture and body movements primarily result from the coordinated contraction and relaxation of muscles, with signals produced at later timesteps derived from the previous timesteps with relatively high autocorrelation [43]. On the other hand, verbal language, being a predominantly semantic modality, exhibits degrees of surprisal and arbitrariness that enhance the cognitive capacity of language processing [44–46]. Therefore, the expected developmental and information processing trajectories will likely exhibit distinguishable patterns across the two different tasks when the DNN system processes them respectively. As we discuss in detail in later sections, this method has a few benefits. Through tracking the learning trajectory of a neural network, researchers can explicitly identify the appropriateness of a model for a given task as well as examine the properties of underlying input signals. This approach could also serve as a standalone visualization to map the accumulation of the underlying signals processed, which can facilitate research on deep learning modeling and signal processing across various modalities. Finally, mapping the learning curve of DNNs has the potential to assist future computational cognitive and neuroscience research and address whether the learning experiences of models also correspond to (or fail to correspond to) the temporal processing in human cognition in addition to the emphasis on static representations in the current literature. In the following sections, we will provide a step-by-step method for visualizing the learning curves of neural networks, illustrate how to holistically interpret signal processing in them and quantitatively compare these curves across two different datasets. This research proposes a model-interpretability method that can extract the learning curve of sequence-based deep learning networks (e.g., RNNs). Inspired by cognitive science, the method measures the learning trajectory and underlying knowledge extracted by such networks. To illustrate the method, we use two temporal tasks: gesture detection and sentence classification as examples. This study therefore demonstrates that the method could inform a range of deep-learning tasks. Our multi-stage pipeline includes three main steps. First, we trained the RNN-LSTM model to generate a sequence of embeddings for a temporal task. Next, we used KNN classifiers to calculate the performance across all extracted embeddings, which we refer to as learning curves (see (2) in Fig 2). Finally, we defined four metrics to quantify these multi-dimensional embeddings for more systematic comparison and significant tests between tasks, classes, the null hypothesis, and development trajectories. The visualization of this multi-stage procedure can be found in Fig 2.

The two temporal tasks (i.e., gesture detection and sentence classification) are distinct in terms of their modalities, lengths, and the steps required to extract and preprocess the features, thereby enhancing the diversity of data to illustrate the learning curve analysis. We detail the preparation of each dataset separately below. The Emotion dataset [49] consists of 20,000 English Twitter messages with six basic emotions (e.g., anger, fear, joy, love, sadness, and surprise) by adopting Plutchik’s [50] wheel of emotions, Ekman’s [51] six basic emotions, and hashtags in tweets. Tweets were annotated through noisy labels and distant supervision introduced by [52]. To prepare the emotion sentences for recognition by the RNN layer, we first applied the “basic English” tokenizer from torchtext to tokenize each tweet. Then, we used GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation), a word vectorization technique that does not rely on local word context statistics (local-context information), to vectorize each token in a sentence. GloVe was preferred over other token vectorization techniques like word2vec [53] due to its design to capture the universal meaning of each token/word, rather than the word’s meaning within a specific sentence or context. We opted for GloVe embeddings with 300-dimensional semantic features because it strikes a balance between capturing sufficient information and maintaining computational efficiency [35]. In theory, the input sequences of RNN are not required to have the same length. In practice, these sequences are padded with zeros or trimmed to the same length to optimize the computation in PyTorch. Accordingly, all tokenized tweets were padded to a consistent length of 66 tokens, which corresponds to the length of the longest tweet sample. The shape of each Emotion tweet follows a 300 dimensions × 66 timesteps (see Fig 3). The iMiGUE is a high-quality dataset that contains 18,499 identity-free, ethnically-diverse, gender-balanced samples of 32 psychologically-meaningful micro-gestures (such as scratching an arm, adjusting the hair, or touching an ear [51]). These gestures were all curated from interview clips with athletes at post-match press conferences. Unlike other gesture and emotion datasets, which are typically drawn from staged performances or movie clips, the iMiGUE provides samples of actual gestures from real-life situations. This poses a more realistic, though more challenging, recognition task for deep learning networks [54, 55]. Due to copyright restrictions, the dataset includes only skeleton keypoints (rather than original interview clips) extracted from OpenPose, a multi-person computer-vision system that can simultaneously extract keypoints of the body, hands, face, and feet [56]1. In total, 25 body, 70 facial, and 21 left hand and 21 right hand keypoints were extracted for each frame using OpenPose. Keypoint data were stored in the following format: [x0,y0,c0,x1,y1,c1… ], in which (x, y) represents the coordinate of each keypoint and c indicates the confidence score of each keypoint-coordinate prediction. The confidence score was excluded in the following processing steps. Although the gesture clips have just 39 frames on average, they have a higher standard deviation at 84 frames with a 75th percentile of 72 frames. We therefore set the padded length of the input sequence to 150 frames to ensure that our input data contained sufficient information for training a classifier. Thus, the input size for each gesture clip was 274 units (137 keypoints × 2) × 150 timesteps (see Fig 3). NB: Gesture figures are adapted from Wikimedia Commons [47].

The learning curve analysis will show how that successful learning emerges, and which stimulus discriminations seem to underlie that emergence. Since even the state-of-the-art neural network can achieve only 55% accuracy on this multi-classification task [48], we further grouped the 32 micro-gestures into six categories (body, head, hand, body-head, head-hand movements and an absence of gestures) to ensure that our RNN-LSTM was indeed “learning” when we attempted to map its learning curve. We selected a model architecture (see Fig 4) that is standardized for sequential stimulus processing in the following way. First, we had a batch normalization layer, a primary RNN-LSTM layer, and then a fully connected layer to connect the final dense embeddings with the output classes (for classification). We offer details below. NB: Gesture figures are adapted from Wikimedia Commons [47]. NB: Gesture figures are adapted from Wikimedia Commons [47]. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012286.g004 RNN is capable of modeling sequential data and time-dependent tasks [41]. Its architecture represents an iterative function that takes an input sequence (x) and an internal state (h) from the previous timestep (t - 1) to predict the current timestep (t), then updates the state as follows: (1) As the formula illustrates, each timestep t should theoretically reflect the information from 0 to t – 1. We selected the RNN model for gesture detection because it can process temporal information under the assumption that the body movement in each timestep depends on signals in the previous timesteps. While an RNN could leverage the context between elements by maintaining its internal state while processing the entire sequence, the “Vanilla RNN” layer experienced the vanishing-gradient problem during model training [58]. Therefore, long short-term memory (LSTM), which is represented by the function f in Equation 1, was introduced here as an additional state variable, called the cell state, for controlling specific information that needed to be kept or updated while processing the entire sequence [57]. LSTM effectively reduced the vanishing-gradient problem encountered by RNN [58]. The construction of our RNN-LSTM neural network follows common practice in deep learning. First, to enhance training stability and speed up convergence, we applied batch normalization, specifically the BatchNorm1d layer, to the input data at each timestep, with dimensions batch_size × timestep × input_dimension (1 × 150 × 274 for iMiGUE and 1 × 66 × 300 for Emotion). This means that each timestep is treated independently, and normalization is applied across all data points in the batch for each timestep. Specifically, this technique normalizes the inputs to have a mean of 0 and a variance of 1 within each timestep, standardizing the distribution of inputs across the data points in each batch during training. Then, an RNN-LSTM was applied to the normalized input to convert temporal information to a dense embedding at each timestep. An RNN-LSTM with an equal hidden dimension was selected to simplify the tracking of embeddings in the later stage. Finally, a fully connected layer, without any activation, was applied to the embeddings in the last timestep t to predict output labels. To ensure the generalizability of our learning curve mapping approach, we performed 15 rounds of simulation for both gesture and emotion detection tasks, each of which included 15 (6C2) pairwise binary classifications. We conducted 25 repetitions (reps) for each set of simulations (sims) to mitigate the idiosyncrasies of specific processing and developmental patterns we are extracting under each pairwise condition. In total, we collected 25 × 15 × 2 ( reps × sims × tasks) = 750 runs of simulation data. Having an adequate number of simulation runs also enables us to observe clustering tendencies in the convergence and divergence of trajectory patterns across various tasks and different classes. In each simulation, 20% of the shuffled samples were used as the test data, while the remaining data were further split into 80% training data and 20% validation data. While validation data were used for reporting each epoch’s model performance, test data were used for reporting the final model performance on unseen data. The number of epochs indicates the number of times an entire dataset has been passed forward and backward through the neural network. We set the number of epochs to 50 for both tasks, given that most of the variation in learning tends to unfold during the early stages of development. In S3 Text and S4 Text we also illustrate how using 20 and 100 epochs leads to similar observed patterns. Because deep learning algorithms are very sensitive to unbalanced datasets, we applied data augmentation to the training and validation datasets. Specifically, the minority class was up-sampled to match the number of data points in the majority class, which ensured a balanced dataset [59]. Default initiation from PyTorch was used to standardize the model specification across simulations. All simulation runs were trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001, and the loss function used was the cross-entropy loss for all pairwise classifications. All the other learning rate hyperparameters were kept at their default values. Since deep learning is, computationally speaking, very expensive to train, the model was run on Nvidia RTX 4090 to expedite the processing. We set the batch size to 64 for gesture recognition and 256 for emotion classification to achieve an optimal balance between training speed and performance.2 To map a learning curve for each simulation, we first extracted embeddings of all LSTM timesteps from the hidden layer. We then applied multiple interpretable machine-learning models between these embeddings and the corresponding output labels to understand how the model’s confidence is updated during the LSTM timesteps. We extracted the LSTM array of all timesteps for all batches across all epochs on the test data to ensure that we were extracting embeddings from all developmental stages and the final model was adequately trained on the targeted task. Since we specified the same dimension of the input data for the LSTM hidden layer, for the gesture detection task, we obtained 150 LSTM arrays from 150 timesteps, each array having the size of 1 × hidden_dimension (1 × 274). Similarly, we obtained 66 LSTM arrays in sentence classification, each with a size of 1 × 300. We then stored the corresponding output labels of those arrays as an output array. Those LSTM arrays share one output array since they are embeddings at different timesteps of the same data points. For binary classification, the labels were encoded as 0 and 1. Once the model had been trained and the embeddings extracted, we stored and processed those embeddings in RAM, which has a greater storing capacity than GPU. To approximate the processing curve of a model’s confidence across the LSTM timesteps, this study used a popular machine learning algorithm, k-nearest neighbors (KNN) for identifying embedding “separatables.” This algorithm classifies an object by using a majority vote of its neighbor data points [60, 61]. Because embeddings are seen as a high-dimensional physical (i.e., location-wise) projection of input data (as opposed to a multivariate representation [1]), distance-based models, such as KNN and support vector machine (SVM), are popular choices for examining DNN embeddings in previous studies. Specifically, we applied KNN to the data point (, y), where is the LSTM embedding at t timestep and y is the corresponding output label and calculated the KNN accuracy across all timesteps (information processing trajectory) and all epochs (developmental trajectory), and thus captured the learning curve of the model. These learning curves examine how the LSTM’s embeddings classify the stimulus as it is incrementally presented to the network. Visually, each curve is plotted as the proportion of correct classifications across the item. These constructed learning curves can be analyzed in various ways, either through qualitative interpretation of the visualizations or by applying statistical analysis for quantification and hypothesis testing. In this study, we utilized the four descriptives statistics introduced earlier to assess the multidimensional KKN classification performance of the RNN-LSTM (i.e, how the discriminability of the model is evolving) across its training on two datasets, reconstructing and analyzing the unfolding learning dynamics of these distinct learning tasks. Specifically, for each such curve, we extracted four simple descriptive metrics: start, end - start, max, tmax. In Fig 5, we illustrate these descriptive statistics from an example trajectory of a single classification run for each dataset. From epoch 1 to epoch 50, the LSTM’s embeddings are able to classify successfully over the test item, and we can characterize this success as a change to its performance using four metrics described in the main body of the text (start, end - start, max, tmax). Top: Example item from the sentence task. Bottom: Example item from the gesture task. From epoch 1 to epoch 50, the LSTM’s embeddings are able to classify successfully over the test item, and we can characterize this success as a change to its performance using four metrics described in the main body of the text (start, end - start, max, tmax). Top: Example item from the sentence task. Bottom: Example item from the gesture task. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012286.g005 First, we defined the maximum performance (max) and the percentage of time at which that maximum was achieved in the presented item (tmax) over the whole timesteps. We included tmax alongside max because we discovered that max alone is not sufficient to determine performance, especially earlier in training. This is because the network may exhibit unstable performance, dropping across subsequent time slices, which may be indicative of a non-monotonic learning trend seen in related domains [62]. This also suggests the network has learned something about the initial segments of an item, but the later segments wash out its performance as it has not yet encoded these later features. To capture this trend, we use tmax to assess when that maximum was achieved within each information processing trajectory – specifically, the percentage of the time slice at which the observed maximum occurred. In Fig 5 above, we show an illustration of this in the top left. The network achieved a performance of 0.82 on this particular item, but failed to sustain this performance as it dropped to near 0.50 as the sequence unfolds (at epoch 1). In the top right, the performance improves approximately monotonically across time slices (by epoch 50), and tmax is achieved near the final bin of the training item. Additionally, we assess the performance at the start and end of the presented stimulus (start, end). Performance at the start may indicate the relative gains that can be expected from a stimulus item. As shown in the bottom panels of Fig 5, the gesture input already has performance above chance ( ~ 0.80) after the very first segment of the stimulus item. This suggests the model rapidly exploits spatial information in gesture (i.e., the location of keypoint coordinates can already vaguely differentiate gesture classes before sequential movement information is fed into the model). A model that achieves near-perfect performance at start and sustains it does not need to be exposed to the subsequent stimulus. The last measure we use is the subtraction of end - start performance. A high value on this measure suggests the network gets substantial information gains across a test item. For example, even at epoch 50 in the bottom right, the end - start of the gesture item is substantially lower than the simulation trained on the sentence task. These measures can be plotted across epochs. Each learning curve now indicates how an item is being processed across an LSTM’s overall training. The measures are relevant to two timescales in the network’s behavior we conceptualized earlier: developmental (or learning) and information-processing timescales. For example, across epochs, movement along the start measure represents the initial performance at the item’s first time slice at the beginning of each information processing session. The end - start measure within an epoch can describe the relative information gains during each processing session from the item’s full presentation. The max represents the best performance achievable in a session, indicating the network’s current information processing capacity. Finally, if tmax is low, it suggests that the network’s maximum performance of the current session is hindered by subsequent timesteps, implying that additional training may be necessary. We took the output from the KNN classification in Python, described above, and designed a sequence of R scripts to measure, visualize and quantify the trends in these four measures (start, end - start, max, tmax). R’s suite of visualization tools provided a convenient arena within which to view trends across epochs, and in these analysis scripts we also built linear models to statistically test the significance of these trends. All of the scripts in our methods are available at GitHub here: https://github.com/JoyceJiang73/Learning-Curves/. The R scripts only require input of simulation CSV data that contain as fields: binary classification labels, time slice, epoch, and performance measure (e.g., KNN classification performance). We have reported the trained RNN model performance for the average of all pairwise simulations of sentence and gesture classification (epochs = 50) in S1 Text, including metrics such as validation accuracy, validation loss, test accuracy, test loss, recall, precision, and F1. These results confirm that almost all pairwise classifications have been sufficiently trained, indicating that the learning curves are capturing the learned experiences. For each of the four metrics, we conducted a series of significance tests using regression models to assess distinctness across data sources, reshuffled null data, classes, and epochs. Specifically: (1) A linear model was used to assess whether the learning curves of the two datasets differed significantly, (2) A linear model evaluated whether the learning curve for each training classification task significantly deviated from a superimposed (randomly reshuffled) null hypothesis across the four metrics, (3) Linear models were used to assess whether the learning curves for each dataset were distinct by class and across epochs, and (4) An ANOVA test was performed to determine whether class differences contributed more to developmental progression than epoch alone. All the significance tests (Adjusted R-squared) are reported in Table 2, and the corresponding visualizations for each metric are provided in their respective sections. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313772.t002 In Fig 6, we show the LSTM performance at the start of an item across epochs of training. In general, the sentence dataset shows low, near-chance performance, while gesture classifications are already well above chance performance. This chance-level performance for sentence items stays consistent across the entire training period, though the gestural dataset shows some improvement. For the gesture dataset, this suggests that the network has some information about a classification before much of a training item is even shown to the network. It would indicate that gestural data has spatial information in the point coordinates of the body and is exploited by the network at the very first time bin. With language, it takes time for word embedding vectors to be integrated in the network. To confirm these trends, we tested a linear model that predicted start performance by training data, showing that dataset accounted for about 98.14% (p < .0001) of the variance seen in Fig 6. The classification of the gesture data accounts for 95.51% (p < .0001) of variance internally to that dataset, whereas for sentence classifications accounts only for 10.28% (lower but also significant, p < .0001). The learning curves reveal that the first word of a language task has low diagnostic accuracy for a classification, but the spatial variance over gestural classifications is much more informative. The start performance for sentence null is the only metric that shows no significant difference between learning from ordered sentence classes and reshuffled data (among all significance tests; = 0.0001, p < .0879). This is expected, as all sentence binary classifications begin with a consistent initial performance of 0.50 (random guessing for binary classification), which remains unchanged even with randomly reshuffled sentence data. In contrast, the start performance significantly differs for ordered gesture classes versus reshuffled data because the various gesture pairs contain different levels of spatial information ( =0.0824, p < .0001), affecting their initial performance. Start metric over epochs, indicating that in the sentence task, the classification at the first time slice remains stable near change, whereas the LSTM’s embeddings for the gesture task are distinct across stimulus types, and also show slightly more improvement over training (while already being well above change relative to the sentence task). Start metric over epochs, indicating that in the sentence task, the classification at the first time slice remains stable near change, whereas the LSTM’s embeddings for the gesture task are distinct across stimulus types, and also show slightly more improvement over training (while already being well above change relative to the sentence task). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012286.g006 Curiously, if one only investigated maximum performance across training, these classification tasks could be regarded as relatively similar in their behavior. As shown in Fig 7, both sentence and gesture datasets yield a classification performance that is high, between 0.75 and 1.0 depending on the classification. In the gesture dataset, there are more “difficult” classifications, shown by outliers in max performance across training. This can be helpful in diagnosing representational challenges in the network’s training, marking what pairs of training items may be more difficult to distinguish than others. Again, as with the start measure, the max performance shows greater variance associated with classifications in the gesture case ( =0.8250, p < .0001) than the sentence case ( =0.2736, p < .0001). The difference between these two datasets is not as pronounced as in the start measure, as a linear model shows that only 2.11% (p < .0001) of the variance is associated with the dataset in a linear model predicting max performance observed within a trial. Despite the small value, it is nevertheless significant and driven by the relatively higher performance in the sentence task. The max performance also differs for both sentence ( =0.0042, p < .0001) and gesture tasks ( =0.0722, p < .0001) when the network learns from ordered datasets compared to randomly shuffled ones. The sentence conditions appear to pick up more spurious signals, ultimately approaching 1.00 as the epochs increase, while the gesture condition remains consistently unlearned across epochs. The learning pattern for tmax across epochs (see next section) provides additional insights into these trends. Both sentence and gesture tasks show an increase in max performance over training epochs. On average this asymptotes near perfect performance but can vary depending on binary classification. Both sentence and gesture tasks show an increase in max performance over training epochs. On average this asymptotes near perfect performance but can vary depending on binary classification. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012286.g007 We would expect that completed training in the LSTM should show that maximum performance should appear near the end of an item, as this would suggest that the network has extracted useful information in the whole presentation. Indeed, this is indicated by lower time-at-max values earlier in the training. During the first few epochs, the maximum value occurs proportionally earlier in a training item, similar to the example shown above in Fig 5. However in both sentence and gesture datasets, networks slowly extract features across the stimulus items for classification, as shown in Fig 8. The time gradually rises for all classifications, though it can also vary widely and tends to be more irregular in gesture. In a linear model predicting tmax from data source, sentence and gesture are only slightly different, with 0.34% (p < .0001) of the variance accounted for. Classifications in sentence and gesture both relate significantly in a linear model predicting time at max, with sentence classifications accounting for 9.51% (p < .0001) of the variance and gesture classifications 24.95% (p < .0001). Interpreting tmax alongside max, we confirm that the learning experience of a language task is more reliant on spurious signals for reshuffled data compared to ordered data, as max continuously increases to reach 1.00 while tmax remains sporadic. The gesture condition remains consistently unlearned across epochs for reshuffled data, as the max performance can occur at any point along the processing trajectory (any timestep). Both tmax values indicate that no meaningful delayed signals were developed when the network was trained on superimposed reshuffled data. The time at max differs significantly for reshuffled versus ordered data in both sentence ( =0.0120, p < .0001) and gesture ( =0.0058, p < .0001) conditions. Both sentence and gesture tasks show an increase in the proportion of time at which maximum performance is observed. Indicative of information gain, this rises in both – suggesting the LSTM comes to better integrate the full test items for its performance.

However this is much more orderly in the sentence task than the gesture task. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012286.g008 Finally, we wish to get a sense of how the LSTM models are extracting information within an information processing session. One way to do this is to discern how much higher its performance is at the end of a session compared to its performance initially. This is where we see the greatest difference between the datasets. As shown as Fig 9, sentence shows substantial information gain across stimulus items. By the end of training, the start and end of trials involves considerable difference, and the positive value of this difference shows that the network improves its performance significantly across presentations. With gesture, the situation is quite distinct. In most classifications, there is indeed a rise. But because gesture is informative even at the first time bin of an item, there isn’t much information gain remaining. Indeed even the highest instances of this value hover near 0.10. Therefore, while performance on gesture is higher at first, the network may find the task more difficult in integrating that spatial information over time to improve performance. As in the start measure, the difference between datasets is quite large. When data source is used to predict the end - start measure, 39.23% (p < .0001) of the observed variance in this measure can be associated with data source, with sentence associated with much higher information gain than gesture results. When looking at each data source separately, only 13.01% (p < .0001) of the measure is associated with the classification pairs in sentence. In the gesture dataset, this association is 38.08% (p < .0001), showing much higher contribution of the class differences in gesture. Both sentence’s (R2 =0.0027, p < .0001) and gesture’s (R2 =0.0340, p < .0001) end-start values differ significantly between ordered and reshuffled data. Consistent with max performance gradually reaching 1.00, the information gain of the sentence network increases incrementally from 0.00 to 0.50 when trained on reshuffled data. Combined with insights from tmax, we suggest that although learning may appear to occur even with reshuffled data, it is likely driven by spurious signals picked up during the processing session. Additionally, the end-start performance for gesture gradually improved from highly negative to slightly negative but was not able to reach 0.00 during the early epochs (e.g. epochs smaller than 50), which explains the flat max performance for the reshuffled gesture condition. The information gain from start to end of stimulus item shows a stark difference between datasets. The sentence task shows that the LSTM’s performance rises as it integrates data from start to end. With gestures, the story is more complicated, showing less improvement overall, and in one classification task, it is almost entirely unlearned.

With gestures, the story is more complicated, showing less improvement overall, and in one classification task, it is almost entirely unlearned. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012286.g009 Recognizing the importance and challenges involved in systematically unpacking the internal representations of DNNs, this study introduced a multi-dimensional quantification and visualization approach, “learning curves,” which can capture two temporal dimensions of a model learning experience. First, it captures the “information processing trajectory,” how the network is doing as it processes test items. Second, it captures the “developmental trajectory,” describing how this processing is changing over training epochs. The former represents the influence of incoming signals on an agent’s decision-making, which is operationalized by the timestep within a single epoch of an RNN. The latter conceptualizes the gradual improvement in an agent’s decision-making abilities throughout its lifespan, operationalized by the iteration of epochs. The learning curve approach we illustrate in our two datasets shows that we can quantify and qualitatively investigate both of these dynamics within the same analysis, utilizing four descriptive metrics: start, end - start, max, tmax. Based on a series of significant tests (see Table 2), we first demonstrated that there is a data source difference between sentence and gesture classification in the overall learning patterns across all four metrics (all p’s < .0001). Additionally, the learning experiences of both datasets’ ordered classifications are distinct from their respective reshuffled null baselines, except for the start of the sentence classification. This is because both ordered (aggregated across all classes) and unordered binary sentence classifications will have an initial classification performance of 0.50 due to random guessing. This is corroborated by the significant test of the start metric for sentence class and gesture class: sentence pairwise classifications show very minor differences, with R-squared 0.10 (p < .0001), whereas gesture classes show much greater divergence, with R-squared above 0.90 (p < .0001), due to the initial spatial information contained in gesture coordinates, even at timestep 0, as mentioned in the previous results section. The significant difference between the reshuffled null baseline for ordered vs. unordered gesture classification is also due to different gesture class pairs having different prior spatial information, deviating from the 0.50 random guess scenario observed in sentence classification. The modality distinction is further evident in the end - start metric (where sentence classification shows a much larger information gain than gesture classification, with gesture’s information gain is more gradual). Finally, the ANOVA test capturing the R-squared difference between epoch × class versus epoch-only indicates significant distinctions between pairwise classes and not being distinguished by class (all p’s < .0001). This reveals that within the same multiclassification task, certain classes can be more difficult or easier to separate. Taken together, based on the analysis of these four measures derived from the learning curves across two distinct datasets, we highlight three insights gained from mapping these curves: non-monotonicity, pairwise comparisons, and domain distinctions. First, we observed a non-monotonic trend in the learning experiences of DNNs. In other words, learning does not always show an increasing monotonic improvement because networks sometimes reveal temporary decrements in their performance across training. This is a characteristic recognized in previous literature as a key advantage for their advancement in addressing the most challenging tasks. For example, in applying neural network models to language, the presence of non-monotonic learning was taken as evidence that networks “reorganize” their knowledge as they learn. This may mean networks are acquiring more efficient representations of a problem space and the drop in performance is indicative of a transition into that more efficient representation. Classically, in the case of models learning language, they show a decrement in performance when they “discover a rule” in grammars [68] Our results are a testament to the observation that both representational consolidation and “catastrophic forgetting” remain as important issues in DNN learning [69]. Specifically in our results, we found that RNNs exhibit different preferences for early versus late cues when addressing various sequential tasks. For instance, in the sentence task, we noted a more pronounced performance improvement occurring in the later stages of information processing (i.e., model development). In contrast, gesture learning tends to show quicker progress, with more variability across epochs and repetitions of simulations, suggesting that DNNs tend to rely on shortcuts, such as naive cues related to keypoint coordinates, for gesture classification, rather than focusing on high-level movement sequences. This shortcut-based “learning” also is evident in the higher initial performance (start) for gesture classification ( > 0.75). On the other hand, sentence classification begins at around 0.50 (the at-chance probability) and exhibits greater performance gains in later epochs, indicating that the models classify based on high-level semantic sequences. Additionally, although multiclassification tends to exhibit collective model performance, our between-class pairwise comparisons reveal the presence of outliers within multiclassification. For example, “joy/fear”, “surprise/fear”, and “sadness/fear” demonstrate higher information gains across epochs compared to other emotion pairs, suggesting that these classes are further apart from each other. The “body/head” classification appears to experience learning challenges, possibly because these two movements have difficulty being completely separated, as the head’s movement in naturalistic data may inevitably coincide with that of the body due to joint coordination. The combination of learning curve mapping and instance measures thus serves as an effective approach for “auditing” representations in multiclassification problems. The proposed pipeline improves model explainability beyond holistic evaluation of classification performance and ad-hoc attention visualization by unpacking pairwise class learning patterns to reveal any pairs that are unsuccessful in being discriminated or involve delayed knowledge gain. This granular examination allows modelers to better investigate a model’s appropriateness for the underlying task, as well as the properties of the processed input signals, reaffirming the value of our learning curve conceptualization. With these findings, it is tempting to infer that there are domain distinctions among different modality classification tasks. Gesture learning, for instance, may rely on autocorrelated signals (as body movements result from the coordinated contraction and relaxation of muscles), potentially emphasizing spatial semantics as early cues 3, while language learning relies on higher degrees of surprisal, irregularities and arbitrariness, as suggested by previous literature (see [43–46]). These domain distinctions are valuable to cognitive science in understanding how humans process and distinguish between various modes of communication, shedding light on the neural mechanisms underlying the flexibility and adaptability of the human mind when processing different forms of information and communication modalities. Though it is intuitive and tempting to explain these domain distinctions here, we cannot yet assert that these trends would hold for all sentence or gesture (keypoint) classification tasks, only the ones we investigate here. However the learning curve results would seem to align with an intuition of how linguistic symbols would be sequentially integrated into a neural network in contrast to the highly auto-correlated spatial information contained in gesture performance. Still, we cannot infer a broad generalization about “language vs. gesture” and only leave it as a potential path for future investigation. Indeed, this may be an additional benefit of a method like the one we present here. Learning curves could finely ascertain these domain distinctions, and expanding the set of data to test may permit generalization in future work. This may have theoretical implications itself. The learning curve analysis may provide information about the distinct sources of information from varied modalities. When neural models (or human brains, presumably) integrate distinctive sources of information, they may strengthen understanding of complex multimodal data by leveraging their unique information-processing and developmental benefits. This study provides conceptual and operational illustrations of applying learning curve methods to RNNs, though both the illustration and the proposed method come with certain considerations. First, we selected two distinct datasets to demonstrate how learning curves offer insights into different data and modality learning experiences. While illustrating significant domain distinctions, our study is limited in making broad generalizations between “language vs. behavioral.” Future cognitive and behavioral research interested in such conceptual generalization can apply our proposed method to various distinct language tasks (e.g., language translation) and behavioral datasets (e.g., facial expression detection) to achieve broader generalizations across different modalities. Additionally, as highlighted at the beginning, our method could have implications for multimodal DNN modeling, given that our simulations utilize datasets with distinct modalities. For the current scope, we focus on how our proposed method facilitates the understanding of distinguishable modalities as an initial step, while future work can explore adopting this method for multimodal DNNs and datasets (e.g., audiovisual emotion classification) to assess how multimodal learning differs from unimodal learning. From a methodological standpoint, as detailed in the model explainability technique comparison (Table 1), our proposed method is currently limited to temporal tasks and DNN architectures, specifically RNNs. However, it has the potential to be relatively easily adapted to various tasks, modalities, multiclassification, and different performance measures, beyond the binary classification used in this study. We have provided illustrations of the multiclassification learning curve based on sentence classification in S2 Text. Additionally, because our method generates measures at every timestep and epoch, it may be more computationally expensive compared to other explainability methods. However, this arises from the tradeoff between obtaining a more granular measure across all training steps versus only obtaining snapshot visualizations of a single neural network layer or attribution scores for all input features. As documented in the DNN explainability comparison (Table 1), each technique has its strengths and considerations, and researchers can exercise discretion in choosing the appropriate method. The learning curve method excels in providing a more systematic understanding of the model’s learning process across models and modalities. There is a long tradition in cognitive science and computational neuroscience of examining the internal representations of models [9–12]. One reason for this is to determine if a model’s features or processes reflect processes of the human mind. Such models can be informative for inferring properties of human mental processing, and so have direct theoretical implications. For example, Elman [13] and others [14] showed that RNNs can learn patterns sufficiently complex to resemble human grammar. By examining the internal activations of these recurrent networks, they showed that these systems are driven by graded, statistical features. Words are not discrete “symbols” but scalar vectors conditioned by linguistic context in time [15]. This was taken to challenge theories that see language as a purely abstract and symbolic recursive process [16]. Inspired by prior work, the learning curve method we proposed uses temporal mapping (information processing and developmental trajectories) to help modelers more comprehensively understand the underlying learning and decision-making processes of a complex model architecture without delving into the intricacies of interpreting its internal representations directly [23, 38]. This kind of systematic and quantitative approach has recently gained popularity in both computational cognitive science and deep learning communities [5, 38, 63–65], as it facilitates multidimensional comparisons across models and modalities, which were previously seen as challenging for DNN-like models. The current study illustrates multiple techniques for analyzing model learning experiences and highlights three insights across different communication modalities based on these analyses. Future studies can utilize this learning curve mapping approach to enhance model interpretability studies by evaluating a model’s appropriateness for the task at hand, examining the properties of the underlying input signals, and assessing the model’s alignment (or lack thereof) with human learning experiences, which is also a critical consideration for computational cognitive science and neuroscience research.

McDonald’s customers aren’t “lovin’ it.” The fast-food giant missed Wall Street’s expectations for the fourth quarter, largely due to the lingering effects of an E. coli outbreak and ongoing inflation pressures. The October incident sickened hundreds of customers and caused a massive drop in foot traffic, leading to a decline in same-store sales. In early trading, McDonald’s shares were slightly up. “Our fourth-quarter performance reflects the impact of the food incident,” CEO Chris Kempczinski said during the company’s Feb. 10 earnings call. The Illinois-based company reported revenue of $6.39 billion, missing Wall Street’s forecast of $6.44 billion in revenue, while earnings per share came in at $2.80 — meeting expectations. Additionally, U.S. same-store sales fell 1.4% year-over-year, surpassing the Street’s modest projection of 0.6%. The impact of the E. Coli outbreak, which began in late Oct. 2024, has started to reveal the toll it took on McDonald’s performance. Citi analyst Jon Tower said in a research note that he believes the outbreak marked the company’s “low point” and sees the coming quarter as “setting the table” for a recovery. However, inflation remains a challenge and is expected to persist in the near future. Jan. 2025 was another tough month for McDonald’s, despite optimism surrounding its McValue platform. BTIG analyst Peter Saleh noted that severe weather conditions across the U.S. complicated efforts to determine whether the value menu had increased foot traffic. In a note covering the restaurant industry, Bank of America set a 12-month price target of $312 for McDonald’s, reflecting steady growth expectations despite the challenges of its franchised business model. In Nov. 2024, the company announced a $100 million investment to support marketing efforts and franchisee operations. About 95% of U.S. locations are run by franchisees. BoA highlighted both upside and downside risks: Stronger-than-expected sales and cost savings could boost McDonald’s stock, while slow sales and margin pressure from inflation could weigh on its performance. According to foot-traffic analytics firm Placer.ai, inflation likely contributed to dips in McDonald’s visits, while budget-conscious consumers flocked to limited-time offers and special releases. The company has capitalized on this trend, driving significant foot traffic with the June launch of its $5 Meal Deal. Additionally, the Chicken Big Mac, introduced in Oct. 2024, drove a 7.2% increase in visits during its first week. The promotions help McDonald’s maintain its relevance. The company recently launched a “McValue” menu, expanding on its $5 meal deal. It’s also bringing back the Shamrock Shake. Other nostalgic promotions, such as collector’s cups relaunched in Aug. 2024, have proven extremely successful. The cups were so popular that customers resold them on third-party websites such as eBay for as much as $100 each. Elsewhere, McDonald’s also made headlines in Oct. 2024 when President Donald Trump staged a cook shift at a Pennsylvania location. The company quickly clarified it had no involvement in the event, noting that it was not “red or blue, but golden.” In Jan. 2025, McDonald’s announced it would scale back its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) efforts, joining the likes of Google, Meta, and Walmart — but not Costco.

February 10, 2025 08:33 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, Feb. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Novo Nordisk, you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/novo-nordisk-as. Investors have until March 25, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and is captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, et al., No. 25-cv-00713. Why was Novo Nordisk Sued for Securities Fraud? Novo Nordisk is a healthcare company focused on the research, development, manufacturing, and distribution of pharmaceutical products globally. During the relevant period, Novo Nordisk was conducting its highly anticipated Phase 3 study, REDEFINE-1, for CagriSema, an investigational drug developed for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Novo Nordisk discussed REDEFINE-1’s trial protocol and anticipated results, stating that, after a dose escalation period, participants receiving CagriSema were to receive a once-weekly maintenance dosage of 2.4 mg cagrilintide and 2.4 mg semaglutide for the remainder of the trial period. In truth, REDEFINE-1 employed a flexible dosing design that left it to patient discretion to choose both their maintenance dose and any decision to lower the dosing during the trial. This undisclosed trial design introduced a heightened risk that jeopardized the Company’s ability to achieve its anticipated results The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On December 20, 2024, Novo Nordisk announced that CagriSema had missed its expected average weight loss target at the conclusion of the REDEFINE-1 trial. The Company attributed its diminished result, in part, on the previously undisclosed “flexible” nature of the protocol whereby patients were able to “modify their dosing throughout the trial.” This flexibility resulted in less than 60% of patients taking the contemplated maintenance dose at the end of the trial. On this news, the price of Novo Nordisk stock declined roughly 18% during the course of the trading day, from a closing price of $103.44 per share on December 19, 2024 to $85.00 per share on December 20, 2024.

Title: Meta set to notify workers impacted by its performance-based cuts

Welcome back! President Donald Trump said that he plans to impose 25% tariffs today on imports of steel and aluminum. Gold hit a record high following the news, while some related currencies softened against the dollar. In today's big story, Meta employees impacted by its performance-based cuts are getting notified today. What's on deck Markets: Palantir and retail investors are a match made in heaven. Tech: Consulting executives told us the prompts they use to get the most out of AI. Business: The billionaire heirs desperate to give away their money. But first, a "reduction of force." If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. The day after the Super Bowl is always tough at work, but it's about to be particularly hard for some Meta employees. Today Meta is starting to notify workers impacted by its performance-based job cuts. Less than a month ago, CEO Mark Zuckerberg told employees the tech giant was firing 5% of its entire workforce to speed up how quickly it got rid of low performers. (He wasn't that blunt, but the point stands.) Business Insider's Jyoti Mann got the internal memo detailing how the cuts will work. When it's all said and done, some 4,000 Meta workers are expected to be shown the door. Jyoti, Pranav Dixit, and Hugh Langley spoke to some employees about the vibes inside Meta leading up to the cuts — "feels like living in a George Orwell novel," one worker said — along with how they play into Meta's broader reorganization efforts. The layoffs come as Meta has made some other seismic shifts. From overhauling its content moderation system and nixing DEI programs to doubling its investment in AI, Meta hasn't wasted time in what Zuckerberg has said will be an "intense year." Coincidentally, Meta employees are having their own issues with content moderation. Some workers have questioned Meta's removal of posts and comments from its internal forum. Meta's Community Engagement Expectations restrict mocking protected categories like race, but some employees accused the tech giant of censoring valid discussions. Internal drama isn't the only problem Meta is facing. The fight for AI dominance is heating up and getting more expensive. Meta expects its capital expenditure to be as high as $65 billion this year, about double what it spent in 2022. Meta's push for open-source AI models also contradicts what some of its competitors are doing, which could either boost it or backfire. A jump in delinquencies in a corner of the mortgage market suggests first-time homebuyers may be struggling. 1. Palantir + retail investors = big returns. CEO Alex Karp doesn't fit the Wall Street mold, so it's not surprising his approach to investors doesn't either. Instead of the IPO route, Palantir went for a direct listing, and — during earnings calls — Karp often prioritizes retail investor questions. These mom-and-pop investors are reaping the rewards, with the stock up more than 47% this year. 2. The White House's opening pro-crypto move. AI and crypto czar David Sacks announced on Tuesday that the Trump administration has prioritized a federal stablecoins bill. Stablecoins, which are cryptos pegged to fiat currencies, could help ensure US dollar dominance, a crypto expert told BI. That's because about 98% of the stablecoins are tied to the greenback. 3. The investor gold rush amid Trump-era policies. Trump's administration has spurred trade and geopolitical uncertainty, so investors are flocking to the yellow metal as a safe haven. Gold hit a record high today after Trump on Sunday threatened steel and aluminum tariffs. Ahead of Trump's comments, IGN said it had expected gold to reach $3,000 an ounce this quarter. 1. Rise of the (VC-backed) robots. A few startups are building autonomous robots, with some US companies securing up to $150 million in funding. The robots use AI and spatial intelligence to do everything from making coffee to helping with surgery. BI found 12 businesses to watch. 2. X has a new adtech partner. Elon Musk's company is working with Magnite, a supply-side platform that helps publishers manage and sell advertising. X has been working to reverse the losses it took when many advertisers left the platform in 2022, though Musk's beef with them is still going strong. 3. How McKinsey and the Big Four use AI. BI asked execs at five big consulting firms — McKinsey, PwC, KPMG, EY, and Deloitte — their best tips for using AI in everyday work. They told us their favorite prompts and advice for getting the most out of the tech. 1. These wealthy heirs want to divest — from themselves. One conference is helping rich — and mostly young — people grapple with their identities and redistribute their funds to causes that matter. The up-and-coming millionaires and billionaires are also finding community (albeit a small one) along the way. 2. Are we making eggs-cuses for all these price hikes? Most people know that egg prices have skyrocketed lately, in part because bird flu has decimated the egg-laying hen population. But when customers are primed to expect price hikes, some retailers can hike prices beyond what's really necessary. Are retailers surcharging to stay afloat, or is there a bit of fowl play at work? 3. RTO FAQs. If you're one of the tens of thousands of Americans recently affected by an order to return to the office, fear not. BI has assembled a guide to help you prepare, including commute planning and deciding what to wear. Every song on Kendrick Lamar's Super Bowl halftime show setlist. Jump to

Today’s Forbes Daily newsletter covers buy now, pay later fintech Sezzle, how Philadelphia Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie made his fortune, the latest jobs data and a conversation with actor Issa Rae. The next time you see higher prices at the grocery store, there could be an unexpected culprit: a bee shortage. In an unprecedented event, bees died off by the millions this winter, resulting in financial losses of more than $139 million, according to a new survey. The bee industry is in full panic as California’s almond season is set to begin, which requires most of the country’s 3 million honey bee colonies to pollinate the trees. And it’s not just almonds that will be affected: Bees are needed to pollinate fruits like blueberries, cherries, cranberries and apples. There’s no known cause for this recent colony collapse. “We’ve seen tough times in the bee business before, but this one seems to be a different flavor,” one beekeeper told Forbes. A worker at an aluminum profile production company in Binzhou, Shandong province, China in 2024. President Donald Trump plans to announce new tariffs Monday of 25% on all imports of steel and aluminum, and shares of steelmaker U.S. Steel and aluminum producer Alcoa surged in pre-market trading early Monday. Trump also said his promised “reciprocal tariffs” will be announced Tuesday, and reiterated that he still intends to impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico after pausing the implementation of those taxes by 30 days last week. MORE: Trump said Japan’s Nippon Steel agreed to drop its nearly $15 billion bid to acquire U.S. Steel Friday and will “heavily” invest in the company instead, after the yearlong merger deal faced bipartisan opposition. Facing bigger and better-funded competitors like Affirm and Klarna, Minneapolis-based buy-now, pay-later fintech Sezzle needed a new revenue source and strategy. CEO and cofounder Charlie Youakim found both by focusing on heavy users: chronic buy-now, pay-later addicts. Sezzle launched a $12.99-a-month subscription service aimed at these frequent fliers, with benefits like access to more retailers and flexibility in rescheduling payments. Billionaire Bill Ackman disclosed Friday his hedge fund made a major bet on ride-hailing giant Uber, helping boost shares of the San Francisco-based company to their highest level in months despite a rollercoaster week. Ackman’s assessment of Uber reflects a growing consensus that the long-time cash-burning business has actually grown to be one of the cheapest big stocks compared to its bottom line. In the first jobs report since Trump’s inauguration, the U.S. added fewer jobs than expected in the weakest start to a year for overall job growth since before the Covid-19 pandemic. Still, other data points revealed a resilient labor market, and the unemployment rate last month was a better-than-expected 4%. Two of the biggest police surveillance companies in the U.S., Axon Enterprise and Flock Safety, are ending a long-standing partnership, in what’s become a bitter, public spat. Cops are already fretting about what the bust-up could mean for law enforcement: One police drone pilot in New Jersey told Forbes that when companies like Axon and Flock don’t work together, it ends up costing cops more. Just months after raising $1.5 billion at a $14 billion valuation, defense tech giant Anduril is in talks to raise another funding round that would value it at $28 billion, Forbes learned Friday. News of the talks comes amid a froth of investor interest in tech companies developing national security products to peddle to the Pentagon. President Donald Trump shocked world leaders last week with his proposal to transform Gaza from a “hellhole” into the “Riviera of the Middle East”, but it’s not the first time Trump has floated luxury development as an urban revitalization tool. It was the late 1970s when Trump became intrigued by Atlantic City, but his casino and hotel empire there was swamped by debt, leading to bankruptcies by the early 1990s. Trump said Sunday night he has ordered the Treasury Secretary to stop minting new pennies, citing the cost of production for the coin, which has been higher than its face value for nearly two decades. It is unclear if the president will be able to act unilaterally to halt the coin’s production or if it would require legislation from Congress. Philadelphia Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie celebrates with the Lombardi Trophy after defeating the Kansas City Chiefs during Super Bowl LIX at Caesars Superdome on February 9, 2025 in New Orleans. Jeffrey Lurie mortgaged his family fortune to buy the struggling Philadelphia Eagles in 1994. Now, after their decisive 40-22 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LIX, Philadelphia is one of the NFL’s most valuable franchises and a two-time champion. As one of Hollywood’s busiest multi­hyphenates, Issa Rae has parlayed a film and television career into a jewelry collection, a haircare company, a Prosecco brand—just to name a few. Despite her budding empire, Rae, who portrayed Presi­dent Barbie in 2023’s Barbie, insists she doesn’t have a master plan. “It happened organically, and it happened because these were things that we were all already doing,” she says. President Donald Trump temporarily reinstated the “de minimis” loophole that allows packages from China valued at under $800 to be processed without customs duties or tariffs, but his new executive order signed Friday states the exemption will cease for good upon further review by the new U.S. commerce secretary. The change had prompted confusion among e-commerce retailers, shipping companies and Customs and Border Protection, leading the U.S. Postal Service to briefly suspend acceptance of packages from China. Echoing earlier statements, Trump has proposed ending a tax break used by private equity fund managers known as the carried-interest “loophole,” a move Barack Obama and Joe Biden also supported. Carried interest is the percentage of private equity investment profits that a fund manager or venture capitalist receives as compensation for their investment, and the Congressional Budget Office estimates that ending the loophole could reduce the federal deficit by $13 billion through 2034. “Every time Marc [Lore] has a new company, it's more and more ambitious, and if he pulls it off, it’s just a bigger story," says Accel partner Sameer Gandhi, who has invested in several of Lore's companies. TOPLINE Serial entrepreneur Marc Lore has dabbled in everything from e-commerce to baseball cards, and Forbes estimates such ventures have now made him worth $2.8 billion. Lore spent six years at three banks before quitting to start a company—any company. He and two childhood friends came up with the Pit, an online trading card marketplace they sold in 2001 for $6 million. After becoming a new parent, Lore dropped out of Wharton to cofound Diapers.com, which Amazon bought in 2010 for $500 million in cash, then reportedly shut down in 2017. Next was Jet.com, an e-commerce take on Costco that Walmart bought for $3.3 billion in 2016 and shuttered in 2020. Lore stayed on to run the retail giant’s online arm until 2021. Later that year, he teamed up with retired New York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez on a deal to buy the Minnesota Timberwolves and the WNBA’s Minnesota Lynx for about $1.5 billion—to be paid in four installments through 2024. The third installment ended up in arbitration, with a decision expected today. Lore’s latest gamble? Wonder, which bills itself as “a new kind of food hall.” He founded it in 2018 and took the reins as CEO after he left Walmart. The original idea was to purchase recipes and branding from trendy restaurants and celebrity chefs, cook meals in central kitchens, then deliver them in oven-equipped vans, though in early 2023, he swapped Wonder’s 450 vans for delivery-focused storefronts, losing $80 million in the process. It now has 35 locations and $470 million in revenue—a long way from Wonder’s dreamy predictions of $2 billion in sales this year and a $40 billion IPO in 2028. But given Lore’s track record, who would bet against him? WHY IT MATTERS “If you’re reading this from New York or New Jersey, chances are, you’ve seen an advertisement for Wonder,” says Forbes reporter Phoebe Liu. “How does a serial tech entrepreneur known for building, scaling and selling big businesses realize that he wants to spend 100 hours a week changing the way we think about dinner? What makes Marc Lore believe he can succeed in an industry where so many—notably including Uber cofounder Travis Kalanick—have struggled to turn a profit? For any aspiring entrepreneur, there’s something to take away from Lore’s story.” MORE How Daily Border Crossings Helped Turn This Mexican American Into A Billionaire The Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program, or VITA, provides free tax filing assistance to underserved communities.

Title: Shock and Awe Miscellany, 2/10/25
URL: https://www.patheos.com/blogs/geneveith/2025/02/shock-and-awe-miscellany-2-10-25/
Time Published: 2025-02-10T11:00:56Z
Full Content:
President Trump has been thinking outside the box, unleashing Elon Musk with his army of young tech prodigies, and doing what he said he would. His opponents are overwhelmed, and even his supporters cannot always get their heads around what he is doing. So here is a special Shock and Awe Miscellany. . . Do we really want Gaza? How can tariffs help our economy? Slashing the government. President Trump has had his eye on Canada and Greenland, hoping to make America great again by means of territorial acquisition. Whether or not that should be pursued, I can see the attraction of Greenland, with its immense mineral wealth and strategic location, and Canada, a developed Western nation that would be the equivalent in population and liberalism of a California North. But now the president has another territory he would like for the United States to have: Gaza, the 25 mile long by 3.7 to 7.5 mile wide strip of land bordering Israel, the Mediterranean Sea, and Egypt. Which is the site of the bloody war between Israel and Hamas. My question is, WHY? After a meeting with Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu, who is open to the idea, President Trump said this, according to the transcript: “I also strongly believe that the Gaza Strip, which has been a symbol of death and destruction for so many decades and so bad for the people anywhere near it, and especially those who live there and frankly who’s been really very unlucky. It’s been very unlucky. It’s been an unlucky place for a long time. “Being in its presence just has not been good and it should not go through a process of rebuilding and occupation by the same people that have really stood there and fought for it and lived there and died there and lived a miserable existence there. Instead, we should go to other countries of interest with humanitarian hearts, and there are many of them that want to do this and build various domains that will ultimately be occupied by the 1.8 million Palestinians living in Gaza, ending the death and destruction and frankly bad luck. “This can be paid for by neighbouring countries of great wealth. It could be one, two, three, four, five, seven, eight, 12. It could be numerous sites, or it could be one large site. But the people will be able to live in comfort and peace and we’ll make sure something really spectacular is done. “They’re going to have peace. They’re not going to be shot at and killed and destroyed like this civilisation of wonderful people has had to endure. The only reason the Palestinians want to go back to Gaza is they have no alternative. It’s right now a demolition site. This is just a demolition site. Virtually every building is down. “They’re living under fallen concrete that’s very dangerous and very precarious. They instead can occupy all of a beautiful area with homes and safety and they can live out their lives in peace and harmony instead of having to go back and do it again. “The US will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it too. We’ll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site, level the site and get rid of the destroyed buildings, level it out. Create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing for the people of the area … do a real job, do something different. America’s top three trading partners, combining both imports and exports, are Mexico ($798 billion), Canada ($773 billion), and China ($575 billion). Together, they account for 42% of America’s trade. Last week, President Trump imposed 25% tariffs on goods coming in from Mexico and Canada, and a 10% tariff on goods coming in from China. Those countries have vowed to retaliate with tariffs against American products. The reason the president gave for hitting our allies, with whom we have a free trade agreement negotiated by President Trump himself, over twice as hard as our adversary China, is that Mexico and Canada are not doing enough to stop illegal immigrants from crossing their borders into the U.S. Also that those porous borders are letting in the deadly drug Fentanyl. At this action, the stock market plunged, since the U.S. economy is highly dependent on world trade, both imports for our supply chains and consumer goods and exports, to sell U.S. products. But by the end of the week, both Mexico and Canada agreed to put 10,000 troops along the border to deter illegal immigrants and Fentanyl smuggling. So the president paused the tariffs for 30 days. So perhaps the threat of the tariffs was just the president throwing the nation’s weight around, a way to force countries to comply with our demands. And yet, President Trump likes tariffs, calling them “the greatest things ever invented,” and the duty on China’s products remains and is likely to go higher. (He earlier proposed a 60% tariff on China.) My question is, how would it be possible to implement such tariffs without triggering massive inflation? Importers always add the duty fees to the cost of the product. That would inflate the prices of just about everything Americans buy on Walmart and Amazon. But that’s not all. If tariffs are successful in limiting the amount of imports, so that more people “buy American,” the drop in overall supply plus the greater demand for domestically-produced goods will also send prices higher. The hope is that tariffs will help American manufacturing, but American industries are highly dependent on other countries for raw materials and parts necessary for their supply line. In time, the American economy could probably adjust, but that will take a long and painful time. Meanwhile, the loss of foreign markets for American products can only mean hard times for our companies, layoffs for our workers, and hardship for our farmers. Is there a way that high tariffs (traditionally a policy favored by liberal Democrats) could possibly help the American economy? To his credit, President Trump is slashing the overgrown federal government. The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, is decimating the federal work force and is eliminating entire agencies. To those who complain that no one elected Musk, I would say that no one elected the IRS agent who collected my taxes or the TSA agent who screened me at the airport. They were simply acting by virtue of the authority given to them by the Executive Branch of the government, under the auspices of the President of the United States. Musk is acting on the authority of the democratically-elected president, who is the head of said Executive Branch. One casualty was the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which was completely eliminated, with its foreign aid function transferred to the State Department. Observes John Daniel Davidson, “In the six decades since it was established, USAID has gone from fighting poverty, spreading American ideals, and undercutting Soviet propaganda, to becoming a woke propaganda operation of its own that actively undermines the pillars of western civilization. . . .Everywhere you look in the USAID database, you see projects promoting LGBTQ ideology, mass immigration, multiculturalism, DEI, climate change-ism, and the like. You see programs that undermine the traditional family, that enable anti-free speech censorship, that strive to make the rest of the world just like urban liberal enclaves in the U.S.” He cites some of the grants: “$70,000 for a ‘DEI musical’ in Ireland, $47,000 for a ‘transgender opera’ in Colombia, $32,000 for a ‘transgender comic book’ in Peru, and $1.5 million for an LGBT jobs program in Serbia.” (Go here for more.) In a bigger move, all federal workers were offered a buyout of eight months severance and benefits. If they don’t, they risk losing their jobs as part of a reduction in force. So far, some 60,000 have accepted, about 3% of the federal workforce, though the overall goal is to cut the number of employees by 5%-10%. One agency offering buyouts to its entire workforce is the CIA. Though most national security personnel were exempt from the cutbacks, the new CIA Director John Ratcliffe decided to apply it to his clandestine domain. Granted, that institution has been guilty of hugely consequential intelligence failures (e.g., Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction, the Taliban’s victory in Afghanistan) and scandalous political interventions (e.g., the Russiagate scandal, the Hunter Biden laptop coverup). A house cleaning is certainly in order. But if some agents or their handlers decide to take early retirement from their dangerous work, can we risk losing our spy networks in places like China, Russia, and Iran? Shouldn’t the pruning, for the CIA and elsewhere, be more targeted? UPDATE: A federal judge has paused the buyouts.

Title: CoinEx Research January 2025 Report: Trumpian Bitcoin Amid Alts Anxiety
URL: https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/02/10/3023267/0/en/CoinEx-Research-January-2025-Report-Trumpian-Bitcoin-Amid-Alts-Anxiety.html
Time Published: 2025-02-10T11:00:00Z

February 10, 2025 06:00 ET | Source: CoinEx CoinEx HONG KONG, Feb. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CoinEx Research's January 2025 report highlights a volatile month that is shaped by political developments, institutional participation, and macroeconomic factors. Bitcoin surged past $100,000 to reach a new all-time high, while altcoins struggled due to liquidity drained by Trump-related tokens. The emergence of China’s DeepSeek AI model further unsettled global tech and crypto markets, leading to a valuation reset. Institutional Bitcoin adoption continued to gain traction, but a late-month pullback raised concerns about potential market consolidation. A Volatile Start to 2025Bitcoin opened the year at approximately $92,500 and closed near $102,000, demonstrating resilience despite a turbulent macroeconomic backdrop. The Federal Reserve maintained interest rates at 4.25%–4.50%, citing a strong labour market and persistent inflation, while the Bank of Japan raised its policy rate from 0.25% to 0.50%. The launch of the Official Trump Memecoin and Trump-linked World Liberty Finance (WLFI) captured market attention, but their liquidity absorption limited altcoin growth. Given the current conditions, Bitcoin may enter a near-term consolidation phase due to the lack of immediate bullish catalysts. The Trump Effect: Memecoins and DeFi Expansion Donald Trump’s influence in the crypto market grew significantly ahead of his inauguration. His team launched the Official Trump Memecoin on Solana’s Meteora platform, bypassing traditional SOL-based liquidity providers like Raydium. This decision helped push Solana’s stablecoin supply beyond $9 billion, a 130% increase, and drove Solana’s DEX trading volume to an all-time high of $258 billion, three times that of Ethereum. The memecoin’s fully diluted valuation (FDV) exceeded $70 billion at its peak, surpassing leading memecoins such as SHIB, PEPE, and WIF. The speculative rally continued with the surprise launch of the Melania Token by First Lady Melania Trump, further intensifying trading activity. However, back-to-back token launches exhausted market liquidity, leading to an eventual pullback. Meanwhile, the Trump-linked World Liberty Finance (WLFI), a DeFi project on Ethereum, successfully raised over $300 million in its presale. This signaled that the Trump crypto narrative extended beyond memecoins to include institutional-style DeFi products, blending speculative and financial elements. DeepSeek AI’s Disruptive Impact on Global Markets China’s DeepSeek AI model, launched just before the Lunar New Year, sent shockwaves through global AI and financial markets. With a training cost significantly lower than its Western counterparts—DeepSeek introduced a cost-efficient alternative powered by a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. This method optimizes computational efficiency by selectively activating only the most relevant sub-networks per query. DeepSeek’s debut triggered a major sell-off in U.S. tech stocks, with Nvidia (NVDA) plummeting 17% in a single day as investors reassessed the competitive landscape. AI-themed crypto tokens also suffered heavy losses due to broader risk-off sentiment. However, rather than being a structural threat, DeepSeek’s emergence represents a necessary market recalibration that could accelerate AI adoption and unlock new crypto-related opportunities. Source: LiveBench Institutional Bitcoin Adoption and Policy Shifts Institutional participation in Bitcoin remained strong in January, supported by major policy developments. SEC Acting Chair Mark Uyeda established a crypto task force, and President Trump signed an executive order in his first week promoting crypto innovation, signaling a shift toward broader adoption. In Illinois, lawmakers advanced a bill to create a state Bitcoin reserve, following Arizona’s move to integrate cryptocurrency into public finance. Outside the U.S., sovereign institutions also increased their Bitcoin exposure. The Czech Central Bank approved Bitcoin for inclusion in its national reserves, while Norway’s Sovereign Wealth Fund disclosed a 150% year-on-year increase in its Bitcoin holdings, now exceeding $350 million. These moves highlighted a growing confidence in Bitcoin as a legitimate store of value among government treasuries and institutional investors. Stablecoin Inflows and Market Caution Stablecoins continued to see strong inflows, with approximately $9.9 billion entering the market in January. This sustained a three-month trend of capital influx, supporting the bullish structure of the market. Bitcoin’s new all-time highs coincided with these inflows, reinforcing the importance of stablecoin liquidity in market momentum. However, despite the positive trend, a notable market pullback in late January suggests a cautious outlook. If stablecoin inflows slow or turn into net outflows, the market could face a period of consolidation, leading to increased volatility. Investors should closely monitor stablecoin trends as an indicator of broader market sentiment. Market Outlook for February 2025 Looking ahead, the market’s direction in February will be shaped by institutional developments, regulatory policies, and stablecoin movements. Traders and investors should remain vigilant, adjusting their strategies in response to evolving macroeconomic conditions and liquidity trends.

Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, will begin issuing layoff notices starting today. These job cuts, referred to as 'performance terminations,' will primarily target the lowest-performing 5% of employees. Unlike previous layoffs, Meta plans to keep its offices open on the day of the cuts and will not release a company-wide statement. #News Meta to lay off about 4,000 employees due to poor performance Social media giant #Meta will reportedly layoff 3,600 employees this year, according to recent filings.

In a memo, these cuts were labeled as “performance terminations,” a term initially reported by The Information. Unlike prior company-wide layoffs, Meta will keep its offices open on Monday and will not provide additional details about the decisions, according to a memo from Janelle Gale, Meta’s Head of People. In a separate memo posted on Friday, Peng Fan, Meta’s VP of Engineering for Monetization, urged employees to support an expedited hiring process for machine learning engineers and other "business-critical" engineering roles. This accelerated hiring initiative is set to run from February 11 to March 13. Meta decided to layoff 3,600 employees citing low-performance. On the surface, it is about efficiency.

Google initiated a voluntary exit program in its U.S. Platforms and Devices team, affecting Android and Pixel. Microsoft focused on performance-based terminations, some without severance. Amazon cut 200 jobs in fashion and fitness divisions, realigning its North America Stores team. Stripe laid off 300 employees in product, engineering, and operations, despite plans to grow its workforce by 17% by year-end. Robinhood's media arm, Sherwood, also downsized as part of a restructuring.

Facebook celebrated its 21st birthday last week and investors are in party mood. Already up 18 per cent in 2025, Meta gained 13 days in a row – the longest winning streak in its history. Stunning numbers are nothing new for Facebook. Begun in Mark Zuckerberg’s Harvard dorm in 2004, the company went public in 2012 and, after enduring a few tricky initial months, subsequently went skyward. A $10,000 (€9,633) investment in Meta at its May 2012 price would be worth $184,200 today, notes Bespoke Investment. Still, buying the stock is one thing; holding on is another. Bespoke notes that between September 2021 and November 2022, Meta lost three-quarters of its value. Chastened, Zuckerberg reined in the spending on the so-called metaverse. Soon after, ChatGPT came along, the AI boom began, and Meta soared nearly 800 per cent. Still, it’s human nature to cut your winners and bank profits, so holding on during a bull market can be as difficult as during a bear market. As Meta’s history proves, the hardest part of investing isn’t picking winners; it’s having the stomach to hold them. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: DeepSeek, Alibaba & The AI Race
URL: https://www.luxuo.com/business/deepseek-alibaba-the-ai-race.html
Time Published: 2025-02-10T04:01:21Z
Full Content:
With China’s DeepSeek challenging Silicon Valley’s dominance and AI’s influence extending from policy-making to consumer behaviour, the AI race is no longer about innovation — it is about who wields the power. As AI-powered personal assistants become deeply embedded in the daily lives of large corporations, businesses and individuals alike, the balance between convenience and control is shifting. From China’s DeepSeek to the West’s AI race, artificial intelligence is no longer just a tool — it is an omnipresent force shaping global surveillance, economic power structures, and the future of digital autonomy. As AI systems become more advanced and widely available — often for free or at a fraction of the cost — what is their real value and if AI developers are the ones truly benefitting, what does that mean for the rest of us? Read More: The Influence of AI in the Interior Design Industry Chinese AI model DeepSeek, which recently took Silicon Valley by surprise and became one of the most downloaded apps in the United States has raised security concerns due to a “hidden code” that allegedly transmits user data to the Chinese government, according to cybersecurity experts. Researchers from Feroot Security, a Canada-based cybersecurity firm, discovered that DeepSeek’s browser-based version not only collects user information but also generates a unique digital “fingerprint” to track activity across multiple websites. Read More: The Influence of AI in the Interior Design Industry Launched in January 2025 as a free, open-source platform, DeepSeek sent shockwaves through the tech industry, triggering over USD 1 trillion in stock market losses and threatening the dominance of U.S. leaders such as Nvidia. Its sudden rise has cast doubt on the perceived dominance of well-funded U.S. AI companies like OpenAI, which has reportedly invested billions in similar technologies. As the South China Morning Post reports, Hangzhou-based DeepSeek rose to worldwide fame last month after it released the V3 large language model (LLM) and R1 reasoning model, which the company said showed capabilities comparable to products from ChatGPT creator OpenAI, despite being developed at significantly lower costs. DeepSeek was founded by entrepreneur and businessman Liang Feng in 2023. By offering an advanced AI tool for free — despite its relatively low reported development costs — DeepSeek is reported to have unsettled Silicon Valley and challenged assumptions about American leadership in the AI space. The AI landscape is no longer a Silicon Valley monopoly as for years, Silicon Valley dictated the pace of AI development, but that dominance is slipping. The rise of Chinese firms — particularly DeepSeek — has accelerated global competition, leading to an unprecedented shift in technological power. No longer is the race confined to a handful of Western tech giants — now, Eastern AI firms are outpacing them in speed, efficiency, and sophistication. Despite DeepSeek’s rise, the Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Meta continue to “pour billions into artificial intelligence”. The report states that Microsoft, Google, and Meta Platforms are projected to collectively invest over USD 215 billion in capital expenditures for their current fiscal years, marking an annual rise of more than 45 percent. Meanwhile, Amazon.com — while withholding a full-year forecast — indicated that its total capex across various divisions is set to exceed USD 100 billion, with the bulk of this increase being directed towards AI development. These figures reflect the growing intensity of the AI race, despite investor concerns surrounding the influence of China’s DeepSeek and the uncertainty over whether these major U.S. firms will see a return on their massive investments. Investors are particularly unsettled by DeepSeek’s ability to replicate much of the functionality of leading American AI systems, all while spending less and utilising fewer, less powerful chips, as claimed by its Chinese creators. However, U.S. company leaders remain confident, highlighting their own technological progress and arguing that reduced costs will drive AI adoption and boost demand for cloud services, which AI heavily relies on to function. So why do Western AI models struggle with inferential reasoning compared to their Eastern counterparts? AI development in countries like Russia and China often take a more centralised, state-backed strategy. This support includes access to vast amounts of data and resources, which can help hone the models to specific needs, including advanced reasoning. Western companies may not have the same access to data and government-driven initiatives that prioritise AI development. Then there is the discussion of public versus private sector approaches. Different countries are taking varied approaches to AI regulation, with the public and private sectors playing distinct roles. In China, for instance, the government leads AI development, driving a centralised strategy that ensures national interests are prioritised. In contrast, the West follows a more fragmented, market-driven approach, where tech giants hold significant sway. This highlights how each model presents its own set of challenges and opportunities for growth and governance in the AI rat race. DeepSeek’s latest iteration has redefined the limits of AI-powered assistants. Unlike standard chatbots, which rely on predefined responses, DeepSeek anticipates user needs before they even ask. It analyses past interactions, contextual nuances, and even subconscious patterns to refine its responses. Unlike ChatGPT, which still struggles with complex inferential reasoning, DeepSeek has developed a more sophisticated approach — one that does not just respond but understands intent between the lines. This raises a critical question: while Western AI models prioritise accessibility and ethical constraints, Eastern firms are refining AI to a near-intuitive level. Will this give them a strategic advantage? And what does this level of sophistication mean for privacy and control? However, despite once being a frontrunner in advanced AI models, DeepSeek has now been dethroned by an even more sophisticated competitor in Alibaba. According to a report by USA Today, Alibaba’s release of its Qwen 2.5-Max artificial intelligence model on the first day of the Lunar New Year highlights the intense pressure exerted by DeepSeek’s recent success. Qwen 2.5-Max — according to Alibaba’s cloud unit — surpasses both DeepSeek-V3 and other leading models like GPT-4o and Llama-3.1-405B in performance. This move follows DeepSeek’s disruptive impact, particularly after its DeepSeek-V2 model, which triggered a price war in China by being open-source and exceptionally low-cost. In response, Chinese firms like ByteDance, Baidu, and Tencent have quickly updated their own models to stay competitive, further intensifying the AI arms race within China and globally. Read More: The OpenAI Debate and the Ramification of Improper AI Governance AI is already shaping human behaviour in ways most people do not realise. From a commercial aspect with AI-written books and deepfake models used for branded commercials to automated journalism, artificial intelligence is not just assisting creativity — it is replacing it. The question is no longer whether AI will generate content but whether we will be able to distinguish human work from machine-generated output. Most users engage with AI tools without realising they are feeding them data — data that becomes fuel for even more advanced learning systems. Governments and corporations are increasingly aware of AI’s power, leading to rising restrictions and tighter control. AI’s presence is often unseen — tracking, predicting, and influencing decisions without users’ explicit awareness. The rise of AI platforms like DeepSeek has sparked new conversations around digital sovereignty. With AI models and data being controlled by a select group of tech giants, the question of who owns and governs digital resources becomes ever more pressing. As seen with the United States’ Silicon Valley, nations that develop and control their own AI technology may gain unprecedented power, influencing global economic and political dynamics. Read More: Is Cinema Preparing for An AI Takeover? With Oracle debuting its AI agents, the next phase of the AI race is here. These self-learning systems are not just programmed to respond; they adapt, evolve, and outthink human-driven decisions. The race is not about creating better chatbots — it is about who can build AI systems that function independently of human intervention. DeepSeek’s latest model faced immediate restrictions from hundreds of companies and government agencies. A newly proposed law in the U.S. could impose hefty fines or even prison sentences on individuals who use the Chinese AI app DeepSeek. The bill — introduced by Republican Senator Josh Hawley — seeks to ban U.S. citizens from contributing to the advancement of artificial intelligence technology in China. It also aims to restrict the importation of AI-related technology or intellectual property developed within the country. If passed, the legislation would enforce strict penalties, including fines of up to USD 1 million for individuals and as much as USD 100 million for businesses. Those found in violation could also face up to 20 years in prison. It is not all doom and gloom, despite the fear-mongering surrounding AI, its real impact is already proving to be transformative. From streamlining business operations to ensuring fairer decision-making in industries like insurance and governance, AI is stepping in where human limitations exist. Rather than a threat, AI could be the key to a more efficient, equitable, and forward-thinking world. One such argument is that AI is not replacing human intelligence but rather amplifying it. Insurance, healthcare and the finance industry could benefit from some element of AI intervention. With insurance, AI can be used to analyse patterns in claims to identify potential fraud while AI-powered automation could speed up claims approvals, reducing paperwork and human errors. As it stands, chatbots already handle routine inquiries, AI could make machine learning models assess customer data to offer personalised policies, improve efficiency and reduce wait times. From the administration angle, AI could reduce paperwork and improve patient data management within the healthcare sector while AI-driven models can predict stock market trends and optimise trading strategies within finance and banking. AI has the potential to meet growing demands that are no longer humanly possible to fulfill at a large scale. AI also has the potential to eliminate human biases in vetting processes, from loans to medical diagnostics. AI automated systems could ensure consistency and prevent human errors or prejudices alongside faster, data-driven decisions that benefit businesses and consumers alike. AGI stands for artificial general intelligence and refers to machines that are able to apply their knowledge and learning ability to a wide range of tasks. Most AI today is “narrow” or “specialised” and designed for specific tasks. True generalised AI will have the capacity to think, act and behave far more closely to the way we do across tasks involving creativity and complex problem-solving. Instead of resisting AI, embracing it for good could be the biggest opportunity of our generation. The real failure is not AI — it is the lack of vision on how it is implemented. Smart systems are helping governments make better infrastructure and policy decisions. The debate of AI ethics has been ongoing for decades and it is time to focus on solutions instead of fueling paranoia. AI is not the problem — how we choose to use (or misuse) it is. Read More: For Better or Worse: Here Is How AI Artist Botto is Reshaping the Art Industry The AI race is no longer about innovation alone — it is about control. With each advancement, AI developers are not just creating better tools; they are designing systems that learn from us, adapt, and evolve. While AI is being given away for free or at minimal cost, the real currency is data, influence, and power. There should also be some importance placed on having diverse teams in AI development as AI systems are shaped by the biases and perspectives of those who create them. Without a diverse group of developers, there is a risk that AI may perpetuate social inequalities or missed opportunities for more inclusive solutions. The real failure is not the implementation of AI itself but rather the profit-driven rush to dominate it. It is a scene all too familiar — when left unchecked, technological advancements prioritise corporate gains over public good. Governments should have systems in place to ensure AI serves society, not just those who control it. Yet, this has been an ongoing discussion for at least the last 30 years or so — warning of automation, bias, and unchecked surveillance — only to find ourselves repeating the same cycle.

Title: What DeepSeek? Big Tech keeps its AI building boom alive.

Monday, 10 Feb 2025 Construction for a new Microsoft data centre in East Wenatchee, Washington on Nov 3, 2024. An apparent breakthrough in efficiency from the Chinese start-up did not make tech’s biggest companies question their extravagant spending on new data centres. — ©2025 The New York Times SEATTLE: Wall Street went into panic mode about two weeks ago after the Chinese startup DeepSeek released an artificial intelligence system that appeared to be radically more efficient than what its American competitors had built. The investors who had pumped trillions of dollars into tech stocks over the past few years worried whether the tens of billions of dollars that tech companies were spending on new data centres suddenly looked like comic overkill. But the biggest tech companies made clear in recent earnings reports that they believe there may be no such thing as overkill when it comes to new data centres. Amazon on Thursday implied that its capital expenditures – a figure that includes data center construction and other items like warehouses – could top US$100bil (RM443.93bil) this year. Microsoft said its spending could surpass US$80bil (RM357.63bil). Alphabet said it would spend US$75bil (RM335.28bil), and Meta reaffirmed plans to have capital spending hit as much as US$65bil (RM290.57bil). Combined, they could spend roughly US$100bil (RM443.93bil) more than last year on these projects. Executives urged patience. The problem right now, they said, is that customers want more AI than the companies can supply. And the only way they can meet demand is to build as much as they can as quickly as they can. “Whenever I see someone else do something better, I say, ‘Ugh, we should have done that’,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told employees at a companywide meeting last week, according to a recording obtained by The New York Times. “Competition is good, but we need to make sure that we win.” Here are some key points to understand this spend-happy moment for tech: Tech companies need more data centres than they have. Many of the companies say they’re constrained by the supply of chips, land and power needed to build data centres, and are racing to get more of them open. Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon all said they could have had higher cloud computing sales if they had the capacity. Cloud services are the typical way AI is delivered to customers. Alphabet saw “demand that exceeds our available capacity”, Anat Ashkenazi, Alphabet’s finance chief, told investors. “So we’ll be working hard to address that and make sure we bring more capacity online.” Microsoft has been saying that it has been constrained for a while, and previously told investors that the pressure would ease early this year. But this past week, when it reported its latest earnings, executives told investors that it might take until summer to get enough capacity up and running to meet the full demand. Its stock fell about 5% in after-hours trading after the report. They say greater efficiency will expand the use and demand for AI. While many people think about data centres as the enormously expensive, power-hungry places where advanced AI systems are developed, they are also where AI is deployed. Those are two different steps: training a model that underpins ChatGPT, versus asking ChatGPT for a recipe suggestion. Deploying AI is known as “inferencing” in the industry; it is where the tech companies increasingly say their businesses will boom. As costs come down, “AI will be much more ubiquitous,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told investors this past week. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told investors on Thursday that while a world where every app was infused with AI could be hard to fathom, “this is the world we’re thinking about all the time.” That vision, he said, has inferencing at its core. He argued that lowering the costs of inferencing would follow the pattern of previous technological trends: As the systems become less expensive to deploy, Jassy said, customers will “get excited about what else they could build that they always thought was cost-prohibitive before, and they usually end up spending a lot more in total.” The companies say they have to think about the long haul. Cloud providers are used to giving customers the illusion of endless supply, which means they must juggle having just enough data centres online to stream the video you want or answer your chatbot query. But they also can’t build too far in advance, locking up billions of dollars that could be deployed elsewhere. Balancing those two – particularly when securing land, chips and power for data centres can take years – is one of the enormous challenges the companies face. Executives have argued that they can adapt how they use the investments, between building and deploying AI models, and between serving their own core business and those of customers. Nadella said Microsoft’s infrastructure was “pretty fungible”. Ashkenazi said Google was also flexible. It could, for example, “repurpose capacity” to serve Google Search instead of cloud customers. Zuckerberg said Meta was studying DeepSeek and the ways it created efficiencies, but that investing heavily in data centres would be a strategic advantage against a small and nimble competitor. “We serve a billion-plus people – that’s just a lot of people, so more and more of the fleet is going toward running inference,” he told employees. Regardless of the explanation, cutting into profits – even the gaudy profits of tech’s biggest companies – is unlikely to thrill investors. Every company saw its share price fall after its earnings report. – ©2025 The New York Times Company Thank you for your report!

Title: Sometimes even 'bad press' is bad and these 10 tech rebrands prove it

Time Published: 2025-02-10T00:37:10Z
Full Content:
We love to hear about innovations in consumer technology that will "change the world." Often, the word "disruptive" is used to describe such innovations. But what happens when the disruption isn't to the world's status quo but to those attempting to disrupt it? You get gaffs like Airbnb's logo rebranding in 2014. Its Bélo symbol was involved in multiple controversies. Sometimes, a rebrand isn't as apparent as a new logo. Instead, it's a change in direction, like when Apple launched FCPX and alienated much of its professional audience. Recently, Microsoft rebranded Bing Chat, making it Microsoft Copilot, and experienced a failure. That got us thinking about other hilarious historical fails. Let's take a trip down nightmare memory lane to revisit the ten worst tech rebrands of all time. Are users really the focus anymore? Netflix started an online DVD rental service. When streaming was introduced in 2007, it was part of the fee you paid for DVD rentals. However, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings saw the future of online video consumption and had a plan. Hastings announced in July 2011 that Netflix would separate the two services. What was once $10 for DVD rentals and unlimited streaming would now be $7.99 for DVD rentals or streaming and $15.98 if you wanted both. Two months after the announcement, Netflix stock lost half its value. Hastings announced a new DVD rental service in September 2011 called Qwikster. Users needed to sign up for a new, separate account, but consumers weren't having it. So, Hastings and company shuttered that service one month later. "Fail fast," indeed. A new kid on the block tried to corner the mobile payment market in 2013. AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile backed the mobile wallet app, Isis. The app was intended to be its own payment vendor instead of a place to hold your credit and debit cards. But the timing for that name was horrible. The terrorist organization, Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, aka ISIS, made global headlines, making it challenging for those searching the internet for information about the mobile wallet Isis. Isis was rebranded to Softcard to make it search-friendly and to distance the brand from the terrorist organization. Isis Mobile Wallet/Softcard never took off. Still, you may be using remnants of its IP today because Google bought portions of Softcard and relaunched Google Wallet as Android Pay. An enterprising tech journalist, TechCrunch's Michael Arrington, regaled the world in 2008 with his vision of the casual computing future: the CrunchPad. Originally slated to retail for $200, the Singapore development studio Fusion Garage brought the tablet to market without Michael Arrington at the helm as the JooJoo. The JooJoo launched for $500 days before the iPad. "JooJoo" is the phonetic pronunciation of "juju," derived from the West African word for "luck." Launching before the iPad was bad luck because the iPad was a better device in terms of hardware and its app store ecosystem, which ensured the name rebrand wasn't the only reason the JooJoo would fail. Oxford University Press began printing in 1669 and is one of the most lauded producers of dictionaries. It published its first dictionary in 1884. But what happens when a brand with a centuries-long pedigree wants to bring its look into the 21st century? Like "The Shack," Oxford's modernizing wasn't for the better. Oxford University Press replaced its classic blue logo in 2014 with a modernized logo that it hoped would help it stand out and beat the competition. It did when it introduced its new Beats Words By Dre logo for Oxford Dictionaries. It looks familiar, right? When it brainstormed this, it didn't forget about Dre. I'm a fan of the artist enclave, DeviantArt. It's easy to get lost in the rabbit hole of genres of fan art, photography, literature, and more, but the logo you see today wasn't around before 2014. That year, it hired global independent design studio Moving Brands to help it move into the future as DeviantArt, presenting a new site layout to its users, called "deviants," and introduced a mobile app. With all of that came a logo redesign. It changed from its "DA" initials logo (top) to one with slices (bottom), and it was definitely "artistic." I'm still trying to determine if the green element is a step stool or a martial arts weapon called a "Tonfa." Microsoft 365 Office is the most widely used productivity suite in the corporate world. Its user base grew by 200 million in 2019, so there are many eyes on the company's brand. That means small things can become a big deal. Such is the case with the now viral name change and logo redesign for Microsoft 365 Office, now Microsoft 365 Copilot. Copilot is Microsoft's foray into artificial intelligence, and since AI is the future, I'm not mad about the name change. The hot takes came fast and furious when everyone saw the new logo, which had the M365 tag strewn across it so small it was almost illegible. Microsoft is all-in on its AI initiative, raising the subscription price for the first time in 13 years and integrating Copilot into the base plan instead of charging extra for a Copilot Pro subscription. Maybe it should've paid a bit extra to have that logo redesigned. Do more with Copilot Tech and science fiction go hand-in-hand. Star Trek communicators are now smartphones. "The Demolition Man" featured driverless cars, and now Waymo's on the road. Some movies seem to have a prescience about what's to come, and the folks in marketing at what was once known as the Sci-Fi channel wish they could've tapped into that quality before rebranding to SyFy. In Poland and other countries around the world, "Syfy" is synonymous with the STI syphilis. That's probably not what you want consumers to associate with your brand, but it wasn't enough to make SyFy rethink its redesign. The name remains today, and it is still ridiculed. I guess there's truly no such thing as "bad press." Radio Shack's move in 2008 to rebrand to "The Shack" to survive the recession in the United States didn't work out well. It tried to remain relevant and appeal to younger consumers but alienated its long-time DIY customers. The odd thing was that it never fully committed to the rebrand. The marketing referred to the company as "The Shack," while the logo had both names, "RadioShack The Shack," making it confusing. When a stoic Morpheus speaks those words to Neo, it references another virtual world, the fictional "Matrix." The issue in is the same: How do you communicate the virtual world's value without showing someone what it is? Even then, how easy is it for the average user to conceptualize what exactly Mark and the Facebook fam are trying to do as they drive folks to the Metaverse? The most concerning issue with the rebrand is that while the age demographic with the most users in the US is between 25 and 34, users who spend the most time on Facebook are between 55 and 64. How well are they receiving the new branding and the aspirational ideals put forth by Mark Zuckerberg? Is "Meta" too meta for Meemaw and PawPaw? Learn about Meta AI and how you can use this free, open source artificial intelligence to chat, create images, and more Picture this: Twitter was so widely used that it became the "go-to" platform for those fighting oppression internationally during social upheaval and protest. Traditional media organizations quote its content multiple times daily in broadcast news reports and more. Now picture this: Elon Musk buys the platform and runs into trust issues with that audience, so much so that many advertisers drop Twitter. Some major brands with an active presence also shut down their Twitter accounts. According to analysts, 32 million users left after Musk's $44 billion purchase. Amidst all that, and despite Twitter's powerful name recognition, Musk changed the branding. Elon Musk's rebranding of the Twitter platform to "X" is the worst tech rebrand in modern times. Almost 18 months after the announcement, nearly everyone still refers to his platform as "X (formerly Twitter)." Not to mention, sending someone an "x" sounds weird: "Hey! I'll X you that info in a bit." Writing an article like this is tough because many involved in these decisions take huge risks, and I applaud that. It's easy to get stuck in the paralysis of analysis, and it's also challenging to catch lightning in a bottle and come up with a rebrand that resonates with consumers and makes tech cool again.

Title: T-Mobile Opens Cellular Starlink Beta to AT&T and Verizon Users, Reveals Pricing

T-Mobile said today that customers on its most expensive Go5G Next plan will receive access to satellite-to-phone connectivity via SpaceX's Starlink as a free perk starting in July. On all other plans, it will be $15 per month per line. The interesting part is that T-Mobile also plans on offering the Starlink connectivity to AT&T and Verizon customers, who will pay $20 per month per line. They will only need a compatible and unlocked smartphone that supports eSIMs, says Clint Patterson, T-Mobile's SVP of marketing. "They add a second SIM to the phone" to get cellular Starlink, Patterson says. The T-Mobile-Starlink eSIM can then be used to receive satellite-based SMS messaging in areas without ground-based cell coverage. T-Mobile published an online list of supported phones, which will be updated over time with more device models. "We've done a lot of work with OEMs and handset providers. So this will work on most smartphones from the last four years," Patterson says. "When you see that list, you'll see things like Galaxy S21 and later, iPhone 14 and later." T-Mobile plans to officially launch its cellular Starlink service in July, when a free test beta announced in December ends. The carrier revealed the news in a Super Bowl commercial about T-Mobile's partnership with SpaceX. The resulting “space-based network,” spanning over 400 satellites, is capable of beaming data to unmodified smartphones on the ground, giving consumers a way to receive a signal even in a cellular dead zone. Last month, the carrier invited select T-Mobile users on newer iPhones, Samsung Galaxy and Pixel devices to try out the satellite connectivity. The Super Bowl ad takes things further, with T-Mobile confirming it’ll expand the free beta program to "anyone on any wireless carrier." The offer lasts until July. For now, the satellite connectivity only supports SMS-based text messaging in dead zones. But over time, SpaceX plans on rolling out support for voice calls and data downloads, pending some regulatory lobbying. In July, business customers will also get T-Mobile Starlink at no extra cost on Go 5G Business Next, first responder agencies on T-Priority plans, and other select premium rate plans. The move to include rival carriers is sure to turn heads since AT&T and Verizon are both pursuing their own satellite ventures through AST SpaceMobile and Skylo, respectively. But in AST’s case, the company still remains months away at best from offering the satellite-to-phone service to mainstream consumers. (T-Mobile says it didn’t initially plan to open Starlink’s cellular service to users on rival carriers. But that changed after Verizon aired a big-budget commercial last week touting its own satellite-to-phone capabilities.) As for SpaceX, the company received FCC clearance in November to commercially operate the cellular Starlink service. The license permits SpaceX to use T-Mobile’s radio spectrum in the 1900MHz block to beam the satellite connectivity to certified devices. The latest phones from Apple, Samsung, and Google have received an FCC Part 25 Supplement Coverage from Space certification. Hence, T-Mobile should be able to beam the satellite data connectivity to them, even though they may be running on another carrier’s network. T-Mobile customers with iPhones and Galaxy devices have already tried out the cellular Starlink service through the beta program. It has enabled them to send SMS text messages in remote areas in the US, but the signal quality isn’t always consistent. "It does drop signal quite often. You do get a notification when you are connected, though,” one beta tester told PCMag. That said, SpaceX is preparing to launch hundreds of additional cellular Starlink satellites, which promise to boost the signal quality. In a statement, T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert said: “We’re still in the early days — I don’t want to overhype the experience during a beta test — but we’re officially putting ‘no bars’ on notice. Dead zones, your days are numbered at the Un-carrier.” In terms of pricing, the $15 and $20 monthly fees may be high for consumers, especially if they don’t live near any cellular dead zones. But T-Mobile is offering an early adopter discount to its own subscribers through this month that cuts the price to $10 per month per line. I've been working as a journalist for over 15 years—I got my start as a schools and cities reporter in Kansas City and joined PCMag in 2017. I've been following SpaceX's Starlink network for several years, writing 500+ stories on availability and feature launches, but also the regulatory battles over the expansion of satellite constellations, fights between rival providers, and the effort to expand into satellite-based mobile service.

Title: ‘It was intentional’: Dollar Tree shopper walks to Coca-Cola shelf. Then she notices a sign

Time Published: 2025-02-09T19:00:00Z

Stace Fernandez Coca-Cola is being boycotted as people accuse the soda giant of being racist and anti-immigrant. But are the claims true? Coca-Cola has branded itself as the drink that brings people together and puts a smile on your face. But people have begun to question the brand as rumors swirl about how they treat employees. In a viral video with more than 250,000 views, content creator Juju (@jujubluebear) shared something she noticed in a dollar store. As Juju walked the aisles of her local Dollar Tree, she immediately stopped and stared at the Coca-Cola display. On the shelf with the unrefrigerated drinks was a small sign that read, “Don’t forget the ICE.” It seems innocuous at first, but then it clicks that Juju thinks this is a reference not to literal ice but to ICE, aka Immigration and Customs Enforcement. “Well, well, well, look what we have here. [Expletive] Coca-Cola. Don’t forget the ICE? Yeah, I [expletive] bet Coca-Cola. [Expletive] you,” Juju said. “U knew damn well what u were doing putting that sign right there,” Juju added in the caption. Part of why Juju implies that Coca-Cola and Dollar Tree are promoting ICE is because of a rumor that’s swirling about Coke laying off undocumented immigrants en masse and calling ICE on them. But it could also just be that the store is trying to upsell people to buy ice with their unrefrigerated drinks. Last year, people started boycotting companies that donated to President Donald Trump’s campaign. Those boycotts have only grown as numerous big companies—including Target, Meta, Walmart, Amazon, and McDonald’s—rolled back their diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. (FYI, Coca-Cola did donate to Trump.) Coca-Cola was added to this list, not for ending its DEI work, but because of rumors that they fired a slew of Latino workers in Texas and allegedly reported them to ICE, Yahoo reported. Let’s be clear up front: these are all rumors until evidence comes out. And so far, there is no evidence, fact-checker Distractify reported. If there were, major news outlets would be picking up on this story. Coca-Cola’s targeting of Latinos could have a huge business impact given that its Latin American division serves about 530 million consumers. A few other things. On layoffs: As a publicly traded company, Coca-Cola must disclose specific financial information. While not all layoffs are public record, one of the scales the rumors propose would certainly be included in their SEC filings. So far, there are no recent SEC filings or press releases on the matter.They did reportedly lay off 75 employees at the Grand Prairie, Texas plant that was closing—but that was in 2021. On deportations: “If Coca-Cola had thousands of undocumented employees, that would mean the company knowingly hired illegal workers — only to then snitch on itself by calling ICE?” Distractify stated. “It’s not just unlikely, it’s illogical.” “Love whoever put that sign, cus you know very da.mn well it was intentional to remind everyone!” a top comment read. “I work at dollar tree those ice signs been there as long as they sold ice bags . pan the video to the right where the Pepsi end cap is. same signs,” a person said. “Pepsi forever. [Expletive] Coca-Cola,” another wrote. The Daily Dot reached out to Juju for comment via TikTok direct message and comment and to Dollar Tree and Coca-Cola via email.

Title: Nvidia (NVDA): Analysts Bullish as AI Inference Becomes Key Growth Driver

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 AI News Updates You Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI news updates you should not miss. Europe is putting itself on the artificial map with France and the United Arab Emirates having agreed to a framework accord for a 1 gigawatt data center dedicated to artificial intelligence. The French presidency said in a statement that the center will be the core of a new AI “campus” and will have up to 1 gigawatt of capacity, “which represents investments of 30 to 50 billion euros”. READ ALSO: Top 10 AI Stocks Trending On Wall Street and 12 High-Flying AI Stocks This Week The move is said to be a part of a larger AI agreement signed between French President Emmanuel Macron and his UAE counterpart Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in Paris. President Emmanuel Macron hosted his Emirati counterpart on Thursday. “The two leaders expressed their desire to create a strategic partnership in the field of AI and committed to exploring collaborations on projects and investments supporting the development of the AI ​​value chain”. According to the leaders, the investments would go into both French and Emirati AI and would include buying advanced chips, building data centers, talent development, and establishing virtual data embassies to secure AI and cloud systems in both countries. France is also going to be hosting the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Summit at the Grand Palais on February 10-11, 2025. The country has deemed the summit a “wake-up call” for Europe in the global race for AI. “The summit comes at exactly the right time for this wake-up call for France and Europe, and to show we are in position” to take advantage of the technology, an official in Macron’s office told reporters. Attendees at the summit will include Sam Altman, head of OpenAI, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Nobel Prize winner Demis Hassabis, who leads the company’s DeepMind AI research unit, amongst many other industry leaders, government officials, and similar figures from around the world. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) specializes in AI-driven solutions, offering platforms for data centers, self-driving cars, robotics, and cloud services. On February 7, Timothy Arcuri from UBS maintained a “Buy” rating on the stock with a price target of $185.00. Besides UBS, analyst Joseph Moore at Morgan Stanley is also bullish on the stock and calls Nvidia a “top pick”. On February 6th, Moore reiterated an “Overweight” rating on the stock with a $152 price target. He said investors should buy in the DeepSeek dip. “While sentiment has worsened around potential longer term risks, near term business continues to firm, Blackwell supply visibility continues to build [and] customer desire to spend is clearly on display. We remain very optimistic on how the balance of the year plays out.” Amongst other things, Moore believes the biggest long-term catalyst for Nvidia goes beyond AI training and into the company’s leadership in the inference market. Inference is a process where trained AI models apply its knowledge to new data and then making predictions or decisions based on that data. “We remain convinced that Nvidia is the biggest beneficiary of long inference workloads.” Overall, NVDA ranks 4th on our list of AI news updates you should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Captioned Moon v.

If you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit, please provide your information here: https://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-novo-nordisk-a-s-class-action-lawsuit-nvo.html You can also contact attorneys J.C. Sanchez or Jennifer N. Caringal of Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail at info@rgrdlaw.com. CASE ALLEGATIONS: Novo Nordisk, together with its subsidiaries, engages in the research and development, manufacture, and distribution of pharmaceutical products. The Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Novo Nordisk’s projected successful outcome of Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1,” while avoiding discussions centered around dosage tolerability; (ii) Novo Nordisk’s repeated optimistic claims that CagriSema would achieve at least 25% weight loss in the REDEFINE-1 study fell short of reality; and (iii) the utilization of the “flexible protocol” limited the study’s ability to effectively provide weight loss data on the dosage tested, suggesting either that tolerability was significantly worse than anticipated, resulting in patients titrating down their dosages to avoid complications, or that the patient selection process was rushed, leading to the onboarding of patients that did not desire to even achieve the 25% weight loss Novo Nordisk sought to demonstrate. The Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit further alleges that on December 20, 2024, defendants published headline results from their REDEFINE-1 CagriSema obesity trial, disclosing that “[t]he REDEFINE 1 trial was based on a flexible protocol, allowing patients to modify their dosing throughout the trial” and that “[a]fter 68 weeks, 57.3% of patients treated with CagriSema were on the highest dose compared to 82.5% with cagrilintide 2.4 mg and 70.2% with semaglutide 2.4 mg.” On this news, the price of Novo Nordisk stock fell nearly 18%, according to the complaint. THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff of the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit.

Title: The New Yorker magazine's first hundred years

Watch CBS News By Kelefa Sanneh Updated on: February 12, 2025 / 9:08 PM EST / CBS News The New Yorker, the beloved weekly magazine, is celebrating its one-hundredth birthday. I have been a staff writer at the magazine since 2008, and Bruce Diones has been at The New Yorker since, well, not quite since the beginning. "1978," he said. "I was in the cradle. They left me on the doorstep and I came." Asked his title, Diones replied , "I don't really have one. I aid and abet all the crimes that happen here. I'm that guy that's always around." "An expert on both the people and the magazine?" "That's right." "You can tell me what we published in 1979, but you can also tell me who's mad at whom?" "Yeah, and I can tell you why they're mad at them and why that thing in '79 didn't work out!" he laughed. The New Yorker is known for its reporting, and for its idiosyncrasies. Each issue also includes cartoons, a short story, and a few poems. The front cover features not a photograph, but a painting. One of Diones' many responsibilities is to organize the magazine's archive. "We have every magazine, every issue since the first one. We have scrapbooks, papers and all sorts of weird little ephemera from the people's offices. It's kind of fun, interesting stuff." The New Yorker may be America's leading literary magazine, but its story starts with an artist: Rea Irvin. "All the artwork in The New Yorker is based on his work," Diones said. Irvin did the cover of the first issue published on February 21, 1925, of a fancy young man in a top hat, inspecting a butterfly. His name is Eustace Tilley, and he became the magazine's mascot, for better or worse. "At long last, I'm gonna tell you that I'm ambivalent about Eustace Tilley," said editor David Remnick. "Because some people look at it and they think it's a symbol of snobbery, or overweening pride. When it began, it was meant to be a joke about snobbery." Remnick was a 39-year-old reporter when, in 1998, he was named the fifth editor of The New Yorker. His job is to keep the writers happy, and, as he sometimes reminds me, productive. His job is also to figure how, and how much, to modernize a 100-year-old magazine that once specialized in light-hearted articles about Manhattan society. In that first issue of the magazine, founding editor Harold Ross wrote, "It is not edited for the old lady in Dubuque." I asked, "What did he have against Iowa?" "I don't know," Remnick laughed. "To him, Dubuque included Queens, Los Angeles …" The magazine's reach, now, extends far past Manhattan. "We have more readers in the state of California than we do in the state of New York, including the old lady in Dubuque," Remnick said. "It's a magazine that has deep, deep reporting, and prides itself on accuracy and fact-checking." Fergus McIntosh leads the magazine's battalion of fact-checkers – more than two dozen. So, what is a fact-checker? "Somebody who takes a story submitted by someone like you and, before we publish it, makes sure that it is accurate, balanced, fair, and as complete as it can be," McIntosh said. "Fair? That seems like a hard thing to figure out," I said. "I know that's hard for you. It's not hard for us," McIntosh laughed. And everything gets checked – not just articles, but also poems, short stories, even cartoons. Teresa Mathew, the department's associate director, once had to fact-check a cartoon about a penguin meeting his girlfriend's parents. "He says, 'We prefer the term Arctic-American,'" she recalled. "And this is factually incorrect, because penguins live in the Antarctic." "But Antarctic-American wouldn't have been as funny," I said. "Not pithy enough, no," said Mathew. "All of my emails to the wonderful cartoon editor about any potential issues I find, almost always I get a response of, 'Thank you so much, Teresa. We will not be taking that change.'" Somewhere along the way, The New Yorker became a serious magazine, publishing writers ranging from J.D. Salinger to James Baldwin, from the film critic Pauline Kael to the investigative journalist Ronan Farrow. The New York Public Library will celebrate the magazine's anniversary with an exhibition later this month. So, what is The New Yorker in 2025? Remnick said, "It's not just one thing. Sports illustrated was about one thing, and it's easy to understand, for advertisers and readers. [The New Yorker] is a more complicated thing. It may be a little bit tricky to invite people in." "Is The New Yorker itself more political than it used to be?" "I think it's certainly more political than when it started out, that's for damn sure," said Remnick. "Would it be wrong to describe The New Yorker as a liberal magazine?" "No, I don't think it would be wrong. I think there a wide range. I don't think it's an assertively ideological publication. I think reporting is at its center more than finger-wagging." These are anxious times for the media industry, and The New Yorker is not immune. The magazine had a round of layoffs in 2023. But The New Yorker has a steady base of around 1.2 million subscribers, many of whom read it on their phones. Remnick said, "How do we write shorter, faster things, as well as do the other things? In addition to; it's not instead of. We have a pretty robust audio operation – four, five podcasts. We do video. But I'm thinking forward. I'm thinking about how do we have a New Yorker that has the possibility of celebrating 200 years? Because in American life, in the history of media, that's unusual. Just ask the people who used to read Life magazine." For Bruce Diones, The New Yorker's 100th birthday is a good excuse to revisit ancient history. He showed me a box left behind by a former employee named Fred Keefe: "He was a little guy like me with a bow tie, and he would sit in the corner and type out 'letters to the editor' answers." One letter was a request to visit the magazine's offices. Keefe responded: "Thank you for your letter. We're afraid there isn't much to see in our offices. The editors and writers are all shut away in little cubicles and are very upset if people pop in on them." In fact, those old editors and writers and artists and cartoonists are still here, in spirit, and also in these boxes. The party's been going for a hundred years, and new people are still being invited to join in. I said, "maybe in another 100 years, someone will come and flip through whatever the newest version of that archives is?" "That's right, and I'm in it now," laughed Diones. "And you're in it, too. That's kind of the thrill of it. You realize that, well, oh, this has always been going on, and we're all a part of it." For more info: Story produced by Mary Raffalli. Editor: George Pozderec. EDITOR'S NOTE: An earlier version of this story misspelled the name of Teresa Mathew, associate director of The New Yorker's fact checking department. We regret the error.

Title: I switched to a new Android voice assistant, and Google Gemini now feels outdated

Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more. Published onFebruary 9, 2025 When Google announced that it would be replacing the Assistant with Gemini, I braced for what I assumed would be the inevitable: a feature-rich experience marred by a frustrating transition period. Almost exactly one year later, however, the transition has actually gone smoother than I expected. Setting reminders and controlling smart home devices now work, and I haven’t found myself completely lost without the old Google Assistant. But while Gemini hasn’t been the disaster I feared, I can’t say it’s a clear upgrade either. For all of Google’s promises about deeper reasoning and higher-quality responses, I feel like there’s very little that Gemini can do that Assistant couldn’t. So when I learned that AI startup Perplexity was stepping up to offer an alternative, I was immediately curious to see how it compared to Google’s old and new assistants. And after a week of use, I can confidently say that I won’t be returning to Gemini anytime soon. As I mentioned earlier, Gemini’s numerous extensions mean that it can now control my smart home and take notes. However, it fails just as miserably at answering questions as the outgoing Google Assistant. My main gripe with Gemini stems from how much it relies on the underlying large language model (and its personal knowledge) to answer my queries instead of using its built-in search engine. Case in point, I routinely ask Gemini for stock prices and get variable results that frustrate me to no end. A prompt like “How is Apple’s stock price doing?” once yielded a vague response about the company’s financial performance over the past few months, but crucially, didn’t deliver a price quote at all. It wasn’t until I specifically asked “What is Apple’s stock price?” that Gemini finally gave me a definitive answer. And even then, it linked me to three other websites and lectured me on the volatility of stock prices. Perplexity, meanwhile, responds to such queries with a rich information box that even contains an interactive chart. Take a look for yourself. This isn’t a one-off, I’ve run into the same problem when trying to convert currencies on multiple occasions. Ask Gemini how much 100 USD is in Euros, and you’re more likely to get a disclaimer about exchange rate fluctuations than an actual number. If the stars align, you might get an answer but it might just be faster to use Google Search instead. Perplexity, on the other hand, does exactly what I want from an assistant: it pulls real-time exchange rates from multiple sources and clearly presents them, albeit without the pretty charts this time. More importantly, though, it performs this task consistently every single time. Next, I asked both assistants, “Where can I watch the re-release of Interstellar this weekend?” Here, Gemini did exactly what I’d expect the decade-old Google Assistant to do: it flat out refused to look for an answer. It’s quite an embarrassing result, to say the least. Meanwhile, Perplexity performed a quick search and analyzed eight sources to offer a release date and recommendations on how to book tickets. From here, I simply used Google’s Circle to Search and navigated to one of the booking websites myself. Is Perplexity’s response perfect? Not at all, but it’s a big step up over Gemini. While most competing digital assistants on Android stop at answering questions, that’s not the case with Perplexity. Like Gemini, you can ask it to perform a handful of phone-related tasks like send a text message or email, call a contact, and open an app. It can also play music via Spotify and set reminders. Impressively, Perplexity can understand vague instructions like “Remind me to watch the next season of The White Lotus when it releases.” Here, you’d expect the assistant to look for the show’s release date first and set a reminder accordingly and that’s exactly what Perplexity does. When I tried the same prompt with Gemini, I was horrified to find that it simply set up a task with the entire text instead of following the instructions at the end. This is the kind of inconsistency that makes Google’s AI experience so frustrating to live with and potentially dangerous if you rely on it for anything important. Perplexity can also perform multiple tasks at once, similar to Gemini’s multi-extension functionality that Samsung showcased at the recent Galaxy S25 launch event. For example, it can find nearby Thai restaurants and set a reminder to book a table at one later. On that note, Perplexity has a couple of cool tricks up its sleeve. For one, you can ask it to book a table and it will bring you to the restaurant’s OpenTable page to set up a reservation. Likewise, you can book an Uber ride using just your voice — I tested it with the prompt “Get me a ride to the airport” and it worked as expected. Perplexity has a surprisingly good handle at localized suggestions too. It managed to give me directions to the nearest coffee shop (a non-chain location at that) and booking a cab to the spot was just another voice command away. Finally, Perplexity can also read the contents of your screen when required. This means you can instruct it to do things like summarize the contents of your screen and then send the result as an email to a friend. Or as I tend to use it the most, translate a foreign language. Gemini has offered this feature for a while now, so I’m glad I didn’t lose it when I switched to Perplexity Assistant. Perplexity may have the upper hand in some areas, but it’s not exactly equal to Gemini yet either. Unlike Perplexity, Google’s assistant can read your emails, access files from Drive, and integrate more seamlessly with services like Tasks and Assistant Routines. The closest Perplexity can get to reading your inbox is summarizing your notifications, which is helpful but nowhere near as powerful. Another key difference is how you invoke each assistant. Gemini supports a wake word for hands-free activation, whereas Perplexity requires holding down the power button or using a diagonal swipe gesture. I personally don’t mind this since I’m usually holding my phone when I need assistance, but it’s a notable limitation nonetheless. Perplexity also lacks any smart home controls at the moment — though that might not be a dealbreaker if you already own smart speakers. The one missing piece that might be harder to ignore is calendar integration. As of now, Perplexity can’t link to a calendar, meaning you can’t check or add events. This is an easily solved problem over time, though, as plenty of other apps allow you to link your Google account for calendar and Drive access. With these downsides then, should you switch to Perplexity? It comes down to what you need from your phone’s digital assistant. If your priority is getting answers to questions reliably, no matter how vaguely worded, Perplexity is the superior choice without a doubt. But if you need your assistant to interface directly with your digital life, Gemini holds the edge for the time being. For now, I’ve made my switch, and I don’t regret it. Gemini could appreciably improve in the future, but Perplexity does everything I need and then some. More than anything, I’m just glad there’s real competition in this space. After all, it was only a few years ago that the stagnating Google Assistant was the only viable option.

Title: DeepSeek's efficiency means Big Tech must stop hoarding, creating more winners. Here are the 12 stocks expected to benefit.

The good, bad, and the ugly are merging as AI enters the next stage of development: competition and efficiency. We all knew this day would come, but perhaps not as soon as it did. DeepSeek's more efficient and cheaper model means Big Tech suddenly has a chink in its armor. Investors question whether they have overvalued the blue chips and their pricing power, especially concerning their proprietary language models. It will be a volatile ride until Wall Street figures that out. For now, AI-related stocks have been dumping almost indiscriminately or at the slightest hint of a slowdown. Chip designer ARM was a recent victim of that trend. It announced earnings Wednesday with some of the best numbers you can get on a typical stock, said Sandeep Rao, a quantitative analyst at Leverage Shares ETPs. Still, the stock closed down by over 7%. "It's clearly evident that this stock is supposed to be soaring," Rao said. "The company's IP is used in virtually every major smartphone in the world. Its software is also used by Apple computers. It has a tie-up with Nvidia, and its backup is SoftBank, which is part of the Stargate project pumping $500 billion into AI cloud infrastructure." ARM CEO Rene Haas also welcomed DeepSeek during its February 5 earnings call, referring to it as "creative" and a welcomed efficiency that would only increase demand for computing. He added that his company was well-positioned to take advantage of efficiencies, including for smaller devices that don't require high-powered Nvidia chips. ARM isn't alone. As AI stocks report earnings, they find themselves in a similar predicament: explaining to Wall Street's money movers that they are well-positioned to continue riding out the AI hype. DeepSeek isn't exactly open source; in other words, it doesn't share its full code. It's open weight, which means it shows its memory or knowledge process. This allows users to adjust it for specific tasks, lowering the bar for startups and companies to enter the space and create specialized business models that could lead to affordability, increased demand, and explosive growth. Before DeepSeek, proprietary models required huge computing power, which meant expensive and small supercomputers were the perceived solution for efficiency. DeepSeek changed that thesis, suggesting that optimization isn't a hardware problem but one that can be addressed with code, Rao said. It also proved that the open-source community was far more efficient at driving results, validating the argument that AI and machine learning should not be done behind closed doors, Rao added. It's a technology that can best be done as a tide that lifts all boats instead of one that's hoarded by a few. But in terms of winners and losers, investors should be concerned with the picks and shovels: companies tasked with building AI infrastructure, said Abby Yoder, a US equity strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank. The focus must now turn to their revenue and gross margin line items to determine whether they will see the impact. She added that CapEx spending isn't dropping; it's actually increasing, but it could be shifting elsewhere. "So, are they going to be going to the incumbent winners that we've seen over the past couple of years who have had this outsized pricing power leading to those really high margins?" Yoder said. Or are they going to semiconductor companies making specialized chips, hardware providers, or software companies? It's the key query investors will need to be able to answer if they want to continue winning in this space. On JPMorgan's part, the investment bank's North America equity research team created a list of stocks they're overweight on and that they expect will be positively impacted by competitive and efficient AI. Software Companies that can use efficiency to increase their total addressable markets will be the new big winners. Here, Yoder believes it will be the software companies. Cloud-based data storage provider Snowflake (SNOW) is positioned to benefit from increased demand as more AI applications develop, increasing the requirement for data storage services. Cloud-based software provider Salesforce (CRM) could be at the forefront of benefiting from cheaper and therefore increased software use. Semiconductors In the semiconductor space, Yoder says an investor should focus on those gaining versus those losing market share. Overall, the demand for AI chips is expected to increase, not drop, though that may not be the case for every chipmaker, read JPMorgan's note. Within this sector, companies that provide application-specific integrated circuits" (ASICs), which are microchips made for certain functions instead of general use, are well-positioned to gain from the increased use of more accessible AI models. ASIC suppliers set to benefit include Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell Technologies (MRVL). Micron (MU) is expected to benefit as a memory and storage chip provider as AI adoption accelerates. Despite fears about how necessary Nvidia's (NVDA) expensive and advanced chips will be, increased demand for AI models will also mean increased demand for GPUs. Internet and hyperscalers The big, leading names like Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta sit in this category. Not only are they developers of AI models, but they are also the spenders that largely determine where money for infrastructure and software will go. Here, efficiency will create a cheaper and broader ecosystem for AI on the internet, and the sharing of developments will push the big players to also become efficient, read JPMorgan's note, which projects 2025 capex spending for Amazon at $97 billion, Meta at $65 billion, and Google at $62 billion. Since Meta's Llama model is also open weight, it's expected to be a main beneficiary of language models like DeepSeek, where its efficiency can be integrated into Meta's ecosystem. "At 4Q earnings, META reiterated the benefits of open source LLMs, noted that costs can be driven down, & — in light of DeepSeek — emphasized the importance of having an American standard for open source that extends globally," JP Morgan's note read. Amazon is also not shying away from more efficacious models. Its cloud-computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), has already added DeepSeek to its AI platforms, making it available for use in some regions. While it could directly compete with more expensive options and impact pricing power, JPMorgan believes losses could be balanced with increased demand. Alphabet's place in this shift isn't as clear. JPMorgan believes that since the search giant is highly dependent on Gemini, its proprietary AI, there's less wiggle room here. However, Google can use lessons of efficiency to help it develop its own path to building out its models. Additionally, it has six new applications it is developing and 2 billion users it can distribute them to. Paul Marino, CRO of Themes ETFs, doesn't believe that large-scale institutions and hyperscalers will move to a true open-source model solely. So when several companies maintain commitments to Capex, it means they haven't even scratched the surface for required growth, this includes expansion into agentic AI, which are models that can make decisions and act on them. Hardware Once models are trained and built, the key part is their use in the inference process, where the model applies its abilities to provide results. As demand picks up, hardware companies involved in this process are set to benefit. These include Dell (DELL) Cisco (CSCO), and NetApp (NTAP). Jump to

Its cloud-computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), has already added DeepSeek to its AI platforms, making it available for use in some regions. While it could directly compete with more expensive options and impact pricing power, JPMorgan believes losses could be balanced with increased demand. Alphabet's place in this shift isn't as clear. JPMorgan believes that since the search giant is highly dependent on Gemini, its proprietary AI, there's less wiggle room here. However, Google can use lessons of efficiency to help it develop its own path to building out its models. Additionally, it has six new applications it is developing and 2 billion users it can distribute them to. Paul Marino, CRO of Themes ETFs, doesn't believe that large-scale institutions and hyperscalers will move to a true open-source model solely. So when several companies maintain commitments to Capex, it means they haven't even scratched the surface for required growth, this includes expansion into agentic AI, which are models that can make decisions and act on them. Hardware Once models are trained and built, the key part is their use in the inference process, where the model applies its abilities to provide results. As demand picks up, hardware companies involved in this process are set to benefit. These include Dell (DELL) Cisco (CSCO), and NetApp (NTAP). Jump to

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Stocks ended the first week of February little changed as investors digested corporate earnings from Big Tech companies, a hotter-than-expected January jobs report, and continuing updates on President Donald Trump's tariff policies. For the week, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was roughly flat, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 0.4%. In the week ahead, inflation will take center stage, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) set for release on Wednesday morning. Updates on wholesale inflation and retail sales will also be closely tracked. But investors will also be keeping a close eye on Trump's planned announcement of new 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, as well as for more details on reciprocal duties across the board. On the corporate front, 78 S&P 500 companies, including McDonald's (MCD), Coca-Cola (KO), Super Micro Computer (SMCI), and Airbnb (ABNB), are set to report earnings. The January jobs report released on Friday showed continued signs of resilience in the labor market as the unemployment rate unexpectedly fell, wages grew more than expected, and December's monthly job gains were revised higher to show the US labor market exited 2024 on an even better footing than previously reported. This prompted economists to argue the Fed likely won't be cutting interest rates anytime soon. And if anything, it puts more pressure on inflation data to show cooling before the central bank brings down borrowing costs. "The more recent data are indicative of a labor market that has regained its footing," Wells Fargo senior economist Sarah House wrote in a note on Friday. "This suggests that the tail risk of a sharp deterioration in the labor market has diminished, and as a result the FOMC can wait to see how the Q1 inflation data and economic policymaking play out before taking further action on the federal funds rate." Stocks rebounded after dropping initially on Monday as President Trump's 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada were delayed at least a month. But what exactly happens with tariffs remains an overhang on markets as investors debate the potential impact on inflation and, subsequently, monetary policy. On Sunday, Trump said he will introduce a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imported into the US from all countries. He told reporters on Air Force One that he will announce the new metals duties on Monday, but didn't say when they would be implemented. The move puts Canada and Mexico, both top US suppliers of steel and aluminum, back in the hot seat on tariffs. Also stepping up the trade pressure, Trump said on Friday he would announce a plan on reciprocal tariffs on American imports. The comments were made during a meeting with Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. Trump said tariffs on Japan were an option. In a research note on Friday, BlackRock Global Fixed Income chief investment officer Rick Rieder said it would likely take two weak jobs reports to prompt discussion about the Fed resuming its interest rate cutting cycle. But he added that the risks surrounding Trump's policies, including tariffs and an immigration crackdown, muddle the outlook. "While we and the Fed are keeping our eyes focused on these payroll (and inflation) reports, we also have to closely watch the news flow, and then the reverberations around these events, to get a sense for when the Fed and market makers can feel confident in rates coming down closer to a long-run neutral level," Rieder wrote. With investors' focus now squarely back on inflation data for hints of interest rate cuts, a fresh update on the pace of price increases is slated for release on Wednesday. Wall Street economists expect January's CPI to show headline inflation of 2.9% in January, flat from the month prior. Prices are anticipated to rise 0.3% on a month-over-month basis, per economist projections, below the 0.4% increase seen in December. On a "core" basis, which strips out food and energy prices, CPI is expected to have risen 3.1% over last year in January, below the 3.2% seen in December. Monthly core price increases are anticipated to clock in at 0.3%, above the 0.2% seen the month prior. The first monthly retail sales report of 2025 is set for release on Friday. Economists estimate retail sales were flat over the prior month during January. But the control group of retail sales — which excludes several volatile categories like gasoline and feeds directly into gross domestic product (GDP) — is also expected to have risen by 0.4%, down from the 0.7% increase seen in December. With more than 62% of S&P 500 companies done reporting earnings, the year-over-year growth rate for the index keeps moving higher. As of Friday, the S&P 500 was pacing for earnings growth of 16.4% compared to the year prior. This would mark the fastest pace of growth in three years and is well above the 11.8% earnings growth analysts had expected at the start of January. While earnings have been beating expectations, macro factors have continued to create stop-and-go market action as stocks have failed to find clear direction. On Friday, stocks slipped lower after the latest University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey showed respondents' one-year inflation expectations hit their highest level since November 2023. One-year inflation expectations jumped to 4.3% in February from 3.3% last month, marking the the fifth time in 14 years that the survey reported a rise of 1 percentage point or more in year-ahead inflation expectations. The release noted that the jump in inflation expectations was "in part due to a perception that it may be too late to avoid the negative impact of tariff policy." Stocks reversed course on the news, with all three major averages flipping from green to red. And while that constitutes just a small sampling of the market action, it's a reminder that what tariffs mean for inflation is squarely in focus for markets ahead of a week that's expected to provide updates on both fronts.

Time Published: 2025-02-09T12:00:00Z

To add cybersecurity exposure to your portfolio, look for companies with strong growth records and ... [+] improving profitability. Executive leaders recently identified cyber and technology risk as primary threats to business growth, according to a survey from insurer Chubb. More than 40% of executive respondents noted that cyber threat monitoring is an essential function within their organization. That percentage will likely rise as the cybersecurity landscape gets more complex. A World Economic Forum analysis cites several factors that are creating more complexity. They include hackers’ use of AI technology, rising geopolitical tensions and the increase in data protection regulations. This fast-changing environment creates opportunities for the best cybersecurity stocks to thrive. Proven cybersecurity providers will become invaluable to their customers and gain pricing power as a result. To benefit from these trends, consider adding targeted cybersecurity exposure to your portfolio. Read on to meet six cybersecurity stocks with growth potential in 2025 and beyond. Identifying these best cybersecurity stock picks began with listing all holdings within WisdomTree Cybersecurity Fund (WCBR) and Global X Cybersecurity ETF (BUG). From that group, stocks with these qualities were removed from consideration: The remaining nine cybersecurity stocks were ordered by free cash flow (FCF) per share—highest to lowest—and the bottom three were dropped. FCF was calculated from each company's most recent year-end financial releases as operating cash flow less capital expenditures or capex. Capex included purchases of property, plant and equipment and capitalized software costs. The table below identifies six cybersecurity stocks poised for growth in 2025. Read on to learn more about these cybersecurity companies and why they may be candidates for your portfolio. Bulleted metrics come from stockanalysis.com, except for the FCF per share, which was calculated from company financial releases. For more investing ideas, see best stocks for 2025, best energy stocks and best growth stocks. Akamai Technologies provides cloud computing, content delivery and cybersecurity solutions. Application and API security, bot and abuse protection, infrastructure security and programs supporting a zero-trust strategy are part of the offering. A zero-trust security strategy assumes breach is possible within networks and verifies every transaction accordingly. Akamai sells to financial companies, video streaming companies, healthcare providers, retailers, pharmaceuticals and the U.S. military. Akamai has proven its ability to drive sales and earnings growth. Although the sales trajectory has been more linear than earnings, the company has the highest and most consistent operating margin among the stocks on this list. Akamai is currently seeing momentum in security solutions and cloud computing. In its most recent earnings release, the company reported 17% quarter-over-quarter sales growth in these areas. Company-wide sales growth rose a more subdued 4%. Going forward, analysts expect high-single-digit sales growth for Akamai through 2028, with annual EPS in the range of about $6.50 to nearly $10. Zscaler operates a cloud security platform sold to customers on a subscription basis. Customers operate in various sectors, including household and personal products, banking, transportation, hospitality and biotech. Zscaler says its inline security cloud platform is the world’s largest. The company launched in 2007 and has since produced impressive year-over-year sales growth. In the past three years, sales grew an average of 48% annually. The profit side of the equation has been more challenging. Zscaler has not yet achieved GAAP earnings. However, the company does have strong cash flow and the second-highest FCF per share on this list. Cash flow production should continue, as the Zscaler team optimizes its already effective go-to-market and upsell strategies. In the October 2024 quarter, Zscaler reported 26% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth on "strong sales execution." Operating cash flow was $291.9 million and 53% of revenue. The GAAP loss per share shrank to $30.7 million from $46.1 million in the prior year period. Okta provides cloud-based workforce and customer identity solutions. The company is best known for its gateway service that allows authenticated users to access multiple applications with one login. Customers include more than half of Fortune 100 companies plus thousands of other organizations. Okta has strong market positioning, good growth history and a solid customer list. Recently, the company has been focused on attracting more high-value contracts and innovating its offering to enhance upsell opportunities. For fiscal year 2025, the leadership team expects 15% sales growth and a FCF margin of 25%. Admittedly, a 15% sales growth expectation doesn’t compare well to Okta's history. Annual sales growth from fiscal years 2019 to 2023 ranged from 40% to 55%. Fiscal 2024 sales growth was about 20%. Data breaches have been a lingering problem for Okta. Incidents in 2022 and 2023 kept OKTA’s stock price low, as other tech stocks rebounded strongly from the 2022 tech sell-off. However, in a recent earnings call, the company said the 2023 breach was no longer affecting results quantifiably. As a potential investor, you can assess Okta's breach history in two ways. You can assume Okta could repeat its mistakes, which would be bad for customers and shareholders. Or, you can interpret Okta's troubles as a possible buying opportunity for a company with some positives: Okta operates in a growing industry, produces more than $400 million annually in FCF and is nearing GAAP profitability. Datadog sells technology monitoring and logging services. Customers use the platform to manage, troubleshoot and optimize their cloud-based IT infrastructure, including servers, applications and databases. The customer list includes Samsung, Shell, Deloitte, Comcast and Nasdaq. In 2023, Grand View Research estimated the global cloud market value at $602.31 billion. The researcher also projected a CAGR of 21.2% between 2024 and 2030. That growth benefits Datadog, which has a strong market position in cloud security. The company’s platform also integrates with OpenAI so customers can track the usage and performance of their AI-based applications. Stifel analysts recently downgraded DDOG due to uncertainty around the company’s potential in the AI monitoring space. However, Bank of America Securities analyst Koji Ikeda has a different view, as reported by Business Insider. Ikeda recently maintained a buy rating on DDOG stock and raised the price target—noting that the company's long-term prospects without AI are still promising. For the September quarter, Datadog reported 26% higher sales quarter-over-quarter and strong growth in customers with annual recurring revenue of at least $100,000. The company also produced FCF of $204 million. Elastic N.V. makes enterprise software that searches, analyzes, logs and visualizes data. The company is best known for its Elasticsearch application, used by popular apps like Uber, Instacart and Tinder. Elastic also offers an AI-powered security solution for detecting, investigating and responding to cybersecurity threats. Analysts appreciate Elastic’s position in AI and cybersecurity, two fast-growing industries. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives has cited AI as the bigger growth engine for Elastic. Ives believes Elastic will see continued strong demand for its platform as the AI revolution continues. Investors appreciate Elastic's habit of beating earnings expectations. In the first two quarters of fiscal 2025, Elastic outperformed the EPS consensus by 36% and 55%, respectively. Highlights from the second quarter include an 18% revenue gain, a 59% increase in non-GAAP diluted EPS and a 16% increase in the high-value customer count from the prior-year quarter. High-value customers are those with annual contract values over $100,000. Rapid7 manages an AI-powered vulnerability management platform that can analyze network activity, proactively identify threats, test applications for security holes, monitor cloud resources and third-party integrations and respond to threats. Rapid7 generates more than $820 million in annual recurring revenue and services more than 11,000 customers. While the company’s revenue growth has slowed recently, Rapid7 has also recently achieved GAAP profitability—a milestone in the cybersecurity space. After producing a GAAP net loss of $149 million in 2023, the company has delivered GAAP net income of $46.9 million over the last 12 months. However, analyst Adam Borg of Stifel Nicolaus is cautious about Rapid7’s growth prospects. Borg says the vulnerability management niche within cybersecurity may not provide the growth investors want to see from Rapid7. Despite Borg's opinion, the average analyst earnings outlook for Rapid7 is positive. Estimates show steady EPS growth from $2.31 in 2024 to $4.02 in 2029. In the third quarter 2024, Rapid7 grew sales 8% year-over-year, and produced FCF of $39 million. Technology and geopolitical trends may create tailwinds for cybersecurity stocks in the coming years. The most effective providers will benefit the most. To add cybersecurity exposure to your portfolio, look for companies with strong growth records and improving profitability. You can alternatively opt for a cybersecurity ETF that spreads risk out over a few dozen securities. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Some of the market’s biggest winners start off as the smallest players. While trillion-dollar tech giants like the ‘Magnificent 7’ dominate the spotlight, the real hidden opportunities often lie in lesser-known stocks trading for $5 or less. Leverage the power of TipRanks' Smart Score, a data-driven tool to help you uncover top performing stocks and make informed investment decisions. Monitor your stock picks and compare them to top Wall Street Analysts' recommendations with Your Smart Portfolio These low-cost shares – penny stocks – may be cheap, but their potential can be massive. Many operate at the cutting edge of their industries, and when they hit the right catalyst – be it a breakthrough innovation or a disruptive product – their share prices can skyrocket. Of course, not every penny stock is a hidden gem; some trade at low levels for a reason, struggling with poor fundamentals or challenges that may be too big to overcome. So, how can investors spot those poised to go from rags to riches? By turning to Wall Street pros. Using TipRanks’ database, we pinpointed two compelling penny stocks that have won over analysts, earning a ‘Strong Buy’ consensus rating. Both tickers also present strong upside potential, with one poised for a nearly 450% surge. Let’s see why they are drawing plaudits across the board. Solid Biosciences (SLDB) We’ll start with Solid Biosciences, a biotech research firm focused on advancing gene therapy for severe neuromuscular and cardiac diseases – areas with limited treatment options. The company is developing a gene therapy pipeline to address high unmet medical needs, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Friedreich’s ataxia (FA), catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), TNNT2-mediated dilated cardiomyopathy, and BAG3-mediated dilated cardiomyopathy. At the heart of its innovation is SGT-003, a next-generation genetic therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. This leading drug candidate is currently undergoing Phase I/II clinical testing in the INSPIRE DUCHENNE trial. With the first patients already receiving doses, Solid is gearing up for potential Phase 3 activities – pending results from ongoing trials. Investors eagerly anticipate the first-in-human data for SGT-003, which is expected this quarter and could mark a pivotal moment for the company’s gene therapy ambitions. Apart from Duchenne, Solid is also advancing SGT-212, a recombinant AAV-based gene replacement therapy targeting Friedreich’s ataxia. This novel treatment is designed to deliver frataxin through two strategic routes – an intradentate nucleus (IDN) infusion using an MRI-guided device, followed by an intravenous (IV) infusion. Last month, the FDA not only granted IND clearance for clinical testing but also awarded Fast Track designation. Looking ahead, Solid plans to initiate a Phase 1b clinical trial for FA treatment in the second half of 2025. Meanwhile, the company is gearing up to expand its portfolio. SGT-501, a potential therapy for catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), is on track for an IND submission to the FDA in the first half of 2025. Beyond its drug pipeline, Solid is also working to develop a library of enabling technologies, including genetic regulators, novel capsids, and promoters. These innovations aim to improve gene therapy delivery systems across the biotech industry. With a major catalyst approaching for SGT-003’s clinical data and a share price of $2.88, Truist’s top analyst Joon Lee views SLDB as a high-potential opportunity. “Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a devastating disease for which the recently approved Elevidys, a gene therapy with modest-at-best efficacy, is annualizing $700-800M in just the 2nd year of launch with consensus estimate of $3.3BN in sales by 2028. Based on the recent FDA hosted meeting where parents of DMD patients expressed the need for better options, we think there’s not only room but a need for better gene therapies. Also, movement in the field towards re-dosing creates opportunities for later entrants. In this backdrop, SGT-003’s First In Human (FIH) DMD data in 1Q25 could be a positive catalyst for the stock. We model peak sales of ~$1BN for SGT-003, which may prove conservative… Net-net, current negative enterprise value makes SLDB a compelling opportunity ahead of key FIH SGT-003 data in 1Q25 followed by IND in CPVT,” says Lee, who’s ranked in the top 2% of Wall Street stock experts. Backing his bullish outlook, Lee rates SLDB a Buy with a $16 price target, suggesting a robust one-year upside potential of ~450%. (To watch Lee’s track record, click here) Overall, SLDB has Wall Street’s unswerving support. With all 9 analysts issuing Buy ratings, the stock enjoys a unanimous Strong Buy consensus. With an average price target of $16.33, the analysts expect shares to be changing hands at a whopping 467% premium over the next 12 months. (See SLDB stock forecast) Foghorn Therapeutics (FHTX) Next, we have Foghorn Therapeutics, a biopharmaceutical company focused on the chromatin regulatory system – an intricate mechanism that controls the unpacking of DNA’s three-dimensional structure, allowing precise gene expression. Disruptions in this system are linked to numerous diseases, including cancer, with research suggesting that over a quarter of cancers involve mutations affecting chromatin regulation. By targeting these fundamental mechanisms, Foghorn aims to develop groundbreaking treatments that address cancer at its core. Foghorn has developed a proprietary drug development platform, Gene Traffic Control, and has used it to build a pipeline of drug candidates, most of which are still in preclinical stages. One candidate, FHD-909, has advanced to clinical trials. This highly selective SMARCA2 inhibitor is being developed as a potential treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients with SMARCA4 deficiencies. The clinical development of FHD-909 is proceeding in partnership with Eli Lilly. FHD-909 is an oral, first-in-class, highly potent, and selective SMARCA2 (BRM) inhibitor. The drug is currently undergoing a Phase 1 trial designed to target SMARCA4-mutated cancers, with the primary patient population suffering from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The first patient in this trial was dosed with FHD-909 in October of last year. The company initiated the trial based on promising preclinical data and has scheduled a presentation of such data, including findings on FHD-909 in combination with pembrolizumab or KRAS inhibitors, for the AACR Annual Meeting taking place from April 25-30, 2025. The promising outlook for FHD-909 comes after the company made the difficult choice to discontinue work on a drug candidate FHD-286. That decision was made based on Phase 1 dose escalation data that did not meet the efficacy threshold. The company has prioritized its resources for the FHD-909 program. This decision, announced on December 16, has weighed on the stock, which is down 14% since that date. Yet, B. Riley analyst Kalpit Patel sees this dip as an opportunity, not a red flag. “We are surprised to see FHTX’s synthetic lethality platform trading near its cash level, especially given the promising outlook of FHD-909, which is under a 50/50 U.S. co-development and co-commercialization agreement with Eli Lilly. The stock’s weakness may reflect several factors, including (1) read-through from Prelude’s disappointing SMARCA2 program data, (2) the recent decline in the biotech sector, and (3) FHTX’s discontinuation of FHD-286. However, we believe these concerns are overblown… We believe this dip has created an attractive entry point to buy FHTX shares,” Patel opined. Patel backs up his bullish stance with a Buy rating and a $10 price target, suggesting a ~110% upside over the next year. (To watch Patel’s track record, click here) Wall Street appears to share his optimism. With 4 recent analyst reviews on record— 3 Buys and just one Hold – FHTX boasts a Strong Buy consensus. The stock, currently trading at $4.75, has an average price target of $10.25, implying a nearly 115% upside potential for the year ahead.

URL: https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Rocket_Lab_Successfully_Launches_Fifth_Satellite_Batch_for_Kineis_IoT_Constellation_999.html
Time Published: 2025-02-09T09:43:21Z
Full Content:
The mission, designated "IOT 4 You and Me," launched from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in Mahia, New Zealand at 9:43 AM NZDT on 9 February (20:43 UTC), placing the five satellites into a 647 km low Earth orbit. This launch represents Rocket Lab's first Electron mission of 2025, and the fourth dedicated mission for Kineis, bringing the total Electron launches to 59. Sir Peter Beck, Rocket Lab's founder and CEO, commented: "That's four launches completed, and just one more to go for Kineis. We'll have their entire constellation deployed in less than a year-a remarkable achievement in itself. Many constellation operators experience longer delays for their first launches, let alone a complete constellation in operation. Once again, Electron proves to be a reliable, precise launcher, enabling our customers to customize their mission plans and timelines." Michel Sarthou, CTO of Kineis, added: "Achieving the production of 25 nanosatellites and launching them into orbit within eight months is an extraordinary accomplishment. With this fourth launch, Kineis is a step closer to providing full global IoT coverage through our constellation of 25 nanosatellites. This milestone reflects the expertise and dedication of our team and our partners like Rocket Lab. We are deeply appreciative of the support we've received since Kineis was founded." The Kineis constellation aims to enable connectivity and real-time data transmission from the most remote parts of the globe, all while consuming minimal energy and maintaining low bit-rate communication. The constellation will support a range of applications, including forest fire monitoring, water resource management, infrastructure and energy network oversight, and transportation logistics tracking. Kineis is now one launch away from completing its constellation. The date for the fifth mission in this series will be revealed in the upcoming weeks. The next Electron mission, scheduled for later in February, will be announced with customer details and the specific launch window shortly.

Title: In Central African Republic, A Campaign Of Terror By Wagner's Successors

By Jean-Fernand Koena, Maja Zivanovic and Mike Eckel February 09, 2025 BANGUI -- Just after noon on January 17, 2023, Privat Damabakizi, 35, and his wife were working in their farm field in a tiny Central African Republic settlement near the border with Cameroon when his brother, Alvin, called him. Seven armed men wearing camouflage uniforms had just driven up in pickup trucks at Damabakizi's home in Bouar, a town about 7 kilometers away from the field. The men were white-skinned, wearing balaclavas, Alvin recalled in an interview with RFE/RL. They spoke poor French, the main language in the country. They were Russians, who were a common presence in the area. They were looking for Damabakizi. "I was worried. I called him and asked him what he had done for the Russians to come here." Alvin recalled in an interview with RFE/RL. "These people are bad people." Damabakizi told Alvin not to worry and said he'd come to the house immediately. Alvin told him to go to the police instead. When Damabakizi drove up a short time later, the Russians grabbed him and threw him into one of their trucks, beating him with their rifle butts and stabbing him with bayonets. Later, his wife, Nelly, cried as they drove away with Damabakizi. The next day, after frantically calling local authorities, Alvin said, prosecutors told him that Damabakizi had been accused of buying items -- probably radios -- that had been stolen from a nearby military base used by the Russian mercenaries. Alvin and Nelly never saw Damabakizi again. They believe he was tortured before he died. They don't know where his body is. Rich in natural resources, wracked by ethnic conflict, gripped by extreme poverty and rampant corruption, the Central African Republic (CAR) has long been a case study of a failed state. It has also become a laboratory for a dangerous political experiment: state capture by a private company. In this case, a company that pairs war-fighting and security with lucrative commercial interests, mainly extracting gold, diamonds, and timber. The company is, or was, the Wagner Group. The creation of a profane, politically connected St. Petersburg chef more than a decade ago, Wagner evolved into one of Russia's most potent fighting forces, at the vanguard of military operations on the ground in Syria, Libya, and most prominently, Ukraine. Yevgeny Prigozhin also built parallel business networks that eventually spread into enterprises as diverse as school-lunch catering in Russia and hardwood timber export-import in Africa. Wagner officially no longer exists, after Prigozhin was killed in an August 2023 plane crash that most experts believe was a targeted assassination, likely orchestrated at the highest levels of the Kremlin. The company's armed units were mostly split up, incorporated into the Defense Ministry and other Russian agencies. But Prigozhin's lucrative businesses largely remain -- especially in the Central African Republic, where they generate hundreds of millions of dollars in revenues from diamond and gold mining, timber harvesting, weapons trafficking, and other sources. Insecure Security Since 2018, Wagner fighters have acted as a personal security service for the country's president, Faustin-Archange Touadera, while also serving to prop up his government. After winning the presidency in 2015, Touadera was reelected in December 2020, though the vote was threatened by a violent challenge from Touadera's rival, Francois Bozize, who had been barred from running for reasons some observers said were dubious. Rebranded inside CAR, Wagner's successor units, meanwhile, have become a paramilitary police force, operating outside the law, committing human rights and other crimes with impunity. In CAR, "Wagner has perfected a blueprint for state capture, supporting a criminalized state hijacked by the Central African president and his inner circle, amassing military power, securing access to and plundering precious minerals, and subduing the population with terror," according to a 2023 report by The Sentry, a U.S.-based nongovernmental research organization that was co-founded by the actor George Clooney. People who have been victimized by Russian mercenaries say they can attest to the fear that Russian units have instilled in parts of the population. "Imagine what [little] power you have when people come with weapons and they don't speak your language," another man, who asked to be identified only by the name Adam, said in an interview in September. "Am I supposed to just wait until they come back again? Who knows what's going to happen if they do come back?" Adam, a shopkeeper in a village two hours southwest of the capital, Bangui, said that his store had been ransacked and robbed by "white guys with tattoos and face masks" who spoke Russian. "Outside of the capital...a lot of people are suffering there and no one seems to know" about it, he told RFE/RL. "It's my case but it's also the case of many more people in different places and regions." 'Unbridled Brutality' When Wagner mercenaries first deployed to CAR in 2018, they arrived ostensibly for a training and instruction mission, and to provide security services to Touadera's government. Wagner incorporated a company called Sewa Security Services to serve as the local entity overseeing Russian fighters in the country. A larger force of ex-Wagner fighters was incorporated by the Russian Defense Ministry under the name "Africa Corps." Up to 2,300 fighters may have been deployed at the height of the Wagner presence, by some estimates. As recently as September, a former top Wagner assault commander was appointed Touadera's top security adviser. Many people also credited Russian forces with tamping down a yearslong conflict fueled by religious and ethnic differences and the struggle for control over the country's wealth. Over the years that followed, however, activists, reporters, and experts -- even the United Nations -- accumulated a mountain of evidence pointing to crimes -- murder, torture, execution, abductions, rape, theft -- credibly linked to Wagner forces and their successor entities. Between 2018 and 2024, Russian troops were involved in more than 100 gun battles, and committed more than 362 incidents of violence against civilians, according to data collected by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data project, a U.S.-based nonprofit that tracks violent events around the world. The violence resulted in at least 786 fatalities. In 2021, a coalition of rebel groups launched an abortive coup targeting Touadera, following a contested presidential election. Wagner troops helped government forces repel the effort. In its wake, Russia's ambassador to the country, Vladimir Titorenko, declared that "the Russian soldiers will remain until the [opposition] rebels and the bandits of the armed groups are completely wiped out." In a 2022 report, Human Rights Watch quoted more than three dozen people who had been victims of various crimes between February 2019 and November 2021. All said the abuses were committed by men with white skin speaking Russian, a language the witnesses recognized. A UN working group that researched the use of mercenaries in CAR and elsewhere reported witness statements describing Russian officers committing rape and sexual violence against women, men, and young girls. Many survivors are reluctant to file formal complaints with authorities because of fear of retribution, the group found. Reports of torture are rampant; one common method, the UN monitoring group found, involves connecting a person's genitals to electric cables and then electrocuting them. "The welcome contribution of Russian bilateral forces to improving the security situation contrasts with the denunciation of the human rights violations they commit," a UN-appointed official, Yao Agbetse, said separately in an August 2022 report. Testimonies from witnesses point to "unbridled brutality" on the part of Russian forces. "By speaking to you, I also tell myself that they will react and I'm afraid because saying that I'm not afraid is not true," Alvin said in an interview with RFE/RL last November. "I don't know what might happen to me tomorrow or the day after." On the morning of August 9, 2024, Adam was manning his small food-and-goods shop in the village of Mbaiki when he noticed two pickup trucks, and a number of motorcycles, roaring into town. A group of heavily armed men started barking orders to local men and boys, demanding identification. Some appeared to be personnel from the Central African Armed Forces, known by the acronym FACA. They beat Adam and some of the other men with their guns, demanding to know if they had stored weapons, and, if so, where. They were followed, Adam said, by "white guys with tattoos and face masks" who spoke Russian. The Russians broke into his store and filled their vehicles with stolen goods, he said: "They took shoes, tents, cooking stoves, rice, cooking oil, even veterinary medicines. They emptied my store." The convoy then headed to another village, where they continued looting stores, asking local men to show IDs. Adam said his cousin, who tried to escape, was shot and thrown into the truck with the group of other men. The Russians drove the truck about 2 kilometers away, Adam said, then they cut his cousin's neck. "They left him near the main road, like 10 minutes' walk into the bush, then tied a rope around his belly and hung him in a nearby tree," he said. Sometime later, Adam and others found his cousin's body in the tree, he said. They cut his body down, then buried him. 'Who Am I Supposed To Complain To?' Igor Ngaisse said that, in December 2020, his aunt Albertine was gunned down by Russian soldiers, possibly as a bystander to a shootout with rebel fighters. On January 25, 2021, he said, he was lying down in his small house in Sibut, a village north of Bangui, when he suddenly heard gunfire outside. He waited until the shooting subsided, then peeked out of his room to see a Russian soldier walking down the hallway. Igor said he bolted out of the building, then listened as the soldier proceeded to fire his rifle into each room, and then rake the main living room with gunfire. Ngaisse said his 25-year-old younger sister remained hidden inside the house, frightened but unharmed. After the incident, which was covered by local media, Ngaisse sought help from the local police commissioner, he said, and they confronted what appeared to be a senior Russian officer, who then offered him 5,000 Central African francs (about $8), which seemed to be simply spare change in his pocket. Insulted, Ngaisse refused it. "If I have to complain, who am I supposed to complain to?" he told RFE/RL. "I don't know exactly what's happening in this country." "The number of victims of Wagner human rights abuses continues to increase," Jelena Aparac, who used to head the UN working group on mercenaries, told RFE/RL in a text message. "[Regrettably] there are no coordinated investigations and [no] effective accountability." And Russian soldiers have gained notoriety for the brutal tactics they've employed to intimidate people -- even those they have trained themselves. Like with Jose Befio, who had previously been recruited by government forces and trained by Wagner soldiers to command a local unit of a nationwide militia known as the Anti-balaka. Befio, who UN monitors said had been implicated in past violent crimes of his own, later backed away from supporting the government and its Russian allies. He spoke out against some of the crimes that Russian soldiers committed in the region, his uncle, Bachir Itoumandji, and two of his wives told RFE/RL. On July 23, 2024, Befio was sleeping in his home before dawn in the central town of Bouca when Russian soldiers burst in to kidnap him, and a close aide. Itoumandji said he and other relatives woke early to the sound of gunfire and explosions. When it ended at dawn, he drove to a local cotton gin facility, where the shooting had taken place. When he found the bodies of Befio and his aide, Itoumandji said, the Russians had beheaded the two and swapped their heads, putting Befio's head in the aide's arms, and vice versa. Photographs of the bodies circulated widely in the country, and the UN monitoring mission also recorded the incident. The bystanders who were already there told Itoumandji that Russian soldiers were responsible. "We brought him inside and put his head back in its place, and his comrade's," he said. "We washed the bodies before burying them." They also kidnapped three of Befio's young children and held them for days, Itoumandji said. When they were returned to the family, all three children had had their teeth pulled out. Befio's beheading was part of a pattern of atrocities and public executions committed by both Russian soldiers and FACA, said Charles Bouessel, a country expert with the International Crisis Group, a Belgian-based think tank. "Terror is used as a weapon because Wagner and FACA may not have enough forces to be present everywhere on the ground," Bouessel told RFE/RL. "They use fear, which can be an efficient way to get people to tell information, and sell information" to the Russians. Befio's beheading, and the photographs that circulated, also probably served as a public warning, he said. "It could be a message to other warlords, a way to pacify the country," Bouessel said. "It's possible this was a message: If you violate your promises to Wagner, this is what is waiting for you." Despite substantial evidence complied by rights activists, plus UN experts, Russian officials in Moscow and in Bangui have repeatedly denied accusations of Russians committing crimes in the country. "Russian military advisers could not participate and did not participate in murders or robberies. This is another lie," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in response to a 2021 United Nations report. RFE/RL sought comment from the CAR Foreign Ministry about the reports of Russian crimes, but received no response. A spokesman for Touadera's office also refused to answer questions, saying only that "cooperation with Russia is excellent and this [fact] disturbs the Westerners who want to demonize the Central African Republic." Despite the fear and intimidation inflicted -- with government blessing, experts say -- there's no indication that Russia's security presence is going anywhere anytime soon. If anything, Touadera and his administration have moved to deepen ties. Last month, Touadera traveled to Moscow, where he received a red-carpet welcome and a small honor guard parade just outside the Kremlin walls. A month earlier, meanwhile, a new monument appeared in the CAR capital: a pair of statues dedicated to the late Prigozhin, and Dmitry Utkin, the ex-soldier credited with being Wagner's first commander, who was also killed in the 2023 plane crash. RFE/RL contributor Jean-Fernand Koena reported from the Central African Republic. RFE/RL correspondents Maja Zivanovic and Mike Eckel reported from Prague.

Title: Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Best Long-term Stock to Invest In for High Returns?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Long-term Stocks to Invest in for High Returns. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks. The global economy seems to be at a point where fiscal ambition intersects with market skepticism, says Oakglen Wealth. Donald Trump’s presidential election and the Republican takeover of the US Senate and retention of the House of Representatives resulted in a complicated mix of policy goals. Notably, the broader market’s initial reaction hints at positivity given Trump’s plans for growth, hinting at the continued outperformance of US assets in the year ahead. Fidelity has an optimistic view of the financial sector, primarily because of steady economic growth for the broader US economy. Since the financial sector is cyclical, the sector’s performance is mainly a function of the strength of the broader economy. The US economy has been showing momentum and a path towards the desired “soft landing,” says Fidelity. Therefore, worries about a mild recession (which could have impacted the financial stocks) are alleviated. One significant difference in market dynamics entering 2025, in comparison to recent years, is the outlook on interest rates. The H2 2024 began a new rate cycle, with the US Fed cutting rates for the first time since the initial days of the pandemic. Banks might benefit from higher interest rates due to higher NIMs. On the other hand, lower rates can help boost confidence and decrease the pressure on economic growth, which is expected to be beneficial for virtually all industries in this sector, opines Fidelity. Within equities, Franklin Templeton has an optimistic outlook on IT, health care, energy, consumer staples, and industrial sectors. READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In. As per Russell Investments, the US economy is resilient as it enters 2025, but the road ahead is expected to be affected by shifting policy dynamics. On the positive side, tax cuts and deregulation can offer a meaningful growth boost, mainly to domestic and cyclical sectors. The investment firm believes that companies leveraging AI technologies to enhance productivity—mainly in industrials and healthcare— are expected to see material improvements to operating fundamentals. Even though the mega-cap AI stocks have fueled the market returns over recent years, leadership has been shifting to companies leveraging AI to develop real-world efficiencies. Russell Investments believes that the Trump administration’s policies offer a delicate balancing act. It assumes that the new administration will not aggressively pursue policies that can create inflation risk. Our Methodology To list the 12 Best Long-term Stocks to Invest in for High Returns, we sifted through several financial media reports related to the best long-term stocks to buy. After getting an initial list of 20 stocks, we chose the ones which analysts saw the most upside to. Finally, the stocks were ranked in ascending order of their average upside potential, as of February 6. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiments around each stock, as of Q3 2024. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Average Upside Potential: 36.0% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading designer of discrete graphics processing units that enhance the experience on computing platforms. Joseph Moore of Morgan Stanley gave an “Overweight” rating on the company’s stock, providing a price target of $152. The analyst noted that China’s DeepSeek, an AI model matching its American rivals in performance and at a much cheaper cost, established some challenges for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) around export controls and longer-term investment. Despite these challenges, Moore opines that near-term checks remain strong for its Hopper platform. The analyst believes that Blackwell’s supply visibility has been building and that customers’ desire to spend remains clearly visible. Elsewhere, Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial upped the company’s stock to “Strong Buy,” raising its price objective to $220. Even though DeepSeek's R1 AI model has been claiming competitive features at lower costs, Tigress Financial noted unknown capabilities and security concerns. The firm lauded NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s critical role in AI and data center growth and sees it as a long-term beneficiary of continued investments. Furthermore, lawmakers in the US have plans to ban DeepSeek. The AI infrastructure build-out continues to act as a major tailwind for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Notably, cloud service providers, sovereign states, and consumer internet companies have been fueling demand for AI computing power. Fred Alger Management, an investment management company, released its Q4 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) for a variety of end markets, such as gaming, PCs, data centers, virtual reality, and high-performance computing. The company is leading in most secular growth categories in computing, and especially artificial intelligence and super-computing parallel processing techniques for solving complex computational problems. In our view, Nvidia’s computational power is a critical enabler of AI and therefore essential to AI adoption. Shares contributed to performance during the quarter, driven by strong demand for its data center products, especially the Hopper H200 chips, which generated double-digit billions in revenue, marking the fastest product ramp in the company’s history. Management provided fiscal fourth-quarter revenue guidance above analyst estimates, along with resilient operating margins supported by robust demand and limited competition. In our view, Nvidia’s leadership in scaling AI infrastructure, including advancements in inference and test-time scaling (i.e., reasoning during inference), is driving adoption among enterprises and startups, providing continued demand for its high-performance chips and software solutions. As older-generation chips are repurposed for inference and new clusters are deployed, we believe Nvidia is well-positioned to capitalize on growing compute needs across AI applications.” Overall NVDA ranks 5th on our list of the best long-term stocks to invest in for high returns. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Fears Over Tariffs And AI Spending Overwhelm Better Earnings
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/02/08/fears-over-tariffs-and-ai-spending-overwhelm-better-earnings/
Time Published: 2025-02-08T15:52:41Z

Earnings season continues this week, with notable economic releases for inflation and consumer ... [+] spending. However, with President Trump threatening reciprocal tariffs, fundamental data could take a backseat to politics. With almost two-thirds of the fourth-quarter earnings season complete, the pace slows slightly with 77 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. Seventy-seven percent of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. Two of the Magnificent 7 reported earnings last week, with only Nvidia (NVDA) remaining on February 26. The Magnificent 7 consists of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tesla (TSLA). S&P 500 Earnings Season Despite robust earnings growth and a noisy but solid jobs report, concerns about President Donald Trump’s threatened additional tariffs and some worries about artificial intelligence spending caused some market consternation. The S&P 500 fell 0.2% for the week, but the Magnificent 7 lost 2.8%. Market Returns According to FactSet data, industrials, consumer discretionary, and healthcare contributed most significantly to last week's earnings growth improvement, while the industrials sector was the largest detractor. Uber Technologies (UBER) was the most significant contributor to industrials, with Amazon.com (AMZN) being the most critical contributor to the consumer discretionary sector. Within healthcare, earnings beats by Pfizer (PFE) and Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) increased the earnings growth rate. The financial sector is expected to show the most rapid year-over-year growth rate in the S&P 500, followed by communications services and consumer discretionary. The energy sector is at the bottom, with a forecasted almost twenty-eight percent decline in year-over-year earnings. Estimated Earnings By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this point in the earnings season, sales growth at 5.2% exceeds expectations, with the tailwind from 5% year-over-year nominal GDP growth. Estimated Sales By Sales Due primarily to the robust earnings growth for financials, communication services, and consumer discretionary, the blended earnings performance has significantly outperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at +16.4% year-over-year, above the expectation of +11.9% at the end of the quarter. S&P 500 Earnings Summary Because these companies are a critical driver of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 are the group to watch this earnings season. Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) reported last week. While earnings growth was robust for both, it was below very high expectations, and the stocks were sent lower for the week. Separately, investors are questioning whether both companies' increased AI infrastructure spending will yield a good return on investment. Looking at Alphabet specifically, their cloud business revenue, including AI infrastructure demand, grew by 30% year-over-year, but that slowed from the 35% growth in the previous quarter. Notably, the company said capacity constraints, not demand, were the issue. The company expects to spend about $75 billion in 2025 on additional AI infrastructure, an increase of 43% over 2024. Aside from focusing on AI, Alphabet’s core businesses, search and YouTube, performed well in the quarter. Nvidia (NVDA) is the final group member to report earnings, scheduled for February 26. The introduction of DeepSeek led to worries that demand for their AI chips might falter, so the stock had been down over 20% from its peak until last week’s 8% rally. Alphabet and Amazon announced significant increases in capital spending to meet AI capacity demands, which helped reduce worries that a decline in demand for NVIDIA’s chipsets could be imminent. Notable companies reporting this week are McDonald’s (MCD), Coca-Cola (KO), Humana (HUM), Kraft Heinz (KHC), Applied Materials (AMAT), and Airbnb (ABNB). Magnificent 7: Q4 Earnings Growth It was a noisy monthly jobs report on Friday. Non-farm payrolls grew by 143,000 in January, which was below consensus. More recent months were revised higher but offset by downward revisions to farther out months. Both household employment measures are distorted by a much higher than typical adjustment for immigration-related adjustments. These adjustments also helped send the unemployment rate down to 4%. The workweek fell to a 5-year low of 34.1 hours, and hourly earnings rose more than expected. Though the government said that the numbers showed no impact from the L.A. fires and weather conditions, it seems likely that there was an impact, so it's best to take this month’s job data with a grain of salt. Monthly Job Growth Looking at other labor market data for some clarity, initial claims for unemployment benefits remain low, so there is no sign of a collapse in the job market. Initial Jobless Claims Given the mixed and noisy monthly jobs report, markets and the Federal Reserve (Fed) will wait for more straightforward data to make any decisions about the economy. The Fed is expected to be on the sidelines until mid-year when it might resume short-term interest rate cuts. Regarding the U.S. economy, the crucial releases will be Wednesday’s consumer inflation (CPI) and Friday’s retail sales numbers. CPI is expected to hold steady at an above-target 2.9% rate, but the details will be more critical with housing costs and services inflation closely watched. Retail sales are expected to slow from December’s rapid pace, but the U.S. consumer is the lifeblood of the economy. U.S. CPI Inflation Estimate Earnings season slows, but plenty of important companies are reporting this week. Fundamental data could take a backseat to politics. President Trump announced he would roll out reciprocal tariffs this week to match the levies other countries put on U.S. imports. Markets would probably see these as positive relative to the original thought of a 10% to 20% global tariff, but it would almost certainly add the European Union to the targeted regions. The duration of the higher tariffs, retaliatory action by impacted countries, the strength of the U.S. dollar, and the ability to switch to domestically produced or imports from non-impacted countries will impact any price increases or demand shocks caused by the tariffs, so the ultimate result is impossible to know. In any case, markets dislike uncertainty, so tariff news should add to volatility. Disclosure: Glenview Trust holds many stocks mentioned in this article within its recommended investment strategies.

Earnings season continues this week, with notable economic releases for inflation and consumer ... [+] spending. However, with President Trump threatening reciprocal tariffs, fundamental data could take a backseat to politics. With almost two-thirds of the fourth-quarter earnings season complete, the pace slows slightly with 77 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. Seventy-seven percent of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. Two of the Magnificent 7 reported earnings last week, with only Nvidia (NVDA) remaining on February 26. The Magnificent 7 consists of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tesla (TSLA). S&P 500 Earnings Season Despite robust earnings growth and a noisy but solid jobs report, concerns about President Donald Trump’s threatened additional tariffs and some worries about artificial intelligence spending caused some market consternation. The S&P 500 fell 0.2% for the week, but the Magnificent 7 lost 2.8%. Market Returns According to FactSet data, industrials, consumer discretionary, and healthcare contributed most significantly to last week's earnings growth improvement, while the industrials sector was the largest detractor. Uber Technologies (UBER) was the most significant contributor to industrials, with Amazon.com (AMZN) being the most critical contributor to the consumer discretionary sector. Within healthcare, earnings beats by Pfizer (PFE) and Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) increased the earnings growth rate. The financial sector is expected to show the most rapid year-over-year growth rate in the S&P 500, followed by communications services and consumer discretionary. The energy sector is at the bottom, with a forecasted almost twenty-eight percent decline in year-over-year earnings. Estimated Earnings By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this point in the earnings season, sales growth at 5.2% exceeds expectations, with the tailwind from 5% year-over-year nominal GDP growth. Estimated Sales By Sales Due primarily to the robust earnings growth for financials, communication services, and consumer discretionary, the blended earnings performance has significantly outperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at +16.4% year-over-year, above the expectation of +11.9% at the end of the quarter. S&P 500 Earnings Summary Because these companies are a critical driver of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 are the group to watch this earnings season. Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) reported last week. While earnings growth was robust for both, it was below very high expectations, and the stocks were sent lower for the week. Separately, investors are questioning whether both companies' increased AI infrastructure spending will yield a good return on investment. Looking at Alphabet specifically, their cloud business revenue, including AI infrastructure demand, grew by 30% year-over-year, but that slowed from the 35% growth in the previous quarter. Notably, the company said capacity constraints, not demand, were the issue. The company expects to spend about $75 billion in 2025 on additional AI infrastructure, an increase of 43% over 2024. Aside from focusing on AI, Alphabet’s core businesses, search and YouTube, performed well in the quarter. Nvidia (NVDA) is the final group member to report earnings, scheduled for February 26. The introduction of DeepSeek led to worries that demand for their AI chips might falter, so the stock had been down over 20% from its peak until last week’s 8% rally. Alphabet and Amazon announced significant increases in capital spending to meet AI capacity demands, which helped reduce worries that a decline in demand for NVIDIA’s chipsets could be imminent. Notable companies reporting this week are McDonald’s (MCD), Coca-Cola (KO), Humana (HUM), Kraft Heinz (KHC), Applied Materials (AMAT), and Airbnb (ABNB). Magnificent 7: Q4 Earnings Growth It was a noisy monthly jobs report on Friday. Non-farm payrolls grew by 143,000 in January, which was below consensus. More recent months were revised higher but offset by downward revisions to farther out months. Both household employment measures are distorted by a much higher than typical adjustment for immigration-related adjustments. These adjustments also helped send the unemployment rate down to 4%. The workweek fell to a 5-year low of 34.1 hours, and hourly earnings rose more than expected. Though the government said that the numbers showed no impact from the L.A. fires and weather conditions, it seems likely that there was an impact, so it's best to take this month’s job data with a grain of salt. Monthly Job Growth Looking at other labor market data for some clarity, initial claims for unemployment benefits remain low, so there is no sign of a collapse in the job market. Initial Jobless Claims Given the mixed and noisy monthly jobs report, markets and the Federal Reserve (Fed) will wait for more straightforward data to make any decisions about the economy. The Fed is expected to be on the sidelines until mid-year when it might resume short-term interest rate cuts. Regarding the U.S. economy, the crucial releases will be Wednesday’s consumer inflation (CPI) and Friday’s retail sales numbers. CPI is expected to hold steady at an above-target 2.9% rate, but the details will be more critical with housing costs and services inflation closely watched.

Title: ROSEN, TRUSTED INVESTOR COUNSEL, Encourages Novo Nordisk A/S Investors to Secure Counsel Before Important Deadline in Securities Class Action – NVO

Time Published: 2025-02-08T15:00:00Z
Full Content:
February 08, 2025 10:00 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Feb. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important March 25, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1.” Defendants’ statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants’ statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk’s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

February 08, 2025 09:41 ET | Source: Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP SAN DIEGO, Feb. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The law firm of Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP announces that purchasers or acquirers of Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz (NASDAQ: KSPI) publicly traded securities between January 19, 2024 and September 19, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), have until February 18, 2025 to seek appointment as lead plaintiff of the Kaspi.kz class action lawsuit. Captioned Krivenok v. Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz, No. 24-cv-10926 (C.D. Cal.), the Kaspi.kz class action lawsuit charges Kaspi.kz as well as certain of Kaspi.kz’s top executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. If you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the Kaspi.kz class action lawsuit, please provide your information here: https://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-joint-stock-company-kaspi-kz-class-action-lawsuit-kspi.html You can also contact attorneys J.C. Sanchez or Jennifer N. Caringal of Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail at info@rgrdlaw.com. CASE ALLEGATIONS: Kaspi.kz provides payments, marketplace, and fintech solutions for consumers and merchants in the Republic of Kazakhstan. The Kaspi.kz class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Kaspi.kz continued doing business with Russian entities, and also providing services to Russian citizens, after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, thereby exposing Kaspi.kz to the undisclosed risk of sanctions; (ii) Kaspi.kz engaged in undisclosed related party transactions; and (iii) certain of Kaspi.kz’s executives have links to reputed criminals. The Kaspi.kz class action lawsuit further alleges that on September 19, 2024, Culper Research issued a report entitled “Kaspi.kz (KSPI): The NASDAQ-Listed Fintech Moving Money for Criminals and Kleptocrats.” On this news, the price of Kaspi.kz American depositary shares fell nearly 19% over two trading sessions, according to the complaint. THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired Kaspi.kz publicly traded securities during the Class Period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the Kaspi.kz class action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the Kaspi.kz class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the Kaspi.kz class action lawsuit. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff of the Kaspi.kz class action lawsuit.

February 08, 2025 08:07 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, Feb. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Novo Nordisk, you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/novo-nordisk-as. Investors have until March 25, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and is captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, et al., No. 25-cv-00713. Why was Novo Nordisk Sued for Securities Fraud? Novo Nordisk is a healthcare company focused on the research, development, manufacturing, and distribution of pharmaceutical products globally. During the relevant period, Novo Nordisk was conducting its highly anticipated Phase 3 study, REDEFINE-1, for CagriSema, an investigational drug developed for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Novo Nordisk discussed REDEFINE-1’s trial protocol and anticipated results, stating that, after a dose escalation period, participants receiving CagriSema were to receive a once-weekly maintenance dosage of 2.4 mg cagrilintide and 2.4 mg semaglutide for the remainder of the trial period. In truth, REDEFINE-1 employed a flexible dosing design that left it to patient discretion to choose both their maintenance dose and any decision to lower the dosing during the trial. This undisclosed trial design introduced a heightened risk that jeopardized the Company’s ability to achieve its anticipated results The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On December 20, 2024, Novo Nordisk announced that CagriSema had missed its expected average weight loss target at the conclusion of the REDEFINE-1 trial. The Company attributed its diminished result, in part, on the previously undisclosed “flexible” nature of the protocol whereby patients were able to “modify their dosing throughout the trial.” This flexibility resulted in less than 60% of patients taking the contemplated maintenance dose at the end of the trial. On this news, the price of Novo Nordisk stock declined roughly 18% during the course of the trading day, from a closing price of $103.44 per share on December 19, 2024 to $85.00 per share on December 20, 2024.

Title: This 7.6% Dividend Can Protect Your Wealth From A Trade War

USA flag Canadian Flag Mexico Flag side by side Trade tensions ratcheted up to 11 this week, and I know that for many readers the wild swings we’re seeing can feel sickening. To you, I say that times like these are exactly why we hold the closed-end funds in our CEF Insider portfolio. Their high, steady dividends (more than 10% on average across the portfolio) let us collect our income while stocks regain their footing. We also avoid the trap of panic selling, then seeing the story whipsaw the other way, locking in our losses (which would’ve happened if you’d hit the sell button first thing Monday morning). That’s a key advantage of all CEFs. And perhaps the coolest thing here is that we have CEFs that are purpose-built for times like these, like the Nuveen S&P 500 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (SPXX)—current yield 7.6%. That’s because SPXX “goes on offense” in the form of exposure to S&P 500 stocks like Microsoft (MSFT), American Express (AXP) and Pfizer (PFE). At the same time, it plays “defense” with a strategy that creates more income when volatility ticks up. That strategy is the fund’s sales of covered-call options. These offer investors the right to buy SPXX’s stocks at a fixed time in the future, at a fixed price. If the stock fails to hit that price (more likely in a correction), nothing happens, and SPXX keeps the fee it charges for the option, fueling its 7.6% payout. Here’s how recent trade drama sets the table for SPXX and CEFs like it. No matter what ultimately happens, in terms of the length or level of tariffs ultimately imposed (and on whom), the question is to what extent they’d change the flow of funds between manufacturers, importers, retailers and consumers. More important, we want to know whether those changes would result in less consumption and, as a result, economic troubles. For Canada, tariffs would almost certainly mean a recession, since 77% of Canada’s exports go to the U.S. The situation is similar in Mexico. About 78% of that country’s exports go to the U.S., with the automotive, agricultural and energy sectors most likely to get hit. This, in turn, could cause prices for food from Mexico and energy from Canada to rise. This also explains why the U.S., Canada, and Mexico reached a deal to pause these tariffs for a month, which means investors don’t have to worry about the impacts of a potential trade war for now. But a month isn’t a particularly long time, and we can expect other factors influencing trade and prices to become more significant. Expect more discussion about other factors driving the price movements of food and energy that could offset the tariffs, such as the fact that Canada has boosted energy production, including 7% year-over-year increases in crude-oil output, according to the Canadian government. All of this leaves first-level investors — by those I mean the ones who stick mainly to the big-cap S&P 500 names — struggling to figure out if Trump’s tariffs will damage company valuations or not. One thing that’s for sure (as we CEF investors know well) is that, given that the worst-case scenario is for higher inflation, selling stocks and going to cash (which loses value faster as inflation rises) makes no sense. Further, a U.S. recession is unlikely, as early indicators of over 3% GDP growth suggest the economy is firing on all cylinders. Even in a scenario where China, Canada and Mexico were to retaliate in full, America just doesn’t export enough for that to hit the entire economy all at the same time. A jittery stock market underpinned by a still-strong economy is perfect for SPXX and other covered-call CEFs. That fact is starting to catch more investors’ attention. Consider that since I wrote about SPXX here on Contrarian Outlook in late November, it has returned about 5%, as of this writing, while the S&P 500 has been flat. Market volatility has been driving SPXX’s performance, and the attention that’s been attracting has shrunk its discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of the stocks it holds) to 4.7%. Note that SPXX’s discount hasn’t flipped to the big premium it saw in 2022, when investors were hunting for pretty well anything that could give them a volatility hedge. And if fears keep growing — on tariffs or whatever else — expect SPXX’s discount to flip to a premium (taking its market price with it). Meantime, buying SPXX now means collecting its 7.6% dividend while we wait for that to happen. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

At the same time, it plays “defense” with a strategy that creates more income when volatility ticks up. That strategy is the fund’s sales of covered-call options. These offer investors the right to buy SPXX’s stocks at a fixed time in the future, at a fixed price. If the stock fails to hit that price (more likely in a correction), nothing happens, and SPXX keeps the fee it charges for the option, fueling its 7.6% payout. Here’s how recent trade drama sets the table for SPXX and CEFs like it. No matter what ultimately happens, in terms of the length or level of tariffs ultimately imposed (and on whom), the question is to what extent they’d change the flow of funds between manufacturers, importers, retailers and consumers. More important, we want to know whether those changes would result in less consumption and, as a result, economic troubles. For Canada, tariffs would almost certainly mean a recession, since 77% of Canada’s exports go to the U.S. The situation is similar in Mexico. About 78% of that country’s exports go to the U.S., with the automotive, agricultural and energy sectors most likely to get hit. This, in turn, could cause prices for food from Mexico and energy from Canada to rise. This also explains why the U.S., Canada, and Mexico reached a deal to pause these tariffs for a month, which means investors don’t have to worry about the impacts of a potential trade war for now. But a month isn’t a particularly long time, and we can expect other factors influencing trade and prices to become more significant. Expect more discussion about other factors driving the price movements of food and energy that could offset the tariffs, such as the fact that Canada has boosted energy production, including 7% year-over-year increases in crude-oil output, according to the Canadian government. All of this leaves first-level investors — by those I mean the ones who stick mainly to the big-cap S&P 500 names — struggling to figure out if Trump’s tariffs will damage company valuations or not. One thing that’s for sure (as we CEF investors know well) is that, given that the worst-case scenario is for higher inflation, selling stocks and going to cash (which loses value faster as inflation rises) makes no sense. Further, a U.S. recession is unlikely, as early indicators of over 3% GDP growth suggest the economy is firing on all cylinders. Even in a scenario where China, Canada and Mexico were to retaliate in full, America just doesn’t export enough for that to hit the entire economy all at the same time. A jittery stock market underpinned by a still-strong economy is perfect for SPXX and other covered-call CEFs. That fact is starting to catch more investors’ attention. Consider that since I wrote about SPXX here on Contrarian Outlook in late November, it has returned about 5%, as of this writing, while the S&P 500 has been flat. Market volatility has been driving SPXX’s performance, and the attention that’s been attracting has shrunk its discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of the stocks it holds) to 4.7%. Note that SPXX’s discount hasn’t flipped to the big premium it saw in 2022, when investors were hunting for pretty well anything that could give them a volatility hedge. And if fears keep growing — on tariffs or whatever else — expect SPXX’s discount to flip to a premium (taking its market price with it). Meantime, buying SPXX now means collecting its 7.6% dividend while we wait for that to happen. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Is Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) the Best Stock to Invest In for Grandchildren?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best Stocks To Invest In For Grandchildren. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other stocks. In an era where financial literacy is increasingly recognized as a crucial life skill, teaching children about stock market investing can provide them with a significant advantage. Studies show that early financial education leads to better money management, long-term wealth accumulation, and greater financial security in adulthood. By introducing children to investing at a young age, they can develop a mindset of patience, risk assessment, and the power of compounding—principles that can shape their financial future. A 2023 study by the National Financial Educators Council (NFEC) found that a lack of financial literacy costs the average American $1,819 per year. Teaching children about investing early can help reduce this financial gap and equip them with the necessary skills to navigate economic challenges. Introducing children to stocks helps them understand concepts like risk and reward, diversification, and market fluctuations. Learning how companies operate and grow their revenue also fosters a deeper understanding of the economy. This knowledge can prevent common financial mistakes such as emotional investing, excessive debt, and poor money management. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. One of the most compelling reasons to teach children about investing is the power of compound interest. If a child begins investing at age 10 instead of waiting until age 30, they could amass significantly more wealth by retirement, simply by starting early. Teaching children about stocks encourages critical thinking and discipline in financial decisions. Instead of seeing money as something to be spent impulsively, they learn the value of investing for the future. A study by Fidelity Investments found that 82% of parents who teach their children about finances believe it leads to greater financial independence. Additionally, teaching investment concepts through real-life experiences, such as monitoring a stock portfolio, fosters engagement and practical learning. With advancements in AI, automation, and digital finance, future generations will need financial acumen to navigate an evolving economy. Experts suggest that children who understand investing will be better prepared for retirement, homeownership, and entrepreneurship.

For this article, we scoured investing forums, analyst reports, and advice from money managers and billionaires and compiled a list of stock options that are deemed the best for a child in the modern world. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

(NASDAQ:AVGO) is a global technology firm that designs, develops, and supplies a range of semiconductors, enterprise software and security solutions. In January, the company launched its innovative Emulex Secure Fibre Channel Host Bus Adapters (HBA), setting a new industry standard. It is a cost-effective, easy-to-manage solution that encrypts all data as it moves between servers and storage. Jeff Hoogenboom, vice president and general manager of the Emulex Connectivity Division at Broadcom, stated that the Emulex Secure Host Bus Adapter would meet the needs by providing an elegantly simple solution that, once installed, encrypts all data across all applications. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the company achieved record semiconductor revenue of $30.1 billion, with $12.2 billion coming from AI. The 220% surge in AI revenue year-on-year was fueled by the company’s advanced AI XPUs and Ethernet networking solutions. Overall AVGO ranks 7th on our list of the best stocks to invest in for grandchildren. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Meta to Begin Previously Announced Workforce Reduction

Meta is set to begin its previously announced workforce reduction on Monday (Feb. 10). The company told staff on Friday (Feb. 7) that those who are laid off will be cut off from Meta’s internal system within an hour and notified about their severance packages via email, The Information reported Friday. CNBC reported on Jan. 14 that Meta planned to cut about 5% of its “low performers,” as the move was described in internal messages from company executives, and that the employees affected by the cuts would be notified Feb. 10. Meta has more than 72,000 employees. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote in one of the internal messages, per the report: “Meta is working on building some of the most important technologies of the world. AI, glasses as the next computing platform and the future of social media. This is going to be an intense year, and I want to make sure we have the best people on our teams.” Amazon, Microsoft and Salesforce reportedly planned or made layoffs during the first weeks of 2025. It was reported Tuesday (Feb. 4) that Salesforce is eliminating over 1,000 jobs while hiring staff to sell its artificial intelligence products. Workers who are displaced will be able to apply for other roles within the company. On Jan. 29, it was reported that Amazon was laying off dozens of people in its communication department. Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser said the move aimed to “help us move faster, increase ownership, strengthen our culture, and bring teams closer to customers.” Microsoft reportedly plans to pause hiring in part of its U.S. consulting business and said in January that it would lay off less than 1% of its workforce. The hiring pause is reportedly part of the Microsoft consulting division’s efforts to manage costs. As for Meta, it was reported Thursday (Feb. 6) the company could pull the plug on its metaverse efforts. Meta Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth told employees in Reality Labs — the home of its metaverse and wearables products — that “this year likely determines whether this entire effort will go down as the work of visionaries or a legendary misadventure.” We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Meta goes to war with leakers

A culture fight is playing out inside the social media giant. Also: DOGE inefficiency and more layoffs. A culture fight is playing out inside the social media giant. Also: DOGE inefficiency and more layoffs. by Alex Heath During a Q&A with employees earlier this week, one of Meta’s top executives gave an ominous warning. After lamenting “a tremendous number of leaks” from inside the company, CTO Andrew Bosworth said that, while he didn’t want to “ruin the surprises,” the company was “making progress on catching people.” Since Mark Zuckerberg’s comments at a recent all-hands meeting were published, Meta’s leaders have tried to clamp down on an agitated and tense cohort of workers. The power struggle isn’t over. It’s unclear how Meta is going to look on the other side. “There’s a funny thing that’s happening with these leaks,” Bosworth said during his Q&A earlier this week (a recording of which I obtained). “When things leak, I think a lot of times people think, ‘Ah, okay, this is leaked, therefore it’ll put pressure on us to change things.’ The opposite is more likely.” “This is a company that, from Mark’s inception, as far as I can tell, has always played the repeat game,” he said. “And if you create an environment where leaks cause people to make things change internally, then it creates more leaks. You create an incentive structure that’s wrong… I think that’s a thing that we should change. I think we probably will at some point but I don’t know when that’s going to be.” Like any company with tens of thousands of employees, Meta is not a monolith. There are still true believers and those who also do their best to just tune out the drama. But there are also reasons for concern: Employees are on edge about Zuckerberg’s next round of “low-performer” layoffs that are arriving on Monday. And many are still reeling from his politically-charged changes to content moderation and DEI programs. The disconnect between that group of concerned employees and upper management was on full display during Bosworth’s Q&A earlier this week. At one point, he responded to a question from a female employee on Zuckerberg’s widely-circulated comment to Joe Rogan about wanting more “masculine energy” in the workplace. The employee asked Bosworth to respond to Zuckerberg saying that companies need “less feminine energy.” Zuckerberg never technically said that in the interview with Rogan, though one could easily interpret the “masculine energy” soundbite to mean that the CEO wants a more specific kind of energy at the expense of the other. Bosworth went off. “This really bothered me because it’s evident from your question that you did not actually listen to the thing you are criticizing or asking questions about. And that is not acceptable. I don’t know why people think it’s an okay thing to take something laundered through a biased source construct and bring it here without even bothering to look at anything that is free and online.” “He wants us to be a place that supports all people,” he continued. “He says that in the interview and then you come in here and you haven’t even bothered to listen to the thing. It’s like three minutes. It wouldn’t take you that long. So, you can tell from your question [that] you didn’t even read it. You didn’t even listen to it. You just read something online and got real mad about it. You’ve been mad about it for weeks, obviously. For weeks, you’ve been mad about it. It’s crazy.” Some noteworthy job changes in the tech world: If you haven’t already, don’t forget to subscribe to The Verge, which includes unlimited access to Command Line, all of our reporting, and an improved ad experience on the web.
