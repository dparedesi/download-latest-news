Is crypto winter coming? It's already more than set in for bitcoin treasury companies (BTCTC). Aiming to replicate the once-in-a-generation success of Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy (MSTR) and perhaps taking advantage of a U.S. regulatory regime that is willing to look the other way at questionable public offerings, a wave of crypto asset treasury companies have gone public in 2025. The result has been massive investor losses nearly across the board. And while the plunge in the price of bitcoin BTC$108,746.91 over the past 11 days (yes, it was only Monday, Oct. 3 when BTC peaked above $126,000) can be blamed for some of the carnage, BTCTC share prices were tumbling well prior to that. Checking a small group of BTCTCs, losses over the past three months range from "just" 38% in the case of Strategy to 94% for KindlyMD (NAKA). As his TerraUSD algorithmic stablecoin began de-pegging from the dollar in May 2022, Do Kwon famously tweeted, "Deploying more capital — steady lads." Within days, TerraUSD, which had previously commanded a market cap of about $50 billion, was worthless. That social media post has gone on to become a meme for the crypto community whenever things start to look questionable for the markets or any companies. This isn't to suggest any level of comparable shiftiness or criminality, or to predict the future BTCTCs, but some of the executive teams at these firms have recently been uber-busy on social networks in defense of their business models. Simon Gerovich, CEO of Japan's Metaplanet (MTPLF) — which remains higher since it adopted the BTCTC strategy in 2024, but has had a 70% share price decline over the past three months — on Friday attempted to make the case for why a shift to preferred stock issuance will deliver strong returns to shareholders. "When bitcoin appreciates faster than the cost of capital, that difference compounds into greater bitcoin per share and the benefit accrues to the common shareholders," he said in a post on X. The tl;dr: Metaplanet investors will benefit if "number go up." KindlyMD CEO David Bailey — whose 94% share plunge over the past three months has left the stock price below $1 and in danger of being delisted by the Nasdaq — on Thursday found it necessary to deny the claims of an X poster that his company had "FTX vibes." "In no way is there any similarity to FTX," said Bailey. "We’re a regulated, registered security that buys and holds bitcoin." When the CEO of publicly traded company has to respond to a random s--tposter to say "we're not FTX," it's safe to say the plot may have been lost. Then there was Strive (ASST) CIO Ben Werkman — whose share price plunge has nearly matched that of NAKA and also faces delisting danger — attempting to explain the difficulties and a way forward. "Now the exuberance is gone, and many companies are now in position with their balance sheets intact to be able to move to the second phase of the journey," said Werkman in an extremely long post to X. "Achieving scale is difficult, but now many companies have it," he continued. "Valuations are reaching what I would consider deep value territory (just based on balance sheets alone), and these are the valuations where many investors will place their bets for the long term." Werkman went on to remind that many assumed Saylor's Strategy (then MicroStrategy) was going to zero in 2022's crypto winter. Those who faded that assumption were rewarded with mind-boggling returns. MSTR was trading at about $30 when Do Kwon made his "steady lads" post. Even after their recent decline, the shares are still at $290 — or nearly a 10-bagger over the last three and a half years. Whatever the future may hold for the BTCTCs, one thing is for sure: the vibes are anything but positive at the moment. If any of the latecomers are going to mirror the massive success of first mover Strategy, it could require a lot more than just a rising bitcoin price.

One important source to distil their India plans is from their quarterly earnings calls. With the September earnings season having just begun, starting this week we will bring to you what CXOs of global corporations are saying about India and their perspectives and plans in this column. Here are some from companies that reported their earnings so far. BlackRock Inc (BLK, $182.3 billion) The world’s largest asset manager said its JioBlackRock venture marks a key step in expanding access to local investing and retirement products in India. “The Indian market remains largely untapped and is today a country of savers rather than investors. Through JioBlackRock, we’re enabling individuals to more easily invest in their local economies and financial assets.” Brown-Forman Corp (BFB, $13.4 billion) The American spirits-maker sees India as a major long-term growth engine for its flagship Jack Daniel’s brand, driven by premiumisation and rising social acceptance of alcohol. “Since Covid, there’s been a rising social acceptance of beverage alcohol in India, particularly among younger consumers. India is the second-largest whiskey market in the world, growing around 8 per cent annually — a perfect storm for Jack Daniel’s growth.” Firan Technology Group (FTG, C$254.8 billion) The Canadian aerospace and defence electronics firm is setting up a new manufacturing facility in Hyderabad to tap India’s cost advantages and policy support. “We concluded India is a very cost-effective place for manufacturing, with Prime Minister Modi’s Make in India policy and strong aerospace spending making it an ideal place to operate.” Pernod Ricard SA (RI, €21.9 billion) The French spirits major reported steady growth in India despite a sharp excise tax hike in Maharashtra that weighed on demand. “While India continues to enjoy strong consumer demand, the 50 per cent increase in excise tax in Maharashtra led to higher prices and a consequential impact on sales, partly offset by strong growth in Royal Stag and international brands like Jameson.” Published on October 18, 2025 Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Title: Ready To Retire? These 8%+ CEFs Show The Way

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. I’m regularly struck by something American investors always seem to take for granted: The many choices we have available to gain financial independence. And investors in closed-end funds (CEFs) make the most of these choices. These high-yielding funds kick out 8%+ dividends on average, and the portfolio of my CEF Insider service, which helps investors make the most of CEFs, pays even more, with its 18 holdings paying a rich average yield of 9.4%. Plus, these funds offer stock-like upside, which makes them pretty much tailor-made for delivering financial freedom. We’ll sketch out how two specific CEFs can help you find your way to an earlier, richer retirement in a bit. But first, back to that embarrassment of choices I mentioned a second ago. Back in my 20s, when I was studying to get my PhD in Europe, I was told I had to pay into the national pension fund, and I would get that money back when I qualified for it. At that time, I qualified at 62, which seemed absurd—nearly 40 years for me (a severely underpaid academic!) to get back money I desperately needed today. But as it turns out, I was lucky. Europe’s mandatory retirement age is rising. Denmark, which currently has the oldest retirement age in Europe at 67, is raising that to 70. Germany, where a normal retirement age is currently 66, is discussing raising that to 73. Whether you like the life of a worker or not, I’m almost certain that you like having the ability to choose that life without having to worry about governments changing the rules on you mid-game. This lack of choice pushed me away from Europe in my 20s and led me back to America. Here’s what I found when I returned. This chart shows that the average American household has gone from $200k in savings in the 1980s to $1.2 million now—and, no, that isn’t due to inflation. That $200k in savings would be $535k in 2025 dollars, so more than half of the jump to $1.2 million is due to actual value being created. Of course, that wealth isn’t going everywhere. While all households have gotten richer on average, the top 0.1% of the population is attracting a greater proportion of overall wealth in the US, now near 14%. The ethics of this aside, it’s clear that the households that have more wealth now have more choices—about when to retire, where to live, what lifestyle to adopt and so on. In a way, it seems like Europeans have too little choice and Americans have so much that retirement investing can be tough for individual investors to navigate without either taking undue risks or locking themselves into weak returns. This is where CEFs come in, with their focus on assets from well-established companies. Plus their high yields almost act like a “mini-pension,” boosting your income without leaving you at the whim of the government. This is the way I viewed CEFs in my late 20s, when I began using their high dividends to get the income I needed to make the choices I wanted. I still view them this way. And in addition to their big dividends, these funds often chalk up strong returns, too, thanks in large part to their discounts to net asset value (NAV, or the value of their underlying portfolios). As these discounts—which only apply to CEFs, by the way—shrink, they put upward pressure on the fund’s price. And the best part is that CEFs are easy to buy, trading on public markets just like stocks. Consider the first CEF we’re looking at today, the Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX). It’s one of the oldest funds in the world, tracing its history back to the 19th century (and is a current CEF Insider holding, too). This one is about as blue chip as it gets, with stocks like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon.com (AMZN) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) among its top holdings. What’s more—and this is the key part—ADX trades at an 8.3% discount to NAV as I write this, and that discount is in the sweet spot, cheaper than it was a few months ago but carrying momentum as it steams toward par. ADX has been paying dividends since before the Great Depression, and its 8.3% dividend yield is fully covered by the 13.3% total NAV return (or the return on its underlying portfolio) it’s enjoyed over the last decade. Moreover, ADX has delivered a 5,340% return to its shareholders, with dividends reinvested, since the late 1980s, when US household wealth just started to meaningfully tick higher. That kind of performance—coming our way at a discount and with an 8.3% dividend—is exactly what we want from our “mini-pension,” and ADX delivers. But, as I said, we do have choices here. And ADX isn’t the only US-stock-focused CEF that delivers a large income stream and has withstood the test of time. Another is the General American Investors Company (GAM), which was launched in 1927 and yielded an impressive 9.4% to investors in 2024. GAM also holds large caps, with Alphabet (GOOGL), Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) and Apple (AAPL) among its top holdings. And, like ADX, this fund’s market price–based return has been strong over the last decade—though not quite as strong as ADX—with a 14.4% annualized return. Moreover, GAM’s 9.3% discount sounds like a good deal, but that’s near its smallest-ever level, so we’re not rushing out to buy the fund today. But it is worth watching, and gets tempting when that discount drops to double digits. But the larger point remains: With high-yielding CEFs like these, we can start generating a meaningful income stream we can choose to use however we like.

Title: Apple is still the best brand in the world, according to Interbrand's report

The Best Global Brands shows which brands are going up, and which are going down... When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Interbrand has released its annual Best Global Brands ranking and there's very little movement at the top. The top five are Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Samsung in that order, showing that Apple is still... well.... the Apple of many eyes. Other notable brands that rose up through the ranks include Nvidia, Instagram, YouTube, Uber and Netflix. Nvidia had a particularly huge increase (116 per cent), the biggest in the history of the Best Global Brands. There is also the highest number of new entries of any Best Global Brands report, with Uniqlo, Booking.com, Shopify and Blackrock among the newcomers. The reports methodology includes looking at financial analysis, the role of the brand (the portion of the purchase decision attributable to the brand as opposed to other factors) and brand strength, which takes into account brand loyalty. And it's no surprise to us that some of these top brands are also in our best logos list. In the automotive sector, Toyota held on to its number 6 position while Mercedes and BMW also made the top 20 (10 and 14, respectively). In success stories, Ferrari has seen 17 per cent growth (in at 54) while on the flipside, Tesla declined 35 per cent to number 25. Jaguar was nowhere to be seen and hasn't ranked on its own since 2018. I imagine its recent rebrand probably hasn't helped matters. Daily design news, reviews, how-tos and more, as picked by the editors. In terms of media and entertainment brands, it was Instagram that stood out as it surged 27 per cent and entered the top 10 for the first time (at number eight). YouTube also saw huge growth, with an increase of 61 per cent to spot number 13 (explore the brand's history with our YouTube logo history). Elsewhere, Netflix surged 42 per cent, and climbed 10 places to number 28. When you think about brands that people use every day for entertainment, neither of these three are a shock. I'm frankly surprised that Netflix wasn't ranked higher. In the world of luxury, Gucci dropped out of the top 50 altogether (to number 69) while Hermés grew 18 per cent (and made it to spot 21) and Chanel managed to cling on to the top 25 at number 24 despite shrinking 8 per cent. Interbrand suggests this may be due to prices post-Covid, which have discouraged some "aspiring middle-class consumers, creating a headwind for the sector". In the world of retail, it was bad news for IKEA and H&M which shrank 9 and 13 per cent, respectively, but good news for Uniqlo, which stormed into the charts at number 47. It must be all those cross-body bags it sold. Interbrand also outlines its Brands to Watch, which shines a light on brands predicted to enter the top 100 in future years. These include Burberry, Canon, KFC, PlayStation, WhatsApp, Zoom and Starbucks. It feels quite amazing that some of those brands aren't on the list already, but I guess there isn't room for everyone.

Investors are plowing money into a broad swath of assets putting the ETF industry in the driver’s seat of what may be another record year. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, overseeing $10 trillion, took a victory lap this week, touting ownership of some of the fastest-growing exchange-traded funds in history. "Our digital assets ETPs and active ETFs have grown from practically zero to 10 in 2023 to over $100 billion in digital assets and over $80 billion in active ETFs. The rapid growth of these premium categories is another proof point of our success in scaling distribution and quickly adapting to new offerings and in new markets," said CEO Larry Fink on the company’s earnings call this week.

Blue/Bloomberg via Getty Images / Getty Images) The star: iShares Bitcoin ETF — ticker IBIT — is now the largest crypto ETF, which gives investors exposure to the cryptocurrency without having to own it directly. Assets topped $100 billion earlier this month but have dipped with Bitcoin’s drop. The largest crypto by market value hit a record $126,272.76 on Oct. 6, 2025, and has since slipped below $110,000. BITCOIN SAFE HAVEN, INVESTOR SAYS Escalating tensions over the past week between the U.S. and China are hurting sentiment for digital assets. This as gold popped to a fresh record high of $4,280.20 an ounce. Another standout, iShares Ethereum ETF -ticker ETHA with assets around $16 billion. AMERICANS FAVOR TRUMP'S $1,000 BABY SAVINGS PLAN "Our flagship offerings in IBIT and ETHA were among the top five inflowing products in the ETP industry," Martin Small, CFO and global head of corporate strategy detailed on the call. Like bitcoin, ethereum has dipped to the $3,800 level from its high of $4,955.23 reached on Aug. 24, 2025. LIVE CRYPTOCURRENCY PRICES: HERE Still, bitcoin and ethereum have each advanced about 14% this year, slightly outperforming the S&P 500’s 13% rise as of Friday. BlackRock BlackRock shares are up 14% year to date.

Title: Wall Street's rising stars share how they set boundaries and avoid burnout — even in one of the toughest industries

Pressure is among the few certainties of daily life on Wall Street — and knowing how to manage it is key to success. Business Insider asked its 2025 Rising Stars of Wall Street how they set boundaries and maintain routines to stay grounded in an industry where the threat of burnout lurks behind each promotion. All of them are standing out at some of the country's top financial firms at age 35 or younger, and somehow maintaining personal lives and sanity in the process. Since Wall Street has little respect for the evening hours, mornings are precious to many of this year's rising stars, particularly when it comes to exercise. From focusing on family, to cooking, to purposefully feeling bored for a few minutes, here are some of the ways finance's young leaders find — and keep — balance. True to the gym-obsessed stereotype, many of the Wall Streeters said exercising is key to staying grounded, especially in the hours before work. Sweating it out at the gym helps relieve the stress they'll likely face during the day, some told Business Insider. As Lamar Cardinez, a principal at Blue Owl, put it, the gym "helps me feel fully awake quickly and supplies you with the energy needed for a full workday." "I'm a morning person, and I will be the person, unfortunately, who will sacrifice sleep so that I can exercise," Catherine Kress, chief of staff to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and a big runner, said. For others, playing sports or spending time outside provides the much-needed physical relief. The up-and-comers opt for everything from golf to tennis to snowboarding to yoga to skiing. And though their interests are diverse, Alex Park, a principal at Thoma Bravo, admitted his typical finance bro tendencies when it comes to health habits. "I'm sure you've heard too many people in finance, especially in Miami, talk about padel," he said, referencing the racquet sport popular with America's wealthy. "But I do very much enjoy that sport as well." Another interest that helps him stay grounded? Wellness and longevity science, which he was sure Business Insider had heard "a fair amount." Colleagues might dominate many of the waking hours during the week, but some of the Wall Streeters told Business Insider that prioritizing family is crucial to excelling in their field. For Mohini Chakravorty, a principal at Blackstone, it's knowing that her family pick up the phone "at any point in time." For GTCR's Natalie Lamberton, it's talking after-work walks with her 6-month-old daughter and decompressing her week with her husband every Friday night. Among those who are parents, some said seeing their kids before and after work gives them the perspective they need to walk into the office and inevitable pressure. "I have my wife and my one and a half year old son, and that's my code of comfort," Aman Mittal, a managing director at Moelis & Company, said. "She and my son give me a lot of anchoring so as to make sure that you can do what you need to do once you're out of the house." Joe Slevin, a managing director in Jefferies' Private Capital Advisory group, often unwinds with his wife and three kids, but finds his friends are a necessary lifeline too. "I would say that a few active text threads with old funny friends is essential." Chakravorty is a "huge foodie," and loves to explore the New York City restaurant scene. The same goes for Benson Kane, a vice president at TPG who said he often explores new spots in the city with his wife. Lamberton said she enjoys cooking with her husband, and Chakravorty said she often cooks with her boyfriend as well. A number of the stars treat logging off as more than shutting their computer, and carve out intentional time to get away from their screens. Blackstone's Knut Kirchoff figured out how important it is to spend at least 30 minutes with a book and away from the glow of his phone during the pandemic, and he still keeps up the habit to help him wind down. Cardinez meditates, Lamberton makes time on her commute to purposefully feel bored, and Jake Woodson, the head of US distressed credit trading at Goldman Sachs, spends time in the Catskills. "When it feels like all that matters in the world is XYZ bond all week, getting into the world and getting into nature and experiencing something different is invaluable and gives you motivation to come back to do it," he said. Beyond reading a physical newspaper in the morning with his coffee, Kirchoff tries to bring some analog habits to the office. He tracks his daily tasks in a paper notebook, crossing them off as they're completed. Your daily guide to what's moving markets — straight to your inbox.

Title: Ford CEO Admits Automakers Didn’t Consider Their Customers When Going ‘Full Bore’ Into EVs

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/18/2025 4:10:31 AM PDT by Adder American automakers have long prided themselves on building vehicles that meet the real needs of hardworking families and businesses across the country. Yet, recent revelations from Ford’s leadership paint a different picture when it comes to the rush into electric vehicles. Former Ford CEO Mark Fields openly acknowledged that the industry charged ahead with massive EV investments, overlooking what consumers actually wanted. Fields, who led Ford from 2014 to 2017, pointed out the misstep during a discussion on the rapid buildup of EV production. “Over the last couple of years, the automakers really went full bore in putting in capacity for EVs,” he said. This aggressive push came without enough thought to buyer preferences, leaving companies like Ford and GM facing unexpected market realities. (Excerpt) Read more at thelibertydaily.com ...

Title: Ethereum: Assessing how ETH could outperform Bitcoin in Q4
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/ethereum-assessing-how-eth-could-outperform-bitcoin-in-q4/
Time Published: 2025-10-18T11:00:02Z
Full Content:
BlackRock and institutional moves put Ethereum in focus. Ethereum is holding a net gain of 7.02% versus BTC’s 4.34% for October, with on-chain stablecoin inflows signaling institutional interest. BlackRock’s recent moves, combined with the ETH/BTC ratio nearing 0.04, suggest strategic rotation rather than a short-term trade. So far in Q4, Ethereum [ETH] has lagged behind Bitcoin [BTC], showing a 6.94% dip. But if we look closely, BTC is only 1.15% ahead, despite its nearly 11% rally in the first week that pushed it to an all-time high of $125k. From a technical perspective, BTC’s net gain for October stood at 4.34%, at press time, while ETH remained at a net gain of 7.02% following its 15% first-week surge. In short, ETH is still holding strong relative to BTC. Notably, this resilience is evident on the weekly chart. BTC has dropped 7.15% with two back-to-back lower-low candles, testing its late-June support at $103k. ETH, on the other hand, is holding onto its August gains. Source: TradingView (ETH/USDT) Against this backdrop, the ETH/BTC ratio is on the verge of snapping its first weekly green, bouncing nearly 9% off the recent crash to 0.03, reinforcing the thesis that rotation into ETH could be gaining momentum. On-chain, Ethereum’s stablecoin supply is signaling the same strength. The 7-day stablecoin supply on Ethereum has jumped 2.18%, adding $3.47 billion and pushing the total to a fresh all-time high of $163 billion. Simply put, more dry powder is flowing into the ecosystem. Combine this with Ethereum’s resilience versus BTC, and it raises the question: Is rotation into ETH shaping up to be more strategic than a short-term trade? BlackRock is driving the rotation thesis in action. Arkham data shows the firm moving 300 BTC across its last fifteen transactions, accounting for roughly 4,500 BTC offloaded. At the same time, it accumulated 12,400 ETH from Coinbase Prime. The effects are visible on the chart: Ethereum was up 1.12% intraday, holding the $3,830 support despite ongoing weakness in ETH ETFs, while the ETH/BTC ratio hiked 1.56%, at the time of writing, inching closer to key resistance at 0.37. Source: TradingView (ETH/BTC) In this setup, the surge in stablecoin liquidity isn’t random. Instead, it points to “targeted” capital flowing into Ethereum, suggesting that institutions are rotating for a longer-term rather than chasing short-term trades, with October’s price action so far reinforcing this strategy. Against this backdrop, the ETH/BTC ratio is eyeing the 0.04 zone, signaling a potential breakout in favor of Ethereum versus Bitcoin, suggesting that ETH’s monthly lag may be nothing more than a short-term blip.

Tributes have been paid to a Dublin man who was killed following a road traffic incident in the US. John Kirby died in hospital on Wednesday, following an incident involving a truck which happened in Austin, Texas, on Friday 10 of October. Mr Kirby, who was in his 20s, had been in the US on a J1 visa and was living with two friends. Blackrock Rugby Football Club has paid tribute to him, saying he "made a huge impact both on and off the field". In a post on the club's website, Director of Rugby Michael Hearty said that Mr Kirby will be remembered "fondly for his smile, his laughter, and his spirit". "John had that special kind of presence. A big, infectious smile and a quick sense of humour that could lift the whole dressing room. "Whether it was during training on a horrible wet Tuesday night or over a pint in the clubhouse, he had a way of making people laugh and feel included. "He was the sort of teammate you were always happy to see walk through the door." Mr Hearty also described John as a great worker, adding that "the word 'no' was not in his vocabulary". He extended his condolences to all of his friends and family. The Department of Foreign Affairs said it is aware of the case and is providing consular assistance. © RTÉ 2025.

Title: US Bitcoin ETFs see $1.2 Billion in weekly outflows

Time Published: 2025-10-18T10:27:46Z

The United States’ spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) faced a challenging week, with over $1.2 billion in total outflows as Bitcoin prices tumbled. Despite the decline in institutional inflows, Charles Schwab says investor engagement with crypto-related products is rising, reflecting a growing interest among retail and institutional clients in digital assets. Data from SoSoValue shows that the eleven US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively recorded $366.6 million in outflows on Friday, closing out a negative week for both the products and the broader cryptocurrency market. The largest withdrawal came from BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which lost $268.6 million in a single day. Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) also saw substantial redemptions totaling $67.2 million, while Grayscale’s GBTC experienced $25 million in outflows. A smaller withdrawal was reported from the Valkyrie Bitcoin ETF, while the remaining funds saw no activity on Friday. In total, spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US witnessed $1.22 billion in outflows over the past week, with only one day—Tuesday—showing minor inflows. The downturn coincided with sharp declines in Bitcoin’s price, which fell from above $115,000 on Monday to just below $104,000 on Friday, marking a four-month low. The steep decline highlights how sensitive institutional products remain to Bitcoin’s price movements, with ETF investors appearing to pull back amid growing market uncertainty. While ETF redemptions signal cooling sentiment among some investors, Charles Schwab remains optimistic about the long-term potential of digital asset investment products. Speaking on CNBC, CEO Rick Wurster revealed that Schwab’s clients now hold 20% of all crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) in the US. He added that interest in crypto has grown substantially over the past year, with visits to the company’s crypto-related webpages up 90%. “Crypto ETPs have been very active,” Wurster said, emphasizing that the topic continues to draw high engagement from investors. ETF analyst Nate Geraci noted that Schwab’s large brokerage platform positions it well to capture future demand. The firm already offers crypto ETFs and Bitcoin futures and plans to launch spot crypto trading for clients in 2026, signaling a long-term commitment to the sector even amid short-term volatility. October, historically one of Bitcoin’s strongest months, has so far delivered disappointing results. Data from CoinGlass shows that Bitcoin has gained in ten of the past twelve Octobers, but this year, the asset is down 6% month-to-date. Despite the slump, some market analysts remain hopeful that the trend of “Uptober” could return in the second half of the month. Many point to the potential for Federal Reserve rate cuts later this year as a catalyst that could reignite demand for risk assets, including Bitcoin. For now, however, the combination of ETF outflows, price pressure, and macroeconomic uncertainty has weighed heavily on crypto sentiment—leaving investors to watch whether the coming weeks can reverse October’s red start.

Title: Analysts Caution Cardano (ADA) May Drop Further Before $1 Rebound After 12% Dip

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Cardano (ADA) fell roughly 27% this week, slipping below the $0.66 support as risk-off flows hit crypto. Bitcoin’s slide toward $104,000 and softer altcoin liquidity magnified downside, and on-chain data shows large holders leaning defensive. Santiment-tracked wallets holding 1–10 million ADA offloaded about 40 million ADA over seven days, while broader whale distribution reportedly reached 350 million ADA, pressuring price. other big wallets accumulated 140–200 million ADA, creating a split tape that’s fueling choppy consolidation between $0.65–$0.70. Derivatives add to the cautious tone. Cardano’s open interest slipped 2.12% to $669.9 million, and long liquidations ($1.13 million) dwarfed shorts ($187,000), signaling bulls bore the brunt of the latest flush. On the 4-hour chart, ADA is carving a falling wedge, but confirmation requires a breakout above $0.74. Until then, momentum indicators remain mixed: RSI 37 (approaching oversold) while CMF 0.12–0.15 hints at returning spot inflows that have yet to overpower supply from large holders. Technicians flag a “risk-first” path: losing $0.66 puts $0.65 in play; failure there opens $0.62–$0.60, then $0.57 (channel/structure confluence). A deeper shakeout could probe $0.53 if broader crypto weakness persists. On the upside, ADA must reclaim $0.66 and then clear $0.74–$0.80 (50-day EMA cluster) to flip trend strength. Above that range, bulls target $0.86, with a psychological $1.00 retest feasible into Q4 if risk appetite and flows improve. Several analysts still eye a path toward $1.20–$1.60 on a confirmed breakout, but most caution the market may dip before it rips given leverage resets and uneven liquidity. ETF headlines (including the Oct. 23 Grayscale ADA ETF decision window), stablecoin and ETF net flows, and whether whale selling cools. A rotation back into altcoins typically follows BTC stabilization; conversely, renewed BTC downside would likely extend ADA’s consolidation near the lows. Beyond price, Cardano’s community treasury has surpassed 1.6 billion ADA ($1 billion), funded by fees and staking rewards and governed via Project Catalyst, a war chest that supports tooling, DeFi, and infrastructure without VC overhang. New staking access (e.g., eToro U.S.) and ongoing initiatives like Midnight and Leios continue to broaden the roadmap, even as TVL ($288 million) lags larger chains.

Title: Should every midlife woman be on HRT - even with no menopause symptoms?
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/life-style/people/2025/10/18/hrt-theres-no-need-for-suffering-any-more-like-our-mothers-and-grandmothers-did/
Time Published: 2025-10-18T05:00:00Z
Full Content:
Suzanne Noonan, a mother of three children, struggled for months with debilitating anxiety, hot flushes and poor sleep but was afraid to look for hormone replacement therapy (HRT) as there is a history of breast cancer in her family. A friend, a beautician who had heard clients say HRT had changed their lives for the better, urged her to try it. By the time Noonan (45) went to her GP in Co Limerick a year ago, “my adrenaline was through the roof”. The doctor reassured her about the breast cancer risks and strongly recommended HRT, as the pros outweighed the cons. “So I bit the bullet.” Within two weeks, “I was so mellow and just felt right again in the world.” Now she recommends that any woman troubled by menopausal-related symptoms should go to their GP and “take the leap to HRT – you will not regret it”. The message that women need not suffer in silence during perimenopause and menopause is spreading. With increasing evidence of other health benefits from the repletion of waning hormones, even those without troubling menopausal symptoms may wonder if they are missing out by not going on HRT. It doesn’t even cost anything, since the State has made the medication free since June 1st. Could that prove to be another psychological nudge? This week there was news of a study, led by the University of Galway, that indicated a link between HRT after menopause and a lower risk of dementia. Last week, eminent consultant endocrinologist Dr Donal O’Shea talked of “medical consensus” that all women should go on it at the time of menopause, unless there are strong contraindications. “Oestrogen replacement is good for bones, it’s good for heart, it’s good for brain,” O’Shea told Jen Hogan on The Irish Times podcast Conversations with Parents. He said he would be advising his daughters, “if I’m around when they’re post menopausal”, to go on it. While many agreed and welcomed his comments, others had a different view. “I think Donal should stay in his lane,” says Dr Deirdre Lundy, clinical lead of the complex menopause clinic in the National Maternity Hospital (NMH). While she says he is entitled to express his opinion, “that most certainly is not the medical consensus”. The “actual consensus”, based on international guidelines, according to Lundy, is that there are only two reasons to go on HRT. “One is for symptom control, and in that case there is no protocol for how long to take it or when to stop it. If your symptoms continue to trouble you and you want to stay on it for 20 or 30 years, which, by the way, I’ve done myself, so I’m not an anti-HRT person, then you go right ahead.” The second indication for treatment is bone density. “A primary use of HRT, even for people with no symptoms, would be low bone quality.” In addition to proven benefits for the heart and bones, it is believed there are other positives “but the data is not there yet. That is why the consensus is not to put everybody on HRT and not to stay on it forever”. [ Does femtech suggest so-called women’s troubles might soon be taken as seriously as men’s?Opens in new window ] About 20-30 new people a month are seen at the NMH clinic, one of six public, specialist menopause services around the country. GPs, who do most HRT prescribing, can refer more complex cases to these clinics. The decision whether or not to take HRT is very individualised, says Cork GP Dr Ciara McCarthy, clinical lead for women’s health in the Irish College of General Practitioners. It should only be considered by somebody after discussing with a GP the risks and benefits for them personally. Despite it being acclaimed as good for the heart, “the international guidelines would say that HRT is generally not recommended for asymptomatic women solely for the prevention of cardiovascular disease”. Cardiologist Dr Blaithnead Murtagh of Blackrock Health in Galway also stresses the need for “a holistic, individualised approach to menopausal women, including lifestyle advice, diet modification, as well as discussion on the role of HRT”. If there are no problematic symptoms, she does not recommend HRT for future cardiac health reasons. However, HRT prescribed before the age of 60, or within 10 years of the menopause, “is likely associated with a reduction in coronary heart disease and cardiovascular mortality”. Women with early menopause, she adds, should be encouraged to use HRT until the average age of menopause, which is 51 in Ireland, according to the HSE. Changing the narrative to view menopause as part of healthy ageing may better empower women to navigate this life stage Periods stopping before the age of 45 is considered early menopause and puts women at a higher risk of not only cardiovascular disease but also bone loss, says McCarthy, which is another reason HRT would be recommended. Older women who have, or are at high risk of developing, osteoporosis could also benefit. During a menopause consultation, other factors that may be relevant to optimising health will be considered, such as vitamin D, calcium, smoking cessation, weight-bearing exercise and healthy diet. Addressing problems with blood pressure and high cholesterol, “will lead to knock-on improvements in long-term cardiovascular risk without taking HRT”. An increased risk of breast cancer, which is the concern women most often raise, is small, she says. The 2002 study by the Women’s Health Initiative, which linked HRT to an elevated risk of breast cancer, as well as blood clots and stroke, is now regarded as flawed, although the fear it generated still lingers. “Family history of breast cancer does not preclude the majority of women from using HRT,” says McCarthy. “But what your family history influences is your baseline risk of developing breast cancer.” The average woman, without a strong family history, has a 23 in 1,000 baseline risk of developing breast cancer in their 50s. This increases to 27 in 1,000 within five years of being on combined HRT, ie oestrogen and progestogen. However, among those on oestrogen-only medication, breast cancer incidence actually drops, to 19 per 1,000 women aged 50-59. (Most women are prescribed a combined form because progestogen is needed to protect against womb cancer.) The risk of breast cancer increases the longer HRT is used. The decision to start, or continue, is generally down to a person’s perception of acceptable risks, adds McCarthy. I asked my GP for HRT patches a few times before finally being listened to. It’s a game changer There is both “toxic negativity” and “toxic positivity” towards HRT, and it is about finding a balance, says GP Dr Brian Kennedy, clinical lead at the midwest complex menopause clinic in Nenagh, Co Tipperary. “I wouldn’t agree that everybody needs HRT, but I do think everybody needs a conversation about HRT. Everybody needs to be aware of the risks and benefits and make their own decision,” he says. [ Relationships and ... menopause: ‘Small gestures of love can go a long way during this time of change’Opens in new window ] He thinks for about 20 per cent of women, menopause “is like a horrific illness – a mixture of physical, psychiatric and social unwellness that is so disabling”. It is obvious they need HRT. Another 20 per cent are probably okay without it – and there’s everybody in between. Hot flushes, insomnia and night sweats are widely recognised symptoms, but more subtle signs, such as brain fog, weight gain and stiff, sore joints, tend to be underplayed. Kennedy points out to patients that perimenopause and menopause do not happen in a vacuum. It is generally a very vulnerable time in women’s lives. They may be caring for teenagers or children, as well as ageing parents, and being pulled in all directions, while approaching the end of their fertility. “HRT is not going to solve everything, but it is definitely much more of a help than a hindrance in the vast majority of cases,” Kennedy says. There will always be women averse to pharmaceutical remedies for what is a natural transition in life. Indeed, the misconception of the menopause “as always being a medical issue which consistently heralds a decline in physical and mental health should be challenged”, argues Prof Martha Hickey of the Royal Women’s Hospital in Melbourne, Australia, in the Lancet medical journal. “Changing the narrative to view menopause as part of healthy ageing may better empower women to navigate this life stage and reduce fear and trepidation among those who have yet to experience it.” Prof Rose Anne Kenny, head of medical gerontology at Trinity College Dublin and founder of the Irish Longitudinal study on Ageing (Tilda), agrees “100 per cent” with O’Shea’s sentiments. “I feel very strongly that as medics we should be taking a much more holistic approach to HRT for women.” The protection it offers for bone density, for example, is important because fractures are a big reason for older people’s health going downhill. “The earlier you get in, the better – once your hormones have attenuated and you’re menopausal,” Kenny says. While it is primarily of value for menopausal symptoms, broader benefits include lubrication of mucosal surfaces, such as the mouth, eyes and vagina. “These aren’t related to diseases as such, but they’re very much related to quality of life for women.” Vaginal dryness can be classed as a menopausal symptom, she says. “Everybody gets that post menopause.” According to the Department of Health, the State will meet the cost of HRT where it has been prescribed “for the purpose of alleviating the symptoms associated with all stages of menopause”. Budget 2025 allocated €20 million for this scheme and, as the pharmacy dispensing fee is now also covered, this was increased to €24 million for 2026. “It’s fabulous now I don’t have to pay for it,” says Suzanne Noonan, who feels she never wants to come off HRT. “I see it as just replenishing the hormones that my body no longer produces. There’s no need for suffering any more like our mothers and our grandmothers did.” “I went through perimenopause and menopause not knowing,” says Tracey Latham, now aged 45. She initially put excessive sweating down to unhealthy lifestyle choices, but was also very angry and irritable. “I asked my GP for HRT patches a few times before finally being listened to. It’s a game changer – if only I was on them sooner, life would have been much better.” [ Perimenopausal and menopausal skin: How to tackle the most common problemsOpens in new window ] However, Anne from Co Wicklow says: “Personally, I started HRT and immediately felt much worse. I stopped it and felt better.” Jaimie (48) says she often raised the question of menopause with a GP after her periods stopped before she was 40. Instead she was prescribed anti-depressants. She ordered a kit online that told her she was in the menopause. “When your doctor won’t even acknowledge your symptoms, how can you proceed? I’ve tried to change GPs but there are so few in my area. It’s cruel.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Old Irish dressers, settle beds and dug-out chairs in a vernacular sale

Cavan auctioneer Victor Mee has built up a strong reputation for selling offbeat stuff, such as advertising memorabilia, antique garden furniture and vintage agricultural machinery. His next sale, live online from 3pm on Sunday, October 19th, will be filled with vernacular furniture, kitchen implements and even a few old metal tractor seats. Vernacular furniture – also known as country furniture – refers to the everyday furniture used in rural homes in the 19th and 20th centuries. In Ireland, pine tables, dressers, wooden chairs, dowry chests and wardrobes – mostly made of pine – are the main pieces of vernacular furniture for sale in auctions. Mee fell in love with it a long time ago. “I bought my first hedge chair in the 1970s for 50 pence and I’ve been enamoured ever since,” he says. “These pieces of furniture were born out of need and the pieces that survive today are like genuine historical artefacts.” Dressers remain popular for their original function – displaying the best crockery in the house – most of which was, and still is, only used for special occasions. There are a few dressers at the Mee auction, the best of which is a 19th-century painted pine dresser from Co Clare (€500-€800). It has three open shelves over a rows of short drawers and two lower cupboards with panelled doors. The pine settle bed was another staple of vernacular furniture. Usually positioned close to the hearth, this high-backed seat provided storage and seating during the day but could be converted to a bed at night-time. The Mee auction includes an early 19th-century pine settle bed from Cork, covered in old flaky paint (€800-€1,200) and another stripped pine settle bed (€250-€450). The 19th-century Irish pine dug-out chair is perhaps one of the more unusual lots (€1,000-€2,000). Dug-out chairs were exactly what you might think – a chair carved from a single trunk with the interior “dug out” for sitting on. It is crude and weathered looking, and Mee suggests it “speaks loudly of a forgotten era”. Shop fittings – in particular sets of drawers – have become sought after by homeowners drawn to eclectic interior styles. There are a few sets of shop drawers in various sizes but the most noteworthy are two sets of 56 drawers in pine from the 1940s (€1,000-€2,000 each). Auctions are also great places for picking up inexpensive crockery, and the Victor Mee auction has plenty of spongeware plates, platters, mugs and bowls from the 19th and 20th century. The set of six 19th-century spongeware soup bowls (€200-€400) are a good example of the style. As a way of creating a pattern on pottery, spongeware was first developed in the 18th century, becoming popular in Britain, Ireland and the United States in the 19th and 20th century. The patterns are created by pressing shaped sponges dipped in coloured pigment into the earthenware clay plate, bowl, jug or mug. This was a thriving cottage industry in the 19th century, and the pieces were often decorated at home by women before being glazed and refired in factories. Smudges, drips and variations in pattern added to the character, creating unique pieces. Contemporary potters such as Nicholas Mosse from Co Kilkenny were instrumental in reviving interest in spongeware techniques and designs. Three books written and signed by Ireland’s first president, Douglas Hyde, are among the lots for sale at Usher’s auction on Monday, October 20th from 6pm. The first edition books – Songs of St Columcille, The Children of Lir and The Children of Tuireann (€400-€700) – were published in the 1940s and are favourites among collectors. Hyde, who founded the Gaelic League, was a distinguished Gaelic scholar and author of many works, including A Literary History of Ireland. He was president from 1938 to 1945. Most of the wide variety of books at Usher’s auction, on view Saturday and Sunday, October 18th and 19th, noon-5pm, belonged to the late Gearóid Mac Gabhann (Gerry Smith). The son of Cavan footballer Big Jim Smith, Mac Gabhann was the founding member of Kilmacud Crokes club in Dublin. He played club football and later was mentor, coach and manager of football, hurling and camogie teams at Kilmacud Crokes. He was an accountant who worked as secretary manager for St Vincent’s hospital, Elm Park and later the Mater hospital. He was fluent in Irish and had a deep passion for Irish folklore, nature, political and local history, as this book collection testifies. The auction also includes manuscripts of religions from around the world, intriguing books on textiles and crafts. Many lots don’t have any estimates – leaving bidding completely open to interested parties. As befitting of a passionate supporter of the GAA, Mac Gabhann’s collection also includes early GAA programmes, medals and other ephemera, many of which are signed. John Weldon’s jewellery, watches and gold coin auction on Tuesday, October 21st, at 2pm, includes a lifetime’s collection of 48 pieces of Irish silver. These include a William IV Chinoiserie silver tea caddy made in Dublin in 1834 by James Fray (€1,000-€2,000), and an Irish silver crested two-handled cup by Robert Calderwood, made in the mid 18th century (€1,200-€1,800). victormeeauctions.ie; usherauction.ie; jwa.ie Estimate €1,200-€1,800 Hammer price €1,200 Auction house Sheppard’s Estimate €1,400-€1,800 Hammer price €1,300 Auction house Sheppard’s Estimate €200 – €300 Hammer price €640 Auction house Adams Blackrock Hammer price €1,600 Auction house Adams Blackrock © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Brains, Gains & Growing Pains: Inside Mount Sinai’s BCI Crystal Ball

ByNaveen Rao, Contributor. In their second annual Brain-Computer Interface Symposium, Mount Sinai Biodesign entreated attendees to an inside track on the top priorities and polarities defining BCI’s incomparable rise around the world. The world’s leading companies, neurosurgeons, clinical researchers, investors, advocates, and other leaders past, present and future convened for two days at the New York Academy of Medicine. After last year’s inaugural gathering, this installment drew a full house of 440 attendees and over 50 speakers. The streamlined program offered expert panels, heated debates, heartwarming stories, and a forum bustling with the intangible promises of discovery. Protocol Labs anchored this year’s sponsorship, signaling accelerating private interests in supporting neural research platforms, alongside Precision Neuroscience, Synchron and other companies. BCI defies easy alignment, categorization, or containment, representing a shared challenge and opportunity. For a fecund field tasked with defining, refining, regulating and selling itself while accelerating in every direction in real-time, growing pains are inevitable. The sessions included extensive presentations and discussions on technical advances and clinical methods, but the highlighted themes below are filtered through my lens of bringing this technology to people safely, sustainably, and responsibly, for all parties involved. This chicken-egg neurotech question knows no better stoa than this event, which kicked off with a lightning panel of eight leading BCI neurosurgeons. Their nuanced and wide ranging conversation underscored that progress depends upon and demands a healthy tension between today’s products and tomorrow’s science. Or, was it today’s science and tomorrow’s products? Invasiveness should not remain a limiting issue in BCI development, argued Michael Lawton, who leads Neuralink implantations as President and CEO of Barrow Neurological Institute. Lawton pointed to minimal scarring and chronic inflammation in both animal and human recipients of Neuralink’s n1 implant, arguing that the field should be aiming for “whole-brain BCI” as the goal, to read more data and develop more sophisticated applications. Today, this goal represents a collective effort with many hands on deck. Paradromics shared updates of their benchmarking work to gauge information transfer in neural recording with their Connexus BCI. Blackrock’s long-awaited neural lace is still in development. Emerging companies like Axoft, Neurobionics and Neurosoft are advancing next-generation arrays. In a later session, Ashwini Sharan, Medtronic’s chief medical officer of neuromodulation defended the medtech giant’s “right to compete” in the BCI space with adaptive DBS platform, cleared earlier this year, whose real-time read/write capabilities offer emerging evidence of the practical and clinical benefits of invasive tools, albeit for a narrow band of eligible patients. As for minimalist BCI, the question of electing brain surgery looms large. Elad Levy, from the University at Buffalo, offered a pragmatic view of helping as many people today with the safest technology available in market. He likened today’s BCI to the Wright brothers airplanes, guaranteed to evolve in the next five years and beyond. Levy, who led the IDE study for Synchron’s minimally invasive Stentrode device, has devoted his career to advancing less invasive, less expensive, more accessible approaches to next-generation stroke treatment. New neuroimaging tools are enabling the shift. As BCI propagate into neurosurgical suites around the world, precise brain mapping is emerging as a central need, pointed out Matthew Wilsey, a neurosurgeon at the University of Michigan who recently implanted Paradromics’ first human user. Levy outlined his use of Neuronetics’ Trakstar platform along with Medtronic tools, which have helped move implantation towards a faster, more affordable outpatient setting without compromising safety or quality. Ian Cajigas from the University of Pennsylvania has led implants of Precision’s Layer 7 array. He reviewed how the limits of fMRI and MEG are opening the door for more advanced “connectomics” to create “wiring diagrams” to guide neurosurgery. In a later session, Michael Ivan from the University of Miami shared how he has used Omniscient’s mapping tools to optimize placement and performance of Neuralink’s device as part of their ongoing clinical trial. Chad Bouton of Northwell Health and founder of Neuvotion stole the show by revealing a “mind body connection” wherein Keith, a man living with a spinal cord injury whose double neural bypass was featured at this event last year, controlled a forearm device worn by Kathy, whose stroke left her partially paralyzed. Bouton explained, “When she holds something, he's literally helping her close his hand, because she's also living with paralysis. And he can now feel what she's holding.” In a video shared with attendees, Kathy sipped her diet coke, aided through over-the-skin wearables controlled by Keith’s thoughts. “It feels like you’re getting back a little bit of what was taken from you,” she told the audience, next to Keith. Neuvotion’s FDA-cleared sleeve is the first of a planned “neurorecovery ecosystem” of off-the shelf, BCI-compatible devices that defy easy value propositions in the best possible ways. In a later session, Chris Kellner from Mount Sinai charted the rapid advances in stroke rehabilitation over the years, from breakthroughs in vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) systems, EEG-based wearable BCI, and both old and new attempts with cortical implants. Stroke impacts 800,000 new people each year, widening the berth of chronic patients who can benefit from specialized care. Kellner’s work shows that even patients with several years “between stroke and rehabilitation can still have a robust improvement” using standard scales of functional assessment. Quantifying clinical benefits of BCI, whether in stroke, ALS, spinal cord injury, or other areas, remains the central challenge for commercial companies approaching regulatory clearance and reimbursement decisions. Jamie Brannigan from Mount Sinai encouraged conservative market estimates and tight clinical definitions for suitable BCI recipients. Omid Forouzan, VP of clinical affairs at Synchron, was among several leaders who highlighted the progress and pitfalls of advancing objective measures of digital autonomy, contextual functional independence, activities of daily living considered critical or “instrumental,” and other ways to measure value to end-users. Mariska Vansteensel from UMC Utrecht Brain Center translated these tactical quality of life measures (feels, functions, survives) into the overarching concept of relational personhood, which gauges how people are, and feel, perceived as full persons by each other. Perhaps Congress needs a bit of the Dutch touch. In the first hour of the event, Lawton shared a video showing Brad Smith, one of Neuralink’s trial participants, playing games with his children through his BCI. In the next session, when Ian Burkhart asked ALS Caregiver and patient advocate MA Fernandez about how BCI could help her family, she answered “I really want Jules to be able to play videogames with Skyler,” referring to her husband and eight-year old son. Indeed. Former CMS Medical Officer Lee A. Fleischer opened the very next panel by saying “it’s very clear that video games don’t fit the reasonable, necessary criteria" after explaining that “CMS cannot pay for things unless Congress says so.” Fleischer pointed to past approvals for speech generation and exoskeleton devices, encouraging innovators to “understand the process and work within the structures because if not, you don’t win.” But when he said the agency’s job is to consider only the benefit and not the cost of new technologies, his panelists pushed back. Mijail Serruya from Thomas Jefferson University called out “quite a bit of hypocrisy in what is paid for” by CMS, cautioning that one-size fits all reimbursement in BCI “could be a trap” because people with identical impairments often have different functionality. David Putrino from Mount Sinai argued passionately that at the bedside, his job was to help drowning people, only for insurers to deny coverage by countering “people are not drowning, their legs just aren’t working. Send us more documentation on the legs.” “We’re in a new age,” Putrino declared. “Technology is advancing faster than ever before, and if we need to use the same system of checks and balances to get treatments through, it will die on the vine before it can help people. My very big fear about BCI is that if it flops now, it’s going to be 20 years before there’s any investor confidence to move forward.” Later that afternoon I moderated a panel with four neurotech investors to discuss market trends, commercial strategies, funding growth and evolution, categories versus platforms, globalization, and founder/funder dynamics. My panelists included Sean Escola, Head of Neurotech and NeuroAI at Protocol Labs, Peter Zhegin, Neurotech Director at e184, Adam Caplan, Founder at Jumpspace Ventures, and Konstantinos Alataris, BOD at Precision Neuroscience, Director at Forepont, and former founder and CEO of Nevro. This year’s funding for implanted BCI will double or triple last year’s $500+ million, driven by Neuralink’s recent $625 Series E. But beyond growth, the key investment trend to watch is the diversification of capital, traditional VC, strategic philanthropies, cryptocurrency firms, international government programs, and beyond. Zhegin observed this is not a purely market-driven trend, but one stemming from investor interest and personality factors. Escola described braiding grant dollars and venture dollars to optimize support across pre-commercial development. Alataris wants to see BCI strategy diverge from traditional med tech commercialization. His remarks followed a series of case studies he’d presented earlier to illustrate the lag between FDA approval and CMS reimbursement for both profitable and failed companies. This so-called valley of death hinders innovation and limits exit options for startups: “You spend 10 years getting to FDA approval, a minimum of $100 to 150 million, then you need to raise another $300 million to create your sales force, and you live and die based on this revenue.” All speakers advised founders navigating this landscape to understand their company’s value fully, and take time to explore all dimensions of the strategic value conferred by different types of backers on clinical and operational goals, from hiring to raising the next round. In a later question about Founder X-factors in BCI, they mentioned the ability to secure both grant and venture dollars, quickly launch a research lab, along with requisite technical expertise and capabilities across the founding team. Alataris called on founders to opt for strategic capital and partnerships in big tech over med tech, while exploring profitable paths to sharing technology, revenue, IP, and maybe even data, with an eye on building for multiple applications. In discussing BCI platforms, he compared the potential to smartphones, Zhegin envisioned developer ecosystems like those at Intel or NVIDIA, while Caplan named read and write capabilities demonstrating sustained safety and performance. Escola called for more modular infrastructure across the ecosystem, so that each BCI company won’t have to absorb millions in equipment costs, and can focus more on business innovation. Building economies of scale in BCI will require vision, intention, and action. Science Corp’s Founder and CEO Max Hodak returned to this year’s event to share a heady list of updates that spanned bringing their retinal prosthesis closer to market, inventing synthetic proteins to enable optogenetic biohybrid arrays, and launching a new, next-generation technology stack to “rewrite the economics of BCI development.” Science’s enablement toolkit includes neural probes, next-generation headstage devices, and a full back end of software applications. Hodak said this modular approach “cuts the total development costs of bringing BCI therapy to market from over fifty to less than five million dollars." Coming from a single company, these developments demonstrate the platform approach discussed earlier. Similarly motivated offerings to scale innovation through interdependence are underway from Mint Neuro and Neuvotion, while new tools like Omniscient’s platform could also smooth the path for BCI startups. While these market innovations represent potential boons for a higher throughput R&D flywheel in the near-term, the longer term impacts on commercial BCI companies’ costs, value proposition (and value perception), and pricing strategies remain open questions. From the outside, a successful BCI ecosystem requires external leadership and vision, too. Beyond attracting diverse pools of capital as described above, neurotechnology’s momentum has drawn interest from public leaders outside the US federal government. Viq Pervaaz, the Senior Vice President of Life Sciences & Healthcare at NYCEDC, shared a macro-economic lens on skilled job creation, catalyzing company formation, leveraging healthcare and life sciences anchors, socioeconomic impact, and more. NYEDC’s ongoing partnership with Mount Sinai has also supported development of new cutting-edge treatments, entrepreneurship and spinouts, and deeper synergies in development. At a time of political gridlock and federal clawbacks across health, science, and global leadership, NYEDC and Mount Sinai’s system-driven collaboration offers a relevant playbook for leaders seeking to future-proof their economies. To build an application layer, BCI needs an application taxonomy, a mindset shift that has already brought the field to a crossroads. Bloomberg reporter Ike Swetlitz opened his panel of seven BCI executives and neurosurgeons by asking for perceptions about Neuralink’s claimed goals to implant “otherwise healthy people” in five years. Several panelists including Tom Oxley, Founder and CEO of Synchron hedged their answers with disclaimers about Musk’s exuberance and the collective need to prioritize safety over rabbitholes. To be fair, Synchron’s sedulous leadership in advancing metrics and standards could arguably benefit this field even more than their high-profile partnerships with Apple and NVIDIA. And yet, the blitz of progress in the last year alone is publicly documented and undeniable: BCI is coming. Neuralink has gone from zero to 12 patients with permanent implants in the US and Canada in under two years. Precision has secured an FDA clearance, and in the time it took to publish findings from their first five patients, increased users by more than tenfold to 50+ people. In a notable breakthrough, Precision’s cofounder and chief science officer Ben Rapoport shared that this now includes patients without disabilities, such as a woman being treated for tumor removal who opted into the temporary implant to help advance research. “Building functional maps from healthy individuals could yield detailed maps of hand, speech and sensory representations,” said Rapoport, adding that such maps could also inform BCI implant targeting. Beyond the lane of motor neuroprostheses, some panelists pushed back on the definition of “healthy people,” pointing to differences between everyone, as well as market shifts towards a broader audiences and elective same-day procedures. Paradromics’ founder and CEO Matt Angle spoke openly about his dual vision for their as a “precisely defined medical device,” as well as a platform technology to turn capital-intensive R&D into “applications that unlock a broader future.” Jacob Robinson, founder and CEO of Motif Neurotech and author of the appli spoke of the BCI field’s shared goal to “create technology that is more normalized, with capabilities designed to bring us to the present.”` His comments, underscored by Helen Mayberg later in the program, stressed that psychiatry suffers from need for more quantifiable, objective assessments. “It’s important to understand what’s happening in the circuit that drives your patient’s suffering. We’re not used to seeing dramatic, fast changes, in people who have failed to respond to years of medication.” Mayberg, a neurologist and director at Mount Sinai, pointed to 20 years of promising evidence of DBS’s efficacy in treating people living with severe depression. She urged the importance of closing clinical gaps with neurotechnology, starting with the lack of validated “facial or behavioral measures, or better, a measure from the brain, that tells us if they’re on the right track or need an adjustment.” Mayburg’s closing observation was that “these patients don’t know who they used to be. We’re having to chase the disorder by defining the disorder.” It reminded me of Alan Watt’s line, which applies to people as well as the BCI field as a whole: “Trying to define yourself is like trying to bite your own teeth.” Teeth gnashing about slow diagnostic innovation aside, BCI is evolving towards broader applications that can fit under the category of “human problems.” Ignacio Saez from Mount Sinai stressed that unlike motor BCI development, for cognitive and psychiatric BCI, "scientific knowledge, and our understanding of the neurobiological basis of cognitive and psychiatric processes, is still a major limiting factor." Unrelated to implanted BCI, Meta shared in a separate session that their newly launched EMG wristband took 6,000 training sessions for off the shelf-functionality, suggesting that we are in the early innings of this next frontier. Michael Ivan, Neuralink’s PI at the University of Miami, said our modern understanding of the brain “is that multiple areas work together to create something powerful. Together, they shape executive function, attention span, memory. As a neurosurgeon, I try to avoid these areas. But with BCI it’s the opposite – we’re trying to find these functional areas to figure out how to sense from them and stimulate them." With their second event, Mount Sinai’s BCI Symposium has cemented itself as a must-attend for those interested in the nexus of brain health and implanted technologies. With an eye on returning to New York in 2026, I will hope for more interdisciplinary and diversified panels, representation from newer companies in BCI and beyond, and tracking all of the inevitable developments between now and then, here are some closing thoughts. Lastly, I asked MA Fernandez if I could share the message her husband Jules shared with attendees. As a young father to an 8 year old son, his ALS symptoms began 6 years ago, and have progressed to the point of his being confined to a wheelchair, dependent on a feeding tube and a breathing tube. Their story broke my heart but gave me hope. How much longer will it take before we can turn to BCI to help folks like Jules?

Title: Illusion of innovation: Indian ‘unicorn’ company becomes corporate cautionary tale

By Amanda Bartolotta October 17, 2025 For years, India has marketed itself as the world’s next great innovation hub, the emerging Silicon Valley of the East. Politicians, business leaders and industry groups have celebrated the nation’s engineers as global talent, proudly pointing to every Indian-origin CEO leading a major American tech firm as proof of India’s global prominence. The narrative being pushed has been that India was no longer just the world’s back office – it was the future of technology. Yet beneath the glossy slogans of “Digital India” and “Make in India,” reality dictates a very different story. The promise of innovation has rarely matched the results. As noted in a report by The Wire, India’s allure for investors stems not from its depth of talent, but from the fact that its “labor is cheap and laws are lax.” Still, American venture capitalists, eager to stake a claim in the “next tech frontier,” have bought into the illusion. Capital flowed, partnerships multiplied and billion-dollar valuations were built, not on genuine technological breakthroughs, but on carefully crafted narratives that sold success.

Why India copies well but fails to lead in innovation When “multinational educational technology company” BYJU’s emerged, it quickly became the perfect poster child for India’s startup dream. It was marketed as a unicorn – that is, a privately held startup company with a valuation of over $1 billion – proof that India could not only serve Silicon Valley, but become it. The company promised to transform how children learn and to usher in a new age of digital education. Yet, true to the national pattern, the promise unraveled quickly. From unicorn to black sheep Before its eventual financial and legal collapse, BYJU’s stood as one of India’s most celebrated startup success stories. Founded in 2011 and officially being dubbed a unicorn by 2018, it grew from a small tutoring operation into India’s most valued startup by 2022, ultimately being valued at $22 billion. Its learning app soon became a household name across India and founder Byju Raveendran earned a spot on the Forbes list of India’s richest people, celebrated as a self-made visionary transforming education. Former employees recalled his taste for five-star hotels and luxury cars, while his wife and co-founder, Divya Gokulnath, was seen networking in elite tech circles and Silicon Valley gatherings. Together, they emerged as global power players, symbols of a new generation of Indian entrepreneurs reshaping the country’s image on the world stage. At its peak, BYJU’s went on a buying spree, acquiring 19 companies for more than $2.6 billion. The goal was to expand its main products and strengthen its presence in the United States. The company added new areas such as coding, job training and lifelong learning to its offerings and even pushed into the Middle East by becoming the official sponsor of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. BYJU’s also hinted at plans to go public within a year, through an initial public offering (IPO) either in India or the United States. Both options were said to be under review, with no immediate deadline. Industry reports also suggested a possible merger with a U.S. special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) that could have valued the business at around $40 billion, though co-founder Divya Gokulnath declined to comment. Yet, beneath the optimism, warning signs were already visible. Despite being valued at $22 billion in September 2022, BYJU’s parent company, Think & Learn Pvt. Ltd., reported a staggering $554.77 million loss for fiscal 2021, largely attributed to soaring marketing and employee expenses, leading to layoffs and cost-saving measures to push towards achieving profitability. The company’s rapid rise had been built on hype and expansion, but the financial foundation was already starting to crack. A fall from grace In December 2022, when India’s child-rights commission called out BYJU’s over complaints of overly aggressive sales targeting families and first-generation learners. In the months that followed, scrutiny widened to its coding unit, WhiteHat Jr, amid allegations regarding advertising claims and hard-sell tactics. WhiteHat Jr filed defamation suits against critics, but then withdrew the cases after public backlash. In April 2023, India’s Enforcement Directorate raided BYJU’s offices and later issued a $1.12 billion show-cause notice under the Foreign Exchange Management Act. The agency reported uncovering “incriminating” documents and digital evidence during the raid, citing serious financial violations, including missing regulatory filings, delayed export payments and unreported foreign direct investment transfers totaling about $3.37 billion between 2011 and 2023. Investigators also found that the company had transferred about $1.18 billion to multiple foreign jurisdictions during the same period, allegedly under the guise of overseas direct investment. Despite being issued multiple summonses, founder Byju Raveendran repeatedly failed to appear before authorities, remaining evasive throughout the investigation. The troubles didn’t stop there. The startup, backed by major investors including Prosus, Peak XV, Sofina, BlackRock, UBS and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, missed its revenue target for the financial year ending March 2023, according to financial statements released months behind schedule. Soon after, the company’s chief financial officer, Ajay Goel, resigned to return to Vedanta, marking yet another senior exit following the abrupt departures of auditor Deloitte and three key board members in June. The turmoil deepened when Prosus, one of BYJU’s earliest and largest investors, holding over 9% of the company, publicly criticized the firm in July for failing to evolve and for repeatedly ignoring investor guidance. These cascading resignations and public rebukes signaled that BYJU’s once-glowing image had fully unraveled and its troubles were only beginning. BYJU’s has raised a total of $4.45 billion over 27 funding rounds: 2 Early-Stage, 22 Late-Stage and 3 Debt rounds. BYJU’s’ largest funding round so far was a conventional debt round for $1.2 billion in November 2021. BYJU’s had a total of 132 investors, 105 being institutional investors and 27 Angel investors. From loan disputes to courtroom battles Through 2023 and into early 2024, BYJU’s mounting troubles spilled into the courts as disputes over a $1.2 billion U.S. term loan escalated. Court filings and investigative reports revealed that about $533 million had been routed through BYJU’s U.S. subsidiary, Alpha, into accounts tied to Camshaft Capital Management, a fund linked to a 23-year-old portfolio manager whose Miami business address once corresponded to an International House of Pancakes. The findings painted a picture of questionable transfers and lax oversight surrounding the billion-dollar loan. The financial strain only deepened. On July 16, 2024, the Board of Control for Cricket in India filed an insolvency case against BYJU’s over roughly $19 million in unpaid sponsorship dues. By the end of the year, both Deloitte and BDO had resigned as auditors, while major investors, including the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Prosus and Peak XV (Sequoia India) quit the board entirely. India’s Byju’s can’t pay employees At the same time, Qatar Holding petitioned the Karnataka High Court to enforce a $235 million arbitral award against Byju Raveendran and Byju’s Investments Pte Ltd tied to a 2022 $150 million loan for the Aakash acquisition, with interest sought at 4% per annum compounded daily from Feb. 28, 2024. The legal blows culminated in February 2025, when a U.S. bankruptcy court issued a summary judgment finding actual fraudulent transfers and breach of fiduciary duty related to the movement of funds through BYJU’s Alpha, marking one of the most significant legal setbacks in the company’s dramatic downfall. The myth of India’s innovation engine Once hailed as the future of Indian innovation, BYJU’s now serves as its cautionary tale. What began as a symbol of national pride, the story of a small startup that conquered global markets, has become a lesson in how hype and ego can outpace substance. In one of his last public interviews, founder Byju Raveendran dismissed the crisis, determined that he would see success again, saying,“Why I am confident of a comeback is that the most valuable thing I had is still with me,” referring to himself. It was a statement that perfectly captured the misplaced faith that defined BYJU’s rise, a belief not in innovation, governance or results, but in personality and perception. For years, U.S. investors, from BlackRock and UBS to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, poured hundreds of millions of dollars into a single man and his myth, while American innovators back home struggled to break into markets dominated by foreign-backed giants. The question now is unavoidable: If so many investors were willing to stake billions on a person halfway around the world, why are they unwilling to back the homegrown entrepreneurs and talent right here in the United States, those who are locked out of markets increasingly monopolized by global capital and offshore influence? BYJU’s collapse is more than the downfall of a company; it is a mirror held up to a global investment culture that prizes narrative over national interest and speculation over stewardship. It is a reminder that the same investors who helped inflate the illusion of India’s innovation miracle have ignored the innovators in their own backyard. In the end, BYJU’s didn’t just fail as a business, it exposed the moral and economic blind spots of an era. The myth of India’s innovation engine has once again met the hard truth of execution and the cost was paid not only in rupees, but in large amounts of misplaced American capital.

A large shareholder in Core Scientific, a data center developer and operator, said he would reject a proposed purchase of the company by the rival data center firm CoreWeave in an upcoming shareholder vote. "Under the math of the deal today, I would have to vote no," Trip Miller, the founder of the investment firm Gullane Capital, told Business Insider on Friday afternoon. Gullane, based in Memphis, Tennessee, is the third-largest shareholder in Core Scientific, behind Vanguard and BlackRock, and owns a stake in the company worth about $200 million. Miller's opposition adds to other recent pushback against the deal, casting doubt on one of the year's largest data center mergers. CoreWeave — the AI cloud darling racing to scale its computing power — needs the roughly $5 billion takeover to help it continue to grow rapidly and also cut billions of dollars in soaring costs. But a dip in its stock price has weakened the offer's value, exacerbating investor concerns that the deal sharply undervalues Core Scientific just weeks before shareholders are set to vote on the transaction. On October 14, Two Seas Capital, another investment firm that owns about 6.3% of Core Scientific's stock, published a lengthy presentation that outlined its myriad objections to the takeover, including that it was not profitable enough for stock owners. The firm urged investors to reject it in the upcoming shareholder vote on October 30. In response, the CEO of the Livingston, New Jersey-based CoreWeave said the acquisition was "the most compelling path forward for Core Scientific stockholders" and that the present deal would be its "best and final" offer for the company. "The combination will offer Core Scientific and CoreWeave stockholders the opportunity to benefit from the tremendous upside potential and long-term value creation driven by greater verticalization," Michael Intrator, CoreWeave's CEO, wrote in a letter published on October 16. Intrator said the complaints from Two Seas Capital were "misleading and misinformed." CoreWeave's rapid, debt-fueled growth has thrust it into the center of a growing debate over whether AI speculation has become a bubble or if early movers like it are seizing on a historic investment opportunity. In July, CoreWeave announced that it had reached an agreement to buy Core Scientific in a stock conversion deal that valued Core Scientific at roughly $9 billion at the time and $20.40 per share — a 66% per share premium over what Core Scientific stock had then been recently trading for. But in the ensuing months, the economics have shifted as CoreWeave's shares have dipped and Core Scientific's have risen. The stock conversion deal currently values Core Scientific's shares at around $17, more than 10% below its market price of about $19 on Friday.CoreWeave and Core Scientific did not respond to requests to comment. "This is not a popular deal, I think for one simple reason: it's a flawed structure," Miller said. "It would be a deal that would value my shares, actually, at a discount to what they currently trade for today." Since a shaky initial public offering in March, CoreWeave has raced to a $70 billion market capitalization — more than three times its value after the IPO — and a place at the forefront of the booming data center business. It has announced blockbuster deals with some of the biggest names in artificial intelligence, including OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft, and the chipmaker Nvidia, and has spent billions of dollars snapping up AI developers and cloud providers to broaden its capabilities and customer offerings. In the company's second-quarter earnings call, Intrator said that its biggest customers required the development of infrastructure, including data centers, on a "planetary" scale. "We are aggressively expanding our footprint on the back of intensifying demand signals from our customers, ensuring that we maintain a durable, multi-year runway for growth," Michael Intrator, CoreWeave's CEO and cofounder, said in the company's second quarter earnings call. CoreWeave said it is expanding its roughly 470 megawatts of operating data centers to more than 900 megawatts by the end of 2025 — enough power to light up about a fifth of New York City on an average day. The Core Scientific acquisition would more than double that by operational megawattage and expand the company's pipeline of contracted future power by 50% to more than 3 gigawatts. Revenue for CoreWeave in the second quarter was $1.2 billion, more than double the same period a year prior, the company reported, and its revenue backlog of $30.1 billion had doubled since the beginning of the year — demonstrating its tremendous business prospects. Its operating margins, however, fell from 20% to 2% year over year, a sign of how costs are increasingly eating into the company's profitability. The company reported its debt had grown to $11.2 billion at the end of the second quarter, a 40% increase from the beginning of the year, and that its borrowing costs ranged from 7% to 15% on its various loans. Gil Luria, an analyst who covers the company, has raised concerns about the high-cost borrowing compared to the company's slimmer profit margins. "They're selling $20 bills for 15 bucks," Luria said. "Sometimes we forget to ask ourselves if this business should even exist," Luria said. "I'm not sure the answer is yes." Acquiring Core Scientific would streamline some of CoreWeave's mounting overhead. CoreWeave rents roughly 270 megawatts of data center space from Core Scientific, and owning the company would allow CoreWeave to save about $10 billion in lease payments for that space over the next 12 years, it has said. "They realize how important this is to the long-term viability of their business model, owning the economics around their largest cost, which is data centers," said Raul Martynek, the CEO of the data center developer and operator DataBank, which is not involved in the deal. Martynek said that Intrator's response letter signified the CEO was making a "full-throated defense of their offer" to purchase Core Scientific. Among the concerns outlined in its presentation, Two Seas said that the deal didn't offer shareholders protection from stock fluctuations that have upended the economics of the transaction. "The initial headline deal price of $20.40 per share undervalued Core Scientific's intrinsic value and strategic value to CoreWeave," Two Seas Capital wrote. "Following one of the worst post-deal drawdowns in an acquirer's stock price since 2020; the current deal value of less than $18 per share reflects a take-under of Core Scientific." In his letter on Thursday, Intrator wrote that CoreWeave represents Core Scientific's only meaningful data center customer and that its business accounts for 76% of Core Scientific's revenue. Intrator added that Core Scientific investors should "think objectively about Core Scientific's stand-alone prospects and the significant risks involved" in rejecting the deal and remaining an independent company." Miller disagreed, stating that in a hot data center market, "the belief is, if you leave this company alone for 18 months, it's a $30 to $40 company" per share, and that he felt it could be a more lucrative acquisition target.

Shares of a major credit card issuer moved higher as a refresh of high-end cards and strong spending among affluent customers helped drive a quarterly earnings beat. Meanwhile, gold prices retreated from their recent highs, exerting pressuring on a major mining company. Major U.S. equities indexes finished higher to close out a volatile trading week as investors shook off concerns about bad loans at regional banks and U.S.-China trade tensions. The S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow each rose 0.5% Friday to post gains for the week. See here for more coverage from Investopedia of Friday's market moves. Kenvue (KVUE) stock bounced back on Friday, clawing back some of the heavy losses posted in the prior session after a lawsuit in the U.K. claimed that baby powder made by the consumer health products company was linked to cancer. Shares of the Band-Aid, Listerine, and Neutrogena parent company ended 8.4% higher, logging the top daily performance in the S&P 500. American Express (AXP) shares surged 7.3% to close at an all-time high after the company beat quarterly earnings estimates, with revenue climbing 11% year-over-year to a record $18.43 billion. Amex benefitted from the launch of updated high-end credit cards and strong spending trends among its affluent client base. Shares of fellow card issuer Capital One Financial (COF) gained 4% Friday, partly recovering from a downtick the prior day amid pressure on the financial sector. Gilead Sciences (GILD) shares added 4.2% following a price target boost by analysts at Goldman Sachs. Earlier this week, the biotechnology company presented positive results from a Phase 3 study of its cancer treatment Trodelvy. Truist Financial (TFC) also reported better-than-expected results for the third quarter, and shares of the financial services firm rose 3.7%. An uptick in fee income, boosted by strength in the wealth management and mortgage banking businesses, helped drive Truist's strong performance. Gold prices retreated from record levels, and shares of Newmont (NEM), the world's largest gold producer, dropped 7.6% Friday. The stock had reached an all-time high Thursday following a rally in parallel with the precious metal's push higher. Shares of Oracle (ORCL) sank close to 7%. Although the enterprise software giant provided targets for robust sales and profit growth through fiscal 2030, some Wall Street analysts raised concerns about a lack of details on Oracle's capital expenditure plans, as well as the company's heavy reliance on revenue from OpenAI and other major customers. Moderna (MRNA) shares lost 4.2%. Some analysts have voiced worries about declining revenue from the company's COVID-19 vaccines, as well as the company's limited headway on diversifying into other products.

Title: Microsoft laid her off. A layoff support group helped her bounce back — and she got a job at Meta 2 months later.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In May, after 14 years at Microsoft, Deborah Hendersen began to sense her time at the tech giant might be running out. Several colleagues on partner teams were among the roughly 6,000 employees laid off that month. The news made Hendersen, a user researcher in the company's Xbox division, worry that her group would be next. She said it eventually became the "worst-kept secret" that additional layoffs were coming, and that her team was likely to be affected. All she could do was hope to come out unscathed. "It wasn't so much like watching a car wreck," said the 45-year-old, who lives in Seattle. "It was more like you were in the car, knowing it was going to wreck." On July 2, her fears were confirmed. Hendersen was one of about 9,000 employees laid off as part of a sweeping companywide reduction. During previous rounds of layoffs she'd survived, Hendersen said it was often hard to tell who had been let go — something the company attributed to privacy concerns. But in her view, that lack of clarity made the experience more difficult for those still at the company, who were left guessing which colleagues had suddenly disappeared. "It's just very uncomfortable, in my experience, to not know who has been affected," she said. So rather than keeping her layoff a secret, she decided to make sure her network knew about it. The moment she received a mysterious meeting invite that she suspected would bring bad news, she started drafting messages to share internally and on LinkedIn. That decision didn't just bring emotional support — it also helped her land a new role at Meta two months later. Hendersen is among the thousands of Microsoft employees who've been laid off over the past year. A Microsoft spokesperson previously told Business Insider the company was focused on reducing management layers and streamlining processes. However, the cuts have also affected individual contributors, such as Hendersen. Microsoft isn't alone. Google, Amazon, and Intel have also announced plans to shed workers. While layoffs remain low by historical standards, tech workers have been disproportionately affected, and a slowdown in white-collar hiring has made it harder for many to secure new roles. But in this challenging environment, some job seekers have found ways to break through. Hendersen shared how she responded to the layoff — and how she landed a job at Meta without ever applying. Business Insider has heard from dozens of tech workers about how corporate strategy shifts, layoffs, and hiring slowdowns have affected their careers.

Use a personal email address, a nonwork WiFi network, and a nonwork device; here’s our guide to sharing information securely. Read more on the topic: Hendersen's journey to a new role began less than an hour after she learned she'd been laid off, when she posted on LinkedIn to share the news. Next, while she still had access to her email, she messaged colleagues on her team, letting them know she'd lost her job — and hoping to identify others affected. As people replied, she added them to a Microsoft Teams group chat. Over the next week, the group of more than a dozen people became a support hub — where laid-off employees traded tips on how to file for unemployment and make sense of the HR materials they'd received. "I would vastly have preferred that I'd have been the only person who was laid off," Hendersen said. "But the fact that we could immediately build community was just incredibly helpful." Hendersen also took steps to prepare financially. When she first suspected a layoff might be coming, she and her husband sold some of their stock holdings to ensure they had enough cash on hand. They didn't know exactly what the severance package would look like, so they wanted to be ready. Once the layoff hit, Hendersen learned she'd continue receiving paychecks through late August, followed by a lump-sum severance payment based on her years of service. With that information, she and her husband analyzed their budget, determined how far their savings would take them, and identified expenses they could cut. She said the process was stressful. "There was very much a sense of stunning anxiety," she said. By reaching out to colleagues and preparing financially, Hendersen hoped to make the transition from Microsoft a little smoother. But she wanted to take some time to decompress and get organized before beginning her job search. "It had been 15 years since I'd updated my résumé in any meaningful way," she said. "I didn't have standardized cover letters. I didn't have all the little stories prepared that you're supposed to tell about yourself in interviews." However, Hendersen said she didn't decompress quite as much as she'd intended. After posting on LinkedIn, friends and former colleagues began reaching out about job opportunities, leading to informal conversations about whether they could be a good fit for her. "It was just like this ocean of warm hugs and kindness that came from people who were here to help me," she said. Support also came from the other laid-off Microsoft colleagues she'd organized in a Teams chat. Before losing access to their internal chat, the group transitioned to Discord, where they shared job opportunities, helped each other prepare for interviews, vented their frustrations, and celebrated their successes. Since Hendersen was finding opportunities through her network, she generally avoided the traditional application route. In total, she thinks she may have formally applied to one role. Relying on her network felt more manageable, especially since, after more than a decade out of the job market, she wasn't sure how to navigate online job searching. Typically, she would share her résumé with a connection, who would then refer her for a role. A recruiter would follow up to begin the process. In some cases, someone would flag an opening, and she'd message the recruiter directly, rather than applying online. One of the roles that was recommended to her was a user experience researcher position at Meta. Someone she knew at the company told her about the opening, which was similar to her role at Microsoft, where she'd conducted studies to evaluate how players interacted with games in development. The Meta role was under Reality Labs, the company's hardware and virtual reality division, and allowed her to work from Meta's Seattle office. Hendersen said the position seemed like a good fit, and after her connection referred her, she landed an interview. In late August, she received a job offer and started full-time in October. Hendersen said she came away from her job search with a few takeaways. First, it's important to develop a library of stories from your career that you can use in interviews. "You've done amazing things that people should be really impressed by," she said. "But can you remember them in the moment? That's so hard." She also recommends practicing how to tell those stories, especially to people who aren't in your field. When she interviewed at Meta, not everyone she spoke with came from the gaming world. That meant she had to explain her past work in a way that resonated with interviewers who didn't have the same level of expertise. Perhaps her biggest takeaway was the importance of supporting — and being supported by — others going through the same journey. "It's so helpful to have the support of other people who are going through it — both the highs and the lows," she said. "Because everybody gets turned down, gets their hopes up, and is just figuring out how to remain sane in a really challenging time."

A Dublin man who was working in Texas while on a J1 visa has died following a road incident last Friday night. John Kirby, who was in his early 20s, is understood to have been knocked down by a truck in Austin, Texas. Mr Kirby was a business and marketing graduate. He suffered serious head injuries and was brought to a nearby hospital after the incident but died last Wednesday. The south county Dublin native had been in Texas with three Blackrock College schoolfriends. Blackrock College Rugby Football Club (RFC) paid tribute in a social media post. A spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said they are “aware of the case and are providing consular assistance.” The director of Blackrock College RFC, Michael Hearty added his condolences saying it is with “deep sadness” that he shared the news of the passing. Mr Hearty said that Mr Kirby was a “much-loved member” of the Blackrock College RFC family, and his loss has been felt “profoundly” across the club and all teams. He continued: “I first met John in the summer of 2019 during preseason training. Immediately I was drawn to his infectious personality and big smile. He was charismatic, witty and very popular. “From the moment he pulled on the Rock jersey, he embodied everything our club stands for, commitment, friendship, and heart. He was a talented player, a dedicated team-mate, and above all, a guy who brought joy to everyone around him.” The director explained that Mr Kirby had that “special kind of presence”. “A big, infectious smile and a quick sense of humour that could lift the whole dressingroom. Whether it was during training on a horrible wet Tuesday night or over a pint in the clubhouse, he had a way of making people laugh and feel included. He was the sort of team-mate you were always happy to see walk through the door,” Mr Hearty noted. “His kindness, and sense of fun left a mark on everyone who knew him. The word no, wasn’t in his vocabulary.” His funeral arrangements are yet to be announced.

Title: Black Women Leaders Found Joy And Reclaimed Their Resilience At The 2025 C-Suite Summit

ByDominique Fluker, Contributor. Black women are experiencing a reckoning. Many of us have found ourselves without a job this year due to mass layoffs, despite our capabilities and accomplishments. Throughout this year, you might’ve come across articles with the headline akin to, “350,000 Black Women Ousted From The Workforce,” highlighting the mass exodus of Black women professionals and documenting where we currently are professionally, despite the despite the grim reality many face. But what hasn’t been as explored are the resources being offered to help keep those who are still in corporate America encouraged, emotionally and spiritually—as many of colleagues, family members and broader community are looking to us for moral support, inspiration, leadership and refuge. Who do we turn to in the face of unprecedented change, confusion and heartache? Is there a soft place to land without judgment and high expectations to perform? That’s where the Martha’s Vineyard African American C-Suite Summit comes into play. Co-founder of Martha’s Vineyard African American Film Festival, Stephanie Tavares-Rance dreamt up the idea in 2019 to create a safe, tangible space for women occupying the highest levels of leadership. The idea morphed into an anticipated event of the Martha’s Vineyard African American Film Festival in 2021, initially as a C-suite luncheon, and has since expanded to include additional cities like Los Angeles, California, Denver, Colorado, and Atlanta, Georgia, featuring notable guests and speakers like April Ryan; Zola Mashariki, head of Audible Studios; Latasha Gillespie, global head of diversity, equity and inclusion at Amazon Studios; award-winning actress Uzo Adubo; and ​​Nicole Avant, to name a few. In October 2024, in the C-Suite Series, the experience evolved into a confluence of women leaders at the inaugural C-Suite Summit, which convened in beautiful Beaver Creek, Colorado, for attendees to “Exhale” and embrace wellness, networking, mentorship and inspiration. In all of these spaces, attendees are encouraged to cultivate new relationships and professional possibilities while engaging in provocative and intimate discussions. This year’s summit was aptly named “Resilience,” as multitudes of Black women are finding themselves in a precarious spot regarding their emotional bandwidth, stretching themselves at work by trying to keep their roles by any means necessary, or recovering from a layoff, while also balancing the stressors of their personal lives. Held from October 9 to 12, at the luxurious Park Hyatt Aviara, in Carlsbad, California, a Forbes Travel Guide Five-Star rated hotel, the summit, sponsored by Disney, L’Oreal Groupe, Carolina Herrera, Amazon MGM Studios, and ESPN, welcomed C-suite executives, entrepreneurs, A-list actresses, from across the country to convene, participate in transformative workshops, and listen to inspiring fireside chats rooted in reclaiming their resilience, while learning how to expand their professional footprint and deepen their influence and leadership skills. Beyond career strategy, the 2025 C-Suite Summit became a safe space for rest, joy, reflection, and establishing the balance in the face of professional turbulence, intentionally designed that way by Tavares-Rance and her team. From early morning Afro-Soca workouts sponsored by ESPN and hosted by Ariel Belgrave to workshops about how to reclaim resilience and position oneself for power from a health perspective, (both sessions led by chief executive officer Dr. Wizdom Powell and Dr. Kelly Elmore, GME president and OBGYN physician), the topic of the sessions showcased a need to focus on health and wellness, as a means of leverage within the workplace and beyond. Lunch-and-learn and fireside chat conversations with the likes of Vanessa Morrison, president of streaming at Walt Disney Studios, and others also proved meaningful, covering the gamut of aspirational career strategies and taking strategic leaps of faith to move forward in line with your purpose. Professional footprint and leadership skills takeaways from the workshop sessions throughtout the summit highlighted the importance of holistic healing (regulating and tending to your mind, body, and spirit) by doing activities that you once loved to do, actively receiving therapy or working with a life coach to understand previous trauma and address it, exploring ways how to bring your whole self to work, like being vulnerable and open. The sessions also guided attendees on how to regain confidence in themselves and work productively after a layoff or career shift, by encouraging them to be open to pivoting and to lean on authentic communities of support for referrals, advice, and job opportunities. Aside from purposeful discussions, the summit offered fun, joyful experiences such as rejuvenating spa sessions, yoga and an exclusive Amazon MGM screening of Hedda. As an attendee of the summit, I got a sense that Tavares-Rance designed this experience to be a safe space for Black women that went beyond the stuffy workshop sessions you may experience at corporate-based career summits and conferences; instead, she wanted to enrich and empower their spirits, especially after a turbulent and trying year. And she did. “I really believe that Black bodies deserve to be spoiled, and I wanted the summit not just to be entertainment focused, because that’s my background. I feel like as Black women, we’re just so siloed with our industries, but you never know where your next job opportunity, your next friendship, your next board position is going to come from," she tells me. "I wanted to create a space where all women from all over could come together, meet new people, be vulnerable, have a really good time, and spoil themselves with spas, hikes, and walks." Tavares-Rance shared that the goal of this summit was to let Black women know that they aren’t alone, no matter what industry they’re in. “Being a Black woman, we all go through the same challenges, and this space has let you know that you’re not alone and that we're here to help,” she says. While career growth and intentional expansion were at the center of the conference, another vital topic lingered—women’s health and self-care, which are critical to overall success and elevation in and out of the workplace. “I believe women’s health is so important, as well as our mental health. As women, we're just told to stuff down our trauma and put on our armor, go to the office, and be strong. And there's no place for us to be vulnerable. So I wanted to talk about things that matter to us at this summit,” she states. When it comes to this year’s summit title and theme, resilience, Tavares-Rance was clear about the intention: using joy as a form of resistance. “I think it's essential for us to realize that we're not alone, and our ancestors have been through much worse. I've chosen to focus on joy because I believe joy is a form of resistance. We are resilient, and the thought and the act of reclaiming our resilience has a lot to do with owning our power and our capabilities and not getting caught up in the title of your job,” she shares.

US banking sector concerns sparked a sell off in Europe with major banking stocks in Ireland and the UK tumbling, including Bank of Ireland, AIB, and Barclays. The Iseq All-Share index ended the session down 1.83 per cent on 11,438.22. Few of the big stocks ended in the black. Kerry Group was one, ending the day 0.78 per cent firmer on €77.45, alongside healthcare services group Uniphar plc, which was up 0.13 per cent. Irish Ferries brand owner Irish Continental Group also went against the tide to close 0.34 per cent ahead. The losses were led by Bank of Ireland and AIB which fell 5.7 per cent and 3.47 per cent respectively amid fears over credit quality in US regional banks which rippled through markets on Friday. Permanent TSB Group got off more lightly, falling 0.43 per cent to end the week on €2.29. Listed home builders also suffered, all ending in the red. Cairn Homes was down 2.07 per cent to €1.896. Glenveagh Properties was off 0.87 per cent and Irish Residential Properties REIT fell 1.07 per cent. Further share price drops came from wind and solar energy group Greencoat Renewables – down 2.62 per cent – and titanium minerals miner Kenmare Resources, which shed another 2.5 per cent at the end of a difficult week for the group. London’s benchmark index hit a two-week low on Friday, weighed down by losses in heavyweight lenders that joined a global sell-off in financial stocks. The benchmark FTSE 100 ended down 0.9 per cent at 9,353 points. Though off its session lows, the index still marked its second consecutive week in the red. The banks index shed 3.1 per cent. HSBC, Barclays and Standard Chartered fell 3 per cent, 5.4 per cent and 3.2 per cent respectively as investors revived memories of the crisis of confidence that shook sentiment just over two years ago. Defensive sectors were among those in positive territory, with personal goods, beverages, personal care, drug & grocery and utilities reflecting the cautious mood among investors. The aerospace and defence index dropped 3.5 per cent, tracking losses in European counterparts. Among other movers, precious metal miner Fresnillo slumped 11 per cent as gold and platinum prices tumbled. Pearson gained 2.5 per cent to the top of FTSE 100 as the education company expects stronger sales growth in the fourth quarter. Man Group gained 6.3 per cent after the hedge fund’s growth in assets under management surpassed expectations. The continent-wide STOXX 600 index closed nearly 1 per cent lower but still managed to log a modest weekly gain of 0.4 per cent. European banks were down 2.5 per cent, with Deutsche Bank, Barclays, Italy’s UniCredit and France’s BNP Paribas all losing between 3.3 per cent and 6.5 per cent. The flight to safety pushed gold to another record high of $4,378.69 per ounce. Luxury stocks helped cushion the broader market as Ray-Ban maker, EssilorLuxottica jumped 13 per cent on investor enthusiasm for its AI-powered Ray-Ban Meta glasses. Luxury was the best performing sector this week, powered by LVMH, which beat forecasts and reported its first quarterly sales rise this year. Continental was up 11.3 per cent after the German auto supplier’s preliminary third-quarter sales came in at €5 billion – just in advance of its own consensus forecast. All three major US stock indices were struggling for direction in midafternoon trading on Friday, while gold pulled back from all-time highs after a record run. Worries over potential systemic credit problems in the banking sector abated the day after Zions disclosed it would take a $50 million loan loss in the third quarter and Western Alliance initiated a lawsuit alleging fraud by an investment firm. The KBW Regional Banking index advanced in a partial recovery from Thursday’s 5 per cent plunge. Amid cooling of tariff rhetoric between Washington and Beijing, analysts now expect third-quarter S&P 500 earnings growth of 9.3 per cent year-on-year, up from 8.8 per cent as of October 1st, according to LSEG data. – Additional reporting, Reuters, PA.

Title: Micron Stock Slips From Record High Amid China Business Concerns—Watch These Key Price Levels

Micron Technology (MU) shares lost ground Friday following a report that the company will suspend some of its business in China. Reuters reported Friday that Micron will no longer supply server chips for data centers in China, after the business struggled following a ban imposed by Chinese authorities on use of the company's products in critical infrastructure. Micron will continue to sell chips to automotive and mobile phone sector customers in China, the report said. Micron shares were down 2% at around $198 in recent trading, after gaining more than 5% yesterday as Wall Street analysts offered bullish commentary on the stock. Analysts at UBS raised their price target on the stock to $245, noting that Micron should benefit from "intensifying" memory and storage hardware shortages. Citi lifted its target to $240 and said the company sits well positioned to team up with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which has recently stuck deals with Nvidia (NVDA), Advance Micro Devices (AMD), and Broadcom (AVGO). Through midday Friday, Micron shares had gained 135% since the start of the year and were up 19% in October, as investors bet that surging AI date-center demand will fuel a memory chip boom. Below, we break down the technicals on Micron’s chart and point out key price levels that investors will likely be watching. After climbing above $200 for the first time earlier this month, Micron shares consolidated in a pennant before breaking out from the pattern on Thursday. Importantly, the move occurred on the highest trading volume in more than three weeks, potentially laying the groundwork for a continuation move higher. While the relative strength index sits near its overbought threshold, the indicator still remains significantly below its June and September peaks that preceded consolidation periods, indicating the stock has ample room for the recent uptrend to continue. Let’s use technical analysis to forecast where Micron’s price may be headed next and also point out key support levels worth watching during pullbacks in the stock. Investors can forecast where Micron shares may be headed by using bars pattern analysis, a technique that analyzes prior trends to project future directional movements. When applying the analysis to the chipmaker's chart, we take the stock’s strong move higher that immediately preceded the pennant and reposition it from Thursday’s breakout point near the pattern’s top trendline. This indicates the share price could rapidly climb to around $245 if a continuation move plays out. During pullbacks, investors should initially watch the $158 level. This area could offer support near the prominent June 2024 swing high and a minor dip on the chart in September this year after an impulsive move higher. Finally, a more-significant drop could see Micron shares revisit lower support near the key $130 level. Investors may look to set buy limit orders in this location near the top of a prior symmetrical triangle, which closely aligns with major peaks on the chart in April 2024 and June this year.

Watch CBS News Updated on: October 17, 2025 / 4:52 PM EDT / CBS News Benjamin Leon Jr. hustled to a White House security checkpoint Wednesday night. He was running late for a dinner recognizing financial backers of President Trump's new ballroom construction project. Secret Service officers waved Leon and his wife through. Once inside, Leon, a wealthy Florida businessman and Mr. Trump's nominee for ambassador to Spain, joined an exclusive guest list of about 130 that included Nvidia's Ned Finkle, Extremity Care's Oliver Burckhardt, Boxabl's Paolo Tiramani and Galiano Tiramani and Coinbase's Kara Calvert. Representatives from companies that gave major contributions to the ballroom were on the list, including OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman and Apple executive Nick Ammann, sources told CBS News. Some guests arrived in black SUVs with a security team. After a meal of tomato salad, Beef Wellington, and butterscotch ice cream with a pear jam-filled meringue, donors "mobbed" Mr. Trump, seeking a quick conversation or a cellphone photo, attendees told CBS News after the event. Several, including Leon, declined to share how much they'd donated, and the White House won't say either. But Mr. Trump says his $250 million ballroom is fully financed — and that leftover money could be directed toward his next architectural endeavor: an arch opposite the Lincoln Memorial. Mr. Trump has taken literally the task of building his legacy, ordering up construction projects that are likely to long outlast his presidency. He's already overhauled the Rose Garden (twice) and recently redid a room off the West Wing. Democrats would like some guardrails around the ballroom — even if they're powerless to stop its construction. California Rep. Mark Takano, a Democrat, is introducing two ballroom-inspired bills Friday. One would ban donor names from being displayed on White House structures or grounds unless the House speaker, minority leader and White House approve it. CBS News reported in September that ballroom fundraisers had discussed etching donors' names in stone or brick in the structure. "This is the White House — it's an emblem of our nation," Takano told CBS News. "It's not like a NASCAR tournament, where all the sponsors are going to get their name emblazoned someplace." Takano's other bill would prohibit federally funded construction at the White House during a government shutdown. The ballroom is being privately financed, so it's not clear that such a law would halt any construction. Neither of Takano's measures are likely to pass, but he argues they send a message. The ballroom is distracting Mr. Trump from "his abilities to actually pay attention to the 21 million Americans that need health care," Takano said. Mr. Trump told dinner guests the ballroom is a respite from heavier matters. "For me, it's like – I love it in between China, Russia and everything else that we deal with." Construction crews are at work on the ballroom, with heavy machinery rumbling around the White House's east side. A John Deere excavator could be seen swinging its arm. Aside from financial donations, companies have also made in-kind contributions. Carrier is donating a "world-class, energy-efficient HVAC system, bringing comfort to distinguished guests and dignitaries in this historic setting for years to come," according to a company statement. An unnamed firm committed $37 million in steel, Mr. Trump said. The ballroom, with bulletproof glass windows, will hold 999 people, up from an initial estimate of 650 in July, Mr. Trump said. The footprint has "definitely expanded," and its exact square footage is "not yet settled," according to a source familiar with the layout. It was originally 90,000 square feet. That figure is likely to increase. The White House shared an abbreviated list of those invited to the dinner, but declined to disclose how much each person or company has given. CBS News obtained a full list of dinner guests. The top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee confirmed earlier this month a probe of the ballroom's financing had commenced. "We need to know who is involved. Are foreign governments paying for any of this?" Rep. Robert Garcia told Meidastouch Network. The investigation is in a preliminary phase. In addition to exploring foreign donations, committee Democrats plan to scrutinize construction contracts, settlement money directed to the cause and whether donations lead to favors from government officials. Ballroom donations are being collected by the Trust for the National Mall, a charitable non-profit organization that partners with the National Park Service and fundraises for projects on the Mall and at the White House. A spokesperson for the Trust told CBS News the White House and National Park Service are responsible for construction and design. So far, the Trust has received no foreign donations for the ballroom, the spokesperson said. According to a pledge form obtained by CBS News, the Trust takes a 2.5% cut on each donation, a routine administrative fee in the fundraising world. The Trust stands to collect more than $6 million in fees on $250 million raised. The Trust spokesperson declined to offer specifics on the fee arrangement. The Trust recently took in $22 million from a settlement agreement between YouTube, which is owned by Google, and Trump. The civil lawsuit stemmed from YouTube deplatforming Trump in the wake of the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot. At the dinner Wednesday, Mr. Trump held up three mock-ups of his next project, an arch on the Virginia side of the Arlington Memorial Bridge, across from the Lincoln Memorial. In 1902, the National Park Service considered building a triumphal arch on that site to honor President and Union General Ulysses S. Grant, but the arch was never built. Perhaps this time will be different. "Small, medium and large," Mr. Trump said, gesturing to the miniature models, which resembled Paris' Arc de Triomphe. "I happen to think the large looks by far the best." Here's the full list of invitees to Mr. Trump's dinner: More than 100 were invited to President Trump's dinner Wednesday night, which was meant to thank financial donors who are funding the new White House ballroom. Those invited, including some who couldn't attend, according to CBS sources, were: Kathryn Watson contributed to this report. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Melinda Gates-backed women's health startup Tia just cut 23% of its workforce

Every time Rebecca publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Women's health startup Tia has slashed about 23% of its staff, Business Insider has learned. The company, which provides in-person and virtual care tailored to women, cut 27% of its corporate team, or 17 people; 22% of its providers, or 27 people; and 23% of its field support team, or 28 people, according to an email to employees sent Monday evening by Tia CEO Felicity Yost. Tia's layoffs show how even buzzy, well-funded startups are being forced to reckon with healthcare's economic pressures against venture capital's growth expectations. Once a rising star backed by Melinda French Gates, Tia is now under pressure to prove that its hybrid model of tech-enabled women's clinics can actually turn a profit. The demise of similar healthcare startups like former Silicon Valley darling Forward has shown how hard tech-enabled healthcare can be to scale; even Amazon owned-health clinic company One Medical has struggled with profitability. Tia confirmed the layoffs in a statement to Business Insider. Tia operates as a one-stop healthcare shop for women, providing services from gynecology and primary care to mental healthcare, with options for in-person and virtual care. The startup runs 11 clinics, according to its website, including six locations in Los Angeles, two in New York City, one in San Francisco, and two in Arizona. Yost told employees in her email that the layoffs were a response to feedback Tia received in a recent fundraise. Yost said Tia sought that funding after its business's underperformance meant Tia would not be able to reach profitability without more cash. The feedback from the fundraise "required us to rethink our business in the current economic and policy climate, which is one that prizes cost and profit-consciousness," Yost said in her email. "We must manage towards a faster timeline to be corporate-level profitable than we previously contemplated." "Tia has seen strong growth, particularly in membership, which has outpaced our expectations for 2025. At the same time, we're facing ongoing structural challenges impacting the broader care delivery sector, such as cost pressures from rising labor rates and tighter reimbursement rates, which require us to be more disciplined in our operations," a Tia spokesperson said in a statement to Business Insider. In-person clinics have proven difficult to sustain financially, even for well-funded healthcare companies. Forward shut down abruptly in November 2024 after raising over $650 million to scale its tech-driven clinics and automated "CarePods." Primary care chain VillageMD has begun selling its clinics after spinning off from Walgreens in the retailer's sale to Sycamore Partners in August; Walgreens had announced plans to close 160 VillageMD clinics in April 2024 to curb losses. Walmart shuttered all 51 of its health centers later in April, citing a lack of profitability. While Tia hasn't announced a round of funding since its $100 million Series B in 2021, Yost's email to employees references Tia's "Series C growth plan." Tia didn't respond to a question from Business Insider about its Series C. The startup also raised an undisclosed amount of Series B extension funding from Melinda French Gates' Pivotal Ventures in 2023, which Tia said brought its total funding to $150 million. "Across healthcare, we're seeing organizations respond to market trends that favor operational efficiency, sustainable growth, and sharper financial discipline. Tia is doing the same, and from a position of strength," the Tia spokesperson said. The spokesperson added that Tia has more health system partnerships and expansion announcements planned for early next year. Yost said in her email to employees that the fires in Los Angeles in early January had challenged Tia's business in the first quarter. She also cited "slower than necessary growth that hampered our business." Tia introduced new projects in the second quarter, "meant to counteract the dip in Q1 performance," Yost wrote. Those initiatives included a new model to allow patients to get care from Tia without becoming a member, a partnership for Tia members to access compounded GLP-1 prescriptions, and a national rollout of Tia's virtual care services. While the new no-membership-required model outperformed expectations, Yost said, underperformance across the rest of the business led Tia to seek additional funding because "we would not achieve profitability with our existing cash runway, as planned." Yost said Tia did ultimately secure additional funding, but received feedback in the process that led to the layoffs. Yost and Witte started Tia in 2016, focusing on in-person clinics. The startup began rolling out virtual care services in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, and later shifted to a hybrid model. Tia's last reported layoff occurred in July 2022, as Business Insider reported the following November. Tia cofounder and then-CEO Carolyn Witte told BI that the layoffs were a preemptive response to the market downturn so Tia could continue to grow responsibly. Witte stepped down as Tia's CEO in April 2024 and into the role of Tia's chairwoman. Witte said a LinkedIn post about her departure from the role that Yost, formerly Tia's president, would serve as Tia's interim CEO. A Tia spokesperson told Business Insider after publication that Witte had stepped down as board chair shortly after departing the CEO position. Yost is now Tia's permanent CEO. In addition to the layoffs, Yost said in her Monday email that Tia would make significant changes to its operating expenses, including to its tools and contracts, and cut compensation for its senior leaders. Yost also said that Tia could no longer afford to hire clinical roles ahead of demand and "must creatively rethink how we optimize our administrative and care support roles across a broader range of responsibilities." She said the startup aims to make these changes without compromising its high-quality patient care standards. Employees affected by the Tuesday layoffs, including patient-facing providers, were cut off from Tia's systems immediately following the email.

Title: These Beloved Fast Food Chains Are Losing Their Edge In 2025, According To Customers
URL: https://www.mashed.com/1994565/beloved-fast-food-chains-getting-worse-2025/
Time Published: 2025-10-17T16:33:00Z
Full Content:
The success of a fast food chain often depends in equal parts on nostalgia and change. On one hand, a fair number of, say, McDonald's customers are perpetually chasing the taste of a Quarter Pounder from their youth. On the other hand, virtually all leading fast food companies continually keep their menus fresh with limited-time offerings or updated recipes, ensuring there's always a new reason to visit. Domino's even overhauled its pizza recipe entirely in the late 2010s and never looked back, permanently altering its flagship offering. Sometimes change is helpful, like in the case of Domino's. But, occasionally, a major change or series of changes at a fast food chain is so detrimental that the classic, nostalgic experience is pretty much lost. In 2025 alone, more than a handful of beloved fast food chains have changed for the worse and started to lose their edge, according to online comments from customers. Isolating the most significant fast food chains declining in 2025 first meant identifying chains with a pronounced downturn, as opposed to a years-long, persistent lull. Furthermore, since the price of fast food is up across the board, complaints from customers needed to cite more than just higher prices. Based on those criteria, then, the following are all popular fast food chains that customers think have lost their edge. Signs that Wendy's was struggling were apparent by the end of 2024, and plenty of customers started to notice those struggles affecting the quality of the Wendy's experience the following year. Pivotal to the chain's decline — and something that started to become evident in 2024 — has been a decrease in the quality of the food. Customers have noticed classic items like the Baconator and the Vanilla Frosty, among others, tasting worse than they remember. Another common critique of Wendy's restaurants is that they're insufficiently staffed. Issues with understaffing recounted by customers in 2025 have included closed drive-thrus, odd hours, and an inefficient ordering system. One Reddit user posted about a series of Wendy's closures in their area, all roughly within the last year, and theorized this was ultimately the fault of the chain no longer delivering on the higher level of quality for which it was once known. "I don't know what the quality control at Wendy's is, but in my opinion, they need to start reigning in the franchises and really look at how the food is getting made," they wrote. "[Wendy's] has always been the more expensive fast food option versus McDonald's or Burger King, but for that price, you used to be guaranteed a certain quality. When the quality is gone, there's really no reason to go there instead of the cheaper option at McDonald's." While the consensus among customers that Wendy's is struggling is a relatively new phenomenon, the decline of Pizza Hut has taken place on a considerably lengthier timeline. Pizza Hut was disappearing across the country in 2020, for example. Nevertheless, things have only gotten worse for the chain in 2025. In response to a post about a particularly low-quality stuffed-crust pizza, for example, a former Pizza Hut manager on Reddit claimed that the chain's dough, cheese, and sauce recipes all changed for the worse in or around 2025. Perhaps even more notable to the Pizza Hut story, however, is the fact that the chain switched from in-house delivery drivers to partnerships with third-party delivery apps in 2025. Many customers are unhappy about this change, generally preferring the experience of dealing with a local Pizza Hut store employee over DoorDash or Uber Eats systems. Even former Pizza Hut employees are denouncing the chain and warning other potential customers away. "As a former Pizza Hut delivery driver, because they gave us two days' notice before they told us they were going 100% DoorDash, I agree," wrote a user on Reddit, in response to a critique of the new DoorDash system. Chipotle has always been a little divisive. For its proponents, items like the burrito bowl make for a fast, largely affordable, and relatively healthy lunch. But to the chain's critics, there are some secrets Chipotle doesn't want the public to know. Some of these suggest a business that doesn't always live up to its own ethos. As much as Chipotle has always faced criticism, some noteworthy changes to the company have negatively affected its 2025 trajectory in particular. Emblematic of Chipotle's 2025 struggles, to the extent it inspired a dedicated Reddit thread, was a significant stock price drop in July. Near the end of 2024, Chipotle hired a new CEO, and some commenters blamed him for the chain's downturn. One analysis of his impact suggested that a purported push to increase Chipotle's volume of catering orders was energy best spent elsewhere. More impactful, this analysis suggested, would be increasing portion sizes. Portion sizes decreasing was, indeed, a complaint shared in numerous posts commenting on the stock price drop. "I was a near-daily Chipotle guy for 10 years," wrote one Reddit user. "Not only did the meat quality nosedive, but as others have mentioned, the portion size reduced by about 33%. I'm done with Chipotle." Like Chipotle, Chick-fil-A elicits strong feelings, both from fans of the chain and those who claim there are better chicken sandwiches at competing restaurants. While Chick-fil-A may cycle limited-time offerings in and out of its rotation, it's the regular chicken sandwich, basic waffle fries, and even its signature chicken nuggets that keep customers coming back — all simple, year-round staples. But as much as Chick-fil-A is reliant on its steadfast classics, some customers are noticing that, classics though they may be, they're just not hitting like they used to. Chick-fil-A made two notable changes to its most popular items. First, in 2024, the chain replaced its antibiotic-free chicken with chicken it describes as raised with no antibiotics important to human medicine. Whether or not that change is resulting in lower quality chicken is up for debate, but regardless, a fair number of Chick-fil-A customers have found that its chicken has gone downhill. Then, in 2025, the chain altered its fry recipe. The big difference compared to the old fries is that the new style of fry is coated in pea starch, intended to keep an order crispier for longer. While that does seem to be working as intended, plenty of fans of Chick-fil-A's classic waffle fries are straight up unhappy with the new recipe's flavor. "Literally tastes like oil, they stick together, and it's not even worth heating up. I'd rather take the soggier ones than what they did this time around," wrote one Reddit user. Around the start of 2024, there were already signs that Panera Bread might not be around much longer. The issues the soup and sandwich chain was facing at that time seem to have only gotten worse, given the volume of customers who noticed the quality drop off in 2025. In a Reddit thread about overrated fast food chains, for example, the two comments with the most upvotes — more than twice as many as the third-most upvoted comment — mentioned Panera. While customers have found that Panera has been steadily declining over the years, the chain announced in July of 2025 that it would no longer prepare its own fresh dough. For those who were already starting to feel iffy about the state of Panera in 2025, this decision was just about the opposite of what the chain needed to win back some goodwill. "Panera's initial concept was that there was a lack of neighborhood bakeries in the U.S., particularly in suburban areas," wrote one Reddit user. "That concept is long gone. There's nothing that makes products at Panera better than elsewhere. You can get similar products in so many places. Sometimes the grocery store selling pre-made sandwiches is in the same strip mall, and it's just as good and cheaper." Sonic Drive-In is sort of a black sheep in the fast-food chain restaurant world. While most fast food chains have a signature item or items, there's no single must-have at Sonic. Rather, it's the chain's old-school drive-in concept that it's most well-known for. Indicative of Sonic's 2025 decline is the fact that some Sonics have closed down the drive-in stalls at times, instead urging customers to order in the drive-thru. A price reason for Sonic's 2025 trajectory is unclear, but that trajectory has been clear enough to inspire multiple online discussions about a sudden lack of quality Sonic restaurants. It's not just the drive-in experience that has been impacted, either. Customers have reported issues with Sonic's food, ranging from overcooked burgers to excessively sweet drinks to drinks being watered down. "I'd like Sonic if it would build its products right," wrote one Reddit user. "Every time I go, all the stuff is on one side of the main item. Like a chili cheese dog with half the wiener exposed. Full serving of chili and cheese falling off the other end. A burger with a patty in the middle of the bun, but half the patty naked and the other half with full portions of everything. It doesn't matter how slow it is or which location I go to." The same way In-N-Out is a business in which Californians take pride — even if its footprint technically extends to a handful of additional states — Whataburger is a Texas chain through and through. Discussion of Whataburger's decline kicked off in a major way around the end of 2024, when The Dallas Observer published an article agreeing with a December Washington Post piece suggesting that Whataburger had fallen off. That sentiment persisted into the following year. Texans recounted issues with the chain in 2025, ranging from cold food to excessive wait times to insufficiently portioned ingredients. Its fries in particular garnered significant criticism — the chain's burgers are cooked to order, sometimes leaving an order of fries to sit out for some time. Even if this practice may have affected orders in the past, customers have shared that in 2025 in particular, subpar fries started to become increasingly common. "Lifelong Whataburger diner here — I am 61," one Reddit user posted. "In my last couple of experiences have noticed a different taste. Last night, I had French fries that were "rubbery," not crisp or fresh like the kind that you find at In-n-Out. I am so disappointed that I want a refund." California has In-N-Out, Texas has Whataburger, and Chicago has Portillo's. From famously delicious hot dogs to Italian beef sandwiches to a famed chocolate cake shake — made with a blended chocolate cake slice — Portillo's specializes in indulgent favorites from Chicago and the Midwest. In 2025, Portillo's attempted to expand significantly outside of Chicago with restaurants smaller than the average Chicago location, focused on quick service. That plan fell so short of expectations, Portillo's parted ways with its CEO in September. Amidst this discord and its inevitable financial impact, customers have noticed the quality of the food at Portillo's locations dropping off. One customer, for example, noted that the size of its Italian beef sandwiches is shrinking. Other customers have noticed that items like the beef and cheddar croissant pretty much never include adequate cheese. "Now every time I go, they always mess up my order, sometimes the cheese on my beef and cheddar croissant isn't even melted," wrote one Reddit user. "I've watched my bag just sit on the counter, ready to get pushed out, while other people are getting theirs. Just not the same anymore."

If you prefer to remain anonymous, you can contact us here. Has reportedly laid off over 120 employees amid a leadership transition following CEO Mark Mader’s retirement. The enterprise software company, which grew to more than 3,300 employees, was acquired for $8.4 billion by Blackstone and Vista Equity Partners earlier this year, taking it private. Has cut over 100 design roles in its cloud division, hitting U.S.-based teams especially hard, as the company shifts focus toward AI investments, per a CNBC report. Many affected employees have until early December to find a new role within Google, following additional layoffs across its Silicon Valley offices, including at least 50 permanent cuts in Sunnyvale. Is reportedly laying off over 500 employees, its first major layoffs since 1998, due to AI and automation improving back-office efficiencies. The Oklahoma City-based HR and payroll software company will provide affected workers with severance packages, outplacement services, and access to internal job opportunities. Will eliminate around 450 jobs as part of a cost and operations review, according to Reuters. The layoffs will span multiple functions and countries, including customer service and sales. Europe’s largest food delivery company said it is increasingly using automation and AI, shifting many manual service tasks to automated systems. Plans to cut around 250 jobs, approximately 30% of its workforce, as part of a push to become a leaner, faster, and AI-focused company, according to The Wall Street Journal. The Tel Aviv-headquartered freelance services marketplace said the restructuring will reduce management layers and position it to pursue growth with an AI-native approach. Is closing its Tel Aviv development center, cutting about 80 jobs. Led by Yosi Taguri, the office specialized in software, data, and AI research, including algorithm development. The California-based recruitment firm, founded in 2010, is trimming costs amid a challenging labor market. Has laid off at least 100 employees, including junior developers, just months after cutting nearly 200 jobs. The San Francisco-based conversational AI company, which is preparing for an IPO within two years, raised $60 million in equity and debt in July. Laid off about a third of its data annotation team, cutting roughly 500 jobs, according to Business Insider. The move comes as the company shifts focus from generalist AI tutors to specialist roles, after testing workers to assess their strengths. Employees were told they’ll be paid through the end of their contracts — or November 30 at the latest — but their system access was cut immediately, Business Insider reports. Has reportedly laid off about 200 workers, or 1.5% of its staff, as the company braces for the end of federal EV tax credits under President Trump’s policy changes. The $7,500 incentive for new electric cars expires this month, adding to pressure from cooling demand. Despite the cuts, Rivian says it’s moving ahead with plans for a lower-cost model. Is cutting another 101 jobs in Seattle and 254 in San Francisco, just weeks after a wave of layoffs in August. The company, which had about 3,900 local employees before the cuts, hasn’t explained the move and declined to comment. Is trimming another 262 jobs at its San Francisco headquarters, according to a state filing, with layoffs set to take effect November 3. The move comes just weeks after CEO Marc Benioff touted AI’s potential to cut customer support roles and follows a smaller round of cuts in Seattle and Bellevue earlier this month. Will eliminate 221 positions across its Milpitas and San Francisco offices, including 157 in Santa Clara County and 64 in San Francisco, effective October 13, according to filings with California’s Employment Development Department reported by the San Francisco Chronicle. The cuts are part of the company’s broader workforce-reduction strategy. Laid off about 100 employees last month, around 9% of its workforce, after falling short of ambitious growth targets. The cuts affected staff across all departments. The company provides back-office software for restaurant chains. Is set to cut 101 jobs at its Santa Clara location, with notices issued on August 13 and terminations effective October 13. The company, which recently disclosed nearly 200 layoffs at its Pleasanton and Redwood City offices, is also planning to lay off 161 employees in Seattle, according to filings with the Washington state Employment Security Department. Is cutting 106 positions at its Seattle and Liberty Lake, Washington, offices, according to a state Employment Security Department filing. The layoffs, which affected senior engineers and managers, are part of a broader global workforce reduction, although the security and application delivery company has not disclosed the total number of employees affected. Will cut 6% of its workforce in its sixth layoff in just over a year. Peloton CEO Peter Stern said the cuts are needed to improve long-term business health. Is cutting 10% of its workforce, or about 70 employees, as part of a cost-saving effort to reduce operating expenses by $8.5 million, marking its third round of layoffs since 2022. The corporate video software company plans to maintain and gradually grow its sales and marketing budgets, driven by a robust pipeline and growing adoption of its AI-powered offerings. Is laying off about 200 employees, roughly 34% of its global workforce, as it shuts down its email and SMS marketing operations. The Israeli-founded unicorn is partnering with Attentive and Omnisend to continue supporting marketing services while investing in AI-powered tools like automated review summaries, smart sorting, and a new Loyalty Tiers system. Laid off 30 employees and is now offering buyouts to the remaining 200.

Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY) shares slumped in early trading Friday after President Trump promised to lower the prices of popular weight-loss drugs, such as Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic and Eli Lilly’s Zepbound. In comments to reporters during a White House event Thursday, Trump said prices could drop to $150 a month from $1,300. When asked which treatment he meant, Trump pointed to Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic, saying prices for weight-loss drugs like it will be "much lower." Ozempic’s current list price is $1,000 a month, but Novo Nordisk offers it to consumers buying in cash without insurance for less. Dr. Mehmet Oz, head of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), said the CMS has not yet finished negotiating costs with pharmaceutical firms. Shares of Novo Nordisk were down about 4% in recent trading, while shares of Eli Lilly dropped 3%. President Trump’s recent comments come amid a broader effort by the administration to cut drug prices in the U.S. to align with lower international rates. A Novo Nordisk spokesperson told Investopedia the company has engaged with the Trump administration, and "will continue to work to find solutions that help people access the medication they need." U.S.-listed shares of Novo Nordisk have lost more than a third of their value this year as the company faces growing competition in the weight-loss drug market. Shares of Eli Lilly have added about 3%.

Today’s top news: It’s been a long-standing joke: “Are the sellers in the room with us?” Well, it turns out: Yes, indeed they are. According to JPMorgan, the sharp crypto correction last week in crypto and carrying through this week was largely self-inflicted. In a note to clients, the bank said the sell pressure came from crypto-native investors, not institutions. The data backs that up: While open interest on Binance and other offshore venues cratered, CME’s institutional contracts barely moved. It’s very much a tale of two markets. Regarding on-chain crypto, the more than $19 billion in liquidations that slammed the crypto market on Friday have tremendously impacted sentiment and prices, neither of which have yet to recover. Glassnode shows nearly $12 billion in futures open interest evaporated overnight, the biggest single-day decline in dollar terms ever. Yet, institutional flow looks calm. The ETFs have seen steady inflows through the turbulence. Across the past two weeks: CME’s Bitcoin open interest held steady, ETF outflows were minor, and Coinbase volumes even ticked up, suggesting that institutional money (smart money) mostly watched from the sidelines. This was the crypto casino cleaning itself out, not TradFi calling it quits. The institutions have mostly still been buying through the pain —so who has been selling? Answer: ancient whales and 4-year cycle believers. There’s plenty of data showing the amount of Bitcoin sold this year from those ancient whales, many of whom were up billions. They said they were going to dump their coins on Wall St., and then they did. And then one of the biggest anecdotal takeaways from the Asia crypto conference tour last month was that many Asian whales still believe in the 4-year cycle, and fully planned on selling this year aligned with prior cycles. While this has put us in a painful spot, there are reasons to be optimistic. Couple those reasons along with the recent on-chain leverage flushout and you have a nice foundation to set up a healthier base for the next leg upwards—not to mention the prospective gold-to-Bitcoin rally that typically takes place when gold leads (and boy, is it leading right now). So stay the course, bulls—this too shall pass.

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Rumors are circulating that BlackRock has partnered with Ripple to tokenize real-world assets on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). There has been no confirmation from either party, suggesting that these rumors may not be accurate. In an X post, XRP influencer JackTheRippler said that there are rumors that BlackRock is about to announce a partnership with Ripple to tokenize assets on the XRPL. Other XRP influencers, such as CryptoSensei and Bale, also shared the rumor, sparking excitement among XRP community members. However, BlackRock and Ripple have yet to issue an official announcement about the rumored partnership, suggesting these claims may not be true. However, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink confirmed that they are building their own technology to tokenize several of their funds and expand their crypto offerings. The BlackRock CEO noted that tokenization can help crypto-native investors access more traditional assets. He further remarked that if they could tokenize an ETF, they could get these investors into the more traditional long-term retirement products. Notably, the asset manager already has products, such as its tokenized money market fund, BUIDL, which runs on the Ethereum network. It is worth mentioning that Ripple already partnered with the fund’s manager, Securitize, to enable off-ramp support for BlackRock’s BUIDL using their RLUSD stablecoin. This has so far been the closest to a partnership between Ripple and BlackRock amid rumors that the asset manager plans to tokenize assets on the XRP Ledger. However, Ripple has so far helped advance upgrades to the XRP Ledger, which could compel institutions like BlackRock to tokenize their funds on the XRPL. This has included the launch of the Multi-Purpose Token (MPT) standard, which is designed to simplify the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs). While rumors of a Ripple and BlackRock partnership do not appear to be accurate, there are other recent developments that provide a bullish outlook for XRP. This includes Ripple’s expansion into the corporate treasury markets through the $1 billion acquisition of GTreasury, a provider of treasury management systems. As part of the deal, Ripple and GTreasury will focus on enabling customers to carry out real-time cross-border payments using Ripple’s payment solution, in which XRP serves as the bridge currency. Meanwhile, according to Bloomberg, Ripple is also working to raise up to $1 billion to establish an XRP treasury company. The crypto firm plans to contribute some of its XRP holdings to set up the firm, while the proposed $1 billion is expected to be raised through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.35, down over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

A small percentage of species in the fungal kingdom can cause devastating infections in humans, with Candida albicans reigning as a leading cause of systemic disease. One of the key virulence phenotypes for pathogenic fungi is the ability to survive at host body temperature; however, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that orchestrate thermal adaptation in fungi remains incomplete. In this study, we expand the largest functional genomics resource in C. albicans, reaching 71.3% coverage of the entire genome, and perform screens under six different temperatures to identify genes important for temperature-dependent fitness. We describe the function of genes involved in translation (GAR1), splicing (C1_11680C or YSF3), and cell cycle progression (C6_00110C or RHT1) in enabling fungal survival at both low and high temperatures. Through experimental evolution, we also show that C. albicans can rapidly overcome deleterious mutations and adapt to extreme temperature environments. Overall, our study highlights the transformative potential of genome-wide functional genomics to uncover critical vulnerabilities in pathogenic fungi.

Among the estimated 5 million fungal species, only a few hundred can cause infections in humans [2]. One of the major barriers restricting fungal species from becoming human pathogens is the ability to grow at human physiological temperature [3]. However, climate change has been implicated in enabling thermal adaptation in fungi, facilitating geographical spread of endemic fungal diseases, and expanding the human fungal pathogen repertoire [4,5]. For example, higher global temperatures have been suggested to promote the spread of the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus deuterogattii, which is more thermotolerant than other species in the same Cryptococcus gattii species complex [6,7]. Another emerging fungal pathogen, Candida auris, first identified from an ear infection in 2009 in Japan, is now a significant public health concern causing nosocomial outbreaks in hospitals globally [8,9]. Importantly, the global emergence of C. auris as a human pathogen is hypothesized to stem from adaptations driven by climate change, allowing it to transition from historically environmental niches to human hosts [10]. Thus, understanding how fungi adapt to extreme temperatures is critical to understand how these species spread and cause disease in human hosts. Deviation from optimal growth temperatures at times induces a temperature shock that disrupts protein homeostasis, challenges cellular physiological state, and jeopardizes fungal survival [11]. In response to temperature upshifts, fungal cells employ a conserved heat shock response, involving reprogramming of gene expression to repress protein biosynthesis and up-regulating cytoprotective heat shock protein-encoding genes. Two of the key players in that response are heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and heat shock transcription factor 1 (Hsf1), which are conserved from yeasts to humans. In the commensal fungal pathogen Candida albicans, the Hsf1-Hsp90 autoregulatory circuit governs the cellular transcriptional response to heat stress [12]. Upon transient heat shock, C. albicans cells rapidly up-regulate over 12% of the genome in an Hsp90-dependent manner with gene functions enriched in the unfolded protein response, proteasome/ubiquitination, oxidative stress response, cell cycle, biofilm formation, and pathogenesis [13]. Hsp90 orchestrates this transcriptional response by modulating chromatin nucleosome positioning enabling transcriptional regulation by Hsf1 [13]. Additional cellular stress response pathways are implicated in tolerance to extreme temperatures as well. In the opportunistic fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans, calcineurin, a conserved calcium-calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine-specific phosphatase modulates heat stress to enable cell survival, and the cold stress response is regulated by the phosphatase Gpp2, a target of the Hog pathway [14–17]. Furthermore, biofilms, or surface-associated communities, have been shown to enhance fungal tolerance to both heat and cold stresses [18]. Due to the pleiotropic effects of these temperature shock defense mechanisms, heat/cold stress adaptation is often accompanied by broader physiological changes, leading to alterations in the cell cycle, transcription, translation, and metabolic processes, which can enhance the potential for fungal pathogenesis [4,11]. With the growing threat of fungal pathogens to human health, the antifungal arsenal remains limited, consisting of only three major classes of antifungal drugs (polyenes, azoles, and echinocandins) targeting essential functions [19]. Unfortunately, each of these antifungal classes is limited by significant host toxicity issues, limited spectrum of activity, and/or the frequent development of resistance [20]. Moreover, heat stress has been shown to induce aneuploidy formation in all major fungal pathogens, including C. albicans, to enable antifungal drug tolerance and resistance [21]. Amid the threat of climate change, fungal pathogens are primed to gain the upper hand in the ongoing antifungal arms race, highlighting the urgency in understanding fungal thermal adaptation. In C. albicans, genetic mutant libraries have enabled large-scale functional genomic screens to identify and characterize genes that govern fungal survival, virulence, and pathogenesis [22–27]. One of the largest functional genomic resources in C. albicans is the Gene Replacement and Conditional Expression (GRACE) collection consisting of heterozygous deletion mutants, where the expression of the remaining wild-type allele is regulated by a doxycycline (DOX)-repressible promoter [23]. Upon its original release, this collection consisted of mutants representing 2,326 genes or ~37% of the 6,198 genes in the C. albicans genome [23]. Genomic coverage increased to 48% with the release of an expanded set of mutants representing 866 genes (GRACEv2) [25]. However, despite the instrumental role this collection has made in furthering our understanding of C. albicans biology [27], over half of the genome has yet to be investigated to identify genes required for important biological traits, including growth at extreme temperatures. Here, we introduce the expansion of GRACE mutants, bringing the cumulative coverage of the GRACE library to 71.3% of the C. albicans genome. Screening of the expanded GRACE library at multiple temperatures identified hundreds of genes that are important for fitness, many of which were selectively required for growth at extreme temperatures. Through the integration of phenotypic clustering, structural similarity analyses, and experimental evolution, we described the function of genes involved in translation (GAR1), splicing (C1_11680C or YSF3), and cell cycle progression (C6_00110C or RHT1). Furthermore, through experimental evolution, we showed that C. albicans can rapidly overcome deleterious mutations via diverse mechanisms in response to high temperature. Overall, this work significantly expands a critical functional genomics resource in C. albicans and characterizes the function of unknown genes with temperature-dependent importance for fitness in this human fungal pathogen. Despite the clinical importance of C. albicans, our understanding of this fungal pathogen remains incomplete due to a lack of comprehensive mutant collections to interrogate gene function. Thus, we first sought to expand the GRACE collection to improve genome coverage. Specifically, C. albicans heterozygous deletion mutants marked with strain-specific molecular barcodes [23] were transformed with a DNA construct consisting of a nourseothricin (NAT)-resistance marker, a DOX-repressible promoter, and homologous sequences to drive homologous recombination immediately upstream of the start codon of the target gene of the remaining allele (Fig 1A). Through this approach, we generated 1,240 novel GRACE strains (GRACEv3) representing 1,228 genes absent from the previous two iterations, expanding genome coverage of this collection from ~48% to ~71% (Fig 1B). For those strains present in the GRACE collection, genes were grouped into broad categories based on manual curation of their annotation status from the Candida Genome Database (CGD) in the gene ontology category of “biological process” [28]. Specifically, genes were determined to have been annotated (i) directly with experimental characterization in C. albicans, (ii) indirectly with conservation in sequence and/or protein domains to other fungal species, or (iii) unannotated based on evidence codes denoting the type of experiments or prediction data presented to support functional annotations. Construction of GRACEv1 and v2 libraries was guided by orthologous gene functions covering all major biological processes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Thus, unannotated genes only make up 11.6% and 15.4% of genes in these two iterations [23,25] (Figs 1B and S1A). In contrast, the construction of GRACEv3 library was not guided by gene functions in S. cerevisiae, resulting in the inclusion of 375 genes (30.6%) lacking functional annotations (Figs 1B and S1A). The remaining ~50% of unannotated genes in the C. albicans genome will benefit from continued efforts of library expansion. A) Schematic of GRACE mutant construction.

To do so, the arrayed GRACEv3 library was grown in liquid culture with a high concentration (100 μg/mL) of DOX before transferring onto solid medium containing 100 μg/mL DOX in technical duplicate to ensure maximum transcriptional repression. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 48 h. Colony images were scored independently by two researchers from 0 to 4, with 4 representing no growth and 0 representing growth comparable to wild type [25] (Figs 1C and S1B). Given the importance of thermotolerance for the success of C. albicans as a human fungal pathogen, we also screened the entire GRACE collection (v1, v2, and v3) for growth at elevated temperature (39 °C) using an analogous approach. Screening results for the GRACEv3 collection at 30 °C were compiled alongside previous results from the v1 and v2 collections [25] and compared to those obtained at 39 °C. This revealed 793 and 887 genes that were important for C. albicans fitness at 30 and 39 °C, respectively, with 734 genes that were important at both temperatures (essentiality score >1, Figs 1C and S1C). To further interrogate the role of temperature in C. albicans fitness, we arrayed 947 strains that showed moderate to severe growth defects (average score > 1 in the presence of DOX) in our initial screen (Fig 1C). To avoid preselection for genes important for fitness during adaptation to DOX suppression, mutants were grown overnight in liquid culture in the absence or presence of 0.5 µg/mL DOX at 30 °C. Mutants were then spotted onto agar plates in the presence and absence of 100 µg/mL DOX and incubated at six different temperatures (16, 22, 30, 37, 39, and 40.5 °C). At the respective timepoints, plates were imaged, and growth of mutants was scored independently by three individuals and averaged to obtain a final growth score for each mutant (S1D Fig and S1 Data). Compared to the 887 strains that were annotated with an essentiality score >1 at 39 °C in the initial screen, 648 strains scored >1 at 39 °C in the secondary screen, suggesting lower DOX pretreatment enabled a more fine-tuned assessment of genes important for fitness at different temperatures (S1 Data). Mutants were then organized by hierarchical clustering of growth scores across screened temperatures to identify clusters of genes with minimal to moderate importance for growth (cluster 4), as well as temperature-independent (cluster 1), heat-sensitive (clusters 2 and 6), cold-sensitive (cluster 3), and extreme temperature-sensitive (cluster 5) phenotypes (Fig 1D). To identify functional enrichment within each cluster, gene ontology (GO) analysis was performed using the 947 genes screened as the background (Fig 1E). As expected, mutants displaying temperature-independent essentiality (cluster 1) were enriched for core biological processes like ‘translation’ and ‘protein metabolic process’, which are indispensable for survival. Cold tolerance genes (cluster 3) showed significant enrichment of various RNA metabolism and regulatory-related processes. Additionally, the GO term “filamentation in response to pH” was enriched in cluster 5, which consisted of genes essential for survival at both low and high temperatures. Finally, genes grouped together based on essentiality at extreme high temperatures (cluster 6) were enriched for functions related to cell cycle, filamentation, and stress response, biological processes previously shown to be important for thermotolerance [13,29]. Overall, this highlights that genes involved in similar biological processes often cluster together based on growth phenotypes at different temperatures. The findings from our functional genomic screen revealed a distinct set of genes required for growth, particularly at elevated temperature, many of which were uncharacterized or poorly characterized based on S. cerevisiae orthologs. One of these genes from cluster 6 was the putative H/ACA snoRNP pseudouridylation complex protein, Gar1. Pseudouridylation is the most abundant RNA modification in noncoding RNAs in all living organisms and plays essential roles in transfer RNA and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) functions [30]. To verify the importance of GAR1 for C. albicans growth at elevated temperature, we performed spot dilution assays with the tetO-GAR1/Δ strain in the absence and presence of DOX and observed a severe growth defect at all temperatures tested upon DOX-mediated transcriptional repression, particularly at 22 and 40.5 °C (Figs 2A and S2A). To confirm the importance of GAR1 for C. albicans fitness, a homozygous deletion mutant was constructed and assessed for growth at different temperatures. Similar to the GRACE strain, spot dilution assay confirmed the importance of this gene for C. albicans fitness, particularly at 40.5 °C where no growth was observed for the deletion mutant. Complementation of the deletion mutant with two wild-type alleles (GAR1A/A) resulted in growth phenotypes similar to wild type (Fig 2B). A) Strains were grown overnight in YPD with or without 0.05 µg/mL DOX and spotted in 10-fold dilutions starting from an OD600 of 0.8 onto YPD with or without 100 µg/mL DOX.

The data underlying Fig 2C, 2D and 2G can be found in S1 Data. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003409.g002 In S. cerevisiae, the box H/ACA ribonucleoprotein complex converts uridine into pseudouridine in rRNAs and consists of four core proteins (Cbf5, Nop10, Nhp2, and Gar1), one RNA-binding protein (Naf1), and one chaperone (Shq1) [31–33]. Spot dilution assays confirmed the importance of the C. albicans core genes for growth at all temperatures. In contrast, the chaperone SHQ1 had the least impact on fitness across all temperatures compared to other genes of the box H/ACA ribonucleoprotein complex (S2A and S3 Figs). These observations suggest Gar1 may be partially dispensable for complex function under optimal conditions, but becomes absolutely required at extreme temperatures. The box H/ACA ribonucleoprotein complex is important for rRNA pseudouridylation modifications and maturation in S. cerevisiae [33,34]. To investigate the role of Gar1 in C. albicans, we quantified the presence of precursor internal transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) by qRT-PCR. During rRNA maturation, ITS1 and ITS2 are cleaved from precursor rRNAs to form mature 18S, 5.8S, and 25S rRNAs [35]. Deletion of GAR1 resulted in significant increases in ITS1 and ITS2 relative to wild-type and complemented strains (Fig 2C), similar to what was observed upon depletion of the core H/ACA ribonucleoprotein CBF5 (S2A and S2B Fig), supporting a role of Gar1 in rRNA maturation (Fig 2C). Defects in rRNA maturation ultimately result in impaired translation [36]. Hence, we performed a fluorescence-based assay to monitor translation activity in the presence or absence of GAR1 [37]. An alkynylated methionine analog, l-homopropargylglycine (HPG), was used to label newly synthesized proteins, and a click reaction of the alkyne with a fluorescent azide provided a fluorescent readout of the translation activity. Treatment of wild-type cells with the translation inhibitor anisomycin or deletion of GAR1 reduced the fluorescent signal compared to wild type or the complemented control. Wild-type cells treated with the non-translation inhibitor fluconazole did not show reduced fluorescent signal, confirming the reduction in fluorescence intensity was not simply due to reduced cell growth (Fig 2D). To further elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying Gar1’s role in temperature-dependent essentiality, we devised a selection strategy to identify mutants with a restored ability to grow at elevated temperature. To this end, we plated 108 gar1Δ/Δ cells on agar plates, incubated the cells at 42 °C for 14 days, and successfully isolated one bypass mutant (ByM1) that was able to grow at 40.5 °C (Figs 2B and S4A) and partially restored ITS1 and ITS2 to wild-type-like levels (Fig 2C). Whole genome sequencing analysis of the evolved mutant showed no aneuploidy or copy number variation in comparison to the reference SC5314 genome or compared to the gar1 mutant from which it was derived (Fig 2E). Variant calling identified a mutation in KRR1 in the LOH region (cyan) on Chr1 at position 109, resulting in an amino acid substitution at position 37 from glutamic acid (E) to lysine (K). KRR1 encodes a nucleolar protein functioning in the 90S pre-ribosome facilitating pre-rRNA cleavage during rRNA maturation [38]. To confirm this substitution was sufficient for the restored growth observed at elevated temperature, we replaced both KRR1 alleles in the gar1 mutant with those identified in ByM1 (Krr1E37K) and confirmed this strain was able to grow at high temperature (Fig 2F). To confirm this substitution was necessary for the growth at elevated temperatures, we replaced both KRR1 alleles in ByM1 with those from the parental gar1 mutant (Krr1K37E), which resulted in a loss of growth at 40.5 °C (Fig 2F). Finally, we evaluated whether the temperature-dependent essentiality of GAR1 plays a role in virulence using the wax moth Galleria mellonella model at both 28 and 39 °C [27]. This invertebrate model has successfully been used to study C. albicans pathogenesis and highlight those genes important for C. albicans virulence in a temperature-dependent manner [27,39]. We infected larvae by proleg injection with wild-type, gar1Δ/Δ, or complemented strains and incubated the G. mellonella at 28 or 39 °C. Deletion of GAR1 significantly attenuated virulence at both temperatures compared to wild-type and the complemented strain with a greater significance at 39 °C, confirming the importance of Gar1 in C. albicans pathogenesis in vivo, especially at human febrile temperature (Fig 2G). Overall, these experiments support the role of Gar1 in thermal tolerance and highlight the increased dependency on translation and rRNA processing at elevated temperature for C. albicans. While the ability of C. albicans to survive within the human host requires it to thrive at physiological and febrile temperatures, this organism also causes a significant number of chronic mucocutaneous infections on the skin, nails, and other mucous membranes, and can survive on different environmental surfaces [40,41]. This requires C. albicans to grow at temperatures below 37 °C. Thus, to investigate which genes are specifically important for growth at lower temperature (cluster 3), we focused on the uncharacterized gene C1_11680C lacking functional annotation on CGD [28]. Using spot dilution assays on YPD agar plates with and without DOX, we confirmed transcriptional repression of C1_11680C impaired fitness at all temperatures, with a more severe growth defect observed at temperatures below 37 °C (Figs 3A and S2A). While we were unable to identify a potential homolog based on DNA sequence comparisons with S. cerevisiae, BLASTp searches against S. cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe genomes predicted C1_11680c as a splicing factor (Ysf3) belonging to the SF3b subcomplex of the U2 snRNP [42–45]. Template modeling (TM) of the predicted C. albicans C1_11680c structure with S. cerevisiae Ysf3 and S. pombe Sap10 by AlphaFold [46] yielded TM-align [47] scores above 0.7, supporting C1_11680c as Ysf3 in C. albicans (Fig 3B).

Spot dilution assays confirmed that across all temperatures depletion of RDS3 and RSE1 had little to no impact on fitness, whereas depletion of HSH49 and HSH155 caused severe growth defects, with HSH155 being essential (S2A and S5A Figs). Interestingly, depletion of CUS1 resulted in similar growth phenotype across all temperatures tested to depletion of YSF3 (S5A Fig). This highlights the differential dependency of various splicing genes in fitness across different temperatures. To test the hypothesis that C1_11680C encodes Ysf3 and is important for C. albicans splicing, we examined the splicing efficiency of the ACT1 transcript upon depletion of YSF3. We also included the tetO-PRP19/Δ strain, as PRP19 is known to be important for splicing of ACT1 in C. albicans [49]. To avoid potential off-target effects by DOX, 20 µg/mL was used, which was sufficient to deplete YSF3 transcript levels in the tetO-YSF3/Δ GRACE strain (S5C Fig) [50]. ACT1 was efficiently spliced in the wild-type control in the absence or presence of DOX, suggesting DOX has no impact on splicing efficiency of the ACT1 transcript (Fig 3C). In the tetO-YSF3/Δ and tetO-PRP19/Δ strains, we observed an accumulation of unspliced ACT1 in the presence of DOX at both 22 and 37 °C, supporting that Ysf3 is important for splicing in C. albicans (Fig 3C). While it has been previously reported that high temperatures reduce splicing efficiency in C. albicans leading to enhanced intron retention (IR) [49], the link between low temperature (temperatures below 30 °C) and splicing efficiency has yet to be investigated. To explore the impact of low temperature on global IR and assess the importance of Ysf3 for global pre-mRNA splicing, we employed 150 bp paired-end RNA-Seq on polyadenylated RNA to map splicing of all intron-containing genes using the tetO-YSF3/Δ GRACE strain and the wild-type control in the presence and absence of 20 µg/mL DOX at both 22 and 37 °C. Principal component analysis of gene expression profiles showed that biological replicates behaved similarly and clustered together (Fig 3D). Furthermore, a significant reduction of YSF3 RNA expression upon DOX treatment led to altered gene expression profiles and the formation of distinct clusters at the two tested temperatures (Fig 3D and S2 Data). Confirming the RT-PCR results (Fig 3C), we detected increased intronic reads for ACT1 when YSF3 was depleted by DOX (S6A Fig). To assess the degree of pre-mRNA splicing globally, we performed a junction-read based analysis to estimate the fraction of IR in all 8 conditions (Fig 3E). This revealed that most introns are well spliced in wild type and the tetO-YSF3/Δ strain in the absence of DOX (median IR fraction for WT: 0.02 (22 °C)/0.04 (37 °C); for tetO-YSF3/Δ without DOX: 0.02 (22 °C)/0.05 (37 °C)) (S3 Data). A modest, but significant increase in IR was seen at 37 °C in wild type and the tetO-YSF3/Δ GRACE strain without DOX, as reported previously (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p < 0.0001****, Figs 3E and S6B) [49]. However, depletion of YSF3 at both temperatures increased IR substantially to median IR fractions of 0.43 and 0.39 at 22 °C and 37 °C, respectively (Fig 3E). IR differences upon depletion of YSF3 were similar and well correlated between all intron-containing genes at both temperatures; however, slightly more pronounced at 22 °C than at 37 °C (Fig 3F and S4 Data). According to the function of S. cerevisiae Ysf3 within the SF3b complex, we hypothesized that C. albicans Ysf3 could be involved in recognizing branchpoint sequence (BPS) and influence splicing of introns with diverse cis-regulatory features as the U2 snRNP [45,48]. To assess this, we analyzed the impact of YSF3 depletion on the accumulation of introns with diverse features, such as intron length, BPS to 3′ splice site (SS) distance, SS consensus, polypyrimidine tract length, and composition and intronic GC-content (S6C and S6D Fig and S4 Data). All features could be extracted from the annotated intronic sequence (Methods). To analyze C. albicans BPSs, we scored intronic 7-nt (nucleotide) motifs according to their similarity to the 7-nt BPS found in S. cerevisiae and also reported for C. albicans [51,52]. For most introns, a single motif close to the intron end (3′ SS) was detected, consistent with the evolutionarily conserved distance of BPS and 3′ SS [52]. For introns with multiple high-scoring 7-nt motifs, the motif was chosen that had the closest match to the typically observed distance of 15−74 nts (median 24 nts) to the 3′ SS and the higher score. As reported previously, the consensus BPS is 5′-UACUAAC-3′ and can be found in >80% of introns (S3 Data) [51,52]. Consistent with our hypothesis, IR and IR differences were increased for introns with non-consensus BPSs and for BPSs that are more distal or proximal to the 3′ SS than the typical branchpoint at both temperatures (Figs 3G and S6D). Interestingly, variation in other intronic features, such as intron length, and 5′ SS sequence also correlated with variation in IR difference (Figs 3G and S6C and S6D). This analysis suggests C. albicans Ysf3 is an important splicing factor, including for those introns that are short and/or exhibit nonconsensus cis-regulatory elements. Given the high prevalence of unspliced mRNAs upon YSF3 depletion, the incompletely processed mRNAs could produce incomplete and possibly toxic, truncated or misfolded proteins that could impact growth. Combining mRNA expression and IR estimates for all intron-containing genes passing our minimal read depth cutoffs for splicing and expression quantification, we estimated that the pool of unspliced, adenylated, and possibly translated cytoplasmic mRNAs increased 6-fold (from 4.1% to 23.9% at 22 °C) and 4-fold (from 5.2% to 20.3% at 37 °C) upon YSF3 depletion (Figs 3H and 6E and S5 Data). This could lead to an increase of prematurely terminated translation products that could be cleared by nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) or require increased proteasome capacity [53,54]. Although we did not see evidence for increased expression of NMD components, genes associated with proteasomal function were increased in their expression relative to all expressed genes and enriched in the group of upregulated genes (Figs 3I, 3J, and S6F and S6 Data). Among downregulated genes, genes involved in filamentous growth and cellular responses to the environment were enriched, consistent with the previously established link between splicing and filamentation [49] (S6G Fig). Interestingly, depletion of YSF3 significantly reduced filamentation in YPD supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum at 37 °C compared to wild-type controls (S5B and S5C Fig). This phenotype was similar to what was observed upon depletion of EFG1, a transcription factor known to be required for filamentation. Overall, we conclude that CaYsf3 is important for splicing of most intron-containing genes with particular importance for short introns and/or nonconsensus cis-regulatory elements. Uncharacterized Candida clade-specific genes essential for growth can enable discovery of new biology relevant to developing antifungal treatments. Hence, we turned to a Candida clade-specific gene C6_00110C that was identified as important for growth at elevated temperature (cluster 6). As observed by spot dilution assays, transcriptional repression of C6_00110C with DOX abrogated growth only at 40.5 °C (Fig 4A). To confirm the temperature-specific essentiality phenotype, we generated a homozygous deletion mutant of C6_00110C, as well as a complemented strain. When examining the growth phenotype of these mutants, we confirmed that deletion of C6_00110C resulted in little to no growth at temperatures at or above 37 °C (Fig 4B). Thus, we named the gene Required for Heat Tolerance 1 (RHT1). BLASTp analysis, conserved domain searches, and co-expression data [55] failed to predict a function for Rht1 and AlphaFold prediction yielded a structure with low model confidence scores for the majority of the amino acids in the protein sequence (pLDDT < 70) (Fig 4C), leaving the function of this Candida-specific protein elusive. Thus, we turned to our bypass mutant selection strategy to uncover the function of this elusive gene and plated 108 rht1Δ/Δ cells on YPD agar plates and incubated at 42 °C for 5 days. Through this approach, we evolved 10 independent bypass mutants (ByMs) with a restored ability to grow at 42 °C in the absence of RHT1 (Fig 4D). Interestingly, when these ByMs were passaged at 30 °C, colonies with restored high-temperature sensitivity (ByMRs) were readily isolated (S4B Fig). ByMRs were successfully isolated for nine out of the 10 ByMs (Figs 4D and S4B). A) Spotting assay was performed as described in Fig 2A except plates were incubated for 2 days. B) Spotting assay was performed as described in Fig 2A. C6_00110CA/A represents the C6_00110cΔ/Δ strain which was complemented with both A alleles.

When examining the genomic changes of the ByMs, we observed significant chromosomal copy number changes for all ByMs. In particular, we detected trisomy of Chr1, Chr2, Chr4 and Chr5 for ByMs 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, and 9; trisomy of Chr1, Chr2, and Chr4 for ByM3; segmental monosomy of Chr7 and ChrR for ByM4; and trisomy of Chr1 and Chr5 as well as segmental trisomy of Chr2 for ByM5 (Fig 4E). When analyzing chromosome copy numbers for ByMRs including 1R, 2R, 3R, 6R, 7R, 8R, and 9R, all strains shared the concurrent loss of Chr1 and Chr2 trisomies, despite differences in Chr3, Chr4, and Chr7 trisomies (Fig 4E). ByM4R and ByM5R gained segmental and full length Chr7 and ChrR trisomies, respectively (Fig 4E). While aneuploidies were detected for ByM10, variant-calling identified a heterozygous mutation in IML3. Iml3 was recently characterized as a C. albicans kinetochore component and is required for heat tolerance [27]. The identified mutation resulted in a substitution of leucine (L) to serine (S) at the amino acid position 67 (Fig 4F). Substitution of S back to L at position 67 in ByM10 abrogated growth at high temperature, whereas both heterozygous and homozygous substitution of L to S at position 67 in the rht1Δ/Δ background restored growth at 40.5 °C, confirming the mutation in Iml3 was both necessary and sufficient for bypassing high-temperature essentiality in rht1Δ/Δ (Fig 4F). Overall, the ploidy changes and mutation in a kinetochore gene observed in rht1Δ/Δ mutants grown at elevated temperature suggests Rht1 may be involved in chromosome segregation and/or genome stability. Given a potential role for Rht1 in genome stability, we examined whether this gene was important for cell cycle progression. Interestingly, the rht1Δ/Δ strain produced both yeast and filaments under non-filament-inducing conditions with the filaments resembling wild-type cells treated with cell cycle inhibitors hydroxyurea (HU) or nocodazole (NOC), suggesting a defect in cell cycle progression in the absence of RHT1 (Fig 5A). Furthermore in a dose-response assay, deletion of RHT1 resulted in a higher sensitivity to G1/S phase inhibitors HU and methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) [56,57] and the G2/M phase inhibitor NOC [58], supporting the potential role of Rht1 in cell cycle progression (Fig 5B). Higher temperature further exacerbated sensitivity of the rht1Δ/Δ mutant to all three drugs (Fig 5B), reinforcing the greater requirement of cell cycle-related genes at high temperature. While the complemented strain fully restored tolerance to all three drugs, ByM1 and ByM10 only partially restored tolerance to HU and MMS (Fig 5B). A) Candida albicans strains were sub-cultured to an OD600 of 0.2 in YPD and grown at 30 °C for 4 h. Cells treated with 25 mM hydroxyurea (HU) or 50 µM nocodazole (NOC) were used as controls. Scale bar represents 20 µm. B) Dose-response assays were performed with 2-fold titrations of hydroxyurea, nocodazole, and methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) at 30 and 35 °C. OD600 was measured after 48 h, values were normalized relative to wild type without drug (see color scale bar). C) Significant interactions for Rht1-GFP were defined through SAINTexpress analysis compared with the Eno1-GFP control. (BFDR threshold = 0, average spectral counts ≥ 20, fold change relative to Eno1 ≥ 50). Protein-labeled nodes are colored based on protein function annotations. Line color ranging from dark black to light gray reflects the decreasing fold change in peptide count of Rht1 relative to Eno1. The data underlying Fig 5C can be found in S7 Data. D) G. mellonella (20 larvae per group) were inoculated with 1 × 106 C. albicans cells. Larvae were incubated at 28 and 39 °C and monitored for survival.

The data underlying Fig 5B, 5D, and 5E can be found in S1 Data. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003409.g005 Identification of protein interaction partners can provide further insights into gene function. Hence, we performed affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry (AP-MS) of a C-terminally GFP-tagged Rht1 strain to define the protein’s interactome using Eno1-GFP as a control for background [25,27]. The homozygous tagged protein was expressed and fully rescued the rht1Δ/Δ high-temperature essentiality phenotype, confirming functionality of Rht1-GFP (S7A and S7B Fig). AP-MS identified 62 high-confidence protein interactors (Bayesian False Discovery Rate [BFDR] = 0, average spectral counts ≥20, and fold change relative to Eno1 ≥50; S7 Data). Consistent with our genetic evidence, the majority of the interactors were found to function in chromatin remodeling, DNA replication and repair, cell cycle progression, transcription, and transcription regulation (Fig 5C). A total of 29 genes encoding Rht1-interacting proteins were included in the secondary fitness screen across six different temperatures. Twelve genes were found in cluster 1 (genes important for fitness across all temperatures) and 15 genes were found in clusters 2 or 6 (genes important for fitness at elevated temperatures), including six genes encoding proteins of the Remodels the Structure of Chromatin (RSC) complex (S7C Fig). Interestingly, five of the six RSC complex members are located on Chr1 or Chr2, chromosomes that increased in copy number upon growth of the rht1 mutant at elevated temperature. The specificity of Rht1 to the Candida clade, its requirement for growth at high temperatures, and its implication in genome stability motivated assessment of its role in virulence and antifungal susceptibility. To determine the role of Rht1 in C. albicans virulence, we turned to the G. mellonella model of C. albicans infection. While injection of the wax moths with the wild-type and complemented strains resulted in profound lethality, the rht1Δ/Δ strain had significantly attenuated virulence only at 39 °C, confirming that Rht1 is required for C. albicans pathogenesis at febrile temperature (Fig 5D). Genome stability modulates fluconazole susceptibility in C. albicans [59], and therefore, we wanted to investigate whether Rht1 was important for azole activity. Dose-response assays with fluconazole showed that loss of Rht1 rendered fluconazole cidal only at 35 °C (Fig 5E). Similarly, when we performed an ETEST strip assay and disc diffusion assay by spotting 50 µg of fluconazole onto a disc placed on a lawn of C. albicans, we confirmed that Rht1 is important for azole activity at 35 °C, as the deletion mutant grew in the absence of fluconazole at 35 °C and showed enhanced clearance around the fluconazole strip or disc relative to wild type (Fig 5F and 5G). The zone of clearance remained after 5 days of incubation at 35 °C (S8A and S8B Fig). Interestingly, growth around the fluconazole disc was restored in ByM10 at 35 °C but not in ByM1 (Fig 5G), suggesting aneuploidy could not fully mask the requirement of Rht1 in fluconazole susceptibility, but the substitution in Iml3 could. Since its original release in 2003, two subsequent expansions of the GRACE library, including the set of 1,235 genes introduced in this study, have increased the total coverage to 4,492 genes [23,25], representing the largest mutant library in C. albicans. Screens of subsets of the GRACE library have been instrumental in advancing our understanding of C. albicans biology and pathogenesis mechanisms including gene essentiality [23,25], fitness in different environmental conditions [27], morphogenesis [22,24,49,60,61], adhesion [62], macrophage interactions [63], and antifungal susceptibility [64,65]. With our expanded GRACE collection, we sought to identify genes required for fitness in diverse temperatures in C. albicans by screening the collection of mutants at both low and high temperatures. Our functional genomic screen identified dozens of genes with important roles in governing C. albicans fitness in a temperature-dependent manner, including GAR1, YSF3, and RHT1. Gar1 plays an important function in pseudouridylation in S. cerevisiae. In C. albicans, deletion of GAR1 caused a severe growth defect across all temperatures tested and completely abrogated growth at 40.5 °C, indicating that GAR1 is important for fungal survival. Interestingly, the nonsynonymous mutation in KRR1 was able to compensate for the fitness defect of the gar1Δ/Δ strain. Krr1 functions in protein and RNA binding via two KH domains for ribosome assembly [66]. The nonsynonymous mutation in the evolved mutant is located in the first KH domain, which lacks the typical GXXG RNA-binding motif [67]. The mutation could either directly or indirectly prime Cbf5 for its catalytic activity in the absence of Gar1. Supporting this hypothesis, Krr1 was shown to physically interact with Cbf5 in multiple studies in S. cerevisiae [38,66,68–70]. In S. cerevisiae, a point mutation in the conserved XLD motif of CBF5 abolishes its pseudouridine synthase activity and eliminates rRNA pseudouridylation, but the mutant remains viable [71]. Thus, whether Gar1 and Krr1 impact temperature-dependent growth via rRNA pseudouridylation in C. albicans remains to be elucidated. Initially thought to be an obligate human commensal fungal pathogen, C. albicans has been found to persist in the environment [72–74], expanding its thermal adaptation range. In this study, we showed that genes in cluster 3 are enriched in RNA metabolic processes and rRNA processes, and they are important for tolerance to temperatures lower than the host temperature of 37 °C. C1_11680C grouped with cluster 3 in the secondary screen, and spot dilution assays confirmed that C1_11680C depletion resulted in no growth at 16 °C and severe growth defects at all other temperatures. Functional characterization of C1_11680C revealed that the gene likely encodes Ysf3, a component of the SF3b complex required for splicing. RNA-sequencing analyses at 22 and 37 °C showed that depletion of YSF3 reduced the efficiency of pre-mRNA splicing, likely increasing the translation of truncated proteins. The effect was slightly stronger at the lower temperature, correlating with a more pronounced growth phenotype at this condition. The high protein structure similarity of C. albicans Ysf3 to S. cerevisiae Ysf3 coupled with the reduced splicing efficiency upon YSF3 depletion suggests that Ysf3 has an important role for splicing in C. albicans. However, future studies are needed to experimentally confirm its function as part of the Sf3b complex and its possible involvement in BP recognition. Among the 30.6% of genes without functional annotation in the GRACEv3 collection is C6_00110C (RHT1), which we identified as a gene required for C. albicans fitness at high temperature. Compared with the gar1Δ/Δ strain, the rht1Δ/Δ strain exhibited an astonishing capacity to evolve bypass mutants, overcoming the fitness defect of the strain at elevated temperatures. Nine out of the 10 bypass mutants were driven by aneuploidy, and seven shared Chr1 and Chr2 trisomies. Interestingly, all seven bypass mutants lost Chr1 and Chr2 trisomies when passaged at a lower temperature, suggesting Chr1 and Chr2 trisomy may contribute to the bypass mechanism. The dynamic ploidy changes observed at different temperatures in rht1Δ/Δ mutants suggest that Rht1 may play a role in maintaining genome stability; however, the temperature-dependent effects of Rht1 on genome stability remain to be elucidated. Among the 62 high-confidence Rht1 interactors, 10 proteins function in the RSC chromatin remodeling complex and 8 are encoded by genes located on Chr1 and Chr2 [75]. It is possible that in rht1Δ/Δ mutants, upregulation of RSC complex genes on Chr1 and Chr2 could enhance chromatin remodeling activities. Supporting this hypothesis, experimental evolution for high temperature survival identified mutations in the chromatin remodeling SWI/SNF complex that enables thermal adaptation in S. cerevisiae [76]. However, additional experiments are warranted to confirm this model. The evolvability of bypass mutants in the rht1 background highlights that C. albicans is able to employ diverse mechanisms in mitigating environmentally contingent detrimental mutations. Such phenomena have also been described in C. albicans when examining the ability of this species to evolve resistance to the azoles [59]. Aneuploidy formation, in particular, isochromosome formation on the left arm of chromosome 5, drives fluconazole resistance [59,77,78]. Chromosome 5 contains ERG11 and TAC1, encoding the fluconazole target and a transcription factor regulating drug efflux pumps [79]. Interestingly, the aneuploidy identified in ByM1 failed to restore azole susceptibility despite the increased copy number of Chr5. In contrast, the evolved mutation in IML3 identified in ByM10 largely restored fungal viability in the presence of fluconazole, suggesting Rht1 likely exerts pleiotropic functions that regulate fitness at elevated temperature and azole exposure. Identification of Rht1 as a novel Candida clade-specific gene required for heat tolerance and virulence highlights the power of functional genomic screens to advance our understanding of C. albicans biology and the importance of continuous expansion efforts to reach whole-genome coverage. Despite our functional characterizations of Rht1, the exact molecular mechanism underlying its role in cell cycle progression and genome stability remains elusive. Interestingly, the functionally relevant kinetochore protein Iml3, implicated by bypass mutant selection, was not present in the Rht1 interactome elucidated by AP-MS. Similarly, close examination of the Iml3 interactome failed to identify Rht1 [27], suggesting a lack of physical interaction between the two proteins. Additional experiments are warranted to pinpoint Rht1’s functional link with the C. albicans kinetochore. Overall, our work characterized genes required for fitness in diverse temperature environments for the major fungal pathogen C. albicans. While connections between temperature and antifungal resistance have been described in the literature [80], more examples continue to be unveiled. In the recently discovered fungal pathogen Rhodsporidiobolus fluvialis, human body temperature elevates mutation rates and drives pan-drug resistance against all three classes of antifungal drugs [81,82]. In Cryptococcus deneoformans, heat stress enhances transposon mobility, which may enable adaptation during infection [83,84]. Thus, it is crucial to continue to probe the mechanisms by which thermal tolerance enables antifungal resistance to disarm fungal threats. Strains used in this study are listed in S1 Table. Plasmids used in this study are listed in S2 Table. Strains were frozen in 25% glycerol at −80 °C for long-term storage. Active cultures were maintained on solid yeast extract peptone (YPD; 1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone, 2% glucose, and 2% agar) at 4 °C for no longer than 1 month. Liquid cultures were grown in YPD at 30 °C, unless otherwise indicated. To select for NAT-resistant mutants, NAT (Jena Bioscience, 96736-11-7) was solubilized in water and supplemented into YPD agar plates (150–250 μg/mL). Prototrophic colonies were selected on SD plates (0.674% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids with ammonium sulfate, 2% glucose, and 2% agar). Temperature-dependent fitness screens were performed using minimal medium plates (0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and without ammonium sulfate, with 2% glucose, 0.1% glutamic acid (MSG), 0.002% histidine, and 2% agar). DOX (Bio Basic, DB0889) stock was prepared at a concentration of 50 mg/mL in H2O, filter-sterilized, and added to the media at the indicated concentration. All genes in the C. albicans genome were analyzed for GO annotations by biological functions on CGD website [28]. Genes with GO terms assigned with codes IC (inferred by curator), IDA (inferred by direct assay), IEP (inferred from expression pattern), IGI (inferred from genetic interaction) in C. albicans, IMP (inferred from mutant phenotype), IPI (inferred from physical interaction), and TAS (traceable author statement) were categorized in the “experimentally characterized” group. Genes with GO terms assigned based on evidence in S. cerevisiae with codes IEA (inferred from electronic annotation), IGI, ISA (inferred from sequence alignment), ISM (inferred from sequence model), ISO (inferred from sequence orthology), and ISS (inferred from sequence or structural similarity) were categorized in the “putative based on S. cerevisiae ortholog” group. Genes with GO terms assigned based on evidence in S. pombe with code IEA were categorized in the ‘putative based on S. pombe ortholog’ group. Genes with GO terms assigned based on evidence in other fungal species with codes IEA, ISA, ISO, and ISS were categorized in the ‘putative based on other fungal species’ group. Genes with GO terms assigned based on conserved protein domains with codes IEA were categorized in the “putative based on conserved protein domains” group. Genes with GO terms assigned codes ISA based on nonfungal species, ISM, and NAS (nontraceable author statement) were categorized in the ‘other’ group. Genes with no GO terms assigned were categorized in the “no data available” group. Double-barcoded HET mutants that were not present in the original collection were constructed, as described previously [25]. Briefly, the CaHIS3 cassette was PCR amplified from pLC1251 using primer 5 and primer 6, each containing 43 base pairs of homology to the 5′ or 3′ of the target gene, internal unique 20 base pair strain-identifying barcodes with flanking common sequences, and 18 base pairs that anneal to the 5′ or 3′ of the CaHIS3 cassette. The cassette was transformed into the histidine auxotrophic parental strain, CaLC6106, that contains the tetracycline-repressible transactivator.

Upstream integration was PCR tested using oLC275 and oLC12436, and downstream integration was tested using oLC274 and oLC12437. Lack of a wild-type allele was PCR tested using oLC12364 and oLC12365. The NAT-sensitive CaLC10720 was derived from the above mutant by SAT1 cassette excision mediated by the site-specific recombinase FLP. SAT1 excision was confirmed by PCR using oLC12436 and oLC12437. RHT1 CDS and RHT1-GFP cassette were transformed into the rht1Δ::FRT/rht1Δ::FRT and SC5314 strains to generate CaLC10721 and CaLC10748 using a transient CRISPR approach adapted from Min and colleagues [85]. To generate the RHT1-SAT1 cassette, RHT1 CDS was PCR amplified from SC5314 genomic DNA with oLC12436 and oLC12444, SAT1 cassette was PCR amplified from pLC1204 with oLC12445 and oLC12439, and fusion PCR was performed on the two PCR products using nested primers oLC12443 and oLC12465.

Lack of wild-type KRR1 3′UTR allele was PCR tested using oLC13240 and oLC13241. KRR1 alleles in CaLC10715 (SC5314 KRR1109GG), CaLC10716 (gar1Δ/Δ ByM1 KRR1109GG), CaLC10717 (SC5314 KRR1109AA), and CaLC10718 (gar1Δ/Δ KRR1109AA) were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. IML3200T wild-type CDS (encoding Iml367L) and IML3200C mutant CDS (encoding Iml367S) were cloned into pLC2055 and pLC2056 using the Gibson assembly method [87].

C. albicans GRACE strains in the GRACEv3 library were screened for growth at 30 °C, as previously described [25]. Briefly, GRACE strains were pinned into 96-well plates (Sarstedt) containing liquid YPD medium and grown overnight at 30 °C. The next day, cells were transferred into liquid YPD medium in the absence and presence of 100 µg/mL DOX in technical duplicates and grown at 30 °C overnight. Approximately 2 μL of cultures were then transferred onto minimal media agar plates in the absence and presence of 100 µg/mL DOX using a metal replicator and grown for 2 days 30 °C. The plates were imaged on a ChemiDoc, and growth fitness was scored independently by two people, using the scoring system outlined in Fig 1C. The entire GRACE library was screened for growth fitness at 39 °C following the same screening pipeline except that cells were grown on minimal media agar plates in the absence and presence of 100 µg/mL DOX at 39 °C (S1B Fig). C. albicans GRACE strains with a fitness score above 1 in the presence of DOX from the growth screens at 30 and 39 °C were prioritized for a secondary screen at six temperatures (S1D Fig). 947 strains were arrayed and pinned into 96-well plates (Sarstedt) containing liquid minimal medium in the absence and presence of 0.5 µg/mL DOX and grown overnight at 30 °C. The next day, 5 µL of mixed cells were diluted in 95 µL H2O and then 5 µL diluted cells were inoculated onto minimal media agar plates in the absence and presence of 100 µg/mL DOX using a multi-channel pipettor and grown for 10 days at 16 °C, 4 days at 22 °C, 2 days at 30 °C, 2 days at 37 °C, 3 days at 39 °C, and 4 days at 40.5 °C. The plates were imaged on a ChemiDoc, and growth was scored independently by three people, using the scoring system outlined in Fig 1C. Four biological replicates were performed for growth screens at 16 and 22 °C, and three biological replicates were performed for growth screens at 30, 37, 39, and 40.5 °C. Genes represented by the 947 strains screened at the six distinct temperatures were clustered based on fitness scores in six temperatures by Euclidean distance (k = 6). GO enrichment analysis was performed using CGD for genes in each cluster against the background of 947 genes screened. P-value was adjusted by false discovery rate (FDR), and only terms with p-adjusted values greater than 0.05 were plotted. Count represents the total number of genes assigned to a given GO term. Blast analyses were performed for C1_11680C and C6_00110C DNA and protein sequences using NCBI (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) [89], FungiDB (https://fungidb.org/fungidb/app/workspace/blast/new) [90], and SGD (https://www.yeastgenome.org/blast-sgd) [91] blast tools. AlphaFold [46] predicted structures were obtained from UniProt31 Website (https://www.uniprot.org/). Similarity between pairs of protein structures was assessed through TM-Align (https://zhanggroup.org/TM-align/) [47]. Wild-type and GRACE strains were grown in YPD in the absence and presence of 0.05 µg/mL DOX overnight at 30 °C. Aliquots of each overnight culture (1 mL) were washed once in H2O and diluted to an OD600 of 0.8. Cells were 10-fold serially diluted four times in H2O in a 96-well plate and 3 µL of cells from each dilution were spotted on YPD agar in the absence and presence of 100 µg/mL DOX. Cells from YPD overnight were spotted on YPD agar and cells from YPD supplemented with 0.05 µg/mL DOX overnight were spotted on YPD agar supplemented with 100 µg/mL DOX. YPD agar plates for box H/ACA ribonucleoprotein complex and SF3b complex GRACE strains were grown for 5 days at 30 °C. YPD agar plates for the tetO-RHT1/Δ GRACE strain were grown for 2 days at 30 °C. Spot dilution assays were performed the same way for wild type, deletion mutant, complemented strains, and bypass mutants without DOX. To evolve bypass mutants, single colonies were cultured in 3 mL YPD under shaking conditions at 30 °C for 48 h and 24 h for CaLC10712 and CaLC10720, respectively. Cells were washed once in H2O and 108 cells were plated on YPD agar media and incubated at 42 °C for 2 weeks and 5 days, respectively. Colonies were propagated on YPD agar and grown at 30 °C to isolate single colonies. A single colony was used to validate bypass phenotype, isolate genomic DNA extraction, and archive in 25% glycerol for −80 °C storage. For rht1Δ/Δ bypass mutants, lineages with restored high temperature sensitivity were obtained from the YPD agar plate during isolation for single colonies (S4 Fig). To confirm DOX-dependent transcriptional repression, wild-type and GRACE strains were grown in YPD in the absence and presence of 0.05 µg/mL DOX overnight at 30 °C, shaking. The next day, the cultures were sub-cultured to an OD600 of 0.2 in 10 mL YPD in the absence and presence of 100 µg/mL DOX and grown for 4 h at 30 °C. GRACE mutants for essential genes were sub-cultured to an OD600 between 0.3 and 0.4 in 10 mL YPD in the presence of 100 µg/mL DOX for 4 h at 30 °C. To confirm DOX-dependent transcriptional repression for YSF3 and EFG1 GRACE strains used in the filamentation assay, cells were grown as above except on the second day, cells were sub-cultured in YPD in the absence and presence of 20 µg/mL DOX. For ITS1 and ITS2 quantification, overnight cultures of wild-type, gar1Δ/Δ, GAR1A/A, and gar1Δ/Δ ByM1 strains were sub-cultured to an OD600 of 0.2 in 10 mL YPD and grown for 4 h at 30 °C. Cells were pelleted, washed once with cold H2O, flash frozen, and stored at −80°C. Cells were lysed by bead beating four times for 30 s, with one minute on ice between. RNA was extracted using the QIAGEN Rneasy kit and Dnase-treated using the Invitrogen DNA-free DNA removal kit. cDNA synthesis was performed using the iScript cDNA synthesis Kit (Biorad). Standard curve was performed for each pair of primers using wild-type samples to determine the optimal cDNA dilutions for qRT-PCR. cDNAs were diluted 80-fold for expression analysis and 800-fold for ITS1 and ITS2 level quantification. qRT-PCR was performed in technical triplicate with a 10 µL reaction volume in a 384-well plate, using Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and the BioRad CFX-384 Real Time System. The following cycling conditions were used: 95 °C for 3 min, then 95 °C for 10 s and 60 °C for 30 s, for 40 cycles. The melt curve was completed with the following cycle conditions: 95 °C for 10 s and 65 °C for 10 s with an increase of 0.5 °C per cycle up to 95 °C. The primers used to monitor expression are listed in S8 Data. The fluorescent translation assay was performed with the Click-iT HPG Alexa Fluor 488 Protein Synthesis Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher C10428), as previously described [37]. Overnights of SC5314, CaLC10712, and CaLC10713 were sub-cultured to an OD600 of 0.2 into 5 mL synthetic defined (SD) medium without amino acids, without ammonium sulfate supplemented with 2% glucose, monosodium glutamate, and uridine and grown at 30 °C, shaking, for 4 h. For positive and negative controls, 1 mL aliquots of SC5314 cells were spun down, and the pellet was resuspended in SD with 100 µM anisomycin or 4 µg/mL fluconazole, and the cultures were incubated under shaking conditions at 30 °C for 10 min. One milliliter aliquots of each sample and drug-treated SC5314 cells were pelleted and resuspended in 1 mL of SD with l-HPG at 1:1,000 dilution. SC5314 cells resuspended in SD without HPG were used as the no-HPG control. All samples were incubated at 30 °C, shaking, for 30 min. Cells were spun down, supernatant removed, and pellets washed once with 1× PBS before being resuspended in 500 µL PBS. Cells were fixed by adding 500 µL 70% ethanol in 1× PBS and rocking for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then pelleted and washed twice with 3% BSA in PBS. Pellets were resuspended with 500 µL of the reaction cocktail containing the azide fluorophore (prepared according to the manufacturer’s protocol) and incubated for 30 min, shaking in the dark. The samples were washed once with the rinse buffer, pelleted, and resuspended in 20 µL of 1× PBS. Cells were imaged by differential interference contrast microscopy and the EGFP channel on a Zeiss Axio Imager M1 at the same exposure time and analyzed using a CytoFlex flow cytometer (Backman Coulter) to quantify fluorescence intensity. A total of 20,000 events were documented and median fluorescein isothiocyanate value was determined using the CytExpert software. Drug susceptibility was measured using a modified broth microdilution protocol in 96-well plates (Sarstedt) format, as previously described [92]. Drugs fluconazole, HU, NOC, and MMS were tested in liquid YPD. Cultures were grown in 2-fold dilutions of drug for 48 h as indicated. To assess cidality, 5 µL of mixed cultures were pipetted onto YPD agar following OD600 measurements, and the agar plates were incubated at 30 °C for 2 days. Data were displayed quantitatively as heat maps using Java TreeView software (version 1.1.6r4). Reported results are representative of two independent experiments, each performed in technical duplicate. Genomic DNA was isolated using the phenol-chloroform extraction method as previously described [78]. Libraries were prepared using NEB Ultra II FS DNA Kit and sequenced with Illumina Novaseq X Plus PE150bp to obtain 50–1,000× coverage. Sequencing data were processed as previously described, with minor modifications [77,93]. For genomes with 1,000× coverage, quality control and trimming were performed using fastp (v0.23.4) [94] with minimum qualified phred quality of 20, a 40% limit on unqualified bases, a mean quality requirement of 20, a cut window size of 5, both front and tail cutting, and with correction enabled. For genomes with 50–100× coverage, adaptor sequences and low-quality reads were trimmed using Trimmomatic (v0.39 LEADING:3 TRAILING:3 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15 MINLEN:36 TORPHRED33) [95]. Trimmed reads were aligned to the C. albicans reference genome (SC5314_version_A21-s02-m09-r10) [28] using BWA-MEM (v.0.7.17) [96] with default parameters. Aligned reads were sorted, duplicate reads were marked, and the resulting BAM file was indexed with Samtools (v.1.17) [97] and picard (RRID:SCR_006525, v.2.26.3). The quality of trimmed FASTQ and BAM files was assessed with FastQC (v.0.12.1) [98] and Qualimap (v.2.2.1) [99]. Chromosome copy number changes were visualized using the Yeast Mapping Analysis Pipeline (YMAP v.1.0) [100]. Aligned BAM files were uploaded to YMAP and mapped to the reference genome C. albicans SC5314 (A21-S02-m09-r10) with GC-content bias correction for read-depth. Read depth along the x axis indicating chromosome position (Chr1–ChrR) was plotted as the log2 ration that was converted to 0–4 as the y axis indicating chromosome copy number [100]. Haplotypes are color-coded with gray, magenta, and cyan indicating heterozygous AB, homozygous B, and homozygous A, respectively. Variant calling and filtering were performed for bypass mutants that failed to revert with Mutect2 and FilterMutectCalls within the GATK package (v.4.6.1.0) [101]. Pairwise variant calling was run for each bypass mutant and its parental strain with the bypass mutant as “tumor” and the parental strain as “normal” using the reference genome C. albicans SC5314 (A21-S02-m09-r10). The resulting VCF files were further filtered using bcftools (v.1.21) [97]. Specifically, the parental strain was removed from the VCF file and variant calls were filtered for a quality status of “PASS“ and exclusion of calls in repeat regions as marked in (SC5314 v.A21-s02-m09-r10_features.gff) and 5,000 bp subtelomeric regions. Hard filtering was performed with the following parameters: minimum of 5 supporting reads, at least one supporting read in both forward and reverse direction, minimum alternate allele frequency of 0.2. Identified variants were compared among bypass mutants and only unique calls were kept. Variants were annotated with SnpEff (v.4.3t; database built from SC5314 v.A21-s02-m09-r10, with alternate yeast nuclear codon table) [102], formatted using bcftools [97], and verified in IGV [103,104]. Verified variants were compiled into S3 Table. A Galleria mellonella larvae model of infection was performed to test C. albicans temperature-dependent virulence as previously described [27]. Briefly, wild type (SC5314), deletion mutants, and complemented strains were grown overnight shaking in YPD at 30 °C. Cells were counted using a hemocytometer to prepare inoculum of 1 × 108 cells per mL. Trypan blue was added to all inoculum stocks to a final concentration of 0.04% as a visual indicator of proper injection in the larvae. Larvae were screened using a weight filter of 230–300 mg and lack of dark spots indicative of injury and visible signs of pupation. Twenty larvae per group were injected in the last left proleg with 1 × 106 cells in a 10 μL volume using a 500 μL gas-tight 1750 series syringe (Hamilton, Ref: CAL81230) with the PB600 repeating syringe dispenser attachment (Hamilton, 83700) for each strain. A group injected with PBS without cells were used as control. Larvae were incubated in petri dishes by treatment group at indicated temperatures and monitored for 144 h for mortality as defined by lack of response to physical touch. Mortality was first checked at 12 h postinfection, then every 4 h between 12 and 24 h postinfection, every 6 h between 24 and 60 h postinfection, and finally every 12 h thereafter until the endpoint of 144 h. Larvae and pupae were euthanized by freezing at −20 °C. Overnight cultures of wild-type, tetO-YSF3/Δ, and tetO-PRP19/Δ strains in YPD in the absence and presence of 0.05 µg/mL DOX were sub-cultured to an OD600 of 0.2 and 0.4 in 10 mL YPD in the absence and presence of 20 µg/mL DOX and grown for approximately 3 h at 22 or 37 °C. RNA was extracted, Dnase-treated, and reverse transcribed as described above with the iScript cDNA synthesis Kit (Biorad), which uses a blend of oligo (dT) and random primers to avoid 5′ and 3′ bias. ACT1 splicing assay was performed as previously described [49]. Briefly, 1 µL of cDNA product was mixed with 0.1 μL of each ACT1 primer at 100 μM (oLC9781 and oLC10309), 2.5 μL of the supplied 10× reaction buffer, 2 μL of the supplied 2.5 mM dNTP mix, 0.25 μL of TAKARA ExTaq DNA polymerase, and 19 μL of ddH2O and subjected to a 30-cycle PCR reaction of 94 °C for 30 s, 52 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 60 s. PCR products were run on a 2% agarose gel at 100 V for 60 min, and the SYBR Safe-stained gels were imaged on a ChemiDoc. Illumina Stranded mRNA Ligation Kit was used to prepare libraries for wild-type and tetO-YSF3/Δ RNAs. Libraries were sequenced with Illumina Novaseq X Plus PE150bp to obtain >50 million reads per sample. Following quality control by FastQC/0.11.9 [98] using the following command: fastqc -o QC_$OUTNAME $R1 $R2 # “$OUTNAME”_R1t.fastq.gz “$OUTNAME”_R2t.fastq.gz, detected Nextera adapter sequences were trimmed off of the paired-end 150 bp reads using cutadapt/2.10 [105] with the following flags and settings: --cores=0 -b CTGTCTCTTATACACATCT -B CTGTCTCTTATACACATCT -e 0.1 -O 10 -m 16 –output=”$OUTNAME”_R1t.fastq.gz –paired-output= ”$OUTNAME”_R2t.fastq.gz $R1 $R2. Another FastQC quality control was performed after trimming. HISAT2/2.2.1 [106] was used to map the trimmed reads to the Candida albicans SC5314 genome version A22 with the following specifications: hisat2 –summary-file “$OUTNAME”_A22_summary.txt –max-intronlen 2000 -x $GENOME2 –rna-strandness FR -1 $R1 -2 $R2 -S “$OUTNAME”_A22.sam –novel-splicesite-outfile “$OUTNAME”_novelSS.txt. Unmapped reads were removed, and the generated output of the mapped reads was converted into tdf and bedgraph files using SAMtools/1.16/1 [107], BEDtools/2.30.0 [108] and IGVtools [104] for IGV visualization and further analyses. Read counts per gene for differential gene expression analysis were obtained using a custom bash script involving SAMtools/1.9, BEDTools/2.27.1 and a custom R script, as described in Lash and colleagues [49]. Specifically, the resulting bam files from mapping were split into first and second reads with SAMtools view -h -b -f 0x40 $BAM > r1.bam/ 0x80 $BAM > r2.bam. Following intersection with the genome annotation by bedtools intersect, reads overlapping with annotated features were counted using awk and bash commands. Resulting files contained reads per gene, as well as total mapped reads (including intergenic regions). Differential gene expression analysis was performed with custom R scripts using the DESeq2 package [109] from Bioconductor. DESeqDataSetFromMatrix was used to create the DESeqDataSet object to run DeSeq, comparing every condition with each other (S2 Data). Principal component analysis was performed by using vst and plotPCA functions. To create custom colors and shapes based on condition, ggplot2 [110] was used for better visualization of the PCA plot. For the analysis towards Figs 3H and S6E, intron-containing gene expression values were adjusted to consider exclusively the CDS for gene expression and excluding reads covering introns that are expected to differ strongly in counts due to decreased pre-mRNA splicing upon YSF3 depletion. First, the reads per intron were calculated using the same approach as for obtaining reads per gene, except for using the intron annotation for bedtools intersect. The obtained intron counts, as well as the total gene counts were normalized for library size by dividing by the number of total mapped reads for each sample. Following normalization, the average counts were calculated between replicates of the same condition. Next, the normalized, averaged number of reads per intron was subtracted from the number of reads per (intron-containing) gene to obtain ‘reads per exon’, to get a measure for expression of transcripts that could actually be subject to translation. Combined exon length was calculated by subtracting the intron length from gene length. Then, reads per kilobase (RPK) values were calculated by dividing number of reads per exon by the exon length in kilobases. To obtain spliced and unspliced intron-containing gene expression, RPK values were multiplied by the respective IR fraction for that gene and condition (S5 Data). Genes with multiple introns were excluded from this analysis. For splicing and IR quantification, the intron annotation used contained annotated introns from CGD, including 5′UTR introns. Analysis was carried out as in Lash and colleagues [49] using custom bash and R scripts. Specifically, bam files were split into forward and reverse reads again using samtools view -h -b -f 0x40 $BAM > r1.bam/0x80 $BAM > r2.bam. Afterwards, reads were overlapped with the annotated introns maintaining strand information using bedtools intersect. A minimum overlap of three bases was required to consider a read overlapping. The block count shows the number of continuous aligned segments in a read. Reads with a block count of 1, indicating alignment without gaps, were considered unspliced and were further categorized into intronic or unspliced, depending on the start and end position of the read; If the block count is > 1, indicating a gap in the aligned read and thus an exon-exon junction, it was classified as spliced. Split reads were further divided into spliced (exactly matching annotated intron) or alternatively spliced (no perfect match). For each intron, reads for each of the categories were counted. For each intron, IR fraction was calculated by dividing the number of unspliced reads by the sum of the number of unspliced and 2 × the number of spliced reads (S3 and S4 Data). We introduced factor 2 for “spliced” junction reads to account for the aspect that one unspliced transcript can give rise to two “unspliced” reads, but a spliced transcript can only yield one “spliced” read. A minimal read cutoff of 20 was required for further analysis. IR difference was calculated as the difference between the fraction of IR of each induced (+ DOX) and uninduced (− DOX) sample. To computationally identify likely BPSs in C. albicans introns we made use of previously annotated 7-nt branchpoint motifs in S. cerevisiae and C. albicans [52,111]. First, we calculated the frequency, position weight, and logOdds matrix from the frequency of nucleotides at each position within the 7-nt motif and the average nucleotide frequency across S. cerevisiae introns using a custom R script and the Biostrings package. Using the S. cerevisiae LogOdds matrix we calculated a branchpoint score for each 7-nt running window across C. albicans introns by summing up LogOdds matrix entries at the respective motif position (column) and base identity (row). To select likely BPSs we required a score above 4. Three introns did not have a score above 4, filtering for a score greater than 0 yielded a likely branchpoint for all three introns. Overall, 333 introns showed the consensus BPS of 5′ UACUAAC 3′ and 76 introns showed slight variations of that motif (non-consensus BPSs) (S3 Data). Seventy-nine introns had more than one possible branchpoint, whereas we considered the BPSs matching the median distance between BPS and 3′ SS best as the primary branchpoint for our analysis. The median distance between BPS and 3′ SS is 24 nts and matches previous estimates [51]; the distance includes the 7-nt BPS. Introns were categorized by their BP motif (consensus/non-consensus) and into four ranges of BPS to 3′ SS distance using quantile to ensure equal distribution of the data. Intron lengths were obtained through the start and end intron coordinates. As intron lengths underlie a bimodal distribution (S6C Fig), we determined a cutoff between short and long introns by analyzing the distribution of intron lengths in our dataset using kernel density estimation (density() function in R). The density plot revealed two prominent peaks, corresponding to two major intron length modes. We used the findpeaks() function (pracma package) to identify these peaks and then determined the local minimum (valley) in the density curve between them. This valley was used as a threshold to classify introns into “short” (≤valley position) and “long” (>valley position). The first 6 nucleotides of an intron were considered for the 5′SS analysis and the last 3 intronic nucleotides to call 3′SS sequences. The conserved 5′SS motif consists of the sequence GUAUGU (GTATGT in the DNA sequ“nce),”and we defined the 3′SS consensus as the most conserved TAG motif, while also including CAG and AAG, which are common 3′SSs in C. albicans as well [51]. We found that all introns for which we measured IR by RNA-seq had a consensus 3′SS, with TAG being the most abundant comprising 298 introns (73%), AAG was found in 58 introns (14%) and 50 introns had a CAG 3′SS (12%). There was some variation within the 5′ SS, while most of them (336 introns) had the full consensus sequence, which is almost 83%, and 62 introns had only the strongly conserved first three nucleotides GTA of the motif, which in combination makes up almost all introns (398/98%). Thus, we categorized the SSs into consensus or variable 5′ SS (S4 Data). When plotting the Δ IR fraction (IR difference) for the categories intron length, BP motif, SS motif and BP–3′SS distance, we verified that the observed effects are consistent when all other variables are kept constant (optimal motifs/distance). Similar analysis for GC-content, polypyrimidine tract length and CU-fraction within the polypyrimidine tract did not produce significant differences in IR upon Ysf3 depletion. As in Lash and colleagues [49] GO term enrichment was performed using the combined GO annotations from CGD (https://geneontology.org/, version from 08/10/2023, gaf-version: 2; and version from 17/01/2024, gaf-version: 2.2) and GO annotations from S. cerevisiae orthologs (https://geneontology.org/, version from 18/01/2024, gaf-version: 2.2). S. cerevisiae orthologous genes were matched according to the information on CGD. GO term annotations were extended to all parents of individual GO terms using the “get_parent_nodes” function from the GOfuncR package. Occurrences of GO terms were counted in each gene group of interest (up- or down-regulated genes upon YSF3 depletion at 22 or 37 °C, respectively) and compared to their frequency in the gene background. For GO term enrichment among groups of differentially expressed genes we distinguished between upregulated genes (log2-fold change of differential expression > 0.5 and adjusted P-value < 0.00001, 592 genes at 22 °C and 239 genes at 37 °C) and downregulated genes (log2-fold change of differential expression >0.5 and adjusted P-value <0.00001, 616 genes at 22 °C and 342 genes at 37 °C). In this case, the gene background was formed by all genes that were quantified as expressed in the RNA-seq data. To assess the significance of GO term enrichment, we performed the Fisher’s Exact Test and multiple testing correction (Bonferroni correction). A P-value cutoff of <0.01 was used to call positively enriched GO terms for “Biological Process.” Enriched GO terms for “Biological Process,” “Molecular Function,” and “Cellular Component” across up- and down-regulated genes are listed in S6 Data. To determine the impact of YSF3 on morphogenesis, CaSS1, YSF3, and EFG1 GRACE strains were grown in YPD in the presence and absence of 0.05 µg/mL DOX overnight at 30 °C, shaking, and sub-cultured to an OD600 of 0.2 in YPD supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum in the presence and absence of 20 µg/mL DOX at 37 °C, shaking, for 6 h. Cells were then imaged on a Zeiss Axio Imager MI. To determine the impact of RHT1 on morphogenesis, overnight cultures of SC5314, CaLC10720, and CaLC10721 were grown in YPD at 30 °C, shaking, and sub-cultured to an OD600 of 0.2 in YPD. SC5314 cells treated with 25 mM HU and 50 µM NOC were used as controls. Cultures were grown at 30 °C for 4 h before imaging on a Zeiss Axio Imager MI. Immunoprecipitation of GFP-tagged Rht1 was performed to assess RHT1-GFP expression, as previously described [112]. Briefly, overnight cultures were sub-cultured to an OD600 of 0.2 in 50 mL YPD and grown for 4 h at 30 °C. Cells were pelleted and washed in 1 mL of F300 buffer (50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.2, 300 mM KOAc, and 10% glycerol) and stored at −80 °C. To prepare whole cell lysate, each pellet was resuspended in 1 mL F300 and disrupted by bead-beating (2 min on; 1 min rest on ice) for three cycles. Crude lysates were mixed with a half-volume of F300 supplemented with 0.06% IGPAL-CA630 and sonicated (20 s × 4) at 30% amplitude using a 3-mm diameter probe. Sonicated lysates were treated with ~30 U Benzonase (Millipore) for 20 min after the addition of MgCl2 to the final centration of 2 mM and clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 g for 20 min at 4 °C. Total protein (~6 mg) in supernatant was incubated with 20 µL of anti-GFP magnetic beads (GTMA-20; Chromotek) for 90 min on a revolving rotator. Bead-bound proteins were captured using a magnetic rack and washed with F300 + 0.02% IGEPAL-CA630 × 3 before boiling in 30 µL 1 × SDS-PAGE loading buffer. All eluted proteins were resolved on 10% precast SDS-gels and blots probed with HRP-conjugated anti-GFP antibody (118144600012; Roche; 1:3,000) followed by HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (170-65169; Bio-Rad; 1:5,000). All F300 buffers were supplemented immediately prior to use with 1× PhosSTOP (Roche) and 1× Complete inhibitor cocktails (Roche) to inhibit phosphatase and proteinase activity. AP-MS experiments were performed as previously described [27]. Briefly, Rht1-GFP (CaLC10748) and Eno1-GFP (CaLC4449) strains were grown overnight at 30 °C in YPD. Stationary phase cultures were diluted to an OD600 of 0.1 in 1 L YPD and grown to an OD600 between 0.6 and 0.8. Cells were harvested at 3,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, washed with ice-cold water, and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen bath. For protein extraction, samples were diluted 1:1 by weight in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 5mM EDTA, 5mM DTT, 0.1% NP-40, 1× ROCHE protease inhibitor cocktail tablet [Roche Diagnostics, Mississauga, ON, Canada]) and vortexed with glass beads (0.5 mm) for 4 × 1 min. Lysates were collected by stacked transfer for 5 min at 100g with a 18-gauge needle and clarified by centrifugation at 16,110g for 20 min in 4 °C in a microcentrifuge. To affinity purify the GFP-interacting proteins, we used 25 µL of GFP-TRAP_M magnetic beads (ChromoTek, Martinsried, Germany) for each 1 L culture. Beads were equilibrated three times with 1 mL of lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 0.1% NP-40, 1× ROCHE protease inhibitors [Roche Diagnostics, Mississauga, ON, Canada]). The protein extract was then added to the resin and rotated for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were magnetized then washed with 1 mL of lysis buffer and then 1 mL of wash buffer (20 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 2 mM CaCl2). The dried beads were resuspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl, and incubated with 0.5 μg trypsin (Sigma, T7575) with rotation at 37 °C overnight (~15 h). The samples were digested on-bead with 0.75 μg trypsin (0.2 μg/μL in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) at 37 °C overnight with rotation. Magnetization and digestion were repeated once more with a shorter incubation of 3–4 h without rotation. Formic acid was added to a final concentration of 2% and stored at −40 °C until used for MS. AP-MS samples and controls were analyzed by MS in two biological replicates. 1/16th of each sample was acquired in data-dependent acquisition (DDA) via LC–MS/MS. Samples were loaded onto Evotip Pure cartridges and eluted from the Performance EV1109 column (8 cm × 150 µm with 1.5 µm beads), heated at 40 °C, with the 60SPD gradient on an Evosep One. The column was coupled to the timsTOF Pro 2 using a 20 µm diameter emitter tip (Bruker 1811107). Peptides were eluted from the column with an acetonitrile gradient generated by an Eksigent ekspert nanoLC 425 and analyzed on a TripleTOF 6600 instrument (AB SCIEX, Concord, Ontario, Canada). The total DDA protocol is 22 min. The MS1 scan had a mass range of 100–1,700 Da in PASEF mode. TIMS settings were accumulation and ramp time of 100 ms (with 4 PASEF ramps and active exclusion at 0.4 min), and within the mobility range (1/K0) of 0.85–1.3 V·s/cm2. This was at a cycle time of 0.53 s. The target intensity was set to 17,500 and the intensity threshold set to 1,750. 1+ ions are excluded from fragmentation using a polygonal filter. The auto calibration was off. MS data generated were stored, searched, and analyzed using the ProHits laboratory information management system (LIMS) platform and searched using MSFragger v4.1 [113] against the C. albicans UniProt database (UP000000559) acquired from NCBI, supplemented with common contaminants, decoy entries were added. Acetylated protein N-term and oxidated methionine were set as variable modifications. Precursor mass tolerance was set to 20 ppm on either side. Fragment mass tolerance was set to 20 ppm. Enzymatic cleavage was set to trypsin with 2 missed cleavages. MSBooster and Percolator were turned on. Percolator required a minimum probability of 0.5 and did not remove redundant peptides. The target-decoy competition method was used to assign q-values and PEPs. For ProteinProphet, the maximum peptide mass difference was set to 30 ppm. When generating the final report, the protein FDR filter was set to 0.01. FDR was estimated by using both filtered PSM and protein lists. Razor peptides were used for protein FDR scoring. All other parameters were default. Results were analyzed with SAINTexpress (v3.3) [114] with Eno1-GFP samples as negative controls. A total spectral count greater than or equal to 20 and a BFDR value equal to 0 were required for proteins to be classified as significant interaction partners (S7 Data).

Cytoscape [115] was used to visualize high-confidence protein interactors identified by AP-MS. E-test strip assay and disc diffusion assays were performed to test fluconazole tolerance for C. albicans strains, as previously described [116]. Wild type, rht1Δ/Δ mutant, complemented strain, ByM1, ByM1R, and ByM10s were grown in liquid YPD at 30 °C overnight, washed once with sterile H2O, and diluted to a cell density of 108 cells/mL. About 100 µL cells were spread on YPD agar using a sterile cotton swab. Fluconazole E-test strip (bioMérieux) or a 0.5 cm precut filter disc was placed at the center of the YPD agar plates. A volume of 5 µL of 10 mg/mL fluconazole stock was spotted on the filter disc. Plates were incubated upside down at 30 or 35 °C and imaged on a ChemiDoc after 3 days.

Title: Fresh U.S. Office Conversion Fund Nears $1B in Investments
URL: http://commercialobserver.com/2025/10/office-conversion-fund-peebles-mcneely/
Time Published: 2025-10-17T13:57:02Z
Full Content:
© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy If you build it, they will come — unless it’s stale office space. In Manhattan, for example, the office vacancy rate hovers at a high of between 13 and 14 percent — nearly doubling the pre-pandemic levels of 2019 — while apartments come with sky-high rents and spark bidding wars, creating a perfect storm for a switch-up. According to recent Cushman & Wakefield data, the pace of New York’s office-to-residential conversions has probably never been faster (or at least it’s close to that milestone). Enter another major player intent on capitalizing on the trend. In April, developer Don Peebles of the Peebles Corporation and Doug McNeely, previously a partner at BlackRock and at Carlyle, announced the Donahue Douglas asset management firm: a $1.5 billion venture to buy offices in New York and elsewhere in the U.S. to convert into housing or hospitality. Office-to-residential conversions are not a new phenomenon, but the national scale of Donahue Douglas marks a major shift from firms or funds focused on a single conversion project or one specific region. “Most of my entire career has been focused on developing cities,” said Peebles. “We’re not going to go to New York City or Washington, D.C., and buy one building; we’re committing to these markets.” Together, McNeely and Peebles plan to buy and transform office buildings across U.S. cities, including New York, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and Boston. The fund could spur at least $4.5 billion in apartment redevelopment, creating roughly 15,000 housing units, said Peebles. Additionally, Donahue Douglas is launching an emerging developer fund, with hopes to eventually employ minority developers for office conversion projects. “This is a long-term business for us,” said McNeely, “The secular headwinds that exist in office space right now, with structural shifts post-COVID, have created a real generational opportunity to invest in this space.” Since the pandemic, thousands of vacated office buildings have undergone makeovers, transforming into much-needed housing complexes. The United States reported a lineup of 55,300 office-to-residential units last year, with some 70,700 conversions planned for 2025, according to Yardi Matrix data. In New York City, notable office-to-residential conversion projects include the historic Emmet Building at 95 Madison Avenue and the Financial District’s newly opened 25 Water Street, the country’s largest conversion of its kind. Outside of New York City, developers from Detroit to Boston are seeking new opportunities in old buildings. These opportunities have ripple effects. “Putting capital and repositioning these buildings either turns around a neighborhood or prevents the neighborhood from ever facing issues with dark and vacant buildings and storefronts,” said Jeremy Shell, a principal with New York-based developer TF Cornerstone (who is not involved in the new fund). As of October, McNeely and Peebles were in the process of closing various commitments totaling nearly $1 billion of their planned $1.5 billion fund, said Peebles, who anticipates closing on that $1 billion by the first quarter of 2026. Different investors have jumped on board, including large institutions such as state pension plans, as well as family offices, university endowments and high-net-worth individuals. Many institutional investors want to allocate significant funds between $100 million to $200 million each, said Peebles. Beyond any one investor, however, the fund has gained momentum by problem solving for the now. “In New York and many other markets, we have a housing crisis, and that is not only an affordable housing crisis — that is a general residential housing crisis,” said Shell. While many New Yorkers can anecdotally understand housing complaints, the statistics hammer home the point. Nationally, there’s a shortage of some 7 million affordable housing units and 4.5 million market-rate ones. In New York specifically, there’s little ground-up construction of multifamily apartments. Moreover, building costs have increased alongside spiking interest rates, inflation concerns and tariff uncertainties, said Shell. To address this staggering lag, state and local officials have enacted policies such as a major rezoning of Midtown South to incentivize office conversions, and a long-term property tax break known as 467-m. Such moves highlight a key player in pulling off large-scale office-to-residential conversions. “That’s really step one: the city getting behind creating or recreating these buildings,” said Andrew Barrocas, CEO of MNS Real Estate (who is also not involved in the Peebles-McNeely venture). But policy alone is not enough to pull off nationwide conversion projects. Rather, a workforce tax credit program and financial incentives are crucial to producing more housing. Tax credit programs allow Peebles and McNeely to create a range of housing, from affordable to higher-end luxury apartments, depending on each building, said Peebles. Meanwhile, Congress earlier this year modified the federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program, making the production of affordable housing more attractive to developers, and tax credits easier for them to use. The closure of all kinds of offices has exposed the potential for a fund like the one proposed by Peebles and McNeely. Empty offices in New York City have caused small businesses to shutter, while those in Downtown Washington, D.C., have created something of a ghost town, snowballing into vacant retail and the closure of small businesses. Washington, D.C., therefore tops the list of Donahue Douglas’ geographic points of interest, as the firm’s investment strategy focuses on large, major markets; strong, solid underlying fundamentals; significant distress; and entrepreneurial opportunities, said Peebles. “No. 2, we really see San Francisco as an environment of great opportunity,” said Peebles, who pinpointed the city’s politics and focus on crime and quality of life issues. He additionally cited Dallas, Austin, South Florida and Boston as areas with major conversion potential. Replacing offices with apartments can revive neighborhoods and create more vibrant, vital, economically resilient and equitable places, said Dan Kaplan, a senior partner at architecture firm FXCollaborative. Across neighborhoods, Peebles and McNeely plan to purchase a combination of both healthy buildings and those under significant duress, said McNeely. Some of these offices will be more bare-bones buildings at the end of their physical and economic lives, while others will be newer skyscrapers that have lost their tenants. Peebles doesn’t consider New York City among Donahue Douglas’ top five cities. But its neighborhoods still present opportunities for both conversions and ground-up development projects through Donahue Douglas’ emerging developer fund. “Our business strategy will be the real estate investment strategy of the future,” said Peebles. “The institutional investors and institutional developers have proven that they can never meet the needs of the public when it comes to housing. … There’s a demand for a new class of developers and investors, and capital to go to them.” As for the New York City areas well positioned to benefit from office-to-residential changes? Barrocas singled out business-heavy neighborhoods like Midtown East and Midtown West. Neighborhoods like the Financial District, Lower Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn are similarly prime for conversion projects. In Midtown, the Garment District is likewise ripe for office-to-residential changes, said Kaplan. Not only is the area accessible to the subway, but it also has loft-type buildings that are relatively easy to transform into apartments. Sure, the neighborhood is missing green spaces, said Kaplan, but those residential aspects are likely to arise after housing arrives. After all, “it’s faster to convert than it is to build new,” said Kaplan. Meaning, converting buildings can — and likely will — revive neighborhoods more efficiently than new construction. (Another bonus: Conversions are also the more sustainable option, as concrete and steel are major sources of embedded carbon.) For proof, take Manhattan’s Financial District circa the 1990s. Back then, the neighborhood was predominantly offices. After an early 2000s recession and the terrorist attacks in September 2001, the values of those office properties declined. Plus, city zoning reforms in the previous decade — among tax incentives and lower-priced office buildings — spurred the conversion of larger offices, said Francis Greenburger, CEO and founder of Time Equities (and uninvolved in the Peebles-McNeely venture). “When you have vacant storefronts, vacant buildings, less pedestrian traffic around these buildings and neighborhoods, there’s risk of this downward spiral, and we’ve seen it,” said Shell, whose TF Cornerstone was responsible for various FiDi conversions. Once housing moved into the Financial District, so did shops, cafes and restaurants to feed and entertain those new residents. Neighborhood residents require everything from garbage pickup to quieter streets, as well as supermarkets, restaurants and cultural venues. “It takes a long time for the locations to provide the sort of infrastructure that residential tenants want,” said Greenburger, who believes the trend of conversions could potentially taper off within the next two to three years, once suitable office buildings are all scooped up. “Changing the office buildings isn’t the entire equation.” Nor is doing away with workspaces altogether. “As it pertains to New York City, we’re being very innovative,” said McNeely. “So, we’re going to couple conversions with smart working spaces. [We will] take 21st-century working spaces, where people are going to be very interested in not only living in the building, but also taking part in the neighborhood. We really want to focus on not only the building, but the amenities within and surrounding the building.” Anna Staropoli can be reached at astaropoli@commercialobserver.com.

ByBoaz Sobrado, Contributor. Howard Lindzon, co-founder and CEO of StockTwits, created an index in May 2023 that tracks companies enabling gambling, day trading, and memecoin speculation. It has returned 130% since inception. The index includes the cornerstone of the speculative economy. It holds Nvidia, Apple, Robinhood, Coinbase, DraftKings, and Bitcoin. These are the infrastructure providers for what Lindzon calls the Degenerate Economy, where investing has converged with entertainment and the lines between trading and gambling have collapsed entirely. Traditional investors find themselves in an uncomfortable position. While retail trading is generally considered to be uninformed, it effectively drives the market. Traditional investors can dismiss what retail traders are doing, or they can acknowledge that Howard Lindzon’s index has doubled the returns of conventional benchmarks while holding household names alongside controversial platforms. The performance gap demands explanation beyond simply calling market participants degenerates. Lindzon built the Degenerate Economy Index around 13 public companies plus Bitcoin. The portfolio divides into clear categories that reveal how speculation became infrastructure. The technology backbone includes Nvidia, Apple, Google, and Meta. These companies provide the computing power, mobile devices, cloud services, and social networks that enable 24/7 access to markets. Without smartphones and social media, retail speculation remains constrained to trading hours and requires desktop computers. The trading platforms include Robinhood, Coinbase, and Interactive Brokers. Commission-free trading, mobile-first design, and cryptocurrency access democratized speculation in ways that traditional brokerages never attempted. Robinhood alone has 24 million funded accounts, most under age 35. The derivatives infrastructure includes CME Group and CBOE. These exchanges provide the futures, options, and volatility products that professional and retail traders use for leveraged speculation. The existence of 3x leveraged ETFs and weekly options expiries reflects demand for higher-risk instruments. DraftKings represents the sports betting category. The company went public in 2020 and now operates in 25 states with 5 million monthly active users. Sports betting legalization following the 2018 PASPA Supreme Court decision created an entirely new category of speculation accessible from phones. Bitcoin itself holds a position in the index. Not as currency or store of value, but as the original digital speculation vehicle that introduced millions to 24/7 trading and extreme volatility as entertainment. The index has seen only about 10 changes since inception. This represents high conviction in the infrastructure thesis rather than trading around momentum. Lindzon is not betting on which memecoin wins or which sports betting platform dominates. He is betting that the infrastructure enabling speculation continues growing regardless of individual winners and losers. The 130% return over 18 months occurred during a period of significant market uncertainty. Interest rates rose from near zero to 5.5%. Regional banks collapsed. Commercial real estate faced existential questions. Geopolitical tensions escalated. None of this mattered to the Degenerate Economy Index. Robinhood stock increased from $8 in May 2023 to over $40 by January 2025. It currently trades at $130. Coinbase moved from $50 to $330 over the same period. Nvidia returned over many multiples as AI demand for GPUs accelerated. DraftKings doubled despite increasing competition in sports betting. The performance occurred because the infrastructure providers collect their rake regardless of whether individual speculators win or lose. Robinhood earns revenue from payment for order flow, margin interest, and premium subscriptions. Coinbase charges transaction fees on every trade. Nvidia sells chips whether they mine Bitcoin or train AI models. CME Group collects fees on every futures contract regardless of who profits. This represents the fundamental insight behind the index construction. Lindzon invested in the arms dealers, not the soldiers. The casinos, not the gamblers. The platforms, not the users. More conservative market participants may argue that this rewards the casino-ification of markets. They point to Robinhood's gamification features, Coinbase's promotion of questionable tokens, and DraftKings' advertising targeting young males with gambling problems. These criticisms are accurate. They are also irrelevant to whether the companies generate profits and grow user bases. Three technological convergences enable the Degenerate Economy and show no signs of reversing. Mobile platforms provide the foundation. The iPhone launched in 2007 and Android followed shortly after. By 2023, global smartphone penetration exceeded 6.8 billion users. These devices enable what Lindzon calls "living life with a wallet on your phone" where stocks, crypto, sports bets, and NFTs sit accessible with a few taps. The friction of desktop trading and phone calls to brokers disappeared. Social networks provide the distribution mechanism. StockTwits, which Lindzon founded in 2008, now has 6 million users discussing markets in real time. Twitter financial content reaches hundreds of millions. Reddit's WallStreetBets has 15 million members. Discord servers coordinate trading activity. Information that previously required expensive Bloomberg terminals or Wall Street Journal subscriptions now spreads instantly and free across social platforms. Blockchain and cryptocurrency provide the rails for 24/7 global trading. Markets that previously closed at 4pm EST now operate continuously. Weekends on StockTwits trend with memecoin tickers rather than traditional stocks. Coinbase reported that approximately 1 million tokens per week are being created as of January 2025. The barriers to launching speculative instruments have collapsed to near zero. The economic context makes these technologies particularly potent. Housing affordability in the US reached its worst level in decades. Student debt exceeds $1.7 trillion. Wage growth lags asset price appreciation. For younger cohorts priced out of traditional wealth building through homeownership and stable employment, high-risk speculation represents a rational response rather than irrational exuberance. Commentators have coined the term "financial nihilism" to describe this phenomenon. When you have nothing to lose, perceived risk changes dramatically. A 23-year-old with no realistic path to buying a house may reasonably conclude that risking $5,000 on memecoins or sports betting parlays offers better expected value than saving for a down payment that never arrives. Sports betting provides the clearest quantitative evidence of speculation becoming entertainment. The Wall Street Journal reported in January 2025 that America is "addicted to parlay bets." Studies show sports betting significantly reduces household savings and increases credit card debt among financially constrained households. The National Council on Problem Gambling estimates $14 billion in social costs from problem gambling, with 38% of male sports bettors aged 18-49 reporting betting more than they should. Crypto adoption follows similar patterns. Coinbase has 108 million verified users. MetaMask has over 30 million monthly active users. These numbers represent genuine adoption rather than speculative bubbles that burst and disappear. The infrastructure exists and users remain engaged even when individual tokens collapse. Market structure has fundamentally shifted in ways that benefit the index holdings. The top 10 stocks now represent 38% of the S&P 500, matching dot-com bubble concentration levels. Passive flows create what Epsilon Theory's Michael Green calls "a giant mindless robot" market where price discovery occurs through flows rather than fundamental analysis. Social sentiment now leads price action rather than following it, and its global. South Koreans stream live perpetual futures trading like esports competitions in what they call "T-POP" (Trading as K-POP). Similar phenomena emerge in India and China. This is not an American cultural quirk but a global transformation in how markets operate. Lindzon himself expressed doubts about the thesis in August 2024. "The term 'degenerate economy' is sloppy in that I do not want to glorify the idea that you are on your own. I take pride in helping people learn the language of the markets. My utopian idea of this economy is that 'speculation is entertainment' and 'investing is a sport'. That is not happening." He considered changing the terminology but ultimately continued using it while emphasizing education and risk management. The discomfort stems from observing friends joke about investing in gambling addiction treatment centers as a growth industry. The normalization of behavior that previous generations would consider pathological creates ethical questions that performance data does not answer. The January 2025 launch of Trump and Melania memecoins crystallized these concerns. The $TRUMP token hit $60 billion in initial valuation three days before inauguration. This represents a massive wealth transfer from retail speculators to insiders rather than democratization of finance. Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum's founder, experienced a crisis of faith in February 2024: "Do I feel good when I hear people from crypto twitter and VC firms telling me that PvP KOL degen casino that's money-losing for over 99% of its own users is the best product market fit that crypto is going to get?" This captures the tension between builders wanting utility and markets demanding entertainment. Traditional value investors see casino-ification killing price discovery and allocating capital inefficiently. When GameStop or AMC trade based on social media sentiment rather than business fundamentals, markets stop performing their core function of directing resources toward productive uses. These concerns are valid, but they do not make the Degenerate Economy Index wrong as an investment thesis. Investors face a choice. They can refuse to participate in infrastructure they find morally questionable and accept lower returns. Or they can acknowledge that opposing a trend does not stop it from generating profits. The Degenerate Economy Index provides a framework for the latter approach. By focusing on infrastructure providers rather than attempting to pick winning meme stocks, investors gain exposure to the trend without participating in its most problematic aspects. Owning Nvidia does not require endorsing AI girlfriends. Owning Apple does not require approving of mobile gambling addiction. Owning CME Group does not require celebrating leveraged speculation by retail traders. These companies provide tools that serve many purposes, some productive and some destructive. The counterargument holds that providing the infrastructure makes you complicit in the outcomes. Often people seek out “ethical” investments which avoid alcohol companies, casinos, tobacco, or any industry with negative externalities. Investors must decide their own ethical boundaries. For now, the performance data suggests that those boundaries cost money. The 60 percentage point gap between the Degenerate Economy Index and the Nasdaq-100 over 18 months represents real wealth not created for those avoiding the trend. Lindzon’s advice to his son Max perhaps illustrates a middle path: if you are going to make a parlay bet, invest an equal amount in the Degenerate Economy Index. The Degenerate Economy entered what Lindzon calls "Ludicrous Mode" in January 2025. The SEC rescinded SAB 121, allowing banks to custody Bitcoin. David Sacks serves as Crypto Czar. Robinhood, Visa, Wells Fargo, and Goldman Sachs all hit all-time highs simultaneously. Both old and new financial platforms benefit from the same trend. Traditional banks adding crypto custody compete with Coinbase while simultaneously validating the asset class. This represents market expansion rather than zero-sum competition. Lindzon predicts several developments that would further benefit index holdings. Vegas sportsbooks will morph into "degenerate economy clubs" combining gambling, trading, and entertainment. CNBC's Squawk Box could evolve into a global streaming phenomenon focused on trading as sport. On-chain peer-to-peer betting will expand to cover everything from stock movements to sports outcomes to prediction markets. The wealth gap will accelerate dramatically as asset owners vastly outperform wage earners. Retail participation may reach 30% of market volume, up from historical 20%, as platforms become more sophisticated. AI will replace traditional Wall Street analysts for many functions, further commoditizing financial research. For crypto specifically, Lindzon predicts that supply will crush demand. With 1 million tokens created weekly, most will fail spectacularly. This benefits infrastructure providers like Coinbase that collect fees regardless of which tokens succeed. The platforms always win. The question facing investors is whether this represents a temporary mania that will revert or a permanent transformation in market structure. The 18-month performance of the Degenerate Economy Index suggests the latter. The technological infrastructure exists and cannot be uninvented. The economic conditions driving participation show no signs of improving. The regulatory environment is becoming more permissive rather than restrictive. Traditional investors can question their sanity for participating in what they see as casino-ification of markets. The alternative is questioning their sanity for ignoring a trend that has doubled benchmark returns while showing no signs of reversal.

Title: Bully For Investment Banks!
URL: https://dailyreckoning.com/bully-for-investment-banks/
Time Published: 2025-10-17T13:30:07Z
Full Content:
By Sean Ring PostedOctober 17, 2025 I remember getting my offer letter from Lehman Brothers in early 1997, a full 11 years before they went bankrupt, I hasten to add. For a whopping $34,000, I was theirs, green as a Granny Smith apple. My job was in a division called Global Corporate Equity Derivatives, and I was going to help the traders keep their trading books reconciled with the general ledger. It was my first, and last, accounting job, and it sucked from Day 1. But I didn’t know that, so I leaped with glee into my family’s New Jersey living room, and yelped, “Ma, I got the job!” My mother squealed, “I’m soooo proud of you!” And then she paused. “I always wondered how those banks made all that money.” I had no idea because my undergraduate macroeconomic classes were a heaping mess of Keynesian nonsense. They failed to mention things like money printing, interbank lending, and bailouts. I was about to get the education of my life. I remembered this episode fondly as I read that every major U.S. bank beat earnings estimates this quarter. JPM, MS, WFC, BAC, and GS shot the lights out. But the reasons why are no longer a mystery. After you read this piece, it won’t be a mystery to you, either. Sure, the Rothbardian reason that banks are closest to the money printer is still valid, perhaps more now than ever. And yes, during good times, CEOs idiotically decide to acquire or merge with another company in transactions that make money for white-shoed investment bankers, but not their shareholders. During bull markets, it’s almost impossible for banks’ sales and trading teams to lose money. That’s not even their doing. It’s their clients —the pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, endowment funds, and other asset managers—who want to hedge their bets. I’ll explain. Investment banks (the sell side) service asset managers, or the buy side. The buy-side is the people who take all of our assets and buy stuff, like stocks, bonds, commodities, and real estate. Asset managers are buyers of mammoth amounts of stock. That means they are constantly long. Of course, if they’re long, they always want the market to go up. And, yes, that is, for the most part, true. But we must keep two things in mind, only one of which is obvious. The obvious one is they don’t want violent downward moves, like the March 2020 Covid crash. The not-so-obvious point is that they also don’t tend to want the market to move too violently upwards, either. It’s like “quality of earnings.” A nice, steady increase is good enough for most of them. Of course, TSLA quadrupling is just fine and dandy. But asset managers would’ve certainly been at least partially hedged. So asset managers do two things to combat a precipitous fall or to prepare for a “sideways move” in the stock. Here they are: An asset manager will go to their investment banks and say to them, “Listen, I’m long this stock that has, say, appreciated 40% in the past year. I need to hold on to it because it’s part of my investment plan, but I’m worried about the downside. Can I please buy a put from you?” When you take a long stock position and combine it with a long put position, you have what’s called portfolio protection. It synthetically creates a long call option on the stock. This means you’re still exposed to the upside, which is great, but you no longer have any downside. The asset manager eliminated that downside by paying the option premium. The second scenario is this: a fund manager may be forced to own a stock that is not particularly good—a dog, in asset management parlance—a stock that hasn’t moved up in many years and doesn’t pay the best dividend in the world. But they have to hold it because it’s a part of their index or basket. So what fund managers often do is sell call options against those stocks. They are what we call covered call positions, and, synthetically, they are short puts. The asset manager will do this for a few reasons: If you’ve got fund managers who are both long puts and short calls, who are long those calls and short those puts? The investment banks are. They facilitate this trade, so they are synthetically long the stock market. How is that? The investment banks are the ones who buy the calls from the fund managers and sell the puts to the fund managers. A long call plus a short put is equal to a long stock position. We call this an “ax.” Who are the two most prominent investment banks in the United States? Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, occasionally known as Government Sachs. Other universal banks like Wells Fargo, JP Morgan, and Bank of America also participate. Now you can see why there is an implied upward bias in the markets. And, of course, vested interests don’t want the markets to come down. This gives credence to rumors of a plunge protection scheme and the “Fed put” that Alan Greenspan was famous for. BTFD takes on new meaning when you understand this state of affairs. But if you are someone who doesn’t have many assets yet, you’re waiting to get in on the action. And waiting, and waiting… You haven’t been exposed to the natural price deflation seen in economic cycles because banks, asset managers, the government, and the media have done their level best to eliminate deflation altogether. Guido Hülsmann, in his masterful essay Deflation and Liberty (page 26), gives us the exact reason why the vested interests will not yield to price depreciation: There is only one fundamental change that deflation brings about. It radically modifies the structure of ownership. Firms financed per credits go bankrupt because at the lower level of prices they can no longer pay back the credits they had incurred without anticipating the deflation. Private households with mortgages and other considerable debts to pay back go bankrupt, because with the decline of money prices their monetary income declines too whereas their debts remain at the nominal level. The very attempt to liquidate assets to pay back debt entails a further reduction of the value of those assets, thus making it even more difficult for them to come even with their creditors. The game may be rigged, but all you have to do to benefit like the banks is get long the market and stay long. Until the market finally, mercifully, turns.

Title: AVGO: Why Broadcom Stock Jumped 110%?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/17/avgo-why-broadcom-stock-jumped-110/
Time Published: 2025-10-17T12:45:26Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Broadcom (AVGO)’s stock didn’t merely rise - it soared over 100%, driven by more than just impressive figures. A nearly 10% increase in revenue and a remarkable 71% rise in net margin suggested enhanced efficiency, but the true excitement lay just beneath the surface. Investors are rallying around the company’s ambitious advancements in artificial intelligence, selling application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) — custom chips that big tech companies use to run AI workloads efficiently, besides supplying high-speed networking solutions. Buoyed by stronger-than-expected Q2 results and a wave of upward analyst revisions, Broadcom’s latest surge reflects not just growth, but a strategic evolution — making its stock’s rise a story worth watching. So what is going on here? The stock price surged an impressive 108%, fueled by a mix of significant factors. Revenue saw a modest increase of 9.9%, and the net margin experienced a notable rise of 71%, indicating enhanced profitability. In the meantime, the valuation, reflected by the P/E multiple, grew by 11%, pointing to increasing investor confidence. Collectively, these elements illustrate the reasons behind the price movement - creating the opportunity to examine the specific events, announcements, and strategic actions that contributed to this strong performance. Before delving into the events that contributed to the stock increase, here’s what market wisdom suggests: investing in a single stock can be risky, but there is significant value in a more diversified approach, exemplified by the Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Should you purchase one stock you prefer or develop a portfolio designed to thrive across market cycles? Our data reveal that the High Quality Portfolio has turned the uncertainty of stock selection into consistent market-beating performance. This portfolio is incorporated into the asset allocation strategy of Empirical Asset Management – a Boston-based wealth manager and Trefis partner – whose asset allocation framework generated positive returns during the 2008-09 period when the S&P experienced losses of more than 40%. Separately, see – S&P 500 Poised For A 40% Crash? Here Is Why Broadcom Stock Moved Our Current Assessment Of AVGO Stock Opinion: We currently consider AVGO stock appealing yet volatile. Why? Explore the full narrative. Read Buy or Sell AVGO Stock to understand what shapes our current viewpoint. Risk: Nevertheless, AVGO is not exempt from significant declines. It dropped nearly 48% during the Covid pandemic, around 35% during the inflation shock in 2021, and about 27% during the 2018 market correction. Even with strong fundamentals, it's evident that the stock can experience a sharp decline when the market shifts. Good companies still feel the impact when sentiment changes drastically. Consistently picking winners is a challenging endeavor – particularly given the volatility associated with individual stocks. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, has shown a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the past 4-year period. What accounts for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided superior returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; a smoother investment journey, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

October 17, 2025 08:45 ET | Source: 24/7 Market News and Kraig Labs 24/7 Market News and Kraig Labs DENVER, Oct. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 247marketnews.com, a pioneer in digital media dedicated to the swift distribution of financial market news and information, reports that, as the fashion industry confronts mounting pressure to overhaul its wasteful practices, Circular Fashion is emerging as both an ethical mandate and a massive economic opportunity. Kraig Biocraft Laboratories (OTCQB: KBLB), the undisputed global leader in the development and commercialization of spider silk, is positioning to be at the forefront of this transformation, offering a scalable, biodegradable alternative to petroleum-based fabrics that could reshape the $1.5 trillion global apparel industry. The Circular Economy’s Billion-Dollar Fashion Upside Circular fashion, a model that emphasizes durability, recyclability, and closed-loop systems, aims to eliminate the staggering 92 million tons of textile waste discarded globally each year. Analysts project the circular fashion market could grow to over $200 billion by 2030, driven by consumer demand, ESG mandates, and regulatory changes. Governments and major fashion houses alike are accelerating toward sustainability targets: Kraig Labs: Bioengineered Spider Silk for the Circular Age Kraig Labs’ recombinant spider silk, produced through proprietary silkworm-based biotechnology, offers a powerful solution for this new era. Unlike synthetic fibers derived from fossil fuels, spider silk is both biodegradable and renewable, while delivering extraordinary strength, elasticity, and breathability. The Kraig Labs spider silk platform will enable luxury and performance brands to meet sustainability mandates without sacrificing quality or performance and support an entirely new circular materials economy. By utilizing traditional silk production infrastructure and replacing the silk protein with engineered spider silk protein, Kraig Labs is able to offer a scalable and economically viable supply chain. This puts the company in a unique position to help apparel brands replace unsustainable materials like polyester, nylon, and conventional silk. Economic Impact: Premium Pricing Meets ESG Demand With the luxury fashion market expected to surpass $330 billion by 2030, and sustainable fashion already outpacing industry growth at large, spider silk could capture a significant slice of this fast-expanding segment: Circular fashion principles also open the door for take-back programs, rental models, and closed-loop recycling, where biodegradable spider silk garments could fully decompose or be re-engineered into new fibers, further boosting the sustainability narrative and lifecycle economics. KBLB: A Biomaterial Solution Whose Time Has Come Kraig Labs (OTCQB: KBLB) has already demonstrated success with its spider silk fibers, developed through years of R&D and protected by an extensive IP portfolio. As the company begins ramping up commercial-scale production, the timing aligns with fashion’s urgent pivot to circularity and transparency. Key catalysts include: As fashion shifts away from fast-disposable goods toward long-lasting, sustainable, and recyclable materials, Kraig Labs’ spider silk is emerging as a leading contender to define the future of circular fashion.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Although Advanced Micro Devices increased by 47% over the last month, its counterpart Nvidia could be the preferable option. Continuously assessing alternatives is essential to a robust investment strategy. NVIDIA (NVDA) stock presents outstanding revenue growth during critical periods, higher profitability, and comparatively lower valuation compared to Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock, indicating that investing in NVDA might be more advantageous. Investing in a single stock can be precarious, yet there is significant value in a broader diversified strategy we employ with the Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Trefis collaborates with Empirical Asset Management - a wealth manager from the Boston area - whose asset allocation strategies produced positive returns during the 2008-09 period when the S&P experienced declines exceeding 40%. Empirical has integrated the Trefis HQ Portfolio into this asset allocation framework to provide clients with improved returns while minimizing risk compared to the benchmark index; offering a less turbulent investment journey, as evidenced by the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Tech industry stalling as AI takes over, with junior roles cut in half

Graduate tech jobs are down 46% from last year When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. A new report from the Institute of Student Employers (ISE) has found that the UK tech industry has experienced a 46% drop in tech graduate jobs from 2024, and a further 53% drop projected in 2026. This probably won’t come as much of a shock to many, but recent tech graduates most likely have AI to blame for the dramatic decline in jobs on offer. After all, why train a junior worker for basic digital tasks, coding, or data analysis when you could ask AI to do it? The UK isn’t the only country suffering. Junior tech workers are in trouble across the world. The Stanford Digital Economy Lab released statistics confirming that entry level tech job postings are down 67% between 2023-2024, with a 13% drop in employment for 22-25 year-olds since AI arrived on the scene at the end of 2022. Tech jobs aren’t the only ones facing this issue. Employers reduced hiring by 8% in the last academic year (2024/2025), and another 7% is predicted for the coming year - but this figure focuses on responses from three large employers. “It is a tough market for students and young people in general. There is not much churn in the labour market and young people are suffering,” Stephen Isherwod, joint chief executive of ISE, told the Financial Times. The data suggests that organisations are simply focusing on hiring experienced workers, and cutting juniors out of the company structure as a cost saving measure, and to become more efficient. Whilst companies may see short-term gains with this strategy, it sets up a scenario for 10-20 years time when experienced professionals are set to retire, but no one has invested in training any juniors to take their place. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! But, unfortunately experienced workers at tech firms can’t necessarily relax, as tech firms have introduced multiple rounds of layoffs, including huge names like Amazon, Intel, and Microsoft all slashing significant chunks of its workforce.

The withdrawal contributed to a brutal Thursday across Bitcoin ETFs, which collectively bled $530.9 million, according to Farside Investors data. BlackRock's IBIT lost $29.5 million, Fidelity's FBTC dropped $132 million, and Grayscale's GBTC shed $45 million, pointing to a broad institutional retreat from Bitcoin exposure. The week proved punishing for Bitcoin products overall, with $858.7 million in net outflows and only Tuesday breaking the exodus with a single day of inflows. The exodus comes as markets continue to absorb shocks from President Donald Trump's 100% tariff announcement on China last Friday, which triggered the largest liquidation event in crypto history with $19 billion in leveraged positions wiped out within 24 hours. China on Thursday nodded openness to trade talks while accusing the U.S. of creating "panic" over Beijing's rare earth export controls, offering a potential off-ramp as both nations work toward a planned meeting between Trump and President Xi Jinping in South Korea later this month. "There is a short-medium term shift, especially post the comments on last Friday towards a more risk-off state, especially given market exuberance across risk assets and uncorrelated assets over the last few months," Ganesh Mahidhar, Investment Professional at Further Ventures, told Decrypt. The combination of the Ethereum-based USDe stablecoin’s depeg on Friday and a social media-driven boycott movement against Binance has pushed concerns about systemic risk back into focus, particularly at this stage of the post-halving Bitcoin cycle, he added. Despite managing just 50,000 BTC versus BlackRock's 800,000 and Fidelity's 210,000, ARKB "is generally one of the funds leading the charge" on outflow days, Sean Dawson, Head of Research at Derive, told Decrypt, adding how "ARK's holdings have held consistently in the 40-50K BTC since March 2024." ARK's fund sees "investors more frequently rotate in and out of BTC as a speculative asset" compared to BlackRock and Fidelity's vehicles, which house longer-term holders, he said. Whether the Bitcoin ETF outflow streak continues depends on upcoming catalysts, particularly the Federal Reserve's October 29 FOMC meeting and the ongoing Q3 earnings season, Mahidhar said. “Market exuberance needs to be supported by revenue and cash flow growth in U.S. markets — if that happens and the FOMC meeting goes well, we may see a staunching in the bleed out,” he noted. Bitcoin is trading at $104,629, down 6.3% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data, still nursing losses from the tariff-triggered crash.

Title: Will the AI Bubble Trigger a Financial Crisis?

Time Published: 2025-10-17T10:33:00Z

Experts might not expect a stock-market crash to cause a financial crisis, but what if they are wrong? With leverage built up in so many parts of the system and asset-price movements so closely correlated, the current US financial system looks like a tinder box just waiting for a spark to land on it. WASHINGTON, DC – OpenAI Co-Founder Sam Altman, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell have joined the chorus of people talking about an AI bubble and expressing concern that the US economy will nosedive when it bursts. But what would a post-bubble nosedive look like? Given the weakness in almost every other sector of the US economy, it could well mean a recession. Economic slumps come in many flavors, though, and the worst tend to follow from financial crises. Yet most experts (with a few exceptions) have not warned of the AI bubble causing a financial crisis. Instead, the conventional wisdom seems to be that if there is a recession, it will look more like the one that followed the dot-com bubble in 2000 than the one following the 2008 global financial crisis. History does provide some support for this view. One well known paper on bubbles and financial crises concludes that “the post-WW2 era appears to have weathered numerous equity price bubbles that did not turn into financial crisis episodes.” But the authors also note that equity-price bubbles can precipitate financial crises if they are fueled by borrowed money. After all, the Great Depression was preceded by a debt-fueled “roaring 20s” equity bubble. This matters because, as economist Noah Smith points out, banks are funding “private credit” funds that in turn are lending money to fund the data-center construction for an anticipated AI boom. Smith wonders whether we will see defaults on those construction loans when the AI bubble bursts, and whether private credit losses could cause a crisis for the banks that ultimately extended that credit. It is also worth pondering whether a bursting AI bubble could compromise the ability of other non-bank financial institutions to repay their loans. A recent JPMorgan analyst note on hedge-fund trading observes that concentration in the “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks (companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Nvidia) remains near historic highs. Yet the prices of these stocks are highly dependent on the companies’ AI ambitions. If they fall short of their goals, and prices come crashing down, highly leveraged hedge funds may be forced into fire sales, unloading stocks to meet margin calls or repay bank loans. And if those fire sales don’t fetch enough cash, the funds will default on their repayment obligations, potentially undermining the financial condition of the broker-dealers, primary dealers, and banks that extended them credit. Moreover, the same dynamics will also drive down the prices of tech stocks further, potentially forcing other leveraged financial institutions to sell off their portfolios, and so on. Nor should we assume that financial institutions desperate for cash will restrict themselves to selling off tech stocks. On the contrary, they may need – or prefer – to dump other types of assets, transmitting problems to other asset markets.

SUBSCRIBE NOW Such a scenario is not far-fetched. The Fed reports that hedge-fund leverage hit historically high levels in 2024, and in a September 2025 commentary, analyst Adam Josephson notes that “hedge fund borrowing/leverage [is] at a record high of $6.2 trillion, up more than 25% vs. a year ago at the end of March.” Specifically, outstanding margin loans from broker-dealers and repurchase agreements from primary dealers are at historically high levels. And bank lending (particularly lending by large banks) to non-bank financial institutions – including broker-dealers, primary dealers, and the hedge funds themselves – is also significantly elevated, with bank loans to NBFIs now accounting for “$1.7 trillion in bank loans, or 13% of loans outstanding.” Meanwhile, US financial regulators continue to permit this expansion of leverage, as well as greenlighting the integration of traditional financial markets with crypto markets (which are also rife with leverage). Despite narratives about Bitcoin and other crypto assets serving as a hedge against risks in other markets, their price movements are highly correlated with equities. Thus, we should expect to see crypto prices fall when the AI bubble bursts, and not just because of fire-sale dynamics. Both crypto and the AI bubble have been inflated by the same kinds of narratives about new technologies shattering old paradigms. If evidence of AI’s limitations starts to permeate the public consciousness during a market crash, more pessimistic sentiment on tech assets could well undermine crypto hype as well. This could then prompt a crash in Ponzi-like crypto assets such as Bitcoin, as well as runs on asset-backed stablecoins. If stablecoin issuers are forced to withdraw their cash reserves from banks, they could trigger a run on those institutions; and if they are forced to dump Treasuries from their reserves, another critically important financial market could be sucked into the maelstrom. Experts might not expect a stock-market crash to cause a financial crisis, but what if they are wrong? With leverage built up in so many parts of the system and asset-price movements so correlated, what if the financial system is a tinder box that could explode when the first spark lands on it? Of course, the financial system may well weather the bursting of the AI bubble, especially if the end arrives with a low hiss rather than a sudden bang. But we shouldn’t count on it.

Title: Axon Enterprise Stock Dropped 13% – Have You Assessed The Risk
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/17/axon-enterprise-stock-dropped-13--have-you-assessed-the-risk/
Time Published: 2025-10-17T10:02:17Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Axon Enterprise (AXON) stock has decreased by 13.3% over the course of 21 trading days. Do you already own this stock, or are you considering purchasing it? You may want to rethink your decision based on the valuation, as the stock appears expensive. Take a look at the following data: While we typically prefer to buy on dips if the fundamentals are sound – for AXON, see Buy or Sell AXON Stock – we also remain cautious about falling knives. Specifically, it's important to evaluate whether we can hold on to the stock if conditions worsen and AXON declines another 20-30% to around $457. What is the worst-case scenario? We refer to this as downturn resilience. It turns out that the stock has underperformed the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns. We measure this by considering (a) how much the stock declined and (b) how quickly it rebounded. AXON stock has suffered a significant decline recently, and we currently view it as relatively pricey. While this might seem like a buying opportunity, there are substantial risks associated with relying on one stock. Conversely, there is great value in the more diversified approach we advocate with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Trefis collaborates with Empirical Asset Management – a wealth manager situated in the Boston area – whose asset allocation strategies produced positive returns during the 2008-09 financial crisis when the S&P lost over 40%. Empirical has integrated the Trefis HQ Portfolio into this asset allocation framework to deliver improved returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; offering a smoother ride, as demonstrated by the HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Separately, see – S&P 500 Poised For A 40% Crash? Here are the details, but first, for some context: AXON provides conducted energy devices and hardware-software solutions for law enforcement to capture, store, manage, share, and analyze digital evidence globally. Concerned that AXON may drop further? You might explore the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which includes a selection of 30 stocks that have consistently outperformed its benchmark, encompassing all three – the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. What accounts for this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded improved returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; resulting in a smoother ride, as is clear from the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: META Appears To Be A More Attractive Buy Compared To Alphabet Stock
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/17/meta-appears-to-be-a-more-attractive-buy-compared-to-alphabet-stock/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. META is Alphabet's counterpart within the Interactive Media & Services sector that possesses: 1) A lower valuation (P/OpInc) in comparison to Alphabet stock2) Yet higher revenue and operating income growth This disparity between valuation and performance could suggest that investing in META stock is more advantageous than purchasing GOOGL stock Investing in individual stocks can be precarious, but there is significant value in adopting a broader diversified strategy as we do with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Trefis collaborates with Empirical Asset Management – a wealth management firm in the Boston area – which has implemented asset allocation strategies yielding positive returns during the 2008-09 timeframe when the S&P declined over 40%. Empirical has integrated the Trefis HQ Portfolio into this asset allocation strategy to deliver improved returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; providing a smoother investment experience, as shown in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Separately, see – S&P 500 Poised For A 40% Crash? OpInc = Operating Income, P/OpInc = Price To Operating Income Ratio Do these figures, however, encompass the entire picture? Read Buy or Sell GOOGL Stock to determine if Alphabet still possesses an advantage that remains viable beneath the surface. For context, Alphabet (GOOGL) offers a variety of products and services, including advertising, Android, Chrome, hardware, cloud solutions, health technology, and internet services across diverse markets. This is merely one method for assessing investments. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio conducts a more comprehensive evaluation and is designed to mitigate stock-specific risks while providing potential growth opportunities. A method to evaluate whether Alphabet stock is currently overpriced compared to other tickers would involve examining how these metrics compared among companies exactly one year ago. Specifically, if there has been a notable trend reversal for Alphabet over the past 12 months, then the ongoing disparity may likely reverse. Conversely, sustained underperformance in revenue and operating income growth for Alphabet would reinforce the notion that its stock is overpriced relative to its competitors but might not revert soon. OpInc = Operating Income Considering buying based on valuation, while appealing, must be assessed thoroughly from various perspectives. This multi-faceted evaluation is precisely how we develop Trefis portfolio strategies. If you desire potential gains with a more stable journey than an individual stock offers, explore the High Quality portfolio, which has surpassed the S&P, delivering over 91% returns since its inception.

Title: BlackRock Plans Tokenization as IBIT Surpasses $100B in AUM and $HYPER’s Presale Reaches $23.9M
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-tokenization-bitcoin-etf-100b-hyper-surges/
Time Published: 2025-10-17T09:02:28Z
Full Content:
Quick Facts: 1️⃣ BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF IBIT surpassed $100B less than two years after its release on January 11, 2024. 2️⃣ Larry Fink announced a long-term plan to tokenize all assets, from funds to stocks and cash. 3️⃣ Fink argues that bubbles don’t impact long-term investors and that time in the market outweighs opportunistic buy-ins. 4️⃣ Bitcoin’s Layer 2 project, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) reaches $23.9M in presale and eyes a Q1 2026 release. BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) just surpassed $100B in assets under management (AUM), which prompted CEO Larry Fink to announce the company’s tokenization plans. Fink made the comments during a CNBC interview, where he said: I do believe we’re just at the beginning of tokenization of all assets, from real estate to equities to bonds, across the board. —Larry Fink, CNBC Interview This comes over a year and a half after BlackRock launched its first tokenized fund, BUIDL, on the Ethereum network by partnering with Securitize. In the official press release, Securitize’s co-founder and CEO, Carlos Domingo, said that BUIDL proves that tokenization is essentially unstoppable and that it will transform the capital market. With over $1T in AUM, BlackRock’s decision to invest in tokenization tech stems from Bitcoin’s and Ethereum’s success, especially amid 2025’s rampant adoption wave. This spells good news for Bitcoin Hyper’s ($HYPER) $23.9M presale which feeds Bitcoin’s coming Layer 2 with a projected Q1 2026 public launch. Fink believes that asset tokenization is imminent and the key step to attracting digital investors into the TradFi market, which pack more unpopular products like retirement funds. The overarching goal is to allow investors to hold multiple assets together, including funds, cash, and cryptos, which would represent a turning point for the capital market as a whole. To that end, Fink pushes for ‘time in the market,’ as opposed to opportunistic buy-ins, as an anti-bubble strategy. As he sees it, it’s only opportunistic buyers who push the notion of financial bubbles due to their short time in the market. This doesn’t happen with long-term investors who ride the bubbles to follow the larger trend. If you put money to work on January 1st, 2000, a year later you had the Dot Com crysis, six years later you had the financial crisis, you had the COVID crysis; you still would’ve made 8% compound interest over the entire 25 years. It’s not about if our markets are going up or down […] it’s about being in the market for the entire cycle. —Larry Fink, CNBC interview The same mindset applies to the digital market and Bitcoin is the living proof of that. While opportunistic snipers often find themselves in hot waters – last Friday’s market crash anyone? – long-term investors who bought $BTC in 2011 are now up 169,000,000%. Bitcoin’s recent performance only adds to that. $BTC now trades at just under $106K after a 13.7% drop over the last week, which is painful for leverage traders, but neutral for long-term investors, because Bitcoin will eventually bounce back. Especially with Bitcoin Hyper just around the corner. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) aims to address Bitcoin’s most pressing problem: its performance limitation. With a hard cap of seven transactions per second (TPS), Bitcoin currently ranks 22nd on the list of the fastest blockchains by TPS. This translates to slow confirmation times, high fees, and lack of scalability. Hyper relies on tools like the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) and the Canonical Bridge to change that. Once the Bitcoin Relay Program confirms incoming transactions in milliseconds, the Bridge then mints the bitcoins on the Hyper layer, allowing you to use the wrapped assets with near-instant finality within the Layer 2 ecosystem. Long-term, Hyper aims to turn Bitcoin into a more feasible option for institutional investors by making the network faster, cheaper, and more scalable. The project is seeing outstanding investor support, managing to reach $23.9M since its beginning and it’s still growing fast. $HYPER is available right now at the presale price of $0.013125, which could be the lowest you could ever buy the token at. Long-term investments, remember? If you want to get in while you still can, check our guide on how to buy $HYPER and visit the presale page today. Join the $HYPER presale here.

Title: AIP, MGX, BlackRock’s GIP consortium to buy Aligned for $40bn

A consortium consisting of the Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure Partnership (AIP), MGX, and BlackRock’s Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) has agreed to acquire Aligned Data Centers for an enterprise value of around $40bn. The deal will help increase the scale of next-generation cloud and AI infrastructure. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more Experience unmatched clarity with a single platform that combines unique data, AI, and human expertise. Find out more Aligned’s current owners Macquarie Asset Management (MAM) and its co-investment partners will sell their entire equity stake. In an interview with Reuters, MAM head Ben Way said the sale “was not a warning sign for the sector or AI”. Way was quoted by the news agency as saying: “We don’t own businesses in perpetuity, we have owned this for seven years and it’s at a great spot to exit and there’s clearly massive demand to exit.” The acquisition is AIP’s first investment as it pursues its goal to deploy $30bn in equity capital, with a longer-term target that could reach $100bn when including debt. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. Aligned Data Centers operates hyperscale and enterprise data centres and currently manages a portfolio of 50 campuses and over 5GW of operational and planned capacity. Its facilities are located in major digital gateway regions in the US and Latin America, including Chicago, Dallas, Northern Virginia, Ohio, Phoenix, Salt Lake City, Santiago, Sao Paulo and Queretaro. Aligned will continue to be led by CEO Andrew Schaap and its current executive team from its Dallas headquarters following acquisition. Schaap said: “Partnering with the consortium will accelerate our mission to deliver the infrastructure powering tomorrow’s digital economy. “With AIP, MGX, and GIP’s global reach, extensive resources, and deep expertise across AI, energy, and finance, we are poised to scale faster, innovate further, and redefine what’s possible in sustainable data centre infrastructure.” Since Macquarie Asset Management’s initial investment in 2018 via Macquarie Infrastructure Partners IV, and an increased stake through Macquarie Infrastructure Partners V in 2020, Aligned has expanded from two facilities with 85MW of capacity to its current scale. The company introduced both green securitisation and sustainability-linked financing models to the data centre sector during this period. The acquisition is intended to provide Aligned with capital and resources required to expand its presence and meet demand for high-density, scalable compute infrastructure. The consortium’s investment brings operational experience across AI infrastructure deployment and management. AIP chairman and BlackRock chairman and CEO Larry Fink said: “AIP is positioned to meet the growing demand for the infrastructure required as AI continues to reshape the global economy. “This partnership is bringing together leading companies and mobilising private capital to accelerate AI innovation and drive global economic growth and productivity.” Subject to regulatory clearance and standard closing requirements, the deal is expected to be completed in the first half of 2026. AIP was established by BlackRock, GIP, MGX, Microsoft, and Nvidia, with the objective of scaling AI infrastructure capacity. The partnership’s primary financial backers include the Kuwait Investment Authority and Temasek.

Business Shares in Ray-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica rose 14 per cent to hit an all-time high on Friday, adding nearly $20 billion in market value as investor enthusiasm for its AI-powered Ray-Ban Meta glasses gathered momentum. The Paris-listed group, founded by late Italian entrepreneur Leonardo Del Vecchio and a possible contender in the race to buy fashion group Armani, reported on Thursday third-quarter sales growth of 11.7 per cent from a year ago to 6.9 billion euros ($8.1 billion). The results beat expectations and marked the company's best quarterly performance ever amid strong demand for wearable products such as the smart glasses it has been developing with Meta since before the pandemic. Even though the smart glasses business has until now accounted for only a fraction of EssilorLuxottica's total revenue, it has become a focal point for analysts and investors, as well as a catalyst for the company's investments.

Title: 'Non-Productive' Gold Zooms to $30T Market Cap, Leaving Bitcoin, Nvidia, Apple, Google Far Behind
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/10/17/non-productive-gold-zooms-to-usd30t-market-cap-leaving-bitcoin-nvidia-apple-google-far-behind
Time Published: 2025-10-17T05:54:34Z
Full Content:
Gold (XAU), a traditional store of value but also a "non-productive" asset, has surged to a market capitalization exceeding $30 trillion in 2025, dwarfing digital gold, bitcoin, and U.S.-listed tech giants alike. The yellow metal's price per ounce has surged 66% to a record high of approximately $4,380, with prices rising 13% in October alone, according to TradingView data. This rally has pushed gold's market capitalization to about $30.42 trillion, based on an estimated above-ground global supply of 216,265 metric tonnes, as reported by the World Gold Council. Nvidia (NVDA), arguably the most consequential company globally due to its foundational role in powering the AI revolution, holds a distant second place with a market capitalization of $4.42 trillion. It is followed by Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (Google), silver, Amazon (AMZN). Meanwhile, bitcoin BTC$108,746.91, considered digital gold, ranked eighth with a market cap of $2.17 trillion. Gold's premium to tech giants doesn't necessarily reflect a positive outlook for the global economy because it is a non-productive asset. Unlike stocks, bonds, or real estate, gold does not generate dividends, interest, or rent, nor does it contribute directly to economic activity. Its price is directly tied to its appeal as a traditional safe haven and store of value asset as opposed to underlying cash flow or productive output. So, the fact that it trades at a significant premium to the most valuable tech companies is likely a telltale sign of economic malaise. It indicates that investors are seeking refuge in perceived safe havens amid broader economic uncertainty. Ken Griffin, CEO of Citadel, recently expressed significant concern over the trend of investors viewing gold as a safer asset than the U.S. dollar, calling the yellow metal's record rally as cautionary signal about the U.S. economy's stability. According to analysis, the rally has been catalyzed by fiscal imprudence in the U.S. and across the advanced world, sticky inflation, geopolitical tensions and expectations for the Fed rate cuts. The consensus is for the uptrend to continue. Features that describe gold as a non-productive store of value also apply to bitcoin. However, while gold's price has rallied sharply this year, surging over 60%, bitcoin has gained a more modest 16% in 2025. Industry observers are optimistic that when the gold rally eventually cools, investment funds may rotate into the relatively cheaper digital store of value.

Title: Bitcoin must upgrade or fall victim to quantum computing attack in 5 years

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/16/2025 9:30:56 PM PDT by SeekAndFind Unless Bitcoin upgrades its core cryptography in the next five years, the trust it has built over 16 years could be wiped out by a single quantum attack. Urgent upgrades are needed to protect the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Satoshi Nakamoto changed how we define money. In response to the 2008 collapse of the financial institutions in which millions put their trust, Satoshi created a decentralized monetary system built on elliptic curve cryptography. This combination of cold math and decentralization was a powerful one, attracting not only diehard skeptics but also the world’s largest financial institutions, such as BlackRock. In the 16 years of its existence, Bitcoin has never been hacked. All of that is about to change very soon, however, with the advent of quantum computing. This is the biggest single threat to Bitcoin since its inception from the ashes of the global financial crisis. Once firmly in the realm of science fiction, quantum computers have become so advanced that they could plausibly rip through Bitcoin’s cryptography within five years or less. Some, like quantum pundit Michele Mosca, predict it might even be possible as soon as next year. Government agencies like the US National Institute of Standards and Technology and the National Security Agency are aiming to fully transition to quantum-secure standards by 2030. Yet the Bitcoin community appears confined to theoretical solutions, like BIP-360 (Pay-to-Quantum-Resistant-Hash) or commit-delay-reveal schemes. The time for theorizing is over. If concrete steps to adapt the Bitcoin blockchain aren’t taken now, Bitcoin’s entire $2.2-trillion market cap could go up in smoke. All it would take would be one compromised wallet or botched transaction to erode 16 years of painstakingly built trust. The rise of supercomputers This year’s real breakthrough was Microsoft’s Majorana chip, which accelerated the timeline to creating a truly useful quantum supercomputer from decades to years. In simple terms, it did so by paving the way to scalable and stable quantum systems — two of the key issues standing in the way of this technological miracle. Fast forward a few months, and we currently find ourselves with around 100 quantum computers operating in the world already. McKinsey estimates there will be 5,000 by 2030. These computers aren’t just faster than the machines we’re all used to — they’re an entirely new breed of computer that runs calculations in parallel instead of in sequence. This is lethal to classical cryptography, like the ECDSA algorithm that protects Bitcoin’s private keys. At least 30% of Bitcoin, or around 6.2 million coins, are currently sitting in pay-to-public-key (P2PK) or reused P2PK-hash addresses, which are particularly vulnerable to this quantum threat. A breach would be catastrophic for holders, whose funds would be gone forever, and the ecosystem at large. It would prove that the unbreakable system can be broken. That’s why BlackRock recently acknowledged the threat of quantum to Bitcoin in its updated spot ETF filing. That’s why the time to act is now, before it’s too late. Prepping for Q-Day “Q-Day” is the term given to the day that quantum computers are finally ready to break traditional cryptography. When this day comes, Bitcoin transactions validated and secured today, or even 10 years ago, could still be vulnerable because blockchain is fully transparent, and the data remains permanently accessible on this ledger forever. On top of this, bad actors are already collecting encrypted data in preparation for Q-Day, in a move dubbed “harvest now, decrypt later.” It wouldn’t be unreasonable to assume that several attacks could happen simultaneously across the globe when Q-Day comes. When this happens, Bitcoin better be ready. A post-quantum future The problem with upgrading an entire blockchain from legacy to post-quantum cryptography is that it would require a hard fork, which has become almost a taboo subject in crypto communities. This huge step could break the UX, fragment liquidity, risk splitting the network and potentially alienate diehard OGs. There are alternatives: hybrid solutions that focus on securing transactions first and foremost without touching the base layer, layered security models and quantum-secure key management, and infrastructure that can prepare Bitcoin for the onslaught that is certainly coming. It isn’t a quick fix. Especially considering how conservative and slow-moving Bitcoin has been historically. Unfortunately, there is no longer any time to waste. Decisions must be made and solutions must be chosen because Bitcoin won’t survive as it is in a post-quantum future. Satoshi gave the world a new monetary system but never said it couldn’t evolve. Now it’s up to the community to make the choice to evolve it and prepare for Q-Day, rather than waiting until it’s too late. It’s not quantum that’s the most significant risk to Bitcoin — it’s complacency.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Once firmly in the realm of science fiction, quantum computers have become so advanced that they could plausibly rip through Bitcoin’s cryptography within five years or less. Some, like quantum pundit Michele Mosca, predict it might even be possible as soon as next year. Government agencies like the US National Institute of Standards and Technology and the National Security Agency are aiming to fully transition to quantum-secure standards by 2030. Yet the Bitcoin community appears confined to theoretical solutions, like BIP-360 (Pay-to-Quantum-Resistant-Hash) or commit-delay-reveal schemes. The time for theorizing is over. If concrete steps to adapt the Bitcoin blockchain aren’t taken now, Bitcoin’s entire $2.2-trillion market cap could go up in smoke. All it would take would be one compromised wallet or botched transaction to erode 16 years of painstakingly built trust. The rise of supercomputers This year’s real breakthrough was Microsoft’s Majorana chip, which accelerated the timeline to creating a truly useful quantum supercomputer from decades to years. In simple terms, it did so by paving the way to scalable and stable quantum systems — two of the key issues standing in the way of this technological miracle. Fast forward a few months, and we currently find ourselves with around 100 quantum computers operating in the world already. McKinsey estimates there will be 5,000 by 2030. These computers aren’t just faster than the machines we’re all used to — they’re an entirely new breed of computer that runs calculations in parallel instead of in sequence. This is lethal to classical cryptography, like the ECDSA algorithm that protects Bitcoin’s private keys. At least 30% of Bitcoin, or around 6.2 million coins, are currently sitting in pay-to-public-key (P2PK) or reused P2PK-hash addresses, which are particularly vulnerable to this quantum threat. A breach would be catastrophic for holders, whose funds would be gone forever, and the ecosystem at large. It would prove that the unbreakable system can be broken. That’s why BlackRock recently acknowledged the threat of quantum to Bitcoin in its updated spot ETF filing. That’s why the time to act is now, before it’s too late. Prepping for Q-Day “Q-Day” is the term given to the day that quantum computers are finally ready to break traditional cryptography. When this day comes, Bitcoin transactions validated and secured today, or even 10 years ago, could still be vulnerable because blockchain is fully transparent, and the data remains permanently accessible on this ledger forever. On top of this, bad actors are already collecting encrypted data in preparation for Q-Day, in a move dubbed “harvest now, decrypt later.” It wouldn’t be unreasonable to assume that several attacks could happen simultaneously across the globe when Q-Day comes. When this happens, Bitcoin better be ready. A post-quantum future The problem with upgrading an entire blockchain from legacy to post-quantum cryptography is that it would require a hard fork, which has become almost a taboo subject in crypto communities. This huge step could break the UX, fragment liquidity, risk splitting the network and potentially alienate diehard OGs. There are alternatives: hybrid solutions that focus on securing transactions first and foremost without touching the base layer, layered security models and quantum-secure key management, and infrastructure that can prepare Bitcoin for the onslaught that is certainly coming. It isn’t a quick fix. Especially considering how conservative and slow-moving Bitcoin has been historically. Unfortunately, there is no longer any time to waste. Decisions must be made and solutions must be chosen because Bitcoin won’t survive as it is in a post-quantum future. Satoshi gave the world a new monetary system but never said it couldn’t evolve.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The rise of supercomputers This year’s real breakthrough was Microsoft’s Majorana chip, which accelerated the timeline to creating a truly useful quantum supercomputer from decades to years. In simple terms, it did so by paving the way to scalable and stable quantum systems — two of the key issues standing in the way of this technological miracle. Fast forward a few months, and we currently find ourselves with around 100 quantum computers operating in the world already. McKinsey estimates there will be 5,000 by 2030. These computers aren’t just faster than the machines we’re all used to — they’re an entirely new breed of computer that runs calculations in parallel instead of in sequence. This is lethal to classical cryptography, like the ECDSA algorithm that protects Bitcoin’s private keys. At least 30% of Bitcoin, or around 6.2 million coins, are currently sitting in pay-to-public-key (P2PK) or reused P2PK-hash addresses, which are particularly vulnerable to this quantum threat. A breach would be catastrophic for holders, whose funds would be gone forever, and the ecosystem at large. It would prove that the unbreakable system can be broken. That’s why BlackRock recently acknowledged the threat of quantum to Bitcoin in its updated spot ETF filing. That’s why the time to act is now, before it’s too late. Prepping for Q-Day “Q-Day” is the term given to the day that quantum computers are finally ready to break traditional cryptography. When this day comes, Bitcoin transactions validated and secured today, or even 10 years ago, could still be vulnerable because blockchain is fully transparent, and the data remains permanently accessible on this ledger forever. On top of this, bad actors are already collecting encrypted data in preparation for Q-Day, in a move dubbed “harvest now, decrypt later.” It wouldn’t be unreasonable to assume that several attacks could happen simultaneously across the globe when Q-Day comes. When this happens, Bitcoin better be ready. A post-quantum future The problem with upgrading an entire blockchain from legacy to post-quantum cryptography is that it would require a hard fork, which has become almost a taboo subject in crypto communities. This huge step could break the UX, fragment liquidity, risk splitting the network and potentially alienate diehard OGs. There are alternatives: hybrid solutions that focus on securing transactions first and foremost without touching the base layer, layered security models and quantum-secure key management, and infrastructure that can prepare Bitcoin for the onslaught that is certainly coming. It isn’t a quick fix. Especially considering how conservative and slow-moving Bitcoin has been historically. Unfortunately, there is no longer any time to waste. Decisions must be made and solutions must be chosen because Bitcoin won’t survive as it is in a post-quantum future. Satoshi gave the world a new monetary system but never said it couldn’t evolve. Now it’s up to the community to make the choice to evolve it and prepare for Q-Day, rather than waiting until it’s too late. It’s not quantum that’s the most significant risk to Bitcoin — it’s complacency.

When this day comes, Bitcoin transactions validated and secured today, or even 10 years ago, could still be vulnerable because blockchain is fully transparent, and the data remains permanently accessible on this ledger forever. On top of this, bad actors are already collecting encrypted data in preparation for Q-Day, in a move dubbed “harvest now, decrypt later.” It wouldn’t be unreasonable to assume that several attacks could happen simultaneously across the globe when Q-Day comes. When this happens, Bitcoin better be ready. A post-quantum future The problem with upgrading an entire blockchain from legacy to post-quantum cryptography is that it would require a hard fork, which has become almost a taboo subject in crypto communities. This huge step could break the UX, fragment liquidity, risk splitting the network and potentially alienate diehard OGs. There are alternatives: hybrid solutions that focus on securing transactions first and foremost without touching the base layer, layered security models and quantum-secure key management, and infrastructure that can prepare Bitcoin for the onslaught that is certainly coming. It isn’t a quick fix. Especially considering how conservative and slow-moving Bitcoin has been historically. Unfortunately, there is no longer any time to waste. Decisions must be made and solutions must be chosen because Bitcoin won’t survive as it is in a post-quantum future. Satoshi gave the world a new monetary system but never said it couldn’t evolve. Now it’s up to the community to make the choice to evolve it and prepare for Q-Day, rather than waiting until it’s too late. It’s not quantum that’s the most significant risk to Bitcoin — it’s complacency.

Now it’s up to the community to make the choice to evolve it and prepare for Q-Day, rather than waiting until it’s too late. It’s not quantum that’s the most significant risk to Bitcoin — it’s complacency. Gold and silver are not hackable. Real stores of value for millenia. I’ve read some stuff that says we have already reached Q-day. The govt will hold it back until they can unleash it so they are in control. Q-day will change the world. Nothing will be safe. The Russians have already started going back to pre computer days for some of their most secretive stuff. Back to paper and physical couriers. It’s coming. Or may alaresdy be here. The govt would definitely hold this info back. Could anyone here imagine how the general population would react if they knew none of our info was safe. Nothing. The banking system would collapse overnight. Entire banking system is vulnerable. Social Security is vulnerable. All pensions are vulnerable Timelines (credible but not guarantees) • IBM publicly projects a first large-scale fault-tolerant system before decade’s end; Google says commercial apps could appear within ~5 years, while others (e.g., Nvidia’s CEO) argue it’s more like 15–20 years—illustrating genuine uncertainty. ￼ • Independent market analyses expect meaningful economic impact through the 2030s if the tech keeps advancing. ￼ Bitcoin can be upgraded—without breaking backwards compatibility—to add post-quantum (PQ) protections, and there are already concrete proposals on the table. The idea is to introduce new address/script types that verify PQ (or hybrid PQ+Schnorr) signatures, then let users move coins into those addresses. That can be done via a soft fork. ￼ How it would work • Add PQ signatures to Script/Taproot. Two well-discussed paths are (a) re-adding OP_CAT so wallets can use Lamport / hash-based signatures in Taproot script paths; or (b) a dedicated opcode (e.g., “OP_SPHINCS”) to verify SPHINCS+ (hash-based) signatures directly. Both are soft-forkable and let funds hide a PQ spend path today, then use it when needed. ￼ • New “quantum-resistant” addresses. BIP-360 (P2QRH) proposes address types that use NIST-standard PQ signatures (e.g., Dilithium or SPHINCS+), optionally in hybrid mode with current Schnorr, so the network can migrate gradually. ￼ • Standards exist. NIST finalized PQC standards in 2024 (FIPS 203/204/205), including CRYSTALS-Dilithium and SPHINCS+ for signatures—natural candidates for Bitcoin if/when adopted. ￼ And we are just five years from flying cars, too.

Title: Diane Keaton, Her Own Brand; Jennifer Meyer Jewelry at 20; Spring 2026 Runway Accessories to Try Now
URL: https://www.thewrap.com/diane-keaton-her-own-brand-jennifer-meyer-jewelry-at-20-spring-2026-runway-accessories-to-try-now/
Time Published: 2025-10-17T01:30:00Z
Full Content:
WrapStyle: Diane Keaton was not defined by any fashion brand, she was her own Diane Keaton was not defined by any fashion brand, she was her own. Jennifer Meyer’s trailblazing L.A. jewelry business at 20. Moncler’s epic Robert De Niro and Al Pacino campaign. Spring 2026 runway accessories to try now and Native American designer Jamie Okuma’s must-have moccasins. Diane Keaton had personal style the likes of which we may never see again, not just because she was a singular creative, but because of the celebrity-fashion industrial complex we’re now living in. Keaton, who died Saturday, showed that there could be power in covering up, even in Hollywood; made androgyny approachable and whimsical; and later found a distinctive uniform that was eccentric yet controlled — structured suits, turtlenecks, long skirts and coats, gloves, hats and wide belts in black and white. Although she wore designer clothing over the years — Ralph Lauren, Giorgio Armani and Thom Browne, to name a few — and modeled in a J.Crew campaign, Keaton wasn’t defined by any one brand. She was her own. If you can find it (it’s sold out nearly everywhere now), Keaton’s coffee table book “Fashion First” explains how she started experimenting with clothing from an early age, often altering Goodwill finds, then eased into her 1970s style with “Annie Hall,” before finding her uniform in the 2000s. It covers the what and the how of her style, but sadly is light on the why. Still, it’s full of fun photos, some of them hilariously annotated. “Someone please help me!” Keaton writes of a 1980s fashion don’t. There were no stylists, no glam squads, just her. And she owned it, for better or worse. The fashion scene in Los Angeles certainly has changed over the last two decades. Back in 2005, magazines like Us Weekly and In Touch were the chroniclers of celebrity style and the engines of discovery for brands. Jewelry designer Jennifer Meyer was perfectly suited to harness the power of Hollywood having grown up in it as the daughter of industry vet Ronald Meyer. Celebrating 20 years in business, she threw a party last week to celebrate her relaxed brand of luxury jewelry to layer and live in, and there was so much good will, even her ex Tobey Maguire showed up. The crowd mingling over wine and canapés in Meyer’s Brentwood home was a testament to how much L.A. has grown into a fashion business capital, with Erin and Sara Foster (Favorite Daughter), Tina Chen Craig (U Beauty) and Andrea Lieberman (A.L.C.) among those who have built brands here by tapping into L.A.’s entertainment and creator economy. “When she had this idea, I remember thinking, OK, good luck,” Sara Foster said. “She’d sit in the back office of her house all day designing and bagging samples. And then it just snowballed. I don’t wear her jewelry because she’s my best friend of 25 years, I wear her jewelry because you can sleep in it, but you also get stopped in the street because someone is desperate to know what that piece is. That’s the sign of a real jewelry designer.” Meyers’ first celebrity fan was Jennifer Aniston, who wore her Gold Leaf necklace in the 2006 film “The Break-Up.” “It didn’t break the Internet because the Internet wasn’t booming. But it broke Us Weekly and InStyle and from there, she wore all kinds of pieces I couldn’t keep in [stock],” Meyer said. “Courtney Cox’s hoop earrings were in InStyle, which came out monthly then. People were just waiting for it so they could see what to buy,” she said of early-aughts tabloid fashion culture. Meyer’s 18-karat Good Luck charm, which features all the good luck symbols—an elephant, evil eye, Om, horseshoe, four-leaf clover, and heart—has been another key piece, worn by Rihanna, Alicia Keys and many guests at the party as well. “Sometimes people come up to me on the street to tell me about their good luck, how they gave it to their daughter and she got pregnant, all these great stories,” Meyer said. Still, she’s as surprised as anyone to still be at it. “I invested hardly any money, there was no overhead, so the risk was minimal. And I wasn’t scared,” Meyer said of starting out. “I was just thinking you know what, let’s see how this goes and suddenly it’s 20 years later.” Next year, she’s looking forward to reopening her store at Palisades Village. “I can’t wait to bring business back,” she said. “L.A. is an amazing community, and we really come together, especially when people are in need.” One of the biggest trends from the Spring 2026 runways was, in fact, jewelry, which seems strategic during an economic slowdown. Costume jewelry typically has lower price points than apparel and leather goods which could help draw in some of the aspirational shoppers that have been fleeing luxury brands in recent years, scared away by relentless price hikes. I love getting a jump on the next season by shopping things in my closet, on The RealReal, or wherever, and mimicking runway looks. A white button-down shirt, à la Chanel, has already been moved to the front of my closet. I’m also ready to dive back into my jewelry box like it’s the early 2010s, when Jenna Lyons at J.Crew and Michelle Obama in the White House were setting the trend with statement pieces. One thing I’ve already dusted off is a 1980s enamel and rhinestone bow-shaped brooch I bought at the Paris flea market. Inspired by Tory Burch’s runway styling (see above), I pinned it to the collar of a polo sweater. Dig up those island souvenirs, too, because Burch also had a ton of seashell pendant necklaces, also seen at Ralph Lauren, Michael Kors, Versace and Dries Van Noten. This Celine tailored “neckmess” as they say, is already one of the most shared Spring 2026 images on fashion Substack. I love the juxtaposition of the global beads and the white suit jacket, and it’s easy to replicate. Silk scarves were also a fun trend at Celine, as seen below. “Why don’t you tie one to your leather-bound agenda?” as Diana Vreeland would say. For the first time in a while, Hermès sent its famous (and relatively affordable) silk scarves down the runway, styled in several ways, including at the neck intertwined with diamond necklaces—a look I plan to try with a thin chain. The luxury brand also showed a scarf bag, which has to cost less than a Birkin, right? Statement earrings are back too—the bigger, the better—from chandeliers at Saint Laurent to vintage-style flower clip-ons at Chloé. At Balmain, ropes of shell beads blurred the line between necklace and top in the coolest way. All of it converged in the Chanel collection where the fire coral necklace was a favorite. Brooches, big earrings and ropes of beads were here, too. The message? Just start piling it on, you can’t go wrong. Speaking of Chanel, newly-minted ambassador Ayo Edebiri has already stepped out in one of the best looks from designer Matthieu Blazy’s Spring 2026 runway debut. She wore the gown (with a slight modification, the bow moved to the other shoulder) to the premiere of “After the Hunt” in London and looked like a dream. In other brand news, fans of Maria Grazia Chiuri’s feminist-centered, commercially-minded work at Dior can now follow her to Fendi. Ending months of speculation, the designer is heading home to Rome as the new chief creative officer for the Roman fashion house. There are so few female directors of luxury houses, so it’s good to see her back at the top. We’ll see if she can strike gold twice at a Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy-owned brand—and how similar or different her vision will be from Dior to Fendi. With Jonathan Anderson’s Dior skewing much younger, it could be an opportunity for Fendi to pick up the lost Dior generation. In one of the all-time best celebrity campaigns, Robert De Niro and Al Pacino are now modeling for uber-luxe outerwear brand Moncler. Titled “Warmer Together,” the campaign features the Hollywood titans, who have been friends for 50 years, wearing Moncler puffers in cinematic black-and-white photos by Platon, including the choice shot above of the duo gazing at the Manhattan skyline. The advertising blitz includes photos and short films, and is running across outdoor, web and social, so you’ll be seeing a lot of it. There is also a newly recorded rendition of Bill Withers’ “Lean on Me” by Moncler ambassador Tobe Nwigwe, as part of the campaign. Pacino and De Niro have appeared in multiple films together throughout their long friendship, including “The Godfather: Part II,” “Righteous Kill,” “The Irishman” and more. “Warmth was never about the outside. It was always about what was happening on the inside,” De Niro says in the teaser film, his voice like a warm cup of cocoa on a winter day. “Friendship is the greatest thing you can have,” Pacino adds. Getting these two together is a flex for CEO Remo Ruffini and Moncler, which saw more than $1 billion in revenue in the first half of 2025. The born-in-the-Alps brand has been looking to the U.S. for growth and will show its Fall 2026 collection in the Hollywood winter haven of Aspen on Jan. 31, 2026. It’s sure to be celeb-packed: Moncler’s last show in snowy Courchevel drew dozens of stars, including Jessica Chastain, Adrien Brody and Anne Hathaway. Native American fashion designer Jamie Okuma has dressed Lily Gladstone and Jessica Matten for the red carpet, is a finalist for the 2025 CFDA Vogue Fashion Fund and her work is in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Smithsonian’s National Museum of the American Indian among other institutions. Now, fresh off her New York Fashion Week debut, Okuma has a new collaboration offering a taste of her museum-worthy beadwork at an accessible price point. The gorgeous Manitobah x Jamie Okuma Modern Moc Chukkas ($260) are decorated with floral beadwork designed by Okuma, who is Shoshone-Bannock and Luiseno based in La Jolla, Calif. The design is inspired by her grandmother’s artistry (there’s a long line of creative gifts in the family; Jamie’s mom, Sandra Okuma, is also a renowned artist) and the traditional styles of her tribes in the Great Basin and Plateau regions. Manitobah is a Métis-founded Canadian shoe company that has funneled more than $1 million back to Indigenous artisans, supporting communities and preserving traditions through education, employment and collaboration. The drop is part of the Manitobah Artist Series, which brings in creatives to craft products that honor their stories—from sketch to marketing campaign. The floral Chukkas are limited edition, and Okuma has a lot of serious fans, so they’ll go fast, but there is a possibility of a future restock according to Manitobah reps. Meanwhile, the ready-to-wear collection Okuma just showed at NYFW is available on her website. Prada has been somewhat quiet retail-wise in Southern California in recent years compared to its luxury peers, but the Italian brand just opened a new 5,000-square-foot store at Westfield Topanga. The boutique features an illuminated façade in the brand’s iconic pastel green with a repeating triangle pattern echoing the brand’s logo. Inside, the black-and-white checkered marble floor pays homage to the original Prada store in Milan’s Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II. The Topanga store has the full run of men’s and women’s ready-to-wear, Re-Nylon outerwear, the new Prada Explore handbags, the latest fall shoes and more. It’s the latest arrival at Westfield Topanga, which opened three years ago to cater to the monied West Valley — aka Kardashian Country. In that time, the shopping center has added 62 new stores — Hermès, Dior, Dolce & Gabbana and Rolex, to name a few — and now boasts the largest concentration of luxury retailers in L.A. County outside of Rodeo Drive. Maybe it’s time for a “Valley Girl” reboot! Forwarded this newsletter?Subscribe here to get WrapStyle directly every week! Have a news story for our readers?

ByDavid Trainer, Contributor. If you’ve read any market news lately, you’ve likely seen OpenAI all over the headlines. First, a $100 billion investment from NVIDIA. Then, 5 new data centers through partnerships with Oracle and SoftBank, which are part of a larger $500 billion initiative. The key takeaway? Massive amounts of capital are flowing into the AI race. Of course, AI investments are not new, even if the magnitude of each investment seems to rise with each announcement. The influx of capital begs the question, “how can investors take advantage of the AI race when most technology stocks are already overvalued?” Finding an AI stock that isn’t already overvalued is extremely difficult in today’s market. Difficult, but not impossible. To find value in the industry, one must look at the infrastructure behind AI. Behind the flash and hype sit massive, power-hungry data centers that require enormous amounts of energy. My Long Idea this week is a company that’s well positioned to benefit from the AI data center driven energy demand. The company has industry leading profitability, multiple development agreements in place, and its stock is cheap, unlike most AI tech stocks. It’s not news that the ongoing race to build massive, power-hungry, data centers will drive strong energy demand in the coming years. It’s also not news that most of the stocks involved in AI and related industries have seen their values explode higher. So, my scoop is that I found a great stock that benefits from AI, but it has been overlooked and remains Attractive. This week’s Long Idea, Black Stone Minerals L.P. (BSM), is well positioned to collect royalties all along the way. I first made Black Stone Minerals a Long Idea in November 2023, and reiterated my bullish opinion on the stock on October 2024. Since my original report, the market has failed to recognize the company’s strong position to benefit from the artificial intelligence (AI) movement. My original investment thesis on this company remains intact and increasing AI spending makes future growth prospects even more attractive. Nvidia (NVDA) recently announced a $100 billion investment in OpenAI to help it build data centers to deploy at least 10 gigawatts of NVIDIA’s systems for OpenAI’s AI infrastructure. What does a deal this big mean for energy consumption? Brian Sullivan of CNBC notes 10 gigawatts is equal to the power generated by: This partnership between Nvidia and OpenAI is just one of many examples of AI and data centers driving huge energy demand. McKinsey projects that by 2030, worldwide data centers will require $6.7 trillion in capital expenditures just to keep pace with the demand for compute power. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects electricity demand from data centers will more than double by 2030, to ~945 terawatt-hours (TWh), which is slightly more than the entire electricity consumption of Japan. Natural gas is an increasingly attractive power source for two main reasons: reliability and efficiency. Reliability is paramount for data centers, as outages can result in millions of dollars in lost revenue and significant reputational damage. Natural gas offers a safeguard against traditional energy risks including grid instability, intermittent power supply, and extreme weather events. Unlike diesel, which is constrained by limited on-site storage and supply chain vulnerabilities, natural gas is delivered continuously via pipelines, which ensures a steady supply even during extended grid outages. Additionally, natural gas can be quickly turned on and off and has much lower ramp times than solar and wind power. When selecting a power source, efficiency is also very important to keeping costs low and margins in the green. To measure efficiency, one can analyze an energy source’s capacity factor, which measures the actual energy produced relative to the maximum possible energy that could have been produced if operating at peak capacity. Solar power typically operates at capacity factors between 10% and 25%, while power generated from wind, hydroelectric, coal, and wood sources operate at capacity factors of around 34%, 35%, 43%, and 56%, respectively. Natural gas – combined cycle on the other hand has an average capacity factor of 60%, with some uses, such as combined heat and power (CHP) systems fueled by natural gas operating at capacity factors of 80%. The only energy source that operates at a higher capacity factor then CHP natural gas systems is nuclear energy, at 92%. The United States is the largest natural gas producer in the world, and the companies that own stakes in natural gas assets are particularly well-positioned to meet the rising needs of data center power consumption. More specifically, Black Stone Minerals’ management believes “gas-powered electrical generation will cause the next 10 to 15 years of the gas market to not be perfect, but more reliable than it’s been over the past 15 years.” Liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports present another large driver of demand for U.S. natural gas production. LNG provides transportation advantages through the process of liquefying natural gas, which reduces it to 1/600th of its original volume. U.S. LNG exports have nearly quadrupled over the last five years, and the Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts U.S. LNG exports will increase 36% from 2024 to 2026. Furthermore, the EIA projects U.S. monthly natural gas production to grow from 112.9 billion cubic foot (Bcf) in December 2024 to 115.1 Bcf in December 2026. See Figure 1. Figure 1: U.S. Monthly Natural Gas Production: 2010 – 2026 U.S. weekly oil production has increased from 9.1 million barrels per day (bpd) in September 2015 to 13.5 million bpd in September 2025. Since October 2023, output has consistently ranged between 13.0 and 13.5 million bpd. See Figure 2. The EIA projects that U.S. oil production will remain stable near these record levels, averaging 13.4 million bpd in 2025 and 13.3 million bpd in 2026. Figure 2: U.S. Oil Production: September 2015 – September 2025 Black Stone Minerals holds mineral rights to 20+ million gross acres across 41 states and 60+ productive basins. According to the company’s September investor presentation, in 2Q25 BSM maintains rights to 11% of the 571 total rigs in the U.S. This exposure is spread across all of the major onshore producing basins, which include Haynesville/Bossier, Permian, Bakken, and Eagle Ford basins. See Black Stone Minerals’ acreage presence by region in Figure 3. Figure 3: Black Stone Minerals’ Acreage by Major Basin in 2024 Black Stone Minerals’ management team is taking steps to expand its already large asset base to capitalize on growing natural gas production. In May 2025, Black Stone Minerals entered into a development agreement with Revenant Energy for 270,000 gross acres across the company’s Haynesville/Bossier acreage in the Shelby Through region. Through deal, the annual well commitments escalate over five years from a minimum of 6 wells per year starting in 2026 and scales to a minimum of 25 wells per year. When discussing the agreement on the company’s 2Q25 earnings call, Black Stone Minerals’ CEO noted “these new developments, coupled with our existing agreements, are expected to more than double our drilling obligations in the area over the next 5 years, providing significant natural gas growth for the partnership.” The company also finalized an amendment with Aethon Energy which will release over 50,000 gross acres back to Black Stone Minerals in the Shelby Through. These agreements build on the company’s ongoing Haynesville Expansion (HEX) initiative, which extends development in the Shelby Trough and geologically connects to the Western Haynesville. As part of the HEX, the company’s Kurth Lake Expansion (KLX) encompasses 220,000 gross acres with an annual well commitment that escalates from a minimum of 1 well per year starting in 2026 to a minimum of 12 wells per year through 2035. To summarize, Black Stone Minerals is adding about 50 wells and 50,000 acres of to boost its natural gas production capacity over the next ten years. As I highlighted in my previous reports, Black Stone Minerals generates revenue by leasing its mineral and royalty interests in oil and gas properties across the U.S. The company does not bear the costs or operational risks associated with drilling or maintaining wells. Instead, it leases its rights to exploration and production (E&P) companies, which assume the associated expenses and risks. This business model allows Black Stone Minerals to benefit from rising natural gas and oil production in a much more stable and predictable manner compared to E&P companies. While profits are down from record 2022 levels, Black Stone Materials continues to generate strong Core Earnings and free cash flow (more on that later). Black Stone Minerals generated $245 million in Core Earnings in the TTM ended 2Q25, which is higher than any other year in my model except 2022 and 2023. Black Stone Minerals has grown revenue by 1% compounded annually and Core Earnings by 7% compounded annually since 2015. See Figure 4. More recently, the company’s net operating profit after-tax (NOPAT) margin improved from 48% in 2019 to 64% in the TTM, and in turn its return on invested capital (ROIC) improved from 11% to 17% over the same time. Figure 4: Black Stone Minerals’ Revenue and Core Earnings: 2015 – TTM Black Stone Minerals’ rising free cash flow (FCF) remains impressive. It gives the company the means to expand production and support an increasing level of capital return to shareholders as highlighted below. The company generated a cumulative $1.9 billion in FCF while paying $1.6 billion in combined distributions ($1.5 billion) and common unit repurchases ($23 million) since 2020. Black Stone Minerals generated a cumulative $2.4 billion (78% of enterprise value) in FCF from 2018 through 2Q25. See Figure 5. Figure 5: Black Stone Minerals’ Free Cash Flow: 2018 – 2Q25 Black Stone Minerals reduced its total debt from $399 million in 2019 to $100 million in the TTM. The company earns an Attractive Credit Rating in part because of its reduced debt load and consistent cash flows. Black Stone Minerals earns a Very Attractive rating in four of the five criteria that drive my Credit Ratings. Even if economic conditions deteriorate, the company’s strong financial footing secures its operations for the foreseeable future. Figure 6: Black Stone Minerals’ Credit Rating Details Black Stone Materials’ superior profitability compared to its peers reflects just how strong the oil and gas royalty business is. Per Figure 7, Black Stone Minerals generates the highest ROIC and NOPAT margin of its peer group. The peer group, detailed in Black Stone Minerals’ proxy statement, includes California Resources (CRC), Gulfport Energy (GPOR), Northern Oil & Gas (NOG), Magnolia Oil & Gas (MGY), and more. Figure 7: Black Stone Minerals’ Profitability Vs. Peers: TTM Black Stone Minerals has consistently returned capital to shareholders for nearly a decade. The company increased its regular distribution from $0.08/unit in 2Q20 (lows of COVID-19) to $0.30/unit in 3Q25. When annualized, the current regular distribution provides investors a 9.3% yield. From 2020 through 2Q25, Black Stone Minerals paid $1.5 billion (56% of current market cap) in regular distributions. Black Stone Minerals also repurchases units, though in lower amounts relative to distributions. Black Stone Minerals repurchased a total of $23 million in units since 2020. As of June 30, 2025, the company had $150 million remaining in repurchase authorization. Should the company continue repurchasing units at TTM levels moving forward, it would repurchase units worth 0.1% of its current market cap. When combined with distributions, investors could see a yield of 9.4%. Oil prices declined in the first half of 2025 due to weakening global demand amid changes in trade policies and escalating trade tensions, alongside a significant supply increase as OPEC+ members unwound voluntary production cuts and non-OPEC+ producers increased output. The company’s realized oil and condensate price was $67.07/Bbl in 1H25, compared to $77.35/Bbl in 1H24 and $98.34/Bbl in 1H22. Lower oil prices drove the company’s oil and condensate sales down 27% YoY in 1H25. Oil prices are forecasted to continue to decline into early 2026, which will continue to put pressure on Black stone Minerals’ oil and condensate sales. However, rising natural gas prices have offset the decline in oil prices. The company’s realized natural gas price was $3.66/Mcf in 1H25, compared to $2.39/Mcf in 1H24. The increase in prices drove natural gas and NGL sales 33% higher YoY in 1H25. Total revenue in 1H25 increased 2% YoY. Furthermore, natural gas prices are projected to rise going into next year, from $2.91 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in August 2025 to $4.30 MMBtu in 2026. The good news is even if natural gas prices were to increase less than expected or oil prices were to fall, any downside to profits is already more than priced into Black Stone Minerals’ current stock price. At its current price of $13/share, Black Stone Minerals has a price-to-economic book value (PEBV) ratio of 0.7, which means the market expects its profits to permanently fall 30% from current levels. Below, I use my reverse discounted cash flow (DCF) model to quantify the cash flow expectations for different stock price scenarios for BSM. In the first scenario, I quantify the expectations baked into the current price. If I assume: BSM would be worth $13/share today – equal to the current stock price. In this scenario, Black Stone Minerals’ NOPAT would fall 3% compounded annually through 2034. For reference Black Stone Minerals has grown NOPAT by 7% compounded annually since 2015. If I instead assume: BSM would be worth at least $20/share today – a 54% upside to the current price. In this scenario, Black Stone Minerals’ NOPAT would grow just 1% compounded annually over the next decade. Should Black Stone Minerals grow profits more in line with historical rates, the stock has even more upside. Figure 8 compares Black Stone Minerals’ historical NOPAT to the NOPAT implied in each of the above DCF scenarios. Figure 8: Black Stone Minerals’ Historical and Implied NOPAT: DCF Valuation Scenarios

BySasirekha Subramanian, Contributor. Nvidia's financial performance has been extraordinary, making it the most valuable U.S. company at a $4.4 trillion market cap.Its market dominance stems can be attributed to the company's leadership, it's high-powered chips and a comprehensive, full-stack AI infrastructure strategy.Despite its stock run-up, valuation metrics indicate Nvidia may still be undervalued given its strong growth potential. A $1,000 investment in Nvidia (NVDA) five years ago would be worth more than $12,000 today. The chipmaker’s stock has enjoyed a remarkable run, fueled by surging demand for its high-powered GPUs amid the AI boom. This wasn’t a hype-driven rally. The stock never got ahead of its fundamentals; if anything, investors were late to recognize what Nvidia had been quietly building for years. When AI’s moment arrived, Nvidia was ready to embrace it. Over the last five years, Nvidia executed two stock splits: On Oct. 14, 2020, Nvidia closed at $14.05 on a split-adjusted basis. That means a $1,000 investment would have bought 71 shares. As of Oct. 14, 2025, Nvidia closed at $180.03 per share, making those 71 shares worth $12,782.13—a more than 12x return, and that’s excluding any dividends received along the way. For comparison, a $1,000 investment in the SPY ETF, which tracks the S&P 500 index, would have grown to $1,986.69 in the same period. The takeaway? Whether you held or missed out, Nvidia’s return has been extraordinary. What drove this exponential return? Nvidia’s strategic pivot — repurposing its powerful graphics chips for AI workloads — proved transformational as AI became a dominant investment theme after OpenAI released ChatGPT in late 2022. Though AI had been evolving for decades, ChatGPT made it tangible, accessible and personal for the mainstream.. Nvidia positioned itself at the center of the AI narrative, capturing demand from cloud providers, data centers and enterprises racing to build next-generation infrastructure. In May 2020, Nvidia launched the A100, the first GPU based on its Ampere architecture. Delivering up to 20x performance improvements over the previous generation Nvidia GPU, A100 quickly became the gold standard for AI. Major customers included Alibaba Cloud, Amazon Web Services, Baidu Cloud, Cisco, Dell Technologies, Google Cloud, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle. After the launch, NVDA shares rose from $8 in mid May to end the year at $13.02, representing a gain of 63% Nvidia stock ended 2021 at $29.36, gaining 125% from the previous year’s close, as the Covid-ridden world embraced high-performance computing for remote work, gaming and data analytics. Demand from crypto mining also contributed to stock gains. In April 2021, Nvidia announced the general availability of Omniverse Enterprise, a 3D simulation platform for creating digital twins and virtual worlds. A key attribute of the Omniverse is to create physically accurate visualizations and simulations of products and environments, reducing the time and costs of physical testing. Nvidia announced its first Hopper-architecture-based GPU, the NVIDIA H100, in 2022, calling it “the engine of the world’s AI infrastructure.” The H100 was designed to be deployed in every type of data center, including on-premises, cloud, hybrid-cloud and edge. While investor response to the H100 announcement was initially muted, the GPU would prove to be a critical enabler of large-scale AI workloads in the following years. ChatGPT’s release on Nov 30, 2022, marked an inflection point for AI. Nvidia stock jumped 8% that day — an early sign that the market was beginning to recognize Nvidia’s potential. However, by the end of the year, the Nvidia stock retraced to 2020 levels, wiping out its 2021 gains. A major reason was the crypto market crash, which significantly reduced demand for Nvidia’s gaming GPUs used by miners. The same year, Nvidia faced yet another setback when the U.S. government introduced controls to prevent the chipmaker from exporting its most powerful chips, including the A100 and H100 GPUs to China, threatening a solid revenue stream. The explosion of investment in generative AI in 2023 led to a surge in demand for AI infrastructure. With its H100 GPUs already in production, Nvidia became a clear beneficiary.. Both institutional and retail investors piled into the AI theme and Nvidia’s stock more than tripled over the year, closing 2023 near $50. Nvidia also crossed $1 trillion in market capitalization for the first time. The momentum carried into 2024. As major tech companies allocated billions of dollars to expand their AI capabilities, Nvidia's datacenter revenues soared. At its annual GTC conference in March 2024, Nvidia unveiled its next-generation Blackwell GPU platform, reinforcing optimism about its roadmap. In June 2024, Nvidia executed a 10-for-1 stock split to increase accessibility for investors. Later that year, Nvidia was added to the prestigious Dow Jones Industrial Average – a recognition of its market leadership. Nvidia’s financial performance has been equally impressive. The AI bellwether more than doubled its revenues for fiscal 2024 and then doubled its revenues again in fiscal 2025 in rapid succession. Positive investor sentiment drove record inflows into the stock, making Nvidia the most valuable company in the U.S. with a $4.4 trillion market cap. Recently, CEO Jensen Huang confirmed that the exponential demand for AI computing, particularly for the newer Blackwell GPUs, showed no signs of slowing down. With Nvidia stock setting new highs, some analysts are even forecasting a potential future valuation of $7 trillion, despite setbacks with China and intensifying competition from AMD. Nvidia’s decision to repurpose its graphics chips for AI was nothing short of visionary. Recognizing that the parallel processing architecture originally designed for rendering complex graphics was also perfectly suited for the intense computational demands of AI – marked a pivotal turning point and redefined the company’s future. The introduction of the Compute Unified Device Architecture in 2006 is Nvidia’s most significant differentiator. CUDA provided software tools that allowed developers to program Nvidia GPUs for general computing tasks beyond graphics. Thus Nvidia built a robust software ecosystem around its hardware. This early move created a durable competitive moat, fostering developer loyalty and driving long-term platform adoption. It meant that researchers and developers building AI models were already accustomed to Nvidia's software and hardware long before the AI boom truly kicked off, positioning Nvidia as the default choice for AI infrastructure. Unlike its competition, Nvidia focuses on building the entire AI infrastructure. Its end-to-end AI platform encompassing GPUs, CPUs, networking hardware, and full-stack software gives it the capability to build AI supercomputers, while enabling customers to deploy AI with greater ROI. Nvidia’s ability to deliver new GPU architectures with significant performance gains — such as Ampere, Hopper and Blackwell — has kept it consistently ahead of the curve. The company’s rapid iteration has made it the go-to provider for customers racing to keep pace with the computing demands of generative AI and large language models. Nvidia’s financials have been growing at a faster pace in recent fiscal years, leading to the sharp rise in its share price. Revenues have grown from $26.97 billion in fiscal 2023 to $60.92 billion in fiscal 2024 and to $130.5 billion in fiscal 2025. The growth in revenue has been accompanied by strong profitability. Operating income has grown from $4.2 billion in fiscal 2023 to $32.9 billion in fiscal 2024 to $81.5 billion in fiscal 2025 and earnings per share from $0.17 in fiscal 2023 to $1.19 in fiscal 2024 and to $2.94 in fiscal 2025. Nvidia has shown remarkable resilience, enduring the 2022 crypto crash that severely impacted its gaming segment and the current US-China trade tensions. China has been a key market for Nvidia; it represented $17 billion or 13% of Nvidia’s sales for the fiscal year that ended in January. But Nvidia’s market share in the region has weakened from 95% before 2022 to just 50% after U.S. regulators tightened restrictions on selling high-end AI chips to China over national security concerns. Instead of resisting policy constraints, Nvidia adjusted swiftly by introducing the H20, a watered-down version of its H100 GPU designed for U.S. compliance — demonstrating its agility in navigating complex regulations. With China turning away from its chips now, Nvidia is accelerating expansion into new markets, again highlighting its resourcefulness. Huang’s leadership remains Nvidia’s greatest asset. The visionary chief executive touted the transformational potential of AI long before it went mainstream and prepared Nvidia to be at the heart of the AI buildout boom. As a founder-CEO, he brings continuity, long-term strategic vision and assertiveness to steer Nvidia through a complex technological and geopolitical situation. Huang’s pragmatic leadership has been on display repeatedly: He lobbied effectively to ease U.S. restrictions on H20 chip exports, yet accepted China’s subsequent rejection of Nvidia’s H20 and RTX Pro 6000D chips with composure. Chinese regulators have reportedly directed companies like Alibaba and ByteDance to cancel orders for Nvidia’s RTX Pro 6000D processors, which are specifically designed to comply with U.S. export rules and serve the Chinese market. Instead of dwelling on the setback, Nvidia shifted strategy — assuming a “China zero” baseline in financial guidance and treating any China-related sales as potential upside rather than expectation. The recent U.S. approval to sell AI chips to the UAE drove Nvidia stock to new highs, and a deal to sell directly to OpenAI, bypassing traditional cloud partners — reflects the company’s evolving sales strategy. Meanwhile, Nvidia’s strategic investment in Intel points to initiatives to diversify manufacturing sources beyond TSMC, as Taiwan faces an ongoing geopolitical threat of invasion from China. This proactive de-risking underscores Huang’s forward-looking approach that continues to set Nvidia apart. Nvidia still has a long growth runway extending into the next decade. Last month, Nvidia unveiled Rubin CPX, a new class of GPU designed to handle million-token coding and generative video applications. Rubin CPX is offered in multiple configurations, including the Vera Rubin NVL144 CPX , which Nvidia says will enable companies to generate $5 billion in token revenue for every $100 million invested. Rubin is on schedule for volume production next year. Over the next five years, Nvidia expects to scale into a $3-4 trillion AI infrastructure opportunity with its Blackwell, Rubin and other successors. The AI infrastructure market continues to expand significantly with $600 billion in data center and computing-power investments expected this year. The key drivers for these investments include reasoning agentic AI that would require a lot of computing power, global build outs for sovereign AI, enterprise AI adoption, and the arrival of robotics and physical AI. Blackwell has set industry benchmarks for AI inference ROI. As agentic and reasoning-based models gain traction, inference workloads are scaling across sectors, positioning Blackwell as a core growth engine. Nvidia claims that its Blackwell platform delivers the highest ROI at AI factory scale and can generate $75 million in token revenue over three years from a $5 million investment. Token revenue is earned during an AI system’s inference phase, where it processes input tokens and generates output tokens to produce responses. The faster and more efficiently it handles each token, the greater the potential revenue the system can generate. Nvidia’s RTX Pro servers enable enterprises to build AI factories and accelerate enterprise workloads from agentic AI and LLM inference to industrial AI and digital twins. About 90 companies have already adopted RTX Pro servers, including Hitachi, which uses these for real-time simulation and digital twins, Lilly for drug discovery, Hyundai for factory design and AV validation and Disney for immersive storytelling. RTX Pro servers are expected to become a multibillion-dollar product line as enterprises modernize data centers. Sovereign AI has emerged as a growth pillar, as nations seek to build in-country AI infrastructure using Nvidia’s full-stack. Nvidia is working on Sovereign AI initiatives across The UK and Europe. The European Union plans to invest €20 billion to establish 20 AI factories in France, Germany, Italy and Spain, including five gigafactories to increase its AI infrastructure tenfold. Isambard-AI, deemed as the UK’s most powerful AI supercomputer, is powered by Nvidia. This supercomputer aims to accelerate breakthroughs in fields of drug discovery and climate modeling. Nvidia expects to achieve over $20 billion in sovereign AI revenue this year, more than twice its revenue last year. Networking, which is shaping up as a critical contributor for Nvidia, fetched second quarter revenues of $7.3 billion, up 98% year-on-year and up 46% sequentially. Strong demand across Spectrum X Ethernet, InfiniBand, and NVLink spurred the strong growth. Spectrum X, which is the world’s first Ethernet networking platform for AI, is now annualizing over $10 billion in revenue, accelerating from an $8 billion annual run rate in the first quarter. THOR, Nvidia’s new robotics computing platform is seeing early adoption from leading players like Meta, Amazon Robotics, Agility Robotics, Boston Dynamics, Caterpillar, Figure, Hexagon and Medtronic. Robotic applications require exponentially more computing power and infrastructure, representing a significant long-term demand driver for Nvidia’s data center platform. Last but not the least, Nvidia’s near-term outlook looks upbeat. It sees third-quarter revenues of $54 billion, plus or minus 2% – implying a range of $52.9 billion to $55.1 billion compared to the consensus of $53.1 billion. This is higher than the $46.7 billion in revenues it generated for the second quarter. The outlook assumes no H20 shipments to China. So, does Nvidia look like it’s slowing down? Even at record highs, Nvidia’s stock may not be as overvalued as it appears. Several valuation metrics suggest there’s still room for upside: These metrics suggest that, despite its impressive run-up, Nvidia stock may still be undervalued relative to its historical and sector benchmarks. Nvidia stock isn’t trading on hype The market is pricing in its AI leadership and perhaps even under-pricing the scale of its opportunity. Despite a hefty $4.4 trillion market cap, Nvidia remains deeply embedded in the multitrillion-dollar AI infrastructure cycle that continues to unfold. Nvidia isn’t some accessory to AI buildout, it is the backbone of the process. The company’s financial results continue to validate this growth narrative, with sustained momentum across key segments. Competition from AMD cannot be brushed off, but Nvidia’s full-stack advantage remains difficult to replicate. China is a near-term setback, but Nvidia is already expanding into other international markets. Nvidia’s dominance in data centers, sovereign AI initiatives and enterprise AI point to a multi-year growth runway. The recent dip in Nvidia stock presents a buying opportunity, in my opinion. Despite a nearly 1,200% surge over the past five years, Nvidia’s growth shows no signs of fatigue.

BySasirekha Subramanian, Contributor. Nvidia's financial performance has been extraordinary, making it the most valuable U.S. company at a $4.4 trillion market cap.Its market dominance stems can be attributed to the company's leadership, it's high-powered chips and a comprehensive, full-stack AI infrastructure strategy.Despite its stock run-up, valuation metrics indicate Nvidia may still be undervalued given its strong growth potential. A $1,000 investment in Nvidia (NVDA) five years ago would be worth more than $12,000 today. The chipmaker’s stock has enjoyed a remarkable run, fueled by surging demand for its high-powered GPUs amid the AI boom. This wasn’t a hype-driven rally. The stock never got ahead of its fundamentals; if anything, investors were late to recognize what Nvidia had been quietly building for years. When AI’s moment arrived, Nvidia was ready to embrace it. Over the last five years, Nvidia executed two stock splits: On Oct. 14, 2020, Nvidia closed at $14.05 on a split-adjusted basis. That means a $1,000 investment would have bought 71 shares. As of Oct. 14, 2025, Nvidia closed at $180.03 per share, making those 71 shares worth $12,782.13—a more than 12x return, and that’s excluding any dividends received along the way. For comparison, a $1,000 investment in the SPY ETF, which tracks the S&P 500 index, would have grown to $1,986.69 in the same period. The takeaway? Whether you held or missed out, Nvidia’s return has been extraordinary. What drove this exponential return? Nvidia’s strategic pivot — repurposing its powerful graphics chips for AI workloads — proved transformational as AI became a dominant investment theme after OpenAI released ChatGPT in late 2022. Though AI had been evolving for decades, ChatGPT made it tangible, accessible and personal for the mainstream.. Nvidia positioned itself at the center of the AI narrative, capturing demand from cloud providers, data centers and enterprises racing to build next-generation infrastructure. In May 2020, Nvidia launched the A100, the first GPU based on its Ampere architecture. Delivering up to 20x performance improvements over the previous generation Nvidia GPU, A100 quickly became the gold standard for AI. Major customers included Alibaba Cloud, Amazon Web Services, Baidu Cloud, Cisco, Dell Technologies, Google Cloud, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle. After the launch, NVDA shares rose from $8 in mid May to end the year at $13.02, representing a gain of 63% Nvidia stock ended 2021 at $29.36, gaining 125% from the previous year’s close, as the Covid-ridden world embraced high-performance computing for remote work, gaming and data analytics. Demand from crypto mining also contributed to stock gains. In April 2021, Nvidia announced the general availability of Omniverse Enterprise, a 3D simulation platform for creating digital twins and virtual worlds. A key attribute of the Omniverse is to create physically accurate visualizations and simulations of products and environments, reducing the time and costs of physical testing. Nvidia announced its first Hopper-architecture-based GPU, the NVIDIA H100, in 2022, calling it “the engine of the world’s AI infrastructure.” The H100 was designed to be deployed in every type of data center, including on-premises, cloud, hybrid-cloud and edge. While investor response to the H100 announcement was initially muted, the GPU would prove to be a critical enabler of large-scale AI workloads in the following years. ChatGPT’s release on Nov 30, 2022, marked an inflection point for AI. Nvidia stock jumped 8% that day — an early sign that the market was beginning to recognize Nvidia’s potential. However, by the end of the year, the Nvidia stock retraced to 2020 levels, wiping out its 2021 gains. A major reason was the crypto market crash, which significantly reduced demand for Nvidia’s gaming GPUs used by miners. The same year, Nvidia faced yet another setback when the U.S. government introduced controls to prevent the chipmaker from exporting its most powerful chips, including the A100 and H100 GPUs to China, threatening a solid revenue stream. The explosion of investment in generative AI in 2023 led to a surge in demand for AI infrastructure. With its H100 GPUs already in production, Nvidia became a clear beneficiary.. Both institutional and retail investors piled into the AI theme and Nvidia’s stock more than tripled over the year, closing 2023 near $50. Nvidia also crossed $1 trillion in market capitalization for the first time. The momentum carried into 2024. As major tech companies allocated billions of dollars to expand their AI capabilities, Nvidia's datacenter revenues soared. At its annual GTC conference in March 2024, Nvidia unveiled its next-generation Blackwell GPU platform, reinforcing optimism about its roadmap. In June 2024, Nvidia executed a 10-for-1 stock split to increase accessibility for investors. Later that year, Nvidia was added to the prestigious Dow Jones Industrial Average – a recognition of its market leadership. Nvidia’s financial performance has been equally impressive. The AI bellwether more than doubled its revenues for fiscal 2024 and then doubled its revenues again in fiscal 2025 in rapid succession. Positive investor sentiment drove record inflows into the stock, making Nvidia the most valuable company in the U.S. with a $4.4 trillion market cap. Recently, CEO Jensen Huang confirmed that the exponential demand for AI computing, particularly for the newer Blackwell GPUs, showed no signs of slowing down. With Nvidia stock setting new highs, some analysts are even forecasting a potential future valuation of $7 trillion, despite setbacks with China and intensifying competition from AMD. Nvidia’s decision to repurpose its graphics chips for AI was nothing short of visionary. Recognizing that the parallel processing architecture originally designed for rendering complex graphics was also perfectly suited for the intense computational demands of AI – marked a pivotal turning point and redefined the company’s future. The introduction of the Compute Unified Device Architecture in 2006 is Nvidia’s most significant differentiator. CUDA provided software tools that allowed developers to program Nvidia GPUs for general computing tasks beyond graphics. Thus Nvidia built a robust software ecosystem around its hardware. This early move created a durable competitive moat, fostering developer loyalty and driving long-term platform adoption. It meant that researchers and developers building AI models were already accustomed to Nvidia's software and hardware long before the AI boom truly kicked off, positioning Nvidia as the default choice for AI infrastructure. Unlike its competition, Nvidia focuses on building the entire AI infrastructure. Its end-to-end AI platform encompassing GPUs, CPUs, networking hardware, and full-stack software gives it the capability to build AI supercomputers, while enabling customers to deploy AI with greater ROI. Nvidia’s ability to deliver new GPU architectures with significant performance gains — such as Ampere, Hopper and Blackwell — has kept it consistently ahead of the curve. The company’s rapid iteration has made it the go-to provider for customers racing to keep pace with the computing demands of generative AI and large language models. Nvidia’s financials have been growing at a faster pace in recent fiscal years, leading to the sharp rise in its share price. Revenues have grown from $26.97 billion in fiscal 2023 to $60.92 billion in fiscal 2024 and to $130.5 billion in fiscal 2025. The growth in revenue has been accompanied by strong profitability. Operating income has grown from $4.2 billion in fiscal 2023 to $32.9 billion in fiscal 2024 to $81.5 billion in fiscal 2025 and earnings per share from $0.17 in fiscal 2023 to $1.19 in fiscal 2024 and to $2.94 in fiscal 2025. Nvidia has shown remarkable resilience, enduring the 2022 crypto crash that severely impacted its gaming segment and the current US-China trade tensions. China has been a key market for Nvidia; it represented $17 billion or 13% of Nvidia’s sales for the fiscal year that ended in January. But Nvidia’s market share in the region has weakened from 95% before 2022 to just 50% after U.S. regulators tightened restrictions on selling high-end AI chips to China over national security concerns. Instead of resisting policy constraints, Nvidia adjusted swiftly by introducing the H20, a watered-down version of its H100 GPU designed for U.S. compliance — demonstrating its agility in navigating complex regulations. With China turning away from its chips now, Nvidia is accelerating expansion into new markets, again highlighting its resourcefulness. Huang’s leadership remains Nvidia’s greatest asset. The visionary chief executive touted the transformational potential of AI long before it went mainstream and prepared Nvidia to be at the heart of the AI buildout boom. As a founder-CEO, he brings continuity, long-term strategic vision and assertiveness to steer Nvidia through a complex technological and geopolitical situation. Huang’s pragmatic leadership has been on display repeatedly: He lobbied effectively to ease U.S. restrictions on H20 chip exports, yet accepted China’s subsequent rejection of Nvidia’s H20 and RTX Pro 6000D chips with composure. Chinese regulators have reportedly directed companies like Alibaba and ByteDance to cancel orders for Nvidia’s RTX Pro 6000D processors, which are specifically designed to comply with U.S. export rules and serve the Chinese market. Instead of dwelling on the setback, Nvidia shifted strategy — assuming a “China zero” baseline in financial guidance and treating any China-related sales as potential upside rather than expectation. The recent U.S. approval to sell AI chips to the UAE drove Nvidia stock to new highs, and a deal to sell directly to OpenAI, bypassing traditional cloud partners — reflects the company’s evolving sales strategy. Meanwhile, Nvidia’s strategic investment in Intel points to initiatives to diversify manufacturing sources beyond TSMC, as Taiwan faces an ongoing geopolitical threat of invasion from China. This proactive de-risking underscores Huang’s forward-looking approach that continues to set Nvidia apart. Nvidia still has a long growth runway extending into the next decade. Last month, Nvidia unveiled Rubin CPX, a new class of GPU designed to handle million-token coding and generative video applications. Rubin CPX is offered in multiple configurations, including the Vera Rubin NVL144 CPX , which Nvidia says will enable companies to generate $5 billion in token revenue for every $100 million invested. Rubin is on schedule for volume production next year. Over the next five years, Nvidia expects to scale into a $3-4 trillion AI infrastructure opportunity with its Blackwell, Rubin and other successors. The AI infrastructure market continues to expand significantly with $600 billion in data center and computing-power investments expected this year. The key drivers for these investments include reasoning agentic AI that would require a lot of computing power, global build outs for sovereign AI, enterprise AI adoption, and the arrival of robotics and physical AI. Blackwell has set industry benchmarks for AI inference ROI. As agentic and reasoning-based models gain traction, inference workloads are scaling across sectors, positioning Blackwell as a core growth engine. Nvidia claims that its Blackwell platform delivers the highest ROI at AI factory scale and can generate $75 million in token revenue over three years from a $5 million investment. Token revenue is earned during an AI system’s inference phase, where it processes input tokens and generates output tokens to produce responses. The faster and more efficiently it handles each token, the greater the potential revenue the system can generate. Nvidia’s RTX Pro servers enable enterprises to build AI factories and accelerate enterprise workloads from agentic AI and LLM inference to industrial AI and digital twins. About 90 companies have already adopted RTX Pro servers, including Hitachi, which uses these for real-time simulation and digital twins, Lilly for drug discovery, Hyundai for factory design and AV validation and Disney for immersive storytelling. RTX Pro servers are expected to become a multibillion-dollar product line as enterprises modernize data centers. Sovereign AI has emerged as a growth pillar, as nations seek to build in-country AI infrastructure using Nvidia’s full-stack. Nvidia is working on Sovereign AI initiatives across The UK and Europe. The European Union plans to invest €20 billion to establish 20 AI factories in France, Germany, Italy and Spain, including five gigafactories to increase its AI infrastructure tenfold.

A MAN WHOSE skeletal remains were found in a jute bag in a ravine at the side of a road in Co Cork had sustained multiple fractures to his skull and body consistent with the use of a hammer like weapon, a murder trial has heard. The remains of Kieran Quilligan were discovered after gardaí brought a cadaver dog to Whitewell, Rostellan, Co Cork on 29 January, 2024. The 47 year old, who was from Togher in Cork city, was last seen alive on 1 September, 2023. Niall Long (33) and Luke Taylor (27) are on trial in the Central Criminal Court sitting in Cork charged with his murder. Today the jury heard evidence from Assistant State Pathologist, Dr Margaret Bolster, who attended at the scene where the remains of Mr Quilligan were found. Dr Bolster said that that on examination of the jute bag the first thing she saw was the pelvic bone protruding. The skull was separate from the body. She noted that there was a large amount of silt and vegetation. Dr Bolster subsequently carried out a postmortem examination on Mr Quilligan on 30 January, 2024 at Cork University Hospital. Advertisement She said that a cause of death could not be established because decomposition had led to the loss of organs. However, Dr Bolster stated that what was not at doubt was that the injuries suffered by Mr Quilligan were consistent with a “severe assault.” Those injuries included fractures to his ribs, femur, knee, skull and face. Dr Bolster said that there was a small piece of skin remaining which consisted of a tattoo with the word ‘Mother’ and a date. A further inscription was illegible. Meanwhile, the jury of ten men and two women also heard evidence today that one of the accused men, Niall Long, had sent a text message to his mother Janice Long on 2 September, 2023. The message was sent after she texted him saying that the jeep smelled of Dettol. Sgt Maurice O’Connor said that Mr Long texted his mother back and said that the boot of the car was cleaned because “the fella that robbed me got a hiding and was thrown in the boot after.” The case continues tomorrow in front of Ms Justice Siobhan Lankford and the jury. The prosecution in the case claim that the accused men killed Mr Quilligan in a “joint enterprise.” The charge facing both accused is that the murder was carried out on a date unknown between 1 September, 2023 and 29 January, 2024, at an unknown location within the state of the District Court area of Cork city. Niall Long previously of St Michael’s Close in Mahon in Cork and and Luke Taylor formerly of Cherry Lawn in Blackrock in the city both deny murdering Mr Quilligan.

Sharon Goldman is an AI reporter at Fortune and co-authors Eye on AI, Fortune’s flagship AI newsletter. She has written about digital and enterprise tech for over a decade. Welcome to Eye on AI, with AI reporter Sharon Goldman. In this edition…a TikTok-like AI video app that is built for Gen Z…Challenges renting San Francisco apartments during the AI boom…TSMC profit surges 39% to hit yet another record on AI chip demand…Spotify partners with Sony, Universal, Warner and more to develop AI music products. Demi Guo, the 27-year-old founder of AI video company Pika, holds degrees in mathematics and computer science. But she’s also always had a creative streak, including writing poetry, and she loves showing off on social media with image and video tools. That’s why she dropped out of her Stanford Ph.D program and co-founded Pika in April 2023 with aspiring animator and fellow Ph.D student Chenlin Meng. Just as AI video companies like Runway were starting to get hot, the duo, after experimenting with making long-form generative AI films, decided to create an easier-to-use AI video generator—sparking interest from top Silicon Valley investors like Nat Friedman. Now, has Pika has raised about $135 million at a $470 million valuation and boasts 16.4 million users across several creative apps. It recently launched a new TikTok-like AI video app, also called Pika, that is already trending, and last week it debuted a new feature in that app called Predictive Video. Unlike other video tools which require long prompts to generate good results, Predictive Video allows users to upload a selfie and say something simple, like “make me a rock star,” or “I’m giving a TED Talk,” or “make me sing in Japanese”; the tool then infers your intent, delivering a complete video with a script, music and dance moves, background, lighting, and camera angles and visual effects. Instead of just producing a standalone video clip, Pika can anticipate motion and interaction, producing a sort of mixed reality by allowing users to weave themselves or real-world elements into AI-generated scenes—something that traditionally would take significant animation skills and production time. All of it is tailor-made for Gen Z and Gen Alpha, cohorts which have grown up on short-form video and uses online platforms to express themselves and share their thoughts, Guo explained. “Most nonprofessionals will never try to create a film using generative AI, but lots of people like to make short videos,” she said. “It’s really about self-expression.” That, she insists, is the opposite of what has become a catch-all tool for AI video: Slop. There may be artificial content at scale, but Pika is meant to, ironically, use generative AI to help people get more real, she says. “We really believe it is not meaningless content,” she emphasized. “It’s about self-expression, the personality is actually real behind it. So a person who is funny will post funny videos, or a person that is very egocentric will post egocentric videos.” Some people like to use one visual effect, or create a video that captures a vibe or a mood, or simply use the tool to do what they wish they could do in real life, she added. “It helps you achieve that in some sense,” she said. “Maybe you are a really bad singer, but in AI, you can sing very well, like a pop star.” Pika is stepping into a competitive landscape dominated by giants like OpenAI’s Sora and Meta’s new Vibes, but it’s carving out a very different niche. Sora is focused on cinematic, photorealistic text-to-video generation, and Vibes is about bringing AI-generated video feeds into Meta’s massive ecosystem. But Pika positions itself closer to the ground-level habits of Gen Z and Gen Alpha: It’s less about polished productions at scale, and more about emotion, creativity and interaction for everyday storytelling. With that, here’s more AI news.

A glimpse into AI’s small, cheap, DIY future – by Sharon Goldman Amazon is planning a new wave of layoffs, sources say – by Jason Del Rey Challenges renting San Francisco apartments during the AI boom. According to the New York Times, a surge of AI start-ups is reshaping San Francisco’s housing market, driving up demand and prices and intensifying competition for apartments. After his company Cluely raised $5.3 million, 22-year-old founder Roy Lee leased eight luxury apartments just steps from the office to foster a “frat house” work culture—emblematic of how tech firms are reshaping city living. Fueled by growth from companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, San Francisco rents have risen 6% in the past year, more than double New York City’s rate, with neighborhoods near A.I. hubs like Mission Bay seeing 13% spikes. The scramble for housing has led renters to tour dozens of units, face same-day rejections, and even bring cash to viewings, raising new concerns about affordability and displacement in one of America’s most expensive cities. TSMC profit surges 39% to beat estimates and hit yet another record on AI chip demand. CNBC reported that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) posted record third-quarter results as surging demand for artificial intelligence chips fueled a 39.1% jump in profit from a year earlier, beating analyst estimates. Revenue climbed 30.3% to NT$989.92 billion ($33.1 billion), while net income rose to NT$452.3 billion. CEO C.C. Wei said growing consumer adoption of AI models is strengthening the company’s conviction in the “AI megatrend,” prompting TSMC to raise its 2025 revenue growth forecast to the mid-30% range and boost planned capacity investments to at least $40 billion. High-performance computing, including AI and 5G chips, accounted for 57% of revenue, and advanced 7-nanometer-and-smaller chips made up 74% of wafer sales, underscoring TSMC’s central role in supplying cutting-edge processors to clients like Nvidia and Apple. Spotify partners with Sony, Universal, Warner and more to develop AI music products. Variety reported that Spotify is teaming up with major music industry players—including Sony, Universal, Warner, Merlin, and Believe—to develop “responsible” AI products aimed at empowering artists and songwriters, marking one of the first large-scale collaborations between streaming and music rights holders on AI. As part of a broader push to invest heavily in AI research and product development, Spotify plans to build a generative AI lab and product team focused on four key goals: creating tools through up-front agreements with labels and publishers; allowing artists and rights holders to opt in to generative music technologies; opening new revenue streams; and strengthening artist-fan connections. The initiative reflects a growing effort across the music industry to shape how AI is integrated into creative and commercial practices. Oct. 21-22: TedAI San Francisco.

That's how many Americans are familiar with AI mental health tools, according to a new YouGov survey that highlights just how far such tools have to go to win over the public. A mere 11% say they’d consider using one, and trust is even lower—just 8% say they trust AI in this space, while 40% explicitly don’t. The top reasons for skepticism: concerns about lack of human nuance (53%), harmful or inaccurate advice (50%), and data privacy (49%). And despite the flood of startups and investment in AI therapy apps, only 4% of Americans have ever tried one. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Fractures of skeletal remains suggest victim suffered severe assault, murder trial hears

A 47-year-old man whose skeletal remains were found more than five months after he went missing suggest he suffered multiple fractures to bones in his head, face and torso, a murder trial heard on Thursday. Kieran Quilligan had suffered a significant assault with some blunt implement such as a hammer, Assistant State Pathologist Dr Margot Bolster told the trial of co-accused Niall Long (33) and Luke Taylor (27) at the Central Criminal Court in Cork. Both Mr Long, of St Michael’s Close, Mahon, Cork, and Mr Taylor, formerly of Cherry Lawn, Blackrock, Cork, have denied the murder of Mr Quilligan on a date unknown between September 1st, 2023, and January 29th, 2024. On Thursday, Dr Bolster told the jury of 10 men and two women that she conducted a postmortem on the skeletal remains of Mr Quilligan, which had been found by a cadaver dog under a jute bag in scrubland at Whitewell, Rostellan, in east Cork on January 29th, 2024. She was not able to say exactly when Mr Quilligan had died nor was she able to give a precise cause of death, due to the length of time between his death and the postmortem. Dr Bolster revealed that Mr Quilligan had both old, healed fractures as well as more recent newer fractures and the latter included fractures of the temporal bone, parietal bone and mandible or jaw bone in the head as well as fractures to several ribs, leg bones and hand bones. “Fractures don’t cause death, it is usually trauma to underlying organs, but I could not establish the cause of death because there were no organs left,” said Dr Bolster, as she explained the lack of tissue and organs also meant she could not carry out any toxicology tests on Mr Quilligan. Cross-examined by Brendan Grehan SC for Mr Taylor, she agreed if Mr Quilligan had been shot in the head, there would be evidence of this in his skull and similarly a stab wound to the torso could leave marks on bones, but she found no evidence of either on his skeletal remains. Dr Bolster said that several of Mr Quilligan’s fractures, including one to his jaw and one to his thigh bone, were “suggestive of a blow with a blunt instrument like a hammer and there is no doubt at all, they are consistent with a severe and significant assault”. She said she believed two pieces of knotted plastic found tied around Mr Quilligan’s neck area were unusual ligatures and were more likely used to lift the remains. She also believed that a ratchet type cable tying his legs together was also used to lift and move the remains. The jury also heard from Sgt Maurice O’Connor of how he seized a number of mobile phones as part of the investigation, including one from Mr Long’s home at St Michael’s Close on September 15th, 2023. Gardaí were able to retrieve texts sent and received by the phones. He said he found a message on the phone seized at St Michael’s Close which belonged to Mr Long’s mother, Janice, sent on 6.23pm on September 2nd, 2023, in which she said she had noticed a smell of Dettol in the boot of her Toyota Rav car. Sgt O’Connor said that although gardaí were not able to locate the phone from which a reply was sent, they were able to establish the content of the message in which the sender admitted that there may have been a smell in the boot of Ms Long’s Toyota Rav jeep. “Yeah, it does, the fellow who robbed me and cut my neck got a hiding and got thrown in the boot, so the boot was cleaned,” said the sender. The jury were earlier told they would hear evidence the accused used Ms Long’s jeep to transport Mr Qulligan’s body. The case continues.

Title: Florida introduces new bill to establish Bitcoin and digital asset reserves
URL: https://cryptobriefing.com/florida-proposes-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-public-funds/
Time Published: 2025-10-16T17:48:30Z
Full Content:
Share this article Florida has introduced a new bill that would authorize the state to invest public funds in Bitcoin and other digital assets. The legislation, filed as House Bill 183 and sponsored by Rep. Webster Barnaby, would allow the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and the State Board of Administration to manage portions of state funds in Bitcoin and digital asset exchange-traded products. The move aligns with broader institutional adoption trends. The US established a strategic Bitcoin reserve managed by the Treasury in 2025, incorporating forfeited assets as a store of value. Institutional players like BlackRock and Fidelity have expanded Bitcoin-related fund offerings, supporting the infrastructure that could facilitate state-level adoption. Recent policies allowing digital assets in retirement plans have created a precedent for Florida’s reserve strategy. The legislation represents Florida’s effort to position itself among states pioneering crypto asset integration into public investment frameworks, treating Bitcoin as a strategic reserve option alongside traditional state fund allocations.

European stocks advanced on Thursday as investors took largely upbeat corporate earnings to heart amid easing political tensions after French prime minister Sébastien Lecornu survived a confidence vote. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index rose 0.45 per cent. Wall Street stocks advanced and gold prices surged ever upward on Thursday as solid corporate earnings helped investors look past simmering trade tensions between the United States and China. All three major US stock indexes followed their European counterparts to modest gains, while safe-haven seekers continued to send gold to fresh highs DUBLIN Shares in mining company Kenmare Resources traded flat after a wobble in the previous session on back of statements production of ilmenite – it’s most important mineral – will be towards the lower end of guidance this year. Bank of Ireland closed marginally down by 0.54 per cent. Food group Glanbia and budget airline Ryanair rose upon the positive tide, closing the session up 1.9 per cent and 1.4 per cent respectively. EUROPE In European equities on Thursday, the CAC 40 in Paris closed up 1.4 per cent, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt ended up 0.4 per cent. In France, prime minister Sébastien Lecornu weathered two confidence motions, just days after appointing his new government and making a key political concession to stay in power. The votes followed Mr Lecornu’s decision Tuesday to back suspending a divisive 2023 pension reform, in a bid to keep his cabinet afloat long enough to pass a much-needed austerity budget by year’s end. In Zurich, Nestle stormed 9.3 per cent higher after announcing plans to cut around 16,000 jobs globally over the next two years, as new chief executive officer Philipp Navratil steps up restructuring to revive growth and profitability at the Swiss food conglomerate. The move forms part of an expanded cost-savings programme. Nestle also reported third quarter organic growth of 4.3 per cent, well ahead of 3.7 per cent expected by analysts. Real internal growth improved to 1.5 per cent, ahead of 0.3 per cent consensus, recovering from negative trends earlier in the year. LONDON Blue chips in London nudged higher on Thursday despite sluggish economic growth in August and a 10 per cent drop for Premier Inn owner Whitbread. The FTSE 100 index was little changed at 9,436.09. The UK economy achieved only minor growth in August, numbers from the Office for National Statistics showed, while the reading for July was downwardly revised. Earlier this week, UK chancellor Rachel Reeves acknowledged she was looking at potential tax rises and spending cuts to fill a black hole in her budget. On the FTSE 100, Whitbread tumbled 10 per cent as lower earnings, higher debt, and growing economic uncertainty in the UK all weighed, despite a pickup in trading at Premier Inn. Whitbread said pretax profit fell 7.1 per cent to £287 million in the half-year that ended August 28 from £309 million a year earlier. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, called Whitbread’s results “another weak performance”, saying that earnings in reverse and net debt on the rise is the “kind of news that makes investors suffer from insomnia”. NEW YORK Wall Street’s main indexes were mixed on Thursday, as financial companies dragged while chip stocks extended their rally following a strong quarterly update from TSMC that reinforced investor optimism around AI. Shares of some major US chipmakers also advanced, building on gains from Wednesday when ASML’s solid quarterly results and a $40 billion (€34 billion) data centre deal by BlackRock and a Nvidia-backed group fuelled optimism around AI. Nvidia rose 1 per cent, Micron Technology added 5.6 per cent and Broadcom gained 1.1 per cent. Salesforce rose 4.1 per cent as it forecast revenue of more than $60 billion for 2030, above Wall Street estimates. “The Nasdaq is having a pretty good day, being driven higher by the semiconductors and the software side of things,” said Zachary Hill, head of portfolio management at Horizon Investments in Charlotte, North Carolina. Among other moves, Hewlett Packard Enterprise slumped 10.5 per cent after it forecast annual profit and revenue below Wall Street expectations. JB Hunt shares jumped 19.3 per cent after a higher third-quarter profit. – Additional reporting by Reuters Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Walmart Stock Hit Record Highs on OpenAI Deal. What Message Does That Send About the Business of AI?

The OpenAI fairy dust that has boosted tech stocks this year is spreading to new sectors. OpenAI and Walmart on Tuesday announced that ChatGPT users will soon be able to have the chatbot shop at Walmart for them without leaving the app. “Whether planning meals, restocking household essentials, or finding something new, customers can simply chat and buy, and Walmart will handle the rest,” Walmart said in a statement. Walmart (WMT) stock rose on the announcement, gaining nearly 5% on Tuesday, its best day since early April. Shares tacked on another 2% on Wednesday to close at a record high and pace Dow Jones Industrial Average gainers for the second straight day. The stock lost ground on Thursday. For OpenAI—which has been at the center of the deal-making lately that has sparked concerns about a possible AI bubble—the partnership with the world's largest retailer represents an important step in its efforts to prove commercial viability. While the terms of the deal weren't disclosed, OpenAI is likely to receive a commission from sales made on its platform, which could reassure some market watchers concerned about the ability of OpenAI to generate revenue and reduce its debt burden. With stocks trading at record highs despite heightened economic and geopolitical uncertainty, some investors have grown concerned that the AI rally fueling stock gains looks a lot like the Dotcom bubble of the late 1990s. When that bubble burst, the tech-heavy Nasdaq index lost nearly 80% of its value and took about 15 years to recover. Walmart is the latest company whose stock has skyrocketed on the announcement of a tie-up with the world’s most valuable private start-up. Shares of Broadcom (AVGO) soared nearly 10% Monday after it signed a deal with OpenAI to co-develop and deploy custom AI systems. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) inked a similar deal with the company last week, and its stock added nearly 25%. Even a simple shoutout at OpenAI’s developers conference is enough to lift shares. OpenAI’s recent dealmaking bonanza has sustained the latest leg of a nearly three-year bull market fueled by big tech and the AI boom. But it has also raised red flags on Wall Street, where some worry about the circularity of the deals underpinning lofty stock valuations. More than half of global fund managers surveyed by Bank of America in early October said they thought AI was in a bubble, and one-third identified an AI bubble as the stock market’s biggest tail risk, more than inflation (27%) and challenges to the Federal Reserve’s independence (14%). Those worried about a bubble compare Nvidia’s (NVDA) recent investments in OpenAI and cloud providers like CoreWeave (CRWV) to the vendor financing deals that heralded the bursting of the Dotcom Bubble in 2000. They also note that the AI data center buildout, which has mostly been funded by big tech’s healthy cash flows, is increasingly being financed with debt, exposing the infrastructure boom to the risk of tighter credit conditions. Though many others on Wall Street argue that bubble concerns are overblown. They point to growing AI demand from global enterprises and governments, as well as tech stock valuations that are still modest compared to the Dotcom era. OpenAI has forecast it will burn through more than $100 billion before reaching profitability around the turn of the decade. As a result, the start-up is expected to be highly reliant on debt and equity markets to fund the commitments it’s made to Oracle, AMD, Broadcom, and others. A successful partnership with a massive retailer such as Walmart could boost OpenAI’s revenue growth, allowing it to take on less debt. The partnership could also convince other retailers to strike similar deals and integrate their online shops with ChatGPT to reach the chatbot’s more than 800 million weekly users. With Tuesday’s stock move, “[Walmart’s] multiple has moved up in anticipation of faster future growth and margins. We agree with this premise,” wrote Morgan Stanley analysts in a note this week. They forecast the partnership could increase Walmart’s EBIT margin by as much as 40%, an improvement that would likely make a strong case for other retailers to follow suit.

Title: How CIOs Can Comply With International Data Privacy Laws

ByMegan Poinski, Forbes Staff andCIO, Forbes Staff. Governance is increasingly more important as cybersecurity risks grow in number, capabilities and scope, but even companies that have excellent governance in some areas might not be covering everything. A new report from data security platform Kiteworks found that several companies are failing at managed file transfer protection—and many of the vulnerabilities are relatively easy to identify and solve. Nearly six in 10 companies had a file transfer security incident in the last year, but priority is not placed on the steps to protect them. “Organizations check compliance boxes while missing fundamental governance,” Kiteworks Chief Strategy Officer Tim Freestone said in a statement. “They can’t tell you where sensitive files are stored, who accessed them last week, or how they move between systems. Without this visibility, even sophisticated security tools become expensive decorations.” Many enterprises are missing out on places to add security that don’t necessarily require new tools or knowhow, Kiteworks found. Three-quarters use end-to-end encryption for data that is in transit, but just 42% use an AES-256 encryption standard for data that is in storage, making it easier for bad actors to steal and exploit. Only about a third have integrated file transfer with their security team and its systems. And only a quarter test their file transferring security regularly. How can these holes be plugged? Kiteworks recommends companies stop buying new tools and instead come up with comprehensive data governance standards that cover files and transfers. This kind of governance is not just helpful from a security perspective, but it also helps enterprises keep better track of all of their data. Paying closer attention also helps identify where cybersecurity risks are lurking, enabling the enterprise to get ahead of threats, which is vital in today’s business environment. Another vital aspect of business is online privacy—a sometimes thorny topic because different states, countries and geopolitical zones have their own distinct sets of laws. I talked to Andy Sambandam, founder and CEO of data privacy platform Clarip, about how companies can stay in compliance everywhere and still do business. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. We are currently accepting nominations for the Forbes CIO Next 2025 list. We’re looking for innovators who have had significant impacts both at their own companies and for other tech leaders on the whole. (And yes, you can nominate yourself.) Nominations are accepted until 5 p.m. ET on October 30. It seems that 2025 is the year of the AI megadeal, and it’s getting difficult to keep track of who’s investing in or partnering with whom. Just this week, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure announced it will deploy AMD’s Instinct MI450 chips starting in Q3 of 2026. A consortium of Big Tech investors—including Nvidia, Microsoft, BlackRock and xAI—plans to purchase Aligned Data Centers for $40 billion. And OpenAI entered what’s likely a multimillion-dollar deal to roll out a custom AI chip with Broadcom. While some of the tech giants have enormous revenues, they’re still taking on debt to bolster their offerings and build infrastructure, like data centers. OpenAI, for instance, is not expected to break even for years to come. The enormous amounts of cash involved and huge investments around AI have inspired comparisons to the dot-com stock market bubble in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Forbes senior contributor Peter Cohan writes about the similarities between both periods of tech growth and enthusiasm, and predicts what fallout might look like for the economy. The bigger question, Cohan writes, is whether the economy is ready for it. Another question worth asking is whether this approach to AI will actually help the U.S. stay ahead in the race to dominate the technology. Forbes contributor Vivian Toh writes that while the U.S. is forming several capital—and debt—heavy alliances for AI, Chinese firms are focusing on open-source and easily adaptable technology. Toh writes that the AI race looks less like a sprint for maximizing intelligence and is now more about infrastructure. The biggest question is who can balance scaling the technology and maintain its resilience, she writes. AI is everywhere, and Oracle is unveiling its new starring role in its ERP and operational work at its AI World event this week—known as CloudWorld until this year. Forbes contributor Robert Kramer writes that Oracle is bringing AI agents into many of its enterprise cloud software suites. A payables agent automates invoicing in Oracle’s Fusion Cloud ERP and EPM. A ledger agent provides accountants with continuous insight. A planning agent supports event-driven forecasting. For supply chain, agents now automate several planning, fulfillment and compliance processes that could take hours to resolve manually. Oracle’s new agents, Kramer writes, are focused on intelligent and accountable AI. At the event, they’re demonstrating how to trace and review agent decisions for compliance, which can especially help companies in highly regulated industries. Kramer writes this stance on AI agents is intended to meet companies where they are, integrating new capabilities into the functions they’re already using. Much has been said about how AI-powered coding can transform the programming industry. But is AI-generated code any good? Forbes senior contributor Adrian Bridgwater took a deep dive into this question, asking Yrieix Garnier, vice president of product at Datadog for his observations. So far, many of the problems between expectations and output come from prompting. Better code, Bridgwater writes, comes from more structured and detailed instructions of what it needs to do and how. The only context that should be included is that which is immediately relevant—extra context may lead to coding errors. But with access to the right data and in the optimal setup, an AI coding app can be a valuable collaborator, he writes. Data privacy is becoming an increasingly more important topic, especially as different countries and states roll out different privacy laws. I talked to Andy Sambandam, founder and CEO of AI-powered data privacy company Clarip, about how companies can ensure that they are in compliance wherever they operate. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. When privacy laws in Europe went into effect, there were different instances of some social media platforms that complied with those jurisdictions’ more stringent privacy requirements. Are the platforms still working on multiple versions, or are they figuring out how to make one system that follows privacy laws? Sambandam: We are a data privacy platform. We’re right in the middle of this thing, and we have a lot of customers that have presence in the EU, in Germany and Spain and in Italy and France and U.K. Companies still, even to this day, take an approach where they [decide], ‘Hey, if a visitor’s coming in from the EU or to our site in the EU, then we’re not going to track this data. Or if it’s coming from America and a certain state, we’re going to not do anything. We’re going to collect all the data and share it freely.’ This has actually given a raise to a pretty interesting subset of services. There are companies using IP address to understand where you’re coming from, which city or country you belong to. You can make a call to understand where that user is coming from: Is [a person] coming from Germany or is she coming from Virginia? Those types of calls are happening seamlessly behind the scenes. These providers are growing tremendously because companies started using some of these tools behind the scenes. The tools, whether it’s ours or other tools, have technology to tweak or configure their platform so that they can decide where somebody is coming from and then track or not track, or use third-party cookies or not use third-party cookies. Tech companies are made up of people who create the tech part, but then there are different departments, like legal and marketing. Do they understand exactly what the ramifications are between privacy laws and what they mean to all countries? The simple and honest answer to your question is not at all. They don’t understand. I see this personally in many of the large Fortune 100 companies that I engage with. The person in the IT world, for example, they’re not really thinking about privacy. If you’re a CIO, you are a business person saying, ‘Hey, I need this feature to be built.’ The developer, the engineer, they’re just going and writing a piece of code. Especially in the last 10, 15 years, software development has almost become like Lego building blocks. If you want to build something, you go download some existing library and then build things on top of it. By nature, software is collecting and sharing data downstream. The IT person or the engineers, they’re not really thinking privacy that much, but the legal and compliance people are. At the same time, I’ve seen marketing and sales team members, for them, data collection and analytics is super important so that they can do retargeting. You’ve probably seen this: You’re looking for something or talking to your friend about a certain thing, and all of a sudden you start seeing ads for that red sweater or shoes or ticket to the Caribbean. It’s a complex issue. The marketing team [can go to] extra lengths to find ways to circumvent these privacy laws. But then the privacy teams are like, ‘Hey, no, you’re not supposed to do this because we have these laws.’ I’ve seen companies where if the chief compliance officer or legal officer [comes from] a much larger state, those companies’ privacy programs will be more strict and stringent. Where the marketing rules, you’re going to see they have the upper hand. What do you suggest that a company working in this space do to make sure that they are complying with all applicable laws everywhere without being too careful? Try to do what’s in the best interest of your customers. If you have consent from your customers to share data, then do that. But you have to be upfront about it. How often do you actually read terms and conditions or a privacy notice top to bottom? Never, right? It’s simplifying that and telling people what data are you collecting, who are you going to share with and how are you going to use it. If you can show that true value proposition, people are willing to share. If you want to receive coupons for Black Friday, $25 off or 25% off, but you’ve got to give an email address or sign up for a newsletter, then you’re going to do it. You’ve got to avoid dark patterns. Don’t try to sneak something in the middle of your privacy policy that’s 4,000 words long. Sometimes, the company is challenged on what they say in the project policy is one thing. What’s actually happening behind the scenes is something else. Legal people don’t understand technology evolving, and they may have returned a project policy 12 months ago that’s no longer valid. Now, something’s changed in that technology ecosystem. Doing annual checks or quarterly audits, and being transparent, getting consent are some big common sense things you can do that could get you out of trouble and that would help you in the balances. While AI can work harder than a person, it can also fail harder. Here are some tips to maximize the assistance you get from the technology and prevent the deepest pitfalls. In order to lead to growth, AI innovation needs safeguards and governance, but it also needs to be able to compete—something proven by the recipients of this year’s Nobel Prize in Economics.

Title: Kieran Quilligan suffered multiple fractures, court hears
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/courts/2025/1016/1538977-quilligan-trial/
Time Published: 2025-10-16T17:14:38Z
Full Content:
Jennie O\u0027Sullivan The trial of two men for the murder of Kieran Quilligan - who had been missing for five months - has been told that there were multiple fractures to his bones, consistent with blows from a blunt weapon, similar to a hammer. However, Assistant State Pathologist Dr Margot Bolster said she could not say what the cause of death was, or when Mr Quilligan died, due to the level of body decompositon which meant there were no organs to examine or toxicology reports available. Kieran Quilligan, who was 47, was first reported missing on 1 September 2023. His body was found in a jute bag in a ravine at Whitewell, adjacent to the Midleton to Whitegate road, on 28 January 2024. Luke Taylor, 27, formerly of Cherry Lawn, Blackrock in Cork, and 33-year-old Niall Long, formerly of St Michael's Close, Mahon in Cork, both deny murdering Mr Quilligan. In her evidence at the Central Criminal Court, sitting in Cork, Dr Bolster said that before she carried out a post-mortem examination, she examined the body at the scene. She described going down a ravine, 8-10m from the roadway, where there was a jute bag covered in mud and vegetation. Underneath this was another jute bag, she said, "partially open, with a pelvic bone protruding". Dr Bolster also said that she could see ribs and "a huge skull with a bag around it, tied with a knot". She told the jury of two women and ten men that the post-mortem the following day revealed multiple fractures to the bones, both old and recent. Recent traumas, she said, included displaced fractures to both head and neck, fractures to the left ankle, fractures to the cheekbones, a depressed fracture to the left of the skull extending to the top of the head, and across the palate. There were fractures to the upper and lower jaw bones, with only one tooth remaining either at death or post-mortem. There were also multiple fractures to the chest and ribs, a displaced fracture to the right scapula with a small piece of bone missing, a fracture of the right upper limb, as well as a lower limb fracture of the right thigh bone, suggesting a blow with a blunt instrument, like a hammer, Dr Bolster said. Mr Quilligan had received multiple blows of a blunt weapon, like a hammer, she added. But as no internal organs were left, or toxicology available, she could not say what the cause of death was, or determine a precise cause. Under cross-examination by Ray Boland, Senior Counsel for Niall Long, Dr Bolster said that Mr Quilligan's drug use would have increased his vulnerability to death by assault. Asked by Senior Counsel Brendan Grehan, for Luke Taylor, about the plastic bags with knots around the victim's neck, Dr Bolster said that it looked like they were used to move the body. "There's no evidence that there were bags over the head of the deceased. They were possibly used as a ligature, possibly used to carry the body," she said. The pathologist also indicated that there was no evidence of a shooting or stab wounds. Another witness, Sergeant Maurice O'Connor, of Anglesea Street Garda Station, gave evidence of examining mobile phones seized during a search of a house in Mahon two weeks after Mr Quilligan was reported missing. In particular, he referred to Whatsapp messages between Janice Long, and her son, Niall Long. In a message, sent on 2 September, she asked: "Ok, my jeep stinks of Dettol?" and the reply from his mobile number was: "Yeah, it does. The fella who robbed me and cut my neck got a hiding and was thrown in the boot", Sgt O'Connor told the court. The trial before Ms Justice Siobhán Lankford has adjourned for the day and will continue tomorrow. © RTÉ 2025.

The Wall Street giant said Thursday it will retool one of its money market funds to cater explicitly to U.S. stablecoin issuers, by making the fund an approved reserve asset for such tokens under the recently passed GENIUS Act. The BlackRock Select Treasury Based Liquidity Fund (BSTBL) will remove agency investments, shorten the maturity of its investments in U.S. Treasuries, and add overnight repurchase agreements as an eligible asset, in a bid to make the fund both compliant with GENIUS and maximally liquid for stablecoin issuers. Jon Steel, global head of product for BlackRock’s cash management business, said Thursday that the company has seen increased demand from stablecoin issuers seeking reserve management options in the wake of GENIUS’s passage. “We believe [the fund] positions BlackRock as one of the reserve asset managers of choice for the digital payments ecosystem,” Steel said in a statement. BlackRock’s bold push into stablecoin reserves is all but certain to have a significant impact on the sector. Earlier this week, the company reported that its cash management business has surpassed $1 trillion in assets under management for the first time ever. Its spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are also handily the largest trading on Wall Street. Today’s development is far from the firm’s first stablecoin foray, though. In 2022, BlackRock led a $400 million funding round for USDC issuer Circle, in a deal that made the asset manager a primary holder of Circle’s reserves. Crypto has been top of mind for BlackRock this week. On Tuesday, the company’s CEO, Larry Fink, announced the firm is currently developing its own technology to tokenize all manner of traditional assets. “It is our belief that we need to be moving rapidly,” Fink said at the time. “We need to be tokenizing all assets, especially assets that have multiple levels of intermediaries.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: How The SEC’s Ethereum Nod Could Unlock A Trillion-Dollar Market

ByJon Helgi Egilsson, Contributor. “I do believe we’re just at the beginning of the tokenization of all assets — from real estate to equities to bonds, across the board,” said Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, in an interview with CNBC. Coming from the world’s largest asset manager, it’s a strong signal. In parallel, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission took a quieter but equally telling step: a nod to Ethereum’s ERC-3643 standard, a framework that encodes regulatory compliance directly into digital tokens. In plain terms, it means law can now travel with the asset — every share, bond, or fund can carry its own rules, embedded directly in its software code — the smart contract. That shift is dramatically accelerating a trillion-dollar tokenized asset market, where law and regulatory compliance move with the asset and live on the blockchain. When SEC Chairman Paul S. Atkins explicitly refers to a blockchain token standard, it’s a sign that finance itself is changing. In a recent speech, Atkins described how compliance requirements could be written directly into smart contracts — citing ERC-3643, the Ethereum-based standard that embeds regulatory safeguards into tokenized securities. It was a subtle but historic moment. A top U.S. regulator recognizing code itself as a tool to ensure regulatory compliance on-chain. The idea behind ERC-3643 is simple but radical — make regulation part of the token itself. Each token carries its own rulebook: who can hold it, where it can trade, and when it can be redeemed. Every transfer automatically checks both sides for legal eligibility. If conditions aren’t met, the transaction never happens. When I met Luc Falempin, co-author of the protocol and co-founder of the startup Tokeny, he recalled the problem that started it all. “Financial institutions loved blockchain but couldn’t use it,” he said. “The tools were outdated, and compliance was manual. We made the rules part of the asset.” That insight led to T-REX, meaning ‘token for regulated exchanges,’ developed for real-world projects tokenizing equities and real estate with regulators involved from the start. Formalized in a 2018 white paper, it became ERC-3643 in 2021, the Ethereum standard for permissioned tokens that can move peer-to-peer yet remain fully compliant. Ethereum’s open standards power everything from stablecoins to NFTs. ERC-3643 adds a missing layer — a framework for regulated assets that embeds compliance directly into code. It lets law move with the asset. Built on Ethereum’s familiar architecture, ERC-3643 adds identity checks and transfer rules where required by law. Instead of building closed systems, institutions can plug into the same open infrastructure that powers DeFi. “Stablecoins and NFTs changed what could exist on-chain,” said Falempin. “ERC-3643 changes who can hold it and how. It connects innovation to regulation.” While most institutions were experimenting with private blockchains or proprietary solutions, Falempin’s team built openly on Ethereum. “The public EVM ecosystem gave us the libraries, the community, and the speed we needed,” he said. That choice saved years of development and ensured ERC-3643 works across networks. By encoding compliance in open standards, rather than proprietary systems, Tokeny showed that open source can lead to business wins in finance just like it does in the field of technology. In his July 2025 address, Atkins outlined how tokenized assets could comply through “principles-based conditions” rather than rigid, outdated rules — including “verified-pool” functionality and token standards with built-in compliance features such as ERC-3643. The head of the world’s most powerful securities agency cited an Ethereum standard as a model for how law itself can operate on-chain. When legal scholar Lawrence Lessig warned that “code is law” in his book "Code Version 2.0"," he meant that software could shape behavior as powerfully as legislation. Two decades later, that idea has flipped. Law itself now runs on code — embedded directly into digital assets so compliance executes automatically. With ERC-3643, regulation isn’t enforced later; it happens in real time. The law no longer follows the asset. Instead, law travels with it. In May 2025, Apex Group, a 13,000-employee financial-services firm with more than $3 trillion under management, acquired a majority stake in Tokeny and appointed Falempin as the new Head of Product for Apex Digital. It wasn’t an exit — it was a convergence. Apex brings regulatory infrastructure and clients; Tokeny brings the technology and the open standard. “We’re building the digital rails institutions can trust,” Falempin said. “If you lose your wallet, your assets can be recovered. If you change blockchains, your identity follows. That’s how traditional finance works — and how on-chain finance should.” Citi-backed research estimates that $5 trillion of traditional securities could be tokenized by 2030, while Boston Consulting Group puts it closer to $16 trillion. Either way, scale demands compliance. ERC-3643 offers precisely that — compliance by design. A fund issued in Luxembourg can now be held by an investor in Singapore, settled instantly on-chain, and remain compliant in both jurisdictions — because the rules are embedded in the token itself. When asked what legacy he hopes ERC-3643 will leave, Falempin paused.“Now that we have open and cost-efficient blockchain infrastructure, along with a compliant token protocol, we have a massive opportunity to upgrade the financial system,” he said. “Traditional finance is slow, costly, and inaccessible because it relies on endless reconciliation. Blockchain can change that. I believe most capital markets will move on-chain within the next ten years.” The era of tokenized real-world assets is no longer hypothetical — it’s here. And at its core lies a protocol few outside the industry have heard of: ERC-3643, the Ethereum standard turning the promise of tokenized finance into a trillion-dollar reality. What began as an experiment in code is fast becoming one of the new operating systems of global finance.

Title: BlackRock targets stablecoin boom with new fund

BlackRock is expanding its crypto footprint with a new fund tailored for stablecoin issuers. The BSTBL aims to streamline reserve management under the GENIUS Act. BlackRock has launched the Select Treasury Based Liquidity Fund for stablecoin issuers. The fund cements BlackRock’s position as a top reserve manager for stablecoin providers, offering liquidity and GENIUS Act compliance. BlackRock is taking a major step deeper into digital assets, launching a retooled money market fund. According to a CNBC report, the fund is designed for stablecoin issuers as global stablecoin supply surges to an all-time high. Also, the new product, the BlackRock Select Treasury Based Liquidity Fund [BSTBL], aims to help issuers manage reserves more efficiently under the GENIUS Act. The landmark U.S. legislation was signed by President Donald Trump months ago and created the country’s first federal framework for stablecoins. BlackRock said the BSTBL fund now offers greater liquidity, expanded trading hours, and full compliance with the new stablecoin standards. The move positions it to become the go-to reserve manager for the next wave of stablecoin providers. BlackRock already oversees Circle’s $64 billion USDC reserve portfolio. It helped push its cash-management business above $1 trillion in assets last quarter. With the updated BSTBL fund, the firm plans to bring the same model to other issuers. Also, it offers secure, yield-bearing exposure to short-term U.S. Treasurys and government securities. Furthermore, the launch comes as the stablecoin supply reaches a record $302.3 billion, according to recent data. Source: X According to CryptoRank, new entrants such as USDe, USD1, and PYUSD are fueling adoption as institutional capital floods in. BlackRock’s pivot reflects how Wall Street is moving from merely investing in crypto to powering its core financial infrastructure. Stablecoins are increasingly used to settle trades, provide collateral, and transfer value across blockchains—functions that demand the kind of liquidity management BlackRock specializes in. With the GENIUS Act’s clarity and its partnership track record, BlackRock is now positioned to capture a large share of that growth. BlackRock’s latest move extends its crypto presence beyond ETFs and tokenized funds like BUIDL. As the stablecoin market breaks new records, BlackRock is no longer just offering exposure to crypto; it’s becoming part of the system’s foundation.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) posted record earnings and lifted its outlook, in what could be taken as another strong signal of AI demand. The world's largest chip manufacturer posted earnings per share of $2.92 on revenue that surged 41% year-over-year to $33.10 billion in the third quarter, topping analysts' estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. TSMC CEO C.C. Wei pointed to "robust" AI-related demand for the growth, telling investors on Thursday's earnings call that “conviction in the AI megatrend is strengthening and we believe that demand for semiconductors will continue to be very fundamental,” according to a transcript provided by AlphaSense. Results from TSMC, which makes chips for many of the biggest names in AI chip design like Nvidia and AMD, can be taken as an early sign of robust orders and demand for their AI chips, adding another feather in the hat of AI trade bulls. TSMC said it sees fourth-quarter revenue of between $32.2 billion and $33.4 billion, and boosted its 2025 revenue growth forecast to the mid-30% range, up from its previous projection of about 30%. Shares of TSMC climbed to a record high Thursday morning following the news before paring their early gains. The stock has added over 50% in 2025 so far.

by Jason Lemkin | Blog Posts We’re back with another deep dive into the shifting landscape of venture capital, and this week we’re joined by a legend who’s seen it all—Roger Ehrenberg. Roger founded IA Ventures in 2008, building one of the most respected early-stage portfolios in the industry with investments in companies like The Trade Desk, Wise, DataDog, and Digital Ocean. After a successful run, he’s now back in the game with a new fund, bringing 25+ years of institutional investing experience (including stints at Deutsche Bank and CSFB) to bear on today’s radically different market. Joining him are Rory O’Driscoll from Scale Venture Partners, Jason Lemkin from SaaStr, and Harry Stebbings from 20VC for a no-holds-barred conversation about what’s really changing in venture—and what investors are getting dangerously wrong. Bottom Line Up Front: The venture capital playbook is being rewritten in real-time. Three seismic shifts are reshaping how investors think about returns: (1) AI companies are compressing the time from zero to billion-dollar valuations into months, not years, forcing investors to rethink traditional portfolio diversification strategies; (2) the concentration vs. diversification debate has become stage-dependent, with early-stage investors needing 20-25 initial bets before concentrating 75% of capital into 3-5 winners; and (3) the old social contract between founders and investors is breaking down when unprecedented wealth—like $3.5 billion offers—turns multi-period games into single-turn decisions. Meanwhile, the exit bar has doubled from $200M to $400M in ARR, extending the journey to liquidity by 2-3 years and fundamentally changing how investors should think about follow-on capital allocation. Goldman Sachs’ acquisition of Industry Ventures for $665 million (with potential earnouts reaching $970M) provided a masterclass in asset management valuations. The deal traded at roughly 10% of Industry Ventures’ $7 billion in assets under management—a valuation that reflects the economics of secondary markets and fund-of-funds structures. “If you manage 100 billion, the entity is worth 20 billion for someone like Carlyle or KKR where they own all the economics,” explained Rory O’Driscoll of Scale Venture Partners. “Here, which makes sense as a secondary because the economics aren’t typically quite as good as primary investors, it’s at 10%.” The transaction highlighted a critical distinction in venture: not all GP businesses can be sold. “You couldn’t do that with a venture firm, especially a small venture firm, because in the end, all you have is the three people, and if you cash them out 100%, then you don’t have anything,” O’Driscoll noted. For Goldman, the strategic rationale is clear: access to high-fee private assets at a time when public market management fees have compressed to single-digit basis points. The firm’s Apex platform for ultra-high-net-worth clients provides immediate distribution for Industry Ventures’ products. Roger Ehrenberg, founder of IA Ventures and now back in the market with a new fund, emphasized the business model distinction: “Hans built an asset management business. The rest of us here do not run asset management businesses.” Andrew Tullik’s departure from Thinking Machines—a company he co-founded and helped raise $2 billion for at a $10 billion post-money valuation—to join Meta for a reported $3.5 billion sent shockwaves through the venture community. Not because founders leaving isn’t common, but because of what it signals about the new rules of engagement. “In the face of unprecedented wealth, I’m shocked to discover that most people behave badly,” said Jason Lemkin, founder of SaaStr. “Something’s broken in the way that we’re evolving as humans if everything ultimately reduces to what’s in it for me.” But O’Driscoll offered a more clinical perspective: “Once you’re not playing a multi-period game, and when someone’s offering you $3.5 billion, you’re no longer playing a multi-period game. You’re playing a one-and-done. You’re going to get bad human behavior.” The financial calculus is stark. “Would you prefer $2 billion in Thinking Machines unlisted stock with a chance to be amazing or a chance to go bust, or $3.5 billion of liquid Facebook stock over the next 5 years?” O’Driscoll asked. The answer, as Ehrenberg acknowledged, was obvious. This raises profound questions about how investors should adapt. Extended founder vesting, cliff vesting, and repurchase rights are becoming standard protective measures. But the deeper issue remains: when the core asset of these AI investments is “a group of seven engineers,” as O’Driscoll noted, the traditional founder-investor relationship may simply not apply. “The unusual thing as a career trajectory for an engineer—spending 14 years at Meta, bouncing to OpenAI for less than a year, then to Thinking Machines for less than a year, then back to Meta—that’s not crazy,” O’Driscoll observed. “What is unusual is because of the technical nature of these bets, how much reliance we’re putting on the behavior of an engineering/academic talent pool, which probably responds fairly differently than the ‘I’m a founder, I want to be the CEO’ talent pool.” SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son securing a $5 billion margin loan against ARM shares to invest more in OpenAI barely registered as news to veteran observers. “Masa rules,” said Ehrenberg simply. “This is Masa being Masa 100%.” The move represents smart use of leverage—Son still owns 90% of ARM’s roughly $90 billion market cap, giving him $80 billion in equity value to borrow against. A $5 billion margin loan at reasonable rates is “a relatively low octane Masa move,” as Ehrenberg characterized it, noting Son could easily lever up to $25 billion against the ARM position. “This man is full risk on all the time and just wants to get the bet on the table,” Ehrenberg continued. “He’s been spectacularly right at times and spectacularly wrong at times, but spectacularly willing to play, which on behalf of the audience we should be eternally grateful.” The broader context matters: where will the capital come from to fund the massive compute infrastructure AI requires? As Lemkin pointed out, “We’re now building more data centers than office buildings,” with demand for tokens growing exponentially as companies deploy AI agents and applications. The conversation revealed just how far we are from meeting current AI compute demand, let alone future needs. Lemkin shared firsthand experience: “I’ve vibe coded eight apps in 100 days. We have 12 AI agents working at SaaStr now. What I can tell you is today, just what we’re doing today with 12 agents and eight apps, I could use 100x the tokens.” O’Driscoll pointed to recent scaling research that takes a remarkably matter-of-fact view of the investment required: “A whole bunch of these folks are like, ‘Yep, this is the task we’ve embarked on ourselves for the next 5 years and it’s going to take around 1% of GDP to build a compute cluster big enough to get the flops to get the outcome we want.'” The scaling laws have held for six to seven years at high degrees of accuracy, creating confidence that continued investment will yield continued progress. The question isn’t whether the technology will advance—it’s whether the economic returns will justify the capital deployment. “If it’s slowed down, it won’t be because the technology direction is incorrect, it won’t be because the demand isn’t insatiable,” O’Driscoll argued. “It will be purely and simply that the marginal capital provider says, ‘Oh my god, even though the scaling law is holding, the economic return from that investment isn’t holding.'” When Polymarket raised at a $9 billion valuation and Kalshi immediately followed with a $5 billion round from Andreessen Horowitz and Excel, it sparked renewed debate about whether capital can “kingmake” winners in venture. The reality, as Ehrenberg explained, is pure regulatory arbitrage: “This is the purest regulatory arbitrage play of all time. You can look at the cumulative market cap of regulated sports betting and look at how it has dropped in response to the rise of Polymarket and Kalshi, who are not subject to the same rules and regulations.” But O’Driscoll pushed back on the kingmaking narrative: “I don’t think anyone betting on Polly or Kalshi gives a damn how much money they have, provided they can pay their bet, and gives a damn who that money came from.” The distinction matters: kingmaking requires either (1) giving one company so much capital they can overwhelm competitors, or (2) brand-name VCs creating customer preference through their backing. Neither applies to prediction markets, where user loyalty is driven by liquidity and payout reliability, not VC pedigree. “What’s going on here is two non-sports betting companies who are doing ‘prediction markets’ where all we talk about is the 10% of the revenue that’s political and 90% of their business is sports betting, but we’re not calling it that,” O’Driscoll observed. “They’re just killing it because we all love to sports bet.” The discussion revealed sophisticated thinking about how portfolio construction must evolve as the venture landscape changes. Ehrenberg laid out his approach: 20-25 initial portfolio companies, then concentrating 75% of total capital into 3-5 winners through aggressive follow-on investments. “Where I’ve tended to get very concentrated is on the second and third checks, where we’ve gotten deep conviction in a team, their execution, in the market,” Ehrenberg explained. “Three to five companies out of the 20 to 25 constituting 75% of the capital deployed.” The strategy requires treating each follow-on check as an independent decision. When Trade Desk raised its Series A at $280 post-money, Ehrenberg wrote a $3 million check out of a $50 million fund—after having already invested over $2 million across four earlier rounds. That single check turned into $40 million. “We look at every check independent of the check prior, period,” Ehrenberg emphasized. “If I look at that and say the information I’ve got about this being a $300 million or $3 billion—I think this could be a $100 billion company—then I will write a very meaningful check into that company, up to about 10% of the fund.” O’Driscoll pointed out the temporal dynamics: “You have to start off with a significant element of diversification and then concentrate down. We’ve moved from a world where an exit is $200 million in ARR to a world where an exit is $400 million in ARR at an IPO. The finish line has receded another two or three years, which means logically you’ve got more risk and more upside.” Founders Fund’s evolution from 31 investments in Fund I to targeting just 10 in Fund III sparked debate about optimal concentration levels. The key insight: concentration strategy depends entirely on stage and conviction. “The more certain you are that you can call the shots, the more focused you should be,” O’Driscoll noted. “Founders Fund both has the evidence that they can call the shots because they’ve done so, and frankly the confidence to call the shots because they got it right.” But even for growth-stage funds, pure concentration has limits. O’Driscoll was surprised Founders Fund I had 31 investments: “It just didn’t feel in sync with what we’ve seen from these guys in general. I mean, if you look at their SpaceX non-diversification, these guys strike me as the most likely to be most concentrated.” The distinction between growth and early-stage investing matters profoundly. “When you’re still at the ‘will this thing even work’ stage or ‘will it scale,’ you probably need some significant diversification and then concentrate when you’re effectively investing in what should be public companies but are just private,” O’Driscoll argued. “Then the growth fund strategy should be 10 or 11 or 12 deal concentration.” Lemkin offered a contrarian view from his concentrated seed approach: “I’m doing 8% of my fund into almost every deal. I have to have such a high hit rate at seed. Half of them have to work. So it’s a stupid model because you have to turn away Clubhouse and Hop In and maybe even DataDog, but you got to just find the Wises and go all in.” Harry Stebbings challenged the group with a critical observation from his Fund I experience: “When I look back over six years, the best performers—your Linear of the world—were not obvious early, and the early outperformers did not signify enterprise value in the long term. Clubhouse, Hopin, BeReal. If you think you can pick your winners early, I think you are wrong.” Ehrenberg pushed back with nuance, citing dramatically different paths to success across his portfolio. Trade Desk experienced “multiple near-death experiences, multiple exit opportunities, bridging multiple times, didn’t have a product in market for more than a year and a half.” Wise, by contrast, was “as close to an up-and-to-the-right company as I’ve ever been involved with.” The key is recognizing you’re playing “a multi-turn game,” as Ehrenberg emphasized. His first check into Wise was $750K at $5.5M post. “Then AR came in and we piled in with AR to $20M, then we piled in with AR to $160M, and we just kept going. We were 17% of TTD at IPO and we were 13% of Wise at IPO out of a little shitty seed fund.” O’Driscoll validated the uncertainty while offering a path forward: “You don’t always know, but you know more than someone coming in from the outside. So at the margin, you can tilt it your way. And that’s all you can do.” The group agreed that once companies have 12-24 months of revenue data, conviction increases dramatically. O’Driscoll noted Scale’s analysis showed that “if you get the first two years that we underwrote in terms of revenue from the moment of our investment, your probability of getting greater than a 5x goes from 30% to mid-70s.” Lemkin raised the practical challenge facing seed investors today: “What are you going to do when you got in at $8 million post, but the next round’s at $300M or $500M because the AI kids come in? How much of your fund can you really put in? Is it even worth writing that second check?” Ehrenberg’s answer was unequivocal: “We are hyper-disciplined. We look at every check independent of the check prior, period. If I look at that and say I think this could be a $100 billion company, then I will write a very meaningful check into that company, up to about 10% of the fund.” He cited the Trade Desk Series A as example: after writing four small checks totaling just over $2M, the company raised at $280M post. “We wrote a $3 million check out of a $50 million fund into that at a $280 post. That $3 million ended up turning into $40 million, and that was a great investment.” O’Driscoll reframed the concern: “What you’re saying is if all the following rounds are priced incorrectly relative to ultimate exit value, does your strategy work? It’s a fair question. But if the worst thing that happens is my initial check gets marked up and on the follow-on I don’t need to chase the money, then I’m money good on the check I’ve written.” Ehrenberg summarized it perfectly: “It’s a cash-on-cash business. If the rounds trade up to the point where the follow-on round doesn’t have the return, so be it. The worst thing that happens is my initial check is money good, and provided every check you write is money good, in the end you’ll die rich.” One tactical approach emerged as particularly valuable: maintaining parallel LP bases across funds to enable cross-fund investing without conflicts. Ehrenberg explained how this transformed IA Ventures’ flexibility: “All of a sudden we weren’t investing out of a $100 million fund. We were investing out of a $260 million fund.” The strategy requires careful LP base construction from the start. Ehrenberg recalled an early situation where Fund I and Fund II didn’t have matching LPs: “The LPAC was like, ‘Yes, if you want to do it, go do it. Just understand, if this doesn’t work, you got some explaining to do.’ The risk of that check was not simply financial, it was reputational. Ultimately, we ended up deciding not to write that check.” With parallel LPs across later funds, the constraint disappeared, enabling aggressive follow-on capital deployment into breakout companies without creating cross-fund conflicts. O’Driscoll validated the approach while noting the limitation: “Any cross-fund you do is going to be a good deal, otherwise you’re an idiot. So I think good deals you can find follow-on checks where you can cross-fund, even if the LPs aren’t fully aligned between funds, provided you run a process.” The discussion returned repeatedly to one of Peter Thiel’s key lessons about follow-on investing: when a big, reputable outside investor does a follow-on round at what feels like a high price, do everything you can to get into it. “It’s not always true, and I could cite examples where it’s not true,” O’Driscoll acknowledged. “But risk-adjusted, information-adjusted, that next round in the deal that you’ve been in that’s performing well, provided the follow-on price is contemplatable, the advice would be: adjust your scales upward, or don’t be guilty of anchoring on what you did.” The key is recognizing the information asymmetry has shifted. External investors seeing enough signal to lead at elevated prices possess different data than those who invested earlier. As O’Driscoll put it: “You got to find a way to take into account the information since then, both operational and the outside round.” This connects directly to Ehrenberg’s framework of treating each check as an independent decision based on current information, not past pricing. “Everything in life you can price as an option,” Ehrenberg noted. “I walk through life. Everything looks like the Greeks. Everything looks like options theory, because that’s life.” On Portfolio Construction: On Follow-On Capital: On Founder Retention: On Market Dynamics: On Capital Deployment: Roger Ehrenberg on follow-on discipline: “We look at every check independent of the check prior, period. If I look at that and say I think this could be a $100 billion company, then I will write a very meaningful check into that company, up to about 10% of the fund.” Rory O’Driscoll on founder departures: “Once you’re not playing a multi-period game, and when someone’s offering you $3.5 billion, you’re no longer playing a multi-period game. You’re playing a one-and-done. You’re going to get bad human behavior.” Harry Stebbings on portfolio strategy shifts: “I’ve realized even at our stage, you got to be trying to do that more and more because the journey from our stage is still 10 years now, whereas before it was six or seven.” Jason Lemkin on token demand: “I’ve vibe coded eight apps in 100 days. We have 12 AI agents working at SaaStr now. What I can tell you is today, just what we’re doing today with 12 agents and eight apps, I could use 100x the tokens.” Harry Stebbings on early-stage prediction: “When I look back over six years, the best performers—your Linear of the world—were not obvious early, and the early outperformers did not signify enterprise value in the long term. If you think you can pick your winners early, I think you are wrong.” Roger Ehrenberg on investment outcomes: “If the worst thing that happens is my initial check gets marked up and on the follow-on I don’t need to chase the money, then I’m money good on the check I’ve written. Provided every check you write is money good, in the end you’ll die rich.” Rory O’Driscoll on early-stage uncertainty: “You don’t always know, but you know more than someone coming in from the outside. So at the margin, you can tilt it your way. And that’s all you can do.” Jason Lemkin on seed concentration: “I’m doing 5%-8% of my fund into almost every deal. I have to have such a high hit rate at seed for the math to work. So it’s a “stupid” model because you have to turn away stuff with no traction, and maybe even a Datadog, but you got to just find the ones in a tight box and go all in.” Founder SaaStr Email Address Company Job Title Email Address Get from $0 to $100 Million in ARRwith less stress and more success.

As much as 15% of Amazon's HR staff might be cut When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Amazon workers could be facing yet another round of layoffs with as much as 15% of its human resources department at risk, Fortune reports have claimed. Sources confirm that the People eXperience Technology team (Amazon’s HR) is likely to be the hardest hit, but other consumer businesses are also in the firing line. Amazon’s workforce has been steadily decreasing since the end of 2022, with around 27,000 staff being laid off across a range of departments. This is continuing, especially with Amazon recently confirming it expects to cut human workers and replace them with AI. It seems clear that Amazon is reducing its workforce spending in order to prop up the $100 billion spend on data centers and infrastructure to support AI and data processing - pushing the company to a 32% global cloud market share during Q1 of 2025. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, who has overseen somr recent dramatic cuts as well as huge data center spending, wrote in a companywide email, also published on Amazon’s corporate blog; “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” “Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company.” This is part of an industry-wide pattern, with Intel planning to slash around 20% of its workforce, or around 25,000 employees in total. Alongside this, Microsoft let go roughly 9,000 of its staff as it pushes for investment into AI.

Title: TSMC +39% Profit, Sold‑Out 3nm - Chip Scarcity Is Real
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmarkman/2025/10/16/tsmc-39-profit-soldout-3nmchip-scarcity-is-real/
Time Published: 2025-10-16T14:30:20Z

ByJon Markman, Contributor. Skeptics are stuck on "bubble talk," but they’re missing the single clearest market signal of this AI cycle: a brutal, tightening chip supply shortage driven by one company. TSM's Capacity: The Hottest Ticket in TechTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM) just reported a 39% profit surge driven by demand so "insatiable" that even their next-gen 3nm process nodes can’t keep up. Revenue nearly hit $33 billion, with gross margins near 60%. TSM isn’t drowning in stockpiles; it’s running at full throttle, selling every advanced wafer the company can make. Clients like Nvidia, Apple, AMD, Broadcom, and the hyperscalers are gobbling up foundry capacity and pushing prices higher. The supply bottleneck is real and tightening. This market isn’t a bubble; it's a sold-out stadium tour. Tens of thousands are battling for a handful of tickets, driving prices to a premium and fueling frenzy. TSM’s manufacturing capacity is the hottest ticket in tech, with limited supply failing to meet global AI upgrade demand. This shortage is a testament to the overwhelming demand from every major chip designer. Secular Shift, Not Short-Term FadOf course, we’ll see corrections. That is simply gravity in action. But anyone focused on market optimism over fundamentals is fundamentally missing the point. This isn't a fad; it’s a secular shift that’s rewiring the global computing foundation. Naysayers are sleeping on a crucial truth: computing hardware must evolve with software trends. The entire IT landscape is being refitted to process AI workloads. Foundry supply can’t keep pace with soaring demand, proving the strength of this shift. TSM’s raised guidance should be a wake-up call for AI pessimists. The company expects 2025 revenue growth near the mid-30% range, fueled by robust AI demand and new tech ramps like the 2nm nodes this quarter. Scarcity Drives Lasting GrowthThe key insight: it’s not only demand but acute supply scarcity driving this. Excess supply creates bubble fears; here it’s the opposite, indicating lasting pricing power and growth.The supply crunch isn't a warning sign; it's the all-clear signal. Ignoring this fundamental supply-demand imbalance isn't just a bet against the AI trade. It is a bet against the inevitable future of computing. The AI upgrade cycle is unstoppable. For investors, the choice is clear: get aligned with the defining technological momentum of our era, or stay stranded on the sidelines, watching the biggest story in tech history accelerate without you.

Title: Citizens Sees SharpLink as a Breakout Ether Treasury Play With More Than 200% Upside

Citizens has initiated coverage of SharpLink Gaming (SBET) with a market outperform rating and a $50 price target, implying potential upside of more than 200%, the bank said in a Wednesday report. The shares were 2% higher in early trading, around $15.45. The bank’s bullish stance rests on a positive long-term view of ether’s price trajectory, forecasting ETH above $7,000 by 2026 and potentially exceeding $20,000 by 2030. The report argued that SharpLink has quickly emerged as one of the most ambitious ether ETH$3,987.18 treasury operators in the public markets. After accumulating a substantial ETH position, the company has begun deploying those assets into staking and other yield-bearing strategies designed to compound value over time. The stock is a novel entry point for investors seeking leveraged exposure to Ethereum’s growth, analysts led by Devin Ryan wrote. Rather than functioning as a passive vehicle holding bitcoin BTC$108,746.91 or ether, SharpLink aims to actively manage its ETH balance sheet, issuing equity at a premium to net asset value or buying it back when trading below NAV, and using its ETH reserves to capture on-chain yield opportunities, the analysts wrote. Citizens describes this approach as a "flywheel" that can drive NAV per share higher as the Ethereum ecosystem expands and institutional adoption accelerates. The bank's analysts also assigned a premium valuation to SharpLink based on the company’s leadership and strategy.

Title: Why AMD Stock Jumped 50%?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/16/why-amd-stock-jumped-50/
Time Published: 2025-10-16T13:13:18Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock surged by almost 50% between 7/17/2025 and 10/15/2025. The gains come on the back of improving earnings, a recovering CPU market and surging interest in GPUs for artificial intelligence applications. AMD also recently snagged a high profile deal with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, to supply tens of thousands of its GPU chips for 6 gigawatts of computing capacity over the next five years. From a quantitative perspective, the gains were mainly influenced by a 19.3% shift in the company's Net Income Margin (%). While there is more to this story than just figures, let's first analyze the stock price movement by breaking it down into its contributing factors. Investing in individual stocks can be daunting, but there is great advantage in adopting a more diversified approach, such as with the Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Trefis collaborates with Empirical Asset Management – a Boston-based wealth management firm – whose asset allocation strategies have yielded positive returns during the 2008-09 period when the S&P experienced a loss of over 40%. Empirical has integrated the Trefis HQ Portfolio within this asset allocation framework to offer clients superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; it provides a smoother investment experience, as demonstrated by HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Returning to the “change”: The shifts in fundamental factors such as valuation, revenue, and margins reveal a deeper narrative regarding the business and investor sentiment. Below, we highlight key developments that impacted the price movement of AMD stock. To provide context: AMD offers x86 microprocessors, accelerated processing units, chipsets, discrete and integrated GPUs, data center and professional GPUs, as well as development services across computing, graphics, enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom segments. Here Is Why Advanced Micro Devices Stock Moved Our Current Assessment Of AMD Stock Opinion: At the moment, we regard AMD stock as relatively pricey. Why is that? For an in-depth analysis, read Buy or Sell AMD Stock to understand the basis of our current view. Risk: AMD is also vulnerable to significant downturns. It dropped about 83% during the Dot-Com crash and nearly 91% in the Global Financial Crisis. The corrections in 2018 and inflation shock caused losses of 49% and 65%, respectively. Even the Covid sell-off was harsh, erasing over 34%. While solid fundamentals are important, during market downturns, AMD has demonstrated its capacity to incur substantial losses. Consistently identifying winners is not an easy endeavor, particularly given the volatility associated with individual stocks. Conversely, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring a collection of 30 stocks, has a demonstrated history of outperforming the S&P 500 over the past four years. What is the reason for this? On average, HQ Portfolio stocks yielded better returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; resulting in a smoother investment journey, as seen in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: 22 of the most iconic performances by Hispanic artists, including some you may have forgotten about

From inspiring dance crazes in the 1980s and 1990s to topping charts in the streaming era, some of the most influential acts in Latino and Hispanic genres have defined and redefined culture across the US, Latin America, and beyond. And while the announcement of Bad Bunny as the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show performer has ruffled some feathers, he is far from the first Latin artist to perform on the world's biggest stage. Who could forget Shakira and JLo's dazzling show of Latin pride in 2020? As Hispanic Heritage Month wraps up, look back on some of the most iconic performances by Hispanic artists, including a few you might've forgotten about. In 1988, Gloria Estefan became one of the first Latin music artists to perform at a televised American music show when she took the American Music Award stage with Miami Sound Machine. The group performed a medley of their hits, which were topping the charts at the time, like"Rhythm Is Gonna Get You," "Surrender," and "Conga." Madison Square Garden hosted a night of salsa music on October 23, 1993, when Celia Cruz, along with artists like Tito Nieves, La India, Tony Vega, Marc Anthony, and Oscar D'León, took the stage. The four-hour show, which celebrated the growing popularity of salsa music in Hispanic communities in the US, was later released as a live album and video. In its review of the night, The New York Times wrote of Cruz's "iron voice nailing every note perfectly." Reviewer Peter Watrous continued, "'Yo soy la reina!' ('I'm the queen!'), she improvised between riffs, 'Yo soy la candela!' ('I'm the hottest!'), and there wasn't a soul to contest her." Then a rising star in the Tejano genre, Selena Quintanilla performed her last televised performance on February 26, 1995, when she sang in the Houston Astrodome in front of a record-breaking attendance of 61,000 fans during her Amor Prohibido Tour. Wearing the now-iconic purple jumpsuit, the singer performed some of her hits, including "Como la Flor," "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom," "Amor Prohibido," as well as a medley of disco music with tributes to Donna Summer, Gloria Gaynor, Van McCoy, and Lipps Inc. The show was later released as a live album and DVD. On a night marked by iconic Y2K pop culture moments like Lil' Kim's daring outfit and Britney Spears' VMAs debut, Ricky Martin made history as the first Latin artist to perform at the MTV VMAs show. The Puerto Rican singer performed his hits "She's All I Ever Had" and "Livin' la Vida Loca," and later took home five awards, including best pop video and best dance video. Hispanic musicians also had a significant presence at the 2000 Grammy Awards, when Marc Anthony took the stage alongside a group of musicians, including Ricky Martin, Ibrahim Ferrer, Chucho Valdés, and Poncho Sánchez, in a tribute to Latin music. Speaking of iconic, it was also the night Jennifer Lopez — Anthony's future wife — wore the green Versace dress. During the first edition of the annual Latin Grammys, Cruz, Martin, and Estefan performed a tribute to Tito Puente, a legendary Puerto Rican musician who died earlier that year. The performance was introduced by Jennifer Lopez, who lauded Puente's accomplishments in helping to fuel the growing popularity of Latin music. Latin rock also had a significant spot at the inaugural Latin Grammys, with Maná and Carlos Santana performing their collaboration "Corazón Espinado," which later won record of the year and best rock duo or group with vocals. Daddy Yankee's "Gasolina" introduced Latin urban music to worldwide audiences, and at the 2005 VMAs, the rapper took the stage alongside Don Omar and Tego Calderón for a three-song medley showcasing reggaeton. Don Omar performed a verse from "Reggaeton Latino" while sporting the Puerto Rican Flag, then Tego Calderón followed with "Abayarde," and Daddy Yankee closed the set with "Gasolina." The performance was a "milestone from reggaeton's first mainstream explosion," Remezcla wrote. Just earlier that night, Shakira and Alejandro Sanz made history performing the first-ever Spanish song at the VMAs. While Shakira won her first Grammy in 2000, it wasn't until 2007 that she made her performance debut at the awards show. The Colombian singer, along with collaborator Wyclef Jean, performed their hit "Hips Don't Lie," with a Bollywood-inspired show featuring an ensemble of dancers, a backflip from the rapper, and Shakira's iconic belly dance. In a musical tribute sponsored by then-President Barack Obama, an array of Latin artists took the stage at the White House's South Lawn, including acts like Gloria Estefan, José Feliciano, Marc Anthony, Los Lobos, Aventura, Thalía, Tito El Bambino, Pete Escovedo, and a band led by Sheila E. Each artist performed a couple of songs, ranging from tropical styles like salsa and bachata to Latin pop and Chicano rock-n-roll. The Obamas even joined the performance, playing along on the timbales at one point of the show. Mexican icon Juan Gabriel performed a nearly 40-minute-long medley of his top hits at the 10th-annual Latin Grammys, where he was honored with the Person of the Year award. The performance broke the record for being the show's longest performance. The singer performed songs like "Hasta que te conocí" and "El Noa Noa" with a backing mariachi band. If you lived through the 2010s, you'll remember the plethora of Pitbull features that sat on the music charts for years on end. Mr. Worldwide, during his second year hosting the American Music Awards show, performed a medley of some of his chart-topping hits, including "Fireball" and "Time of Our Lives." In previous years, he also took the AMAs stage with collaborators like Enrique Iglesias, Marc Anthony, Jennifer Lopez, Kesha, and Christina Aguilera. He performed atop a globe, obviously. The next year, Selena Gomez performed her Charli XCX-penned song "Same Old Love" at the AMAs in a dramatic, theatrical, and noir-inspired performance. For added drama, Justin Bieber, her ex, was also in the audience. By 2014, Shakira had become the face of the FIFA World Cup following the worldwide success of her song "Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)," which was the official song for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. However, during the following tournament, the Colombian singer returned to the soccer stage — this time alongside Carlinhos Brown — during the opening ceremony of the final game to perform the song "La La La," which, although it wasn't one of the official World Cup songs, became a massive hit. She was followed by Santana, Wyclef Jean, and Alexandre Pires, who performed the official World Cup anthem for that year, "Dar Um Jeito (We Will Find a Way)." In 2018, MTV awarded JLo with the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award at the VMAs. During her 15-minute medley, the singer opened with "Waiting for Tonight" and performed hits such as "Love Don't Cost a Thing," "Dance Again," "On The Floor," "All I Have," and "Dinero." "J.Lo's medley was a reminder of the sheer number of hits she's provided over the years, and that she's still one of the most talented dancers pop music has seen," wrote Vanity Fair. Following the success of "Despacito," Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee performed the record-breaking song at the Grammy Awards in a high-energy performance, joining a small group of Latin performers at the awards show. The duo performed the fully Spanish version of the song instead of the English remix featuring Justin Bieber. That same night, Cardi B made her Grammys debut alongside Bruno Mars when the duo sang "Finesse (Remix)" in a colorful '90s-inspired performance, in what Billboard called "one of the most captivating moments of the 2018 Grammys." Later that night, Mars took home the album of the year, record of the year, and song of the year awards. Bad Bunny and J Balvin made their VMAs debut in 2019 with a peculiar and cartoon-esque performance of "Que Pretendes" from their collaborative release, "Oasis." While the duo sang in oversized costumes, the stage was filled onscreen with VR figures. At one point in the performance, the two sang while floating over the stage. Pitchfork called it "bonkers." Talk about an unlikely combination. At the 2019 Latin Grammys, longtime buddies Marc Anthony and Will Smith recruited the then-up-and-coming Puerto Rican star for a performance of their joint collaboration, "Está Rico." Camila Cabello made history as the first female Latin artist to open the annual Grammy Awards ceremony in 2019, when she performed "Havana" alongside artists like Ricky Martin, J Balvin, trumpeter Arturo Sandoval, and rapper Young Thug, who is featured on the song. The performance was marked by the Cuban-Mexican Fifth Harmony alumna holding up a newspaper reading "build bridges, not walls," in a political statement. A lot of things happened in 2020, but Shakira and JLo's Super Bowl halftime show was one to remember. The two icons shared the stage, performing hits from both of their discographies like "She Wolf," "Whenever, Wherever," and "Hips Don't Lie" during Shakira's section, and "Jenny from the Block," "On the Floor," and "Get Right" during Jennifer Lopez's section. Bad Bunny and J Balvin also made appearances during the performance, bringing together the Puerto Rican and Colombian heritage of the headliners. The two closed the show by performing "Let's Get Loud" and "Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)" together. Karol G made her VMAs debut with a medley of "Mañana Será Bonito (Bichota Season)" tracks, including "Oki Doki" and "Tá OK," bringing a piece of her record-breaking stadium show to the awards show audience.

Title: Why NVIDIA Stock Rose 80% In 6 Months?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/16/why-nvidia-stock-rose-80-in-6-months/
Time Published: 2025-10-16T12:23:47Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. From a quantitative perspective, the 77.2% change in NVIDIA (NVDA) stock from 4/18/2025 to 10/15/2025 was chiefly motivated by a 48.4% change in the company’s P/E Multiple. While there is more to this narrative than mere numbers, let’s first analyze the stock price movements by examining its contributing elements. Investing in a single stock can be risky, yet a significantly diversified approach offers great value, such as the one we adopt with Trefis High-Quality Portfolio. Should you invest in a single stock you like or create a portfolio designed for success across market cycles? Our data illustrates that the High Quality Portfolio has transformed stock-picking uncertainties into consistent market-beating performance. This portfolio is integrated into the asset allocation strategy of Empirical Asset Management – a Boston-based wealth manager and Trefis partner – whose asset allocation framework produced positive returns during the 2008-09 timeframe when the S&P declined by more than 40%. Returning to the “change”: the alterations in fundamental factors such as valuation, revenues, and profit margins have an underlying narrative regarding business and investor sentiment. Below, we have pinpointed crucial developments that affected the stock price movement for NVDA stock. Before that, as a brief background: NVDA provides graphics, computing, and networking solutions for the gaming, professional visualization, datacenter, and automotive sectors globally, in addition to a strategic partnership with Kroger Co. Opinion: We currently consider NVDA stock appealing yet volatile. Why is that? Take a look at the complete narrative. Read Buy or Sell NVDA Stock to understand what drives our current view. Risk: That said, Nvidia isn’t exempt from significant declines. It dropped 68% during the Dot-Com bubble and suffered an even steeper decline of 85% during the Global Financial Crisis. During the inflation shock, it declined approximately 66%, while the corrections in 2018 and the Covid pandemic pulled it down by 56% and 38%, respectively. Even with strong fundamentals, Nvidia’s history indicates it can incur steep losses when market conditions turn. Consistently selecting winners is a challenging endeavor – particularly given the volatility linked with a single stock. Instead, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring a collection of 30 stocks, has a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the past four-year period. What is the reason for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have historically yielded better returns with less risk when compared to the benchmark index; showcasing a more stable performance as highlighted in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Stock futures are pointing to a higher open for major indexes as investors digest a flurry of corporate earnings reports, while gold continues hitting new highs; Walmart (WMT) shares are higher after closing at record highs the last two days following news of the retailer's collaboration with OpenAI; Salesforce (CRM) shares are gaining after the company issued new long-term revenue projections; Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) shares are rising as strong AI chip demand continues to fuel sales growth; and Nestlé is laying off 16,000 workers. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are higher as strong earnings reports from banks continue to roll in. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.2% recently, after the blue chip index closed fractionally lower yesterday. Futures linked to the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq, both of which finished higher on Wednesday, were up 0.4% and 0.6%, respectively, this morning. Gold was up 1.4% at $4,260 an ounce, as investors continue pouring money into the safe-haven asset amid stock market volatility and economic uncertainty. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) was little changed at $111,600, trading near its lowest levels of the month and well below the record high of $126,000 set early last week. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on a array of loans, was at 4.01%, down from 4.04% yesterday. Walmart (WMT) shares are slightly higher in premarket trading after closing at record highs the past two sessions following news the retail giant would team up with ChatGPT developer OpenAI. The collaboration, announced Tuesday, will allow shoppers to discover and buy items via instant checkout directly through the AI platform. The stock has gained 21% so far this year, outpacing broader market returns, as the retailer has benefitted from strong e-commerce sales and demand across income levels amid economic uncertainty. Walmart shares were up 0.1% before the opening bell, after gaining nearly 7% over the previous two sessions. Salesforce (CRM) shares are surging in premarket trading after the customer relationship software maker announced new long-term revenue targets as part of its annual conference. Salesforce said it expects $60 billion in revenue in 2030, which would reflect an annual growth rate of around 10%. The projections exclude impacts from the company’s $8 billion acquisition of data management software provider Informatica. The fresh outlook comes after the cloud-based software company recently issued current-quarter growth projections that came in below expectations. Salesforce shares, which come into today's session down roughly 30% so far in 2025, were up nearly 6% in recent trading. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) reported a huge increase in third-quarter revenue as the chipmaker continued to see strong demand amid the AI spending boom. TSMC posted third-quarter revenue of $33.10 billion, up 41% from the year-ago period and 10% from the second quarter this year. The company is forecasting fourth-quarter revenue of between $32.2 billion and $33.4 billion. TSMC shares were up 2% in recent premarket trading. Nestlé announced plans to cut 16,000 jobs over the next two years. About 12,000 of the eliminated will be in white-collar roles, while the remainder will be manufacturing and supply chain jobs. Nestlé said it expects to save CHF 1.0 billion ($1.256 billion) by the end of 2027. The move by new CEO Philipp Navratil comes after the company dismissed its former chief executive in September over an undisclosed relationship with a subordinate. Nestlé shares traded in Switzerland moved sharply higher Thursday.

LVMH’s rise also added to chairman Bernard Arnault’s fortune by more than $18 billion. The performance of LVMH, which includes brands like Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Sephora, will “likely set a positive tone for the upcoming luxury reporting season,” analysts said. A positive turnaround for sales in China drove the gains, Reuters reported. Despite ongoing trade tensions, the Chinese government said Apple would boost investment in the country, though it did not provide details on the size of the investment. The company’s CEO Tim Cook made a trip to China this week, even as President Donald Trump has threatened 100% tariffs on the country after it enacted export controls over rare earths. A federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump Administration from laying off workers during the government shutdown, meaning those employees will have their jobs secured for at least two more weeks. Federal workers’ unions had argued the layoffs were being used as an unlawful pressure tactic against Democrats, and the judge said Wednesday that the government is using the shutdown to “assume all bets are off, the laws don’t apply to them anymore.” As the One Big Beautiful Bill Act limits student loans for parents and graduate students, the nation’s Historically Black Colleges and Universities, whose students rely more heavily on federal loans, are bracing for impact. But some billionaires are stepping in and supporting the institutions—including Atlanta Falcons owner and Home Depot cofounder Arthur Blank, who this week committed $50 million in scholarships for students at four Atlanta HBCUs. Andy Slavitt left his government job and set out to use technology to improve healthcare for underserved and low-income communities in 2018 through healthcare-focused VC firm Town Hall Ventures. Since then, the firm has invested in 35 companies and started seven others. Now, Town Hall Ventures told Forbes it has raised $440 million for a fourth fund, bringing its total assets under management to $1.4 billion. A Colorado couple raked in millions in sales for a device that claims to help stop people from choking to death. The Dechoker was marketed as FDA-approved—but the government agency had not only never approved the device, it told the Carvers to stop selling the product entirely in 2023, records show. Anti-choking devices have been shown to be potentially more harmful than helpful, and Amazon began removing the Dechoker and rival unapproved suction devices after Forbes asked the retailer about them. Brown University became the latest institution to reject a deal with the Trump Administration that would have provided special federal funding considerations in exchange for widespread changes to its policies. In a letter to government officials, the school’s president said the deal would “restrict academic freedom” and undermine the autonomy of its governance. The U.S. military is considering land strikes against Venezuelan drug cartels, President Donald Trump told reporters Wednesday, a potential escalation of the controversial military operations aimed at curbing drug smuggling into the U.S. The president also said he had authorized the CIA to conduct covert operations in the country, and alleged that Venezuela’s top officials have “emptied their prisons into the United States of America.” Inflation and tariff disruptions have had a big impact on the cost of your morning cup of joe, as coffee prices have risen more than 20% since August 2024, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In July, President Donald Trump imposed tariffs of 50% on Brazil and 20% on Vietnam, the two countries that together produce more than half of the world’s coffee beans. For decades, Stanford Health Care had been trying to install a state-of-the-art proton therapy machine to add to its array of high tech cancer treatments. But try as it might, it just couldn’t find a place to put one. Three years ago, Stanford found an alternative: Startup Leo Cancer Care had developed a variation on the standard proton therapy machine design. Instead of rotating the radiation beam around a patient laying flat in a bed, it used a chair in which a seated patient rotated around the beam. That seemingly simple change had transformative consequences. It helped trim the space required for the machine to about 1,700 square feet from more than 29,000 square feet—a more than 90% reduction. That made it significantly less expensive and easier to fit where they wanted it. So Stanford teamed up Leo Cancer Care, which makes the chair and imaging technology, with Mevion Medical Systems, which had developed a small proton accelerator, and in 2024 they started building out the new facility. It’s still early days for Leo Cancer Care, and this is a hard and capital-intensive business. But the company, which has raised a total of $150 million at a valuation of $280 million, including a recent $40 million round led by Catalio Capital Management, is gaining traction. Revenue reached $11 million last year, and is expected to more than double this year. WHY IT MATTERS The number of proton therapy machines in use today is tiny: There are only 46 proton centers in the U.S. and just over 100 worldwide, Leo Cancer Care cofounder and CEO Stephen Towe said, while the global need for them is closer to 2,000. Proton therapy provides greater targeting in cancer treatment, allowing patients to receive effective therapy with less damage to normal tissue and lower radiation risk, but its cost has been prohibitive.

Nestlé layoffs: Switzerland-based fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) giant Nestlé SA is planning to cut 16,000 jobs after its new Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Philipp Navratil, took charge and vowed to turn the company around. Nestlé SA's move to cut 16,000 jobs represents nearly 6% of the total number of employees working at the FMCG firm. “The world is changing, and Nestlé needs to change faster,” Nestlé CEO Philipp Navratil said in an official statement. “This will include making hard but necessary decisions to reduce headcount.” However, the company also announced that a layoff of this scale will be carried out over the next two years, affecting employees working for the KitKat candy bar maker in an effort to save 1 billion Swiss francs in costs. Mint reported earlier that the layoffs include 12,000 white-collar jobs, in addition to the 4,000 job cuts already underway in production and the supply chain. 1. TCS or Tata Consultancy Services: Tata Group's IT arm, Tata Consultancy Services, has already laid off 6,000 employees, which represents 1% of its global headcount. The IT major also plans to cut another 6,000 jobs, bringing the total to 12,000 layoffs, or approximately 2% of its total workforce, as part of the company's restructuring plans amid the push for artificial intelligence (AI) in the industry. 2. Nestlé SA: The FMCG giant plans to cut 16,000 jobs, which amounts to nearly 6% of the company's total workforce. 3. Amazon: Global e-commerce giant Amazon is planning to cut nearly 15% of job roles in departments, including human resources (People eXperience Technology team), consumer business, among others. 4. Google: Big tech giant reportedly laid off 100 employees in design-related roles. 5. Accenture: The tech company in September 2025 announced that they are going to lay off more than 11,000 employees in a company-wide restructuring move. 6. Salesforce: Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has cut the jobs of 4,000 customer support staff as AI tools take over in the IT and services industry. The company reduced its customer support workforce from 9,000 employees to 5,000 employees, marking 4,000 job cuts. 7. Microsoft: In 2025, Microsoft laid off more than 15,000 employees and around 2,000 more staff who were deemed as underperformers from the big tech firm. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, in a memo, explained how the company has carried out the restructuring based on an objective measure considering the firm's ‘market performance, strategic positioning, and growth all point up and to the right.’ Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Title: GE Vernova Stock To $1000+?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/16/ge-vernova-stock-to-1000/
Time Published: 2025-10-16T09:00:00Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. GE Vernova (NYSE: GEV), the newly independent energy and electrification giant spun off from General Electric, has rapidly emerged as one of the most captivating industrial narratives in the market. Shares currently trade around $640, having increased significantly since the April 2024 listing, as investors flock to opportunities associated with the global energy transition and AI-driven power demand. Yet, with valuations soaring, many are questioning: can GE Vernova continue to ascend—or is it already fully valued? However, if you are looking for an upside with less volatility than owning an individual stock, take a look at the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns of over 105% since its launch. As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; providing a steadier ride, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Additionally, see Can PayPal Stock Fall To $50? For GE Vernova’s stock price to reach the $1,000 level, investors would need to witness a combination of robust revenue growth, significant margin expansion, and persistent belief in its long-term earnings potential. The company is anticipated to generate about $37 billion in revenue in 2025, but if management successfully implements its strategy across gas power, grid, and electrification, total revenue could rise to approximately $55–60 billion by 2028. If operating margins enhance towards the mid-teens, that would equate to net income of around $6–7 billion. Should investors continue to value the company as a leading high-growth energy transition player instead of a conventional industrial entity, a forward P/E ratio of 50×—akin to the current premium valuation—would suggest an equity value in the vicinity of $900–1,000 per share. In essence, achieving $1,000 is not implausible, but it relies on GE Vernova maintaining rapid revenue growth, enhancing profitability to top-tier standards, and preserving its growth-stock valuation multiple. Any degradation in execution or compression of that multiple would render the target significantly more difficult to attain. At $640 per share, GE Vernova is valued like a leader in energy transformation—not a turnaround story. The company’s fundamentals are strengthening, and its involvement in electrification, grid modernization, and AI-driven power demand renders the long-term narrative compelling. If management can effectively implement its growth strategy—then valuations in the $900–1,000 range are mathematically feasible. However, with forward multiples already nearing 50× earnings and 90× EV/EBITDA, the margin for error is exceedingly slim. For investors who trust in GE Vernova’s execution and the global power demand cycle, the stock still presents significant long-term potential. For others, it might be wise to wait for a pullback before re-entering. Now, we apply a risk assessment framework while constructing the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which, consisting of 30 stocks, has a proven track record of consistently outperforming the S&P 500 over the last four-year period—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. . Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided better returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; providing a steadier ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

with Dave Vellante Dive into tech news and cutting-edge insights on current technology topics with Breaking Analysis hosted by Dave Vellante. Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and theCUBE Research communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Salesforce is moving from the hype phase of generative AI into doing the harder engineering work to create the agentic enterprise. Dreamforce 2025 showed us that the company which created the original SaaS model now wants to lead what we call service as software. In our view, this represents a profound revolution, not just in technology but in business. In a world where AI agents deliver outcomes across systems of record, systems of engagement and systems of intelligence. Our assessment is that Salesforce’s AgentForce 360 platform is crossing day one early version to attack day two problems and customer requirements. What does that mean? It’s no longer just demoing copilots inside Customer 360. Rather, the company is going after the messy problems of observability, orchestration, data quality, etc. that determine whether agent systems can scale in the enterprise. The shift to service as software will bring learning curve advantages, software- like marginal economics, and winner- take- most dynamics to all companies across every industry, not just tech vendors. We believe those firms that can more quickly jump on the AI experience curve will see substantially increased benefits relative to their competitors. However, our research suggests that data management We’re on the cusp of a new software- enabled business model that will determine winners and losers in the coming decades. We call this service -as-software. Specifically, we believe enterprises will begin to organize knowledge work in new ways, that harmonize islands of automation into a build-to-order assembly line for knowledge work. Firms that aggressively pursue this opportunity will be on a learning curve that we think will create sustainable competitive advantage, and, importantly, a winner-take-most dynamic. Now, we’re not just talking about technology vendors here. Rather, we believe new technology, operational, and business models will emerge, and apply to all enterprises across every industry. In this breaking analysis, theCUBE Research team presents a new way to think about how businesses will operate in the AI era; with implications for application developers, edge deployments, and security / governance models. With a glimpse toward the path that we think organizations can take to go from where they are today into the future. For the past several decades, Cybersecurity has been an unfair fight. The economics have favored attackers, which have access to sophisticated resources, lower costs, fast innovation cycles and deep knowledge of vulnerabilities. Defenders, by contrast, bear the full burden of securing sprawling networks, fragmented technologies, and human error, all while operating under legal, regulatory, and financial scrutiny. In our view, the Intel–NVIDIA pact further accentuates NVIDIA’s dominance and represents a final handoff of the baton in the race to the next era of computing. Just as Intel had a lock on the market in the 80s and 90s, NVIDIA has now extended its moat deep into the x86 ecosystem (in both PCs and the data center) and expanded its TAM by $500B to $1T by our estimates. The subtext here is that Lip-Bu Tan is taking necessary steps to save Intel. In doing so, he’s hitching the company’s wagon to the future, which is being defined by CUDA, NVIDIA’s software platform. This move by our estimates, increases Intel’s TAM by $100B and breathes new life into the x86 franchise, which was rapidly deteriorating. In our view, Intel foundry remains problematic but will get a boost from the system on chip (SoC) products that this partnership will produce. On balance we see this as a win for both companies, x86 customers and a further boost for AI’s momentum. CrowdStrike used Fal.con 2025 to harden its ongoing value proposition that security is a speed game. But the company extended its messaging emphasizing that platforms which orchestrate fleets of AI agents will set the bar for the future of security. In our view, George Kurtz’s keynote and theCUBE interview (below) mark a goal to create a clean hand-off from “assistive The threat landscape is undergoing a profound transformation. At CrowdStrike’s Fal.Con 2025 event in Las Vegas, Adam Meyers, who heads counter-adversary operations, provided a rare window into how the world’s most capable adversaries are adapting their tactics. His insights underscore a sobering reality in that artificial intelligence has become both a weapon and a defense shield, underscoring the asymmetry between attackers and defenders. We believe CrowdStrike (CRWD) has re-established growth momentum while still working through the financial and reputational overhang of the July 19, 2024 global outage. The company recently delivered net new ARR reacceleration ahead of expectations, showcased strong platform expansion across cloud, identity, and Next-Gen SIEM, and leaned on Falcon Flex as a durable consolidation lever. In our view, the near-term debate centers not only on churn or Flex conversion but more on net new ARR performance, valuation skepticism, and whether identity and SIEM can offset a maturing core endpoint business while fending off intensifying competition. The mainspring of CrowdStrike’s success remains relentless product innovation, increasingly defined by its platform. We believe its unified platform and AI-driven threat defense at scale underpin the company’s premium valuation through customer consolidation, stickiness, and durable ARR growth. We believe the prevailing narrative that Broadcom and NVIDIA are locked in a zero-sum battle for AI data center dominance is misleading. The reality is these companies are playing very different games. NVIDIA has built a vertically integrated compute and software platform that has become the engine of the AI factory era. Broadcom, by contrast, has constructed a durable business model around connectivity, custom silicon, and high-margin software. The strategies overlap but are not mutually exclusive. We believe the real story is how these firms are carving out complementary positions in the most important technology cycle since the dawn of the Internet. We believe the industry’s broad interpretation of Jensen’s Law — i.e. “Jensen’s Law accelerates Moore’s Law” — understates a fundamental economic reality of AI Factories. Jensen Huang’s own language and NVIDIA’s operating model point to a financial law of motion for AI factories: When power is the binding constraint and demand is elastic, perf/watt increases raise monetizable throughput faster than they raise total cost. The result is an extension to existing laws of tech that we’ve come to know. Specifically, Jensen’s invoking of Buy ore to make more (i.e. revenue up) and spend more to save more (i.e. unit cost down) has explicit economic implications that we believe need further examination. In addition, there is a corollary in this new regime in that, under certain conditions, fabric‑driven utilization unlocks are so valuable that high‑speed networking becomes “economically free” (i.e. where utilization gains exceed amortized fabric cost). In this Breaking Analysis we explain in detail what we’re referring to as a new Jensen’s Law. We’ll explore why this phenomenon is so important, review the math behind it, share some concrete examples of where the law is applicable, when the corollary of “the network is free” holds, implications for investors and operators; and where the law is not applicable. We believe the center of gravity in AI infrastructure has shifted from servers to AI factories, where networking is perhaps as critical as compute. Our analysis of an interview with NVIDIA SVP of Networking, Gilad Shainer, indicates NVIDIA’s thesis is straightforward. Specifically, that scale-up fabrics (NVLink/NVLink Fusion) plus scale-out Ethernet purpose-built for AI (Spectrum-X) — and increasingly scale-across for multi–data center topologies (Spectrum-XGS) — deliver superior determinism, efficiency, and time-to-outcomes at giga-scale. At the same time, the market is too large and heterogeneous for any single fabric to dominate; open standards and merchant Ethernet will continue to win broad adoption, and even NVIDIA is embracing open interfaces and ecosystems to complement its proprietary advantages. In our view, NVIDIA is a somewhat rare case where first-mover advantage has paid off. Its early conviction in parallel computing, GPUs, CUDA/NCCL software moats, and the Mellanox acquisition now underpin a defensible systems position across scale-up, scale-out, and (increasingly) scale-across. Cybersecurity is the number one risk facing enterprises today, and yet organizations remain dangerously unprepared. Executives are not blind to the problem — they understand the financial exposure, the reputational stakes, and the business impact of a major breach. They acknowledge gaps in their defenses and recognize the vulnerabilities that could cripple their mission-critical systems. But awareness has not translated into readiness and true business resilience remains elusive for the vast majority of firms. Data strategies are especially important – specifically data governance, data protection, and data quality. These remain essential elements of cyber resilience, but they’re only part of the equation. True business resilience requires confronting a multitude of dimensions — from application security to identity, supply chain integrity, operational continuity, infrastructure defenses and more. The uncomfortable truth is that most firms still lack the cohesive strategy, investment, and execution to protect their most vital assets. Donald Trump’s 180 on Intel is at least directionally correct, certainly more so than calling for the ouster of Lip-Bu Tan, Intel’s CEO. But a contemplated investment by the US in Intel, as reported by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, without a significant restructuring of Intel’s entire business, is a recipe for failure in our view. Specifically, we continue to urge Intel’s board to spin out its foundry business. Every day it waits further decreases foundry’s value. Moreover, we call on the U.S. government to use money from the CHIPS Act and its influence on large US chip designers, and TSMC, to secure a position for a US-domiciled company in advanced semiconductor manufacturing. AI is currently running on a one lane, CapEx highway that is capacity constrained. Hyperscalers are the largest contributor to the momentum and as such, investors keep score with cloud growth rates. But this past quarter you had to read the footnotes and the fine print to go beyond the massive investments fueling the wave. Microsoft put up eye-popping Azure growth again, but a big part of that acceleration is Azure serving AI inference — notably ChatGPT — now neatly included in the revised definition of what’s included in Azure. This is great for headlines but not conducive to apples-to-apples comparisons over time. Meanwhile, AWS delivered the largest revenue for cloud infrastructure and sent a clear message that demand exceeds supply. Meaning growth is capped by power and components, not pipeline. That creates a weird optics penalty — AWS showing growth in the high teens on a $120B-plus run rate and it’s deemed “concerning.” But it also telegraphs future upside as capacity goes online and depreciation cycles progress. OpenAI and NVIDIA just dropped news with implications for every model lab, cloud, and enterprise AI customer and vendor. The two companies released gpt-oss-20B and gpt-oss-120B, open-weight reasoning models trained on H100, tuned across NVIDIA’s full stack, and capable of spitting out 1.5 million tokens per second on a single Blackwell GB200 NVL72 rack. The weights ship under a permissive license; the inference path spans DGX Cloud, Blackwell servers, and RTX PCs via Ollama, llama.cpp, vLLM, FlashInfer, Hugging Face, and Microsoft AI Foundry Local. Last November, we argued that Jamie Dimon is sitting on a treasure trove of proprietary data that will never find its way into proprietary LLMs via the Internet. And as such, he was Sam Altman’s biggest competitor because his data is more valuable than the democratized insights from these LLMs. Our premise was and continues to be that foundation model companies are waging an internecine battle chasing artificial general intelligence (Messiah AGI) and the true holy grail is what we called “enterprise AGI;” meaning applying AI to proprietary data inside of enterprises will ultimately prove to be the most valuable endeavor. Today we extend that argument and posit that agents and enterprise digital twins, powered by that proprietary data, will drive the next wave of AI value. By all accounts, Microsoft just delivered one of the most powerful quarters in its history. But this wasn’t just a blowout print, it was a signal that Microsoft is playing a new game. The company’s performance is redefining what hyperscale looks like in the AI era. An objective analysis of the Q4 FY2025 earnings call suggests that Microsoft is firing on all cylinders in cloud, AI, and infrastructure execution, and it’s building for a future measured in gigawatts, not racks. The only potential negatives for investors are: 1) Capital expenditures are expected to be more than $30B in the coming quarter, signalling continued spending ahead of revenue and negatively affecting cash flow; and 2) Gross margin pressure continues in cloud due to the lower margins realized in its Azure / infrastructure business. The stablecoin market is rapidly maturing into one of the most consequential sectors of the digital asset econoour. After years of uncertainty, regulatory friction, and media skepticism, stablecoins are no longer a speculative curiosity, rather they are foundational to the next chapter of programmable finance. Our research suggests that the convergence of policy shifts, institutional adoption, and new economic use cases has thrust stablecoins into the spotlight. In short: crypto’s ChatGPT moment has arrived, and its name is stablecoin. In our view, IBM delivered one of its strongest quarters in recent memory, reinforcing a narrative we’ve tracked for some time – i.e. the pivot from legacy to a modern, AI-driven hybrid cloud company is finally showing up in the numbers. The company beat expectations across revenue, profit, margin, and free cash flow, and perhaps more importantly, demonstrated credible traction While the NASDAQ seems to reach new highs daily, enterprise tech spending remains persistently cautious at the macro amid continued uncertainty. That’s not necessarily bad news but it can be disconcerting to decision makers. Often during transitional cycles, like the one we’re in now, executives don’t want to overrotate on capital allocations that deliver outcomes, which could potentially be achieved much more cost effectively with emerging technologies like AI. We’ve seen similar patterns in previous waves. There was a period of “great softness” in enterprise IT spending when transitioning from mainframes and minis to the PC era, a huge backlash from overly exuberant Y2K and dotcom spending; and a steady deterioration of traditional enterprise tech momentum during the cloud, mobile, SaaS, social, big data era. Each wave is different but two common themes remain: 1/ strong conviction that a new era is here; and 2/ fear of disruption, which sometimes leads to hasty decision making and waste. These countervailing forces seem to be in play today as 87% of enterprises report taking a cautious approach to AI investments. And that caution is showing up in the macro spend environment. Intel’s new CEO has promised to clean up the balance sheet, slim down the company, return to a culture of engineering, sharpen its customer focus, shore up its products, become a world class independent foundry and lead Intel for as long as it takes to achieve success, however that is defined. As our audience knows, unlike most other analysts, we have aggressively emphasized the icebergs ahead for Intel since 2013, culminating in our prediction that Intel would go bankrupt trying to execute on its most previous strategy. While we would have preferred a different approach to Intel’s foundry – i.e. JV with TSM – Lip-Bu Tan at least has what we consider to be a viable go forward plan. The steady state outcome of this new direction, however is far from certain. In last week’s Breaking Analysis we argued that Snowflake was attempting to cross the Rubicon, vaulting from cloud data warehouse innovator into AI leader and intelligent application platform. This week the competitive fire got a fresh accelerant. As usual, Databricks followed up Snowflake Summit and put forth bold claims of its own, emphasizing unified governance, data intelligence, simplified user experiences, transactional capabilities and, of course, open data. Cisco hasn’t enjoyed much organic revenue growth in more than a decade. It just rolled into San Diego claiming this year’s Cisco Live is the “most consequential” event in the company’s history. Hyperbole? Maybe. But after three days on-site comprising Q&A with Chuck Robbins and Jeetu Patel, closed-door roadmap dives, and a flood of product reveals in public, our assessment is that Cisco finally has a credible, end-to-end story for the AI era. Our research indicates that data platform wars have entered an entirely new phase, one where open data is no longer a marketing slogan and governance catalogs are now the new control point. We see this as the first of several structural changes to the software industry. The next price of entry we think will be an emerging layer that we call systems of intelligence, or SOI, which we believe will become a high value piece of real estate in the AI-optimized software stack. In this Breaking Analysis, and just a few days removed from Snowflake Summit 2025, we unpack how Snowflake has moved from steward of its pristine proprietary data platform to orchestrating an ecosystem in a world that enables any compute engine to operate on any open data formats. Last week, we framed the company’s Rubicon moment, meaning the pivot from analytic warehouse to enabler of intelligent data apps. The data industry has arrived at a pivotal juncture that echoes the themes we’ve charted in previous Breaking Analysis episodes, from The Sixth Data Platform through The Yellow Brick Road to Agentic AI; Why Jamie Dimon is Sam Altman’s Biggest Competitor all the way to the Faceoff between Benioff and Nadella. Those analyses have chronicled the steady convergence of analytic data platforms such as Snowflake and Databricks, not only with the hyperscalers’ estates, but increasingly, with the operational applications that run businesses. Our research indicates that this merger is not a side-effect of Gen AI hype, rather it’s a structural shift in how enterprises will create value from data and software over the next several decades. Thirty months into the GenAI awakening, the jury is still out on how much enterprises are benefiting from investments in artificial intelligence. While the vast majority of customers continue to spend on AI, reported returns are no greater than, and frankly lag those, typically associated with historical IT initiatives like ERP, data warehousing and cloud computing. Let’s face it, the multi-hundred billion dollar annual CAPEX outlay from hyperscalers and sovereign nations is fueling the euphoria and essentially supporting blind faith in the AI movement. But ground truth returns from enterprise AI adoption remain opaque. This combined with geopolitical unrest, fluctuating public policy and GDP estimates in the low single digits, have buyers tempering expectations for tech spending relative to January of this year. Dell’s founder-led business is one of the most remarkable and under appreciated stories in tech. Dell Technologies is not particularly sexy, nor does it put forth an earth- shattering vision that bends the mind. Yet it’s a company that has consistently figured out how to ride successive waves without becoming driftwood. And like Hyman Roth of Godfather fame, Michael Dell always seems to make money for his partners. Unlike Roth, Mr. Dell is not a gangster, rather he’s a gentleman that literally wrote the book on how to play nice and win. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of DTW 2025, we examine the question, how will Dell capture the explosive AI opportunity, while transitioning the millions of servers, arrays, and PCs it already has in the field to this new AI era? The Road to ‘Service-as-Software.’ Salesforce co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff is articulating a bold vision for the next era of enterprise software. In an exclusive interview with theCUBE on April 25, 2025, Benioff outlined how AI-driven agents and a unified data architecture will transform Software as a Service (SaaS) into what we’re calling “Service as Software” – a model where software-based digital agents augment every business process. The Salesforce chief has often quipped that today’s CEOs are “the last generation of executives leading exclusively human workforces,” underscoring his conviction that AI agents (what many call agentic AI) will soon work alongside humans in every enterprise. Our premise is that this “digital labor” revolution could be more disruptive than the cloud and mobile waves of 15 years ago, fundamentally redefining how applications function. Our view is that IBM has crystallized a coherent, differentiated AI thesis based on smaller, domain‑tuned models running on an open, hybrid‑cloud fabric. The goal is to unlock what it claims is the 99 percent of enterprise data still untouched by GenAI. If execution matches the marketing—particularly on integration speed and cost transparency—IBM will change the perception from perennial AI underdog to a primary or even default choice for risk‑averse enterprises seeking tangible ROI. The next two quarters of Watsonx bookings and Granite adoption will tell us whether the strategy is hitting escape velocity, merely clearing the launchpad or needs a reset. Based on this quarter’s earnings reports, it’s clear to us that demand is not the constraint for hyperscale clouds. They are, however running head‑long into the hard limits of physics. Access to megawatts, liquid‑cooled racks, and a GPU supply chain that begins and ends with NVIDIA are now critical paths to tapping what appears to be unlimited demand. AWS, Microsoft, and Google each chalked up record‑setting capital outlays last quarter—collectively dropping around $63 billion in CAPEX—yet even that eye‑popping sum can’t fully satiate the compute‑hungry AI models racing toward trillion‑parameter scale. We believe the real story isn’t simply “AI is expensive”; it’s that power availability, not revenue potential, is now the gating factor on hyperscaler growth. In our view, the winners of the next cycle will be the providers that secure sustainable energy footprints, master GPU allocation, and—critically—translate all that infrastructure into margin‑accretive AI services before the depreciation schedules kick in. Welcome to the ironic era where megawatts equal market share. As RSAC 2025 approaches, key themes are emerging that are set to dominate the world’s largest cybersecurity gathering. Industry dynamics are shifting rapidly – from AI enabling higher velocity threats, an intensified platform consolidation debate, high-profile M&A, rising interest in AI agents (with somewhat tepid adoption in cyber) and shifting security budget priorities. Our research shows that while cybersecurity remains At last week’s AI Agent Builder Summit, hosted by Scott Hebner of theCUBE Research at SiliconANGLE’s Palo Alto Studios, the hype around “agentic AI” – autonomous software agents that can orchestrate complex tasks – was on full display. Demos and keynotes painted a bold vision of AI-driven business processes. But scratch beneath the surface, and a sobering reality emerges: Most enterprises are far from ready to reap the benefits of fully autonomous agents. Much work needs to be done to realize the promise of agentic systems, including organizational alignment to create a true data culture, cleaning up data silos, harmonizing that data, data ownership, data product thinking, getting governance and security right, choosing technology partners, rationalizing your SaaS and on-prem applications portfolio, and of course change management to get all this done. Starting the journey toward an agentic enterprise is an exciting imperative, but in our view will take the better part of a decade to realize. We estimate that Google’s Cloud business will exceed $50B in annual revenue this year with Google Cloud Platform comprising more than 50% of its cloud revenue for the first time ever. Why is it then that Google’s cloud business, a $50B+ entity growing deep into the double digits gets so much criticism? The answer is simple. Google’s cloud, with arguably the best technology in the industry, is 2.5 – 3.5 times smaller than the cloud businesses of AWS and Microsoft. We are in the midst of a fundamental transformation of computing architectures. We’re moving from a world where we create data, store it, retrieve it, harmonize it and present it so that we can make better decisions, to a world that creates content from knowledge using tokens as a new unit of value; and increasingly takes action in real time with or without human intervention, driving unprecedented increases in value. What this means is every part of the computing stack, from silicon, infrastructure, security, middleware, development tools, applications and even services, is changing. As with other waves in computing, consumer adoption leads us up the innovation curve where the value is clear, the volume is high and the velocity is accelerated, leading to lower costs and eventual adoption into and disruption of enterprise applications. Importantly, to do this work on today’s data center infrastructure would be 10X more expensive, trending toward 100X by the end of the decade. As such, virtually everything is going to move to this new model of computing. Automation generally and AI specifically, render today’s cybersecurity stacks ineffective. Previously, stopping 99% of attacks and leaving the 1% for armed human hunters to deal with was, while not ideal, at least feasible. With AI, that all goes away because adversaries can scale phishing and other attacks at unprecedented rates, which overwhelms the ability of humans. This creates a wider gap between exfiltration times, which are shrinking, and mean time to remediation, giving even greater advantage to attackers. As such, the only way to fight AI is with AI. Moreover, the ever expanding number of tools in an organization’s security stack continues to exacerbate the problem. According to Palo Alto Networks, the answer is a complete makeover of your cybersecurity stack where consolidating multiple tools into a single platform and gaining comprehensive access to the right data, simplifies security operations and enables AI to operate in real time. The analyst relations (AR) function is undergoing a fundamental transformation. Once dominated by a handful of large research houses, such as Gartner, IDC and Forrester, the market now features a spectrum of independent analysts and influencers. The fast-paced nature of the tech industry, its speed of change, the relentless competition and ubiquity of technology, make it a challenging sector for Since the Gen AI awakening, we’ve said consistently that NVIDIA and Broadcom are the #1 and #2 AI plays in tech. Since peaking in mid-December of last year, Broadcom shares have been under pressure, off on sympathy with other semiconductor stocks and the general confusion about the economy, tariffs, inflation, jobs, geopolitics, debt, etc. Broadcom’s Q1 results were impressive and assuaged some of these fears. At one point last night after hours the stock was up 15% from its previous close and midday Friday was up around 6-7% despite continued pressure on tech shares. Market transitions such as the one we’re in now often bring confusion and market volatility as the new high growth sectors are not large enough to offset the slowdown in the larger declining markets. NVIDIA doesn’t have this problem because it is at the mainspring of the new wave. Broadcom is facing a similar but different dynamic in that its traditional businesses are ones that are extremely durable. Moreover, we see two relatively new dynamics coming into play for Broadcom: 1) Hyperscalers are coming to Broadcom to enable their custom AI accelerators; and 2) Broadcom’s VMware strategy is working, lifting the company to new software heights. A seismic shift is underway in enterprise software, one that pits two of the most influential leaders in the industry—Microsoft’s Satya Nadella and Salesforce’s Marc Benioff—against each other in a war of words that highlights the broader transformation unfolding in enterprise applications. Nadella predicts the demise of traditional SaaS applications, arguing that AI-powered agents will take over, fundamentally redefining enterprise software. Benioff, on the other hand, argues that AI will serve as an augmentation layer and rely on his existing platform to supply the digital workforce of the future. Few brands in technology carry the storied pedigree of Intel. For decades, “Intel Inside” was synonymous with progress in computing—an American icon that repeatedly raised the bar for processor performance and innovation. Today, Intel finds itself in a precarious position. Its once-vaunted manufacturing machine has fallen behind TSMC, which dominates advanced process nodes. Meanwhile, Intel’s core CPU design business—a substantial, if bruised, revenue engine—remains overshadowed by the mounting losses and capital burn in its foundry operations. Rumors swirl that Broadcom might step in and scoop up Intel’s design arm. But for those who believe in competition, national security, and the long-term integrity of an American technology brand, that outcome would be deeply misguided. Earnings reports from the big three cloud players disappointed investors this week. All three US hyperscalers fell a bit short of consensus for their cloud revenues in the December quarter and investor reaction has been negative. But squinting through the data, there’s a lot to like about the position of AWS, Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure. In particular, the IaaS and PaaS revenue alone for the big 3 approached $200B in 2024 and grew 25%. All three cited capacity constraints and, along with Meta, are committing more than $300B in CAPEX spend this year, most of it to support current and future AI demand. As is often the case, when a new wave hits it tends to be overhyped at the beginning of the cycle and underestimated when it hits a steady state. And in between points A and B we often see blips and bumps that represent opportunities for long term investors. Make no mistake. We are entering a technology cycle that is completely new. Massively parallel computing and the Gen AI awakening is creating an entirely different industry focus that has altered customer spending patterns. Moreover, this new computing paradigm has changed competitive dynamics almost overnight. Decisions whether to spend tens of billions or hundreds of billions on CAPEX are being challenged by novel approaches to deploying AI. Geopolitical tensions are higher than at any time in the history of tech. While the pace of change appears to be accelerating, causing consternation and confusion, the reality is that broad technology adoption evolves over long periods of time, creating opportunities, risks, and tectonic shifts in industry structures. At the beginning of each year, as is our tradition, we collaborate with ETR to dig through the latest data and craft ten predictions for the coming year. This year’s batch follows some annual favorites and some new territory. In this Breaking Analysis we put forth our top ten predictions for enterprise tech in 2025 with our usual data-heavy opinions and prognostications. In just two short years, the entire data and technology industry has undergone a seismic shift. Tech stacks—from top to bottom—are being tuned to harness extreme parallel computing, often called Accelerated Computing. From silicon to infrastructure and throughout the software layer, nowhere is this transformation more pronounced than in the data stack. Over the past seven years, modern cloud-native data platforms set the agenda. Today, however, the rise of open table formats, shifting control points, open-source governance catalogs, and a heightened focus on AI are creating both challenges and opportunities for enterprises and the tech providers who serve them. In this special breaking analysis, we’re pleased to host our fourth annual data predictions power panel with some of our collaborators in the Cube Collective and members of the Data Gang. With us today are five of the top industry analysts focused on data platforms. Sanjeev Mohan of Sanjmo, Tony Bear of DB Insight, recent IDC graduate Carl Olofson, Dave Menninger of ISG and Brad Schimmin with Omdia. We are witnessing the rise of a completely new computing era. Within the next decade, a trillion-dollar-plus data center business is poised for transformation, powered by what we refer to as extreme parallel computing (EPC)—or as some prefer to call it, accelerated computing. While artificial intelligence is the primary accelerant, the effects ripple across the entire technology stack. Nvidia sits in the vanguard of this shift, forging an end-to-end platform that integrates hardware, software, systems engineering, and a massive ecosystem. Our view is that Nvidia has a 10-to-20-year runway to drive this transformation, but the market forces at play are much larger than a single player. This new paradigm is about reimagining compute from the ground up: from the chip level to data center equipment, to distributed computing at scale, data and applications stacks and emerging robotics at the edge. The road to agentic AI will be paved with stepping stones that progressively build on each other. Our research suggests that Agentic AI will not suddenly appear without a strong data foundation built on: 1) cloud-like scalability; 2) a unified metadata model; 3) data mesh organizing principles; 4) harmonized data and business process logic; and an orchestration framework that incorporates governance, security and observability. The time for Intel to shed its foundry business is now. While former CEO Pat Gelsinger made a persuasive case for U.S.-based advanced semiconductor manufacturing, his vision was flawed from the start. Intel’s foundry operation, like IBM’s Microelectronics business a decade ago, is an asset with negative value. Yet, its strategic significance for U.S. competitiveness in the semiconductor race cannot be overstated. If financial institutions are deemed too big to fail, then Intel’s foundry represents a similarly critical infrastructure for U.S. national interests. AWS re:Invent 2024 ushered in a transformative chapter for both Amazon Web Services and the broader tech ecosystem. This year’s event marked the debut of Matt Garman as CEO of AWS, stepping into a role that aligns with what John Furrier aptly describes as a “wartime CEO”—a technically adept leader and trusted consigliere. Garman’s keynote set the tone for AWS’s strategic focus: doubling down on core infrastructure capabilities across silicon, compute, storage, and networking, while extending its Graviton playbook to GPUs and potentially large language models (LLMs). The inboxes are overflowing once again with predictions about the future of enterprise tech, as we gear up for 2025. While many of these forecasts are insightful, we’ll sift through them carefully before releasing our own predictions later in January of next year. True to tradition, we aim to set a higher bar for our forecasts by focusing on measurable outcomes—whether it’s tied to a specific number or a clear binary result. Our philosophy remains consistent: a good prediction should be testable, enabling us to look back a year later and determine, with confidence and supporting data, whether it held true. In this Breaking Analysis, we evaluate the 2024 predictions we made alongside ETR’s Erik Bradley. We revisit our January forecasts on topics like the macro IT spending environment, GenAI ROI, security, on-prem AI, technology priorities and more. The ever expanding cloud has become ubiquitous. No longer is the cloud some remote set of services, somewhere up in the sky. Rather, the cloud is seeping into every industry, hybrid on-prem models, edge workloads, telco markets and has its sights on space. The market size is staggering and will surpass $1T in revenue when including infrastructure – IaaS and PaaS – SaaS and professional services. Much AI work is being done today in the public cloud and despite indications that bringing AI to on-prem data will be a growing trend, it’s unlikely that the cloud will stop expanding any time soon. Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware is proceeding almost exactly as we expected when the deal was announced in May of 2022. While much of the media and competitor narrative is focused on the increased license fees Broadcom is imposing and the urgency of migrating off VMware, customer conversations and recent surveys show that while migrations are happening, the real story is that VMware’s more narrow focus and cost discipline are allowing Broadcom to integrate VMWare into its highly successful business model. Specifically, we see two seemingly countervailing trends that are both possible to be true: 1) Customers are actively moving many low value workloads off VMware; and 2) Most mission critical work is staying put, allowing Broadcom to dramatically increase the contribution from its software business and deliver a roadmap for customers that will be more cost effective than migrating. Investors have poured north of $30B into independent foundation model players including OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, Mistral and others. OpenAI itself has raised more than $20B. To keep pace, both Meta and xAI will have to spend comparable amounts. In our view, the stampeding herd of LLM investors is blindly focused on the false grail of so-called artificial general intelligence AGI. We believe the greatest value capture exists in what we’re calling enterprise AGI, metaphorically represented by the proprietary data estates and managerial know-how locked inside of firms like JP Morgan Chase, and virtually every enterprise. The tools to curate and harness that collective intelligence will allow these firms to capture the majority of value in the race for AI leadership. Gen AI enthusiasm has lately turned to AI skepticism. Lack of clarity on tangible ROI for mainstream businesses, a narrow list of early winners and relentless vendor marketing around AI has caused cynicism and media backlash. But the reality remains that we have entered a new era in technology innovation that has a high probability of transforming industries, public policy, company leadership and the related fortunes of individuals and organizations. Moreover, 97% of leading Gen AI adopters report that they’re achieving tangible benefits from their deployments. Adoption of Gen AI is relentlessly on the rise and nearly two years in, is poised to begin throwing off enough value that it will heighten a mandate to apply AI to drive business results. As such, we believe that as we exit Q4 into 2025, the demand for AI solutions will continue to occupy the headspace of business technology pros and AI momentum will maintain its accelerated pace. It’s estimated that organizations spend more than $200B annually on security hardware, software and services globally. That’s a big number. But consider that the economic impact of cybercrime ranges from $500B – $2T annually. There’s even an estimate from cybersecurity ventures that says the figure is as high as $9.5T. Each year, it seems the more we spend, the more vulnerable we become, which is especially concerning given the exposure to critical infrastructures. Governments around the world have stepped up their involvement with executive orders, privacy regulations and lots of “finger wagging” at the technology industry and its customers. Frankly some of that is justified. The technology industry does much good but has a subpar record at solving this problem. One premise that we’ve put forth at theCUBE Research is that the industry must find ways to better collaborate and share resources to combat cyber threats. Two firms, IBM and Palo Alto Networks, have joined forces to combine deep expertise, AI and platform approach to better protect organizations from attackers. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the security landscape and unpack the multi-dimensional relationship between IBM and Palo Alto Networks to better understand how industry collaboration can improve cyber defenses and modernize security operations. With us are two senior executives from each firm, Mohamad Ali, SVP and Head of IBM Consulting and BJ Jenkins, the President of Palo Alto Networks. Microsoft’s new financial disclosures include changes to the way it reports Azure metrics. The company said the change was to better align Azure with consumption revenue and by inference, more closely aligning with how AWS, the leader in cloud computing infrastructure, reports its metrics. The accounting change removed certain mature, slower growth revenue streams and consequently raised the growth rates for Azure. It also had the effect of increasing the AI services contribution within Azure. While this was reported and often applauded in the media and financial circles, what wasn’t widely discussed is that while such a change increases growth rates, by definition it reduces the size of the Azure business and its resulting revenue market share. Regardless, in our view, Microsoft is comfortable that the future AI revenue contribution within Azure combined with both higher growth rates and a greater AI contribution will foster greater investor confidence and enthusiasm over time. They’re probably correct. Data from recent surveys shows that the scenarios we’ve been putting forth throughout 2024 continue to be in play. Specifically, we cite three main dynamics affecting the tech spending climate, including: 1) IT budgets continue to be constrained as; 2) GenAI is being funded by stealing from other budget buckets; and 3) The ROI for AI initiatives remains tepid, as expectations for break even continue to be pushed out to the right. Nonetheless, customers remain highly optimistic about the prospects for AI driving productivity improvements. Moreover, the cloud remains a key ingredient in supporting AI workloads. We believe the AI center of gravity for enterprise value creation is shifting from LLMs to SLMs. Where the S not only stands for small but encompasses a system of small, specialized, secure and sovereign models. Moreover, we see LLMs and SLMs evolving to become agentic, hence SAM – i.e. small action models. In our view, it’s the collection of these “S-models,” combined with an emerging data harmonization layer, that will enable systems of agents to work in concert and create high impact business outcomes. These multi-agent systems will completely reshape the software industry generally and more specifically, unleash a new productivity paradigm for organizations globally. Technology generally and big tech specifically are regularly cited by politicians, media and governments around the world as the root of many societal problems today. Accusations like privacy invaders, fake news amplifiers, job destroyers, discriminators and more are commonly lobbed at technology firms with little recognition for the substantial value large tech companies have delivered over the decades. Moreover, many powerful government officials have rewritten the history of effective government oversight and are attempting to apply antitrust law in novel ways that have virtually killed M&A and threaten to stifle American exceptionalism and innovation. For over a decade we’ve been sounding the alarm on Intel. Five years ago, like some on Wall Street, we recommended a strategy to recreate Intel by splitting up its design and manufacturing divisions. Most recently we posited that a miracle would be needed for Intel to achieve its aspirations of becoming a viable number two foundry by 2030. The majority of industry pundits have finally come to the realization that Intel’s current path is unsustainable. However some still feel that splitting Intel’s fabs from its design business doesn’t make sense. We disagree. Oracle Corporation is seeing renewed business momentum powered by a combination of an entrenched database business, years of investment in cloud infrastructure, an integrated application suite and AI technologies that are being infused throughout its product line. This includes its autonomous database, 23ai, Exadata/Exascale, other Oracle infrastructure and its vast applications portfolio. Oracle has a highly differentiated strategy that is hitting on most if not all cylinders. And it appears the best is yet to come. It’s one reason that, year to date, the stock is up 54%, compared to the Nasdaq which is up 19% as of the recording of this recording. Input from theCUBE and data practitioner communities suggests that acceleration in compute performance and the sophistication of the modern data stack (MDS) is outpacing the needs of many traditional analytic workloads. Most analytics workloads today are performed on small data sets and generally can run on a single node, somewhat neutralizing the value of distributed, highly scalable data platforms. As We believe enterprise applications are undergoing a profound change. By next year, highly capable agentic systems will emerge to create new application classes and alter the way organizations think about their backend systems, data platforms and user interfaces. The extent of the transformation, we believe, will be more impactful to the application stack than were the changes brought about by innovations seen during the modern GUI, Web, cloud and mobile eras. Customers and partners are pivoting to address Broadcom’s swift changes to its VMware packaging, pricing and partnership programs. Our data suggests customers and MSPs have moved beyond the emotional shock phase to implementing their options in earnest. Our advice to large VMware customers has been to evaluate your ELA expiration and work backwards from that timeframe. Isolate core workloads that The investor community is realizing that the return on invested capital for the AI buildout is going to take some time. The payback period for enterprise AI investments is not akin to the dopamine rush from completing a great workout. This realization combined with several other macro factors, has caused the big AI names to pullback hard recently. But the The so-called modern data stack is getting a facelift and perhaps a complete body makeover. As the point of control shifts from the DBMS to the governance layer we cite three dynamics that highlight a reshaping of today’s data landscape, including: 1) Key data players are disrupting the established norm as they expand their aspirations; 2) Data platform vendors used Three main pressure points are transforming the modern data landscape: 1) Increased interest in adopting open table formats to allow any compute to operate on any data; 2) The point of control is shifting from the DBMS to the governance layer; and 3) AI is enabling the emergence of a new class of intelligent data apps that promise to radically automate business processes and drive unprecedented levels of productivity. The chaos caused by yesterday’s CrowdStrike content update shows that even the most successful cybersecurity firms with great management, award-winning products and a growing business, are exposed to unexpected events. What’s even more important is that it underscores the fragility of our connected world and the critical infrastructure that makes it run. Virtually every industry, and who knows how many AI continues to lead all enterprise IT sectors by a wide margin in terms of spending momentum. But that momentum has not led to an across the board boost in productivity or meaningful revenue gains for firms. Specifically, the adoption of Gen AI is increasing steadily but the use cases are not yet self-funding. As such, the outlook for IT spending, while slowly improving in the second half of 2024, remains constrained. In this Breaking Analysis we share our thoughts on the emerging trends around agentic AI. We’ll define what it is, how agentic builds on (and is additive to) generative AI, what’s missing to make it real, what the stack components look like and some of the likely players in the space. As customers try to “get AI right,” the need to rationalize siloed data becomes increasingly important. Data practitioners could put all their data eggs into a single platform basket, but that’s proving impractical. As such, firms are moving to an open model where they maintain control of their data and can bring any compute engine to any of their data. While compelling, the capabilities to govern open data across an entire estate remain immature. Regardless, the move toward open table formats is gaining traction and the point of control in the data platform wars is shifting from the database to the governance catalog. Earnings prints from the likes of Dell, Supermicro and more recently HPE have shown the AI server trend is not just benefiting cloud hyperscalers but also firms with large on-premises installed bases. Oracle as well is trading at an all time high citing cloud momentum and recent deals with Google, OpenAI and prior deals with Microsoft. But make no mistake, Snowflake Summit 2024 marks the next chapter in the company’s history with new CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy taking center stage, driving even faster product innovation and an ambitious TAM expansion strategy. Snowflake has moved beyond being a friendly and simpler data warehouse to tackling new problems including how to bring AI value to enterprise customers, helping ecosystem partners monetize and providing tools and services to build AI-powered enterprise data apps. Snowflake is at a crossroads. The company, which defined the modern data platform, now faces fresh challenges on four fronts. Specifically, Snowflake must: 1) advance its data cloud vision; 2) transform into an AI leader; 3) become a platform for data apps; and 4) address external market forces that pressure its core values of simplicity, efficiency, and trusted data. In this research we quantify the semiconductor ecosystem which we believe is being led by a transition to AI. Four companies stand out including NVIDIA, TSMC, Broadcom and Qualcomm to make up 45% of a $900B market by 2028. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, ahead of IBM Think and Dell Technologies World, we shine a spotlight on these two firms as leading examples of hybrid AI players that we believe will benefit from the AI wave that is upon us. And of course we’ll share several survey data points from ETR to support our assertions. RSAC 2024 was crowded, buzzy, vibrant and chaotic, underscoring the very nature of the cybersecurity industry. This market has a kind of self-propelling energy with a dynamic that blends tons of money, an ever-present and capable adversary, technical innovation, public policy, geopolitics, and a smashing together of the digital and physical worlds. In this Breaking Analysis we introduce you to Blue Yonder, a builder of digital supply chain management solutions that we believe represents an emerging example of intelligent data applications. Organizations continue to spend more on security with 87% of firms expecting to increase spend on cyber in the next twelve months. But are we safer? It’s estimated that firms on average have between 60-75 security tools installed. While leading vendors logically market the benefits of addressing tools sprawl and complexity through consolidation, the data suggests that more than half the firms are increasing the number of security vendors installed with a very small percentage able to affect vendor consolidation. In another big week we saw the AI battles continue to escalate. Google reorged to better focus on AI, Meta’s Llama 3 was released, TSM is doubling its manufacturing capacity for NVIDIA high end chips, Samsung got a $6.4B tranche of the chips act money, a Microsoft paper describes VASA-1 that turns photos into a kinda creepy talking head, Mistral Enterprises are fighting a dual mandate of operating inside a tight IT budget envelope while at the same time transforming their organization into an AI-first company. Navigating macroeconomic headwinds while driving innovation is an exciting challenge for IT decision makers. To deliver the goods, technology leaders are stealing from other budgets to fund AI, finding quick wins with fairly unspectacular AWS’ AI strategy combines foundation model optionality from partners with its own innovations across a three layered AI stack. In this Breaking Analysis we review takeaways from our AI field trip to NYC. Adobe Summit 2024 put highlighted AI powered digital experiences and personalization at scale. By applying AI, Adobe showed off its ability to bring custom experiences to the masses and do so with trusted, enterprise-grade content. Adobe’s TAM is approaching $300B and the company is demonstrating the ability to monetize AI at scale. We attended both NVIDIA GTC and Broadcom’s investor day this week where the AI platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. When you think of AI leadership, which companies come to mind? NVIDIA, OpenAI, the hyperscalers, Meta, Hugging Face, Anthropic and names like that, right? You don’t typically think of Broadcom do you? You should. Many people question whether the current AI boom will end in the same way that the dotcom bubble burst. It’s understandable as there are many similarities, especially with the exuberance seen this past week in the stock market following NVIDIA’s earnings print. The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, i.e. a capability that allows a globally consistent, real time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and non-relational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. Predictions become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true– ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Recent spending intentions data from more than 1,700 IT decision makers indicates that executives expect technology budgets to grow at 4.3% this year. That’s up from roughly 3.5% in 2023 and is higher than the expectation in October which was 3.8%. But the forecasts for 2024 are backend loaded. Moreover, while some sectors such as energy and regions like APAC With George Gilbert We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with With Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer, Carl Olofson, Dave Menninger and Doug Henschen In the words of famous people like Nobel laureate Neils Bohr and baseball legend Yogi Berra, predictions are very difficult, especially if they’re about the future. In this special Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to host our third annual data predictions power panel with some of our collaborators in Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them The rapid awareness and adoption of AI has increased concerns around security, governance, compliance and business risk. The digital business imperative to improve customer experience combined with a vastly more complex technology environment, comprising multiple clouds, IoT, containers, app integration and the popularity of open source, are driving need for better observability across technology stacks. But fragmented IT environments, lack Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, With George Gilbert We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s With George Gilbert Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to Episode 207 Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by Cisco’s $28B acquisition of Splunk represents a good outcome for Splunk and a strategic growth opportunity for Cisco. Splunk’s painful transition to a cloud and subscription pricing model was largely through the knot hole as seen by its margins and recent P&L performance. But questions remained with respect to its growth prospects and competitiveness in the hot observability space.

For With George Gilbert The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, realtime system. The premise is that increasingly, George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this With George Gilbert and Rob Strechay At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. With George Gilbert Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent With Rob Strechay and Zeus Kerravala The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting.

Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates.

Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration With George Gilbert, Rob Strechay & Andy Thurai The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, With George Gilbert Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data With Rob Strechay & Andy Thurai HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with With George Gilbert Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created.

We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley With Andy Thurai, VP & Principal Analyst, Constellation Research The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of AI raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing.

Once hopeful that the security industry would be shielded from macroeconomic conditions, the past year has been painful for many investors with some exceptions – most notably those investors who stuck with Palo Alto Networks and Fortinet. That On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll An AI-powered rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over The financial services industry has always been a leading consumer of tech with big IT budgets. The recent banking crisis will add even more headwinds to the already challenging IT spending climate and several tech firms are exposed. In particular, we believe those companies with a higher than average mix of business in financial sectors, combined with decelerating spend momentum The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and With George Gilbert When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market.

But creating Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2021 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, With Andy Thurai, VP & Principal Analyst, Constellation Research A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data.

Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0.

The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm.

It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger The rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Today we’ll address the following frequently asked questions: 1. In an industry full of hype and buzzwords, why After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. But judging by the attendance and enthusiasm at Despite fears of inflation, supply chain issues, skyrocketing energy and home prices and global instability caused by the Ukraine crisis, CIOs and IT buyers continue to expect overall spending to increase more than 6% in 2022. While this is lower than our 8% prediction made in January of this year, it remains in line with last year’s roughly 6-7% growth Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more.

The When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership.

Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches.

The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates.

As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it.

Oracle performance specifications are remarkable at ≤19 µs average read latency with more than 27.6 million Oracle Database 8K SQL read IOPS and 7.4 million write IOPS, The challenges of legacy data warehouses have been well documented. Built on rigid infrastructure and managed by specialized gatekeepers, data warehouses of the past were, as one financial customer once told us, “like a snake swallowing a basketball.” Slide from Wikibon’s 2014 Big Data Capital Markets Event: The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every With Erik Bradley The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional In the 2010s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon Despite the more than $100B spent each year fighting cybercrime, when we do an end of year look back and ask, “how did we do” — the answer is invariably the same; worse than last year. Pre-pandemic, the picture was disheartening. But since March of 2020 the situation has only worsened as cybercriminals have become increasingly sophisticated, better funded and Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead.

Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance What Could Disrupt Amazon? Weigh in and take the survey. Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture.

We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging.

It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work Cisco is a company at the crossroads.

That’s a substantial chunk of market opportunity that is growing Following a 4-5% contraction in 2020, we expect a 6-7% increase in 2021 technology spending. Key drivers are: 1) Continued fine-tuning of and investment in digital strategies– e.g. cloud, security, AI, data, and automation; 2) Application modernization initiatives (e.g. containers); 3) Steady remote workforce infrastructure investment; and 4) Pent up demand for data center infrastructure (e.g. servers, storage & networking on-prem). Best of theCUBE on Cloud The next ten years of cloud will differ dramatically from the past decade. The early days of cloud deployed virtualization of standard off-the-shelf components to scale out and build a large distributed system. The coming decade will see a much more data-centric, real time, intelligent, hyper-decentralized cloud that will comprise on-prem, hybrid, cross cloud and Much of the discussion around Intel’s current challenges is focused on manufacturing issues and its ongoing market share skirmish with AMD. Of course that’s understandable. But the core issue Intel faces is it has lost the volume game, forever. When it comes to silicon, volume is king. As such, incoming CEO Pat Gelsinger faces some difficult decisions. On the one In our 2020 Enterprise Technology Predictions post we said that organizations would slow down experimentation this year and begin to operationalize their digital transformation PoCs. We also said that, based on spending data, cyber security companies like Crowdstrike and Okta were poised to rise above the rest in 2020 along with an accelerated pace of cloud migrations. And we said New data suggests that tech spending will be higher than we previously thought for 2021. COVID learnings, a faster than expected vaccine rollout, productivity gains and broad-based cloud leverage, lead us to raise our outlook for next year. We now expect a 3-5% increase in 2021 technology spending, roughly double our previously forecasted growth rate.

The year 2020 has acted as a hasty but effective proof of concept for how to digitally transform businesses. CIOs report that generally, technology spending levels have either rebounded or will do so in the near future, Cloud computing has been the single most transformative force in IT over the last decade – what will Cloud 2030 look like? As we enter the 2020s, we believe that cloud will become the underpinning of a ubiquitous, intelligent and autonomous resource that will disrupt the operational stacks of virtually every company in all industries. This Breaking Analysis is a CISOs see Permanent Shifts in Cyber Strategies due to COVID & Remote Work As we’ve reported extensively, the pandemic has affected cyber security markets perhaps more than any other. Remote work has caused CISOs to shift spending priorities toward identity access management, endpoint and cloud security. COVID has been a benefactor for nextgen security companies that participate in these sectors. Fixing A Flawed Data Warehouse Model Snowflake will not grow into its valuation by simply stealing share from the on-prem data warehouse vendors. Even if it got 100% of the data warehouse business it wouldn’t come close to justifying its market cap. Rather Snowflake must create an entirely new market based on completely changing the way organizations think about monetizing Despite softer tech spending, cloud revenue shows continued momentum into 2021. As we watch an historic election unfold before our eyes, we look back at the early days of this millennium and the memorable presidential race of 2000. That decade was defined by 9/11, which permanently re-shaped our thinking. We exited the ’00s at the tail end of a massive Azure cloud is the linchpin of Microsoft’s go forward innovation strategy.

Of course As we reported in our last update, tech spending overall continues to be significantly muted relative to 2019– CIOs Report a Cautious Outlook for Q4 Tech Spending. We currently project a 4 to 5 percent decline in 2020 spending and a tepid 2 percent increase in 2021. Nonetheless, there continue to be some sector and vendor bright spots in an CIOs Report Slow Thaw of Spending Freezes. In the most recent September ETR spending survey, CIOs expect a slight sequential improvement in Q4 spending relative to Q3– but still down 4% from Q4 2019. So the picture is still not pretty but not bleak either. Firms are adjusting to the “new abnormal” and are taking positive actions that can be Application performance management (APM) has been around since the days of the mainframe. As systems architectures became more complex, the technology evolved to accommodate client server, Web tier architectures, mobile and now cloud-based systems.

Are we now going to see Enterprise software markets are dominated by mega cap companies like SAP, Oracle, Salesforce and Microsoft. SaaS leaders like ServiceNow and Workday have solidified their market positions by to a great extent, replicating the Salesforce model in their respective domains. There is still room for innovative upstarts that are introducing new cloud native services and value pricing models but the traditional Cloud, IAM & Endpoint Security are rocking the markets. Over the past 150 days, everyone in the technology industry has become an expert on COVID in some way shape or form.

We have all lived the reality that COVID-19 has accelerated by at least 2 years, many trends that were in motion well before the virus hit. The cyber security Cloud Remains Strong but not Immune to COVID. While cloud computing is generally seen as a bright spot in tech spending, the sector is not immune from the effects of COVID-19. It’s better to be cloud than not cloud, no question, but recent survey data shows that the V-shaped recovery in the stock market looks much more like a square RPA competitors vie for a bigger prize… RPA Leads all Sectors in Spending Intentions Robotic process automation (RPA) solutions remain one of the most attractive investments for business technology buyers. This despite our overall 2020 tech spending forecasts, which remain at the depressed levels of -4% to -5% for the year.

ETR’s Erik Bradley provides data and insights from customer roundtable discussions and Oracle Autonomous Database on Exadata Cloud@Customer and Dedicated Region Cloud@Customer is a radical approach at bringing cloud services on-premises. Our initial take is those substantial customers running mission-critical Oracle applications can cut costs by up to 40% with this offering. This strategy is the most ambitious attempt we’ve seen in the industry to bring a full public cloud experience to organizations’ premises. Global 2000 customers running mission-critical large-scale applications on Oracle Databases should assume that they will migrate to one of Oracle’s new Cloud@Custmer offerings. Wikibon recommends that CxOs begin engaging with Oracle to conduct their TCO/ROI/IRR analyses now. Despite its faster growth in infrastructure-as-a-service relative to AWS and Azure, Google Cloud Platform remains a third wheel in the race for cloud dominance. Google begins its Cloud Next online event starting July 14th in a series of nine rolling sessions through early September.

New Cloud Workloads As we’ve reported, there is a new class of workloads emerging in the cloud. Early cloud was all about infrastructure-as-a-service ( IaaS). That is, the spinning up Data shows that most CIOs expect a U-Shaped recovery from COVID-19. Specifically, 44% of roughly 700 executives surveyed believe revenue declines will continue through most of 2020 with growth returning next year. This is a key finding of the latest flash survey data from ETR. Not surprisingly however, the shape of the recovery will be mixed and vary substantially by CIOs and IT execs report strong RPA adoption plans in a post-pandemic environment.

Wikibon also projects that True Private Cloud Server SAN will make some headway together with Hyperscale Server SAN in public cloud storage. Definitions for the Wikibon Server SAN classifications are Premise. The digital twin programming concept will extend well beyond IoT. It presents a richer representation of real things that traditional programming technologies. Users need conventions for core concepts and how they fit together. In our conversations with the Wikibon community, we hear both interest and confusion regarding the notion of digital twins. We believe digital twins will have enormous If you’ve been following IBM’s strategic moves over the past 6 months in data and analytics, it’s hard not to have some concerns. The announcements they’ve been making this year err on the side of excessive caution. What they illustrate is IBM Analytics’ ongoing retrenchment into mainframes, private clouds, and end-to-end data governance. IBM seems to be re-crafting its core Wikibon projects that 3D XPoint will not make it in volume in either the enterprise or consumer markets; it may reside in some specialist application niches. The areas of uniqueness claimed for 3D XPoint will be addressed by DRAM, 3D NAND, and innovative non-volatile combinations of DRAM and 3D NAND. CIOs and CTOs should assume 3D XPoint will NOT be important to the enterprise, and not evaluate it further. The focus should be on deployment of 3D NAND technologies, and expect a rapid cadence of increases in performance, density, form factor, and volume. Hybrid DIMMs with DRAM and 3D NAND should also be evaluated as the technologies mature, as well as UniGrid Architectures. Premise By mid 2018, 3D NAND will become the backbone of almost all deliveries and all vendors of NAND flash, to both the consumer and enterprise markets, with a clear path to increased density, higher performance, and decreasing cost. Consumer NAND announcements are a leading indicator of enterprise NAND capabilities. Toshiba Consumer SSD NAND Announcement The concept of Private Cloud has been in the market since 2008, but the ability of IT organizations to build Private Cloud services that match Public Cloud have been limited. Wikibon forecasts the Private Cloud market revenues from 2015-2026, as well as introducing the enhanced concept of “True” Private Cloud. As more companies transition into digital businesses, it is critical to understand the business and technology trends that will shape Cloud Computing for the next decade. Wikibon examines the critical elements to help companies understand this rapidly evolving landscape and marketplace. Customers are asking how to choose from the rich and growing array of tools in the Hadoop ecosystem. Part of the consideration centers on how to insulate them from fragmentation in the continually evolving Hadoop ecosystem. The incredibly rapid pace of innovation distinguishes the ecosystem but it also has its downsides. The mix and match richness of choice introduces complexity for administrators and developers. At some point it makes sense for customers to consider investing in tools that can hide much of that complexity in data ready for analysis. To be clear, there is no magic product that can hide all these technologies. But when customers take the perspective of simplifying specific end-to-end processes, solutions are available to address the problem. IT leaders can no longer treat stream processors as esoteric functionality employed solely by leading-edge consumer Internet services. They are becoming core functionality that works side-by-side with the more familiar batch processing engines such as Hive, HBase, or Impala. Application developers that need near real-time functionality can start to evaluate stream processors as part of design patterns. However, their analytics functionality is still a bit primitive and most of them need a lot of hardening in order to be resilient enough for mainstream customers.

Wikibon Research has forecasted Public Cloud revenues from 2015 through 2026; with the expectations that 33% of all IT spending ($500B) will move to Public Cloud services within the next decade. The impact this will have on IT vendors and IT strategy will be significant as more applications focus on mobile and real-time data analytics. In this research paper, Wikibon looks back at the introductory Server SAN research, adjusts the Server SAN definition to include System Drag, and increases the speed of adoption of Server SAN based on very fast adoption from 2012 to 2014. The overall growth of Server SAN is projected to be about a 23% CAGR from 2014 to 2026, with a faster growth from 2014 to 2020 of 38%. The total Server SAN market is projected to grow to over $48 billion by 2026. The traditional enterprise storage market is projected to decline by -16% CAGR, leading to an overall growth in storage spend of 3% CAGR through 2026. Traditional enterprise storage is being squeezed in a vice between a superior, lower cost and more flexible storage model with Enterprise Server SAN, and the migration of IT towards cloud computing and Hyperscale Server SAN deployments. Wikibon strongly recommends that CTOs & CIOs initiate Server SAN pilot projects in 2015, particularly for applications where either low cost or high performance is required. Mainstream IT, LoB execs and application development professionals each provide different yet critical perspectives to Systems of Intelligence. IT exes must be in a position to deliver the right infrastructure (e.g. cloud, on-prem, etc.) with the proper performance and SLA profile to support LoB requirements. Line-of-Business execs must have enough knowledge to specify the real-time needs of applications while application development pros must ensure the right skills are in place to deliver and maintain services to Systems of Intelligence over a full life cycle. The Big Data market continued its maturation in 2014, experiencing both significant growth as measured by vendor revenue and increased adoption of Big Data tools and technologies by large enterprises across vertical markets. In this exclusive report for Wikibon Premium members, Wikibon details Big Data vendor revenue and extends its groundbreaking market forecast through 2020. Converged infrastructure is a trend that has been growing for over 5 years and is rapidly transforming the way that users consume IT. In 2012, Wikibon forecasted (see Converged Infrastructure Takes the Market By Storm) that 2/3 of infrastructure for enterprise applications would be packaged as some form of converged infrastructure by 2017. Now there are billions of dollars of Hortonworks plans to go public in 2015 and its S-1 filing, revealed to the world yesterday, says a lot about the state of the Hadoop market generally and, obviously, Hortonworks specifically.

The company’s fourth quarter results were particularly weak, coming in 5.5% below expectations.

The Google Compute Engine (GCE) is a public cloud now generally available that brings Google’s architecture to the masses. While it is undeniable that Google has immense resources (having spent over $2.9B on infrastructure) and The research behind this article drills down into the database components, Big Data SQL database revenue, and Big Data NoSQL database revenue. The total represents 10.4% of total Big Data in 2012, and remains at about 10% of total through 2017. Last week at the Open Compute Summit Winter 2013 event, Facebook shared insight into its IT infrastructure. While hyperscale companies like Google, Amazon, and Facebook are quite different from the typical enterprise, it is Wikibon’s belief that those companies are driving key changes to how infrastructure is consumed that will filter down to the service provider and enterprise worlds in the Providing effective business analytics tools and technologies to the enterprise is a top priority of CIOs and for good reason. Effective business analytics – from basic reporting to advanced data mining and predictive analytics — allows data analysts and business users alike to extract insights from corporate data that, when translated into action, deliver higher levels of efficiency and profitability to the enterprise. Underlying every business analytics practice is data. Traditionally, this meant structured data created and stored by enterprises themselves, such as customer data housed in CRM applications, operational data stored in ERP systems or financial data tallied in accounting databases. But the volume and type of data now available to enterprises — and the need to analyze it in near-real time for maximum business value — is growing rapidly thanks to the popularity of social media and networking services like Facebook and Twitter, data-generating sensor equipped and networked devices, both machine- and human-generated online transactions, and other sources of unstructured and semi-structured data. We call this Big Data.

with Dave Vellante Dive into tech news and cutting-edge insights on current technology topics with Breaking Analysis hosted by Dave Vellante. Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and theCUBE Research communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Salesforce is moving from the hype phase of generative AI into doing the harder engineering work to create the agentic enterprise. Dreamforce 2025 showed us that the company which created the original SaaS model now wants to lead what we call service as software. In our view, this represents a profound revolution, not just in technology but in business. In a world where AI agents deliver outcomes across systems of record, systems of engagement and systems of intelligence. Our assessment is that Salesforce’s AgentForce 360 platform is crossing day one early version to attack day two problems and customer requirements. What does that mean? It’s no longer just demoing copilots inside Customer 360. Rather, the company is going after the messy problems of observability, orchestration, data quality, etc. that determine whether agent systems can scale in the enterprise. The shift to service as software will bring learning curve advantages, software- like marginal economics, and winner- take- most dynamics to all companies across every industry, not just tech vendors. We believe those firms that can more quickly jump on the AI experience curve will see substantially increased benefits relative to their competitors. However, our research suggests that data management We’re on the cusp of a new software- enabled business model that will determine winners and losers in the coming decades. We call this service -as-software. Specifically, we believe enterprises will begin to organize knowledge work in new ways, that harmonize islands of automation into a build-to-order assembly line for knowledge work. Firms that aggressively pursue this opportunity will be on a learning curve that we think will create sustainable competitive advantage, and, importantly, a winner-take-most dynamic. Now, we’re not just talking about technology vendors here. Rather, we believe new technology, operational, and business models will emerge, and apply to all enterprises across every industry. In this breaking analysis, theCUBE Research team presents a new way to think about how businesses will operate in the AI era; with implications for application developers, edge deployments, and security / governance models. With a glimpse toward the path that we think organizations can take to go from where they are today into the future. For the past several decades, Cybersecurity has been an unfair fight. The economics have favored attackers, which have access to sophisticated resources, lower costs, fast innovation cycles and deep knowledge of vulnerabilities. Defenders, by contrast, bear the full burden of securing sprawling networks, fragmented technologies, and human error, all while operating under legal, regulatory, and financial scrutiny. In our view, the Intel–NVIDIA pact further accentuates NVIDIA’s dominance and represents a final handoff of the baton in the race to the next era of computing. Just as Intel had a lock on the market in the 80s and 90s, NVIDIA has now extended its moat deep into the x86 ecosystem (in both PCs and the data center) and expanded its TAM by $500B to $1T by our estimates. The subtext here is that Lip-Bu Tan is taking necessary steps to save Intel. In doing so, he’s hitching the company’s wagon to the future, which is being defined by CUDA, NVIDIA’s software platform. This move by our estimates, increases Intel’s TAM by $100B and breathes new life into the x86 franchise, which was rapidly deteriorating. In our view, Intel foundry remains problematic but will get a boost from the system on chip (SoC) products that this partnership will produce. On balance we see this as a win for both companies, x86 customers and a further boost for AI’s momentum. CrowdStrike used Fal.con 2025 to harden its ongoing value proposition that security is a speed game. But the company extended its messaging emphasizing that platforms which orchestrate fleets of AI agents will set the bar for the future of security. In our view, George Kurtz’s keynote and theCUBE interview (below) mark a goal to create a clean hand-off from “assistive The threat landscape is undergoing a profound transformation. At CrowdStrike’s Fal.Con 2025 event in Las Vegas, Adam Meyers, who heads counter-adversary operations, provided a rare window into how the world’s most capable adversaries are adapting their tactics. His insights underscore a sobering reality in that artificial intelligence has become both a weapon and a defense shield, underscoring the asymmetry between attackers and defenders. We believe CrowdStrike (CRWD) has re-established growth momentum while still working through the financial and reputational overhang of the July 19, 2024 global outage. The company recently delivered net new ARR reacceleration ahead of expectations, showcased strong platform expansion across cloud, identity, and Next-Gen SIEM, and leaned on Falcon Flex as a durable consolidation lever. In our view, the near-term debate centers not only on churn or Flex conversion but more on net new ARR performance, valuation skepticism, and whether identity and SIEM can offset a maturing core endpoint business while fending off intensifying competition. The mainspring of CrowdStrike’s success remains relentless product innovation, increasingly defined by its platform. We believe its unified platform and AI-driven threat defense at scale underpin the company’s premium valuation through customer consolidation, stickiness, and durable ARR growth. We believe the prevailing narrative that Broadcom and NVIDIA are locked in a zero-sum battle for AI data center dominance is misleading. The reality is these companies are playing very different games. NVIDIA has built a vertically integrated compute and software platform that has become the engine of the AI factory era. Broadcom, by contrast, has constructed a durable business model around connectivity, custom silicon, and high-margin software. The strategies overlap but are not mutually exclusive. We believe the real story is how these firms are carving out complementary positions in the most important technology cycle since the dawn of the Internet. We believe the industry’s broad interpretation of Jensen’s Law — i.e. “Jensen’s Law accelerates Moore’s Law” — understates a fundamental economic reality of AI Factories. Jensen Huang’s own language and NVIDIA’s operating model point to a financial law of motion for AI factories: When power is the binding constraint and demand is elastic, perf/watt increases raise monetizable throughput faster than they raise total cost. The result is an extension to existing laws of tech that we’ve come to know. Specifically, Jensen’s invoking of Buy ore to make more (i.e. revenue up) and spend more to save more (i.e. unit cost down) has explicit economic implications that we believe need further examination. In addition, there is a corollary in this new regime in that, under certain conditions, fabric‑driven utilization unlocks are so valuable that high‑speed networking becomes “economically free” (i.e. where utilization gains exceed amortized fabric cost). In this Breaking Analysis we explain in detail what we’re referring to as a new Jensen’s Law. We’ll explore why this phenomenon is so important, review the math behind it, share some concrete examples of where the law is applicable, when the corollary of “the network is free” holds, implications for investors and operators; and where the law is not applicable. We believe the center of gravity in AI infrastructure has shifted from servers to AI factories, where networking is perhaps as critical as compute. Our analysis of an interview with NVIDIA SVP of Networking, Gilad Shainer, indicates NVIDIA’s thesis is straightforward. Specifically, that scale-up fabrics (NVLink/NVLink Fusion) plus scale-out Ethernet purpose-built for AI (Spectrum-X) — and increasingly scale-across for multi–data center topologies (Spectrum-XGS) — deliver superior determinism, efficiency, and time-to-outcomes at giga-scale. At the same time, the market is too large and heterogeneous for any single fabric to dominate; open standards and merchant Ethernet will continue to win broad adoption, and even NVIDIA is embracing open interfaces and ecosystems to complement its proprietary advantages. In our view, NVIDIA is a somewhat rare case where first-mover advantage has paid off. Its early conviction in parallel computing, GPUs, CUDA/NCCL software moats, and the Mellanox acquisition now underpin a defensible systems position across scale-up, scale-out, and (increasingly) scale-across. Cybersecurity is the number one risk facing enterprises today, and yet organizations remain dangerously unprepared. Executives are not blind to the problem — they understand the financial exposure, the reputational stakes, and the business impact of a major breach. They acknowledge gaps in their defenses and recognize the vulnerabilities that could cripple their mission-critical systems. But awareness has not translated into readiness and true business resilience remains elusive for the vast majority of firms. Data strategies are especially important – specifically data governance, data protection, and data quality. These remain essential elements of cyber resilience, but they’re only part of the equation. True business resilience requires confronting a multitude of dimensions — from application security to identity, supply chain integrity, operational continuity, infrastructure defenses and more. The uncomfortable truth is that most firms still lack the cohesive strategy, investment, and execution to protect their most vital assets. Donald Trump’s 180 on Intel is at least directionally correct, certainly more so than calling for the ouster of Lip-Bu Tan, Intel’s CEO. But a contemplated investment by the US in Intel, as reported by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, without a significant restructuring of Intel’s entire business, is a recipe for failure in our view. Specifically, we continue to urge Intel’s board to spin out its foundry business. Every day it waits further decreases foundry’s value. Moreover, we call on the U.S. government to use money from the CHIPS Act and its influence on large US chip designers, and TSMC, to secure a position for a US-domiciled company in advanced semiconductor manufacturing. AI is currently running on a one lane, CapEx highway that is capacity constrained. Hyperscalers are the largest contributor to the momentum and as such, investors keep score with cloud growth rates. But this past quarter you had to read the footnotes and the fine print to go beyond the massive investments fueling the wave. Microsoft put up eye-popping Azure growth again, but a big part of that acceleration is Azure serving AI inference — notably ChatGPT — now neatly included in the revised definition of what’s included in Azure. This is great for headlines but not conducive to apples-to-apples comparisons over time. Meanwhile, AWS delivered the largest revenue for cloud infrastructure and sent a clear message that demand exceeds supply. Meaning growth is capped by power and components, not pipeline. That creates a weird optics penalty — AWS showing growth in the high teens on a $120B-plus run rate and it’s deemed “concerning.” But it also telegraphs future upside as capacity goes online and depreciation cycles progress. OpenAI and NVIDIA just dropped news with implications for every model lab, cloud, and enterprise AI customer and vendor. The two companies released gpt-oss-20B and gpt-oss-120B, open-weight reasoning models trained on H100, tuned across NVIDIA’s full stack, and capable of spitting out 1.5 million tokens per second on a single Blackwell GB200 NVL72 rack. The weights ship under a permissive license; the inference path spans DGX Cloud, Blackwell servers, and RTX PCs via Ollama, llama.cpp, vLLM, FlashInfer, Hugging Face, and Microsoft AI Foundry Local. Last November, we argued that Jamie Dimon is sitting on a treasure trove of proprietary data that will never find its way into proprietary LLMs via the Internet. And as such, he was Sam Altman’s biggest competitor because his data is more valuable than the democratized insights from these LLMs. Our premise was and continues to be that foundation model companies are waging an internecine battle chasing artificial general intelligence (Messiah AGI) and the true holy grail is what we called “enterprise AGI;” meaning applying AI to proprietary data inside of enterprises will ultimately prove to be the most valuable endeavor. Today we extend that argument and posit that agents and enterprise digital twins, powered by that proprietary data, will drive the next wave of AI value. By all accounts, Microsoft just delivered one of the most powerful quarters in its history. But this wasn’t just a blowout print, it was a signal that Microsoft is playing a new game. The company’s performance is redefining what hyperscale looks like in the AI era. An objective analysis of the Q4 FY2025 earnings call suggests that Microsoft is firing on all cylinders in cloud, AI, and infrastructure execution, and it’s building for a future measured in gigawatts, not racks. The only potential negatives for investors are: 1) Capital expenditures are expected to be more than $30B in the coming quarter, signalling continued spending ahead of revenue and negatively affecting cash flow; and 2) Gross margin pressure continues in cloud due to the lower margins realized in its Azure / infrastructure business. The stablecoin market is rapidly maturing into one of the most consequential sectors of the digital asset econoour. After years of uncertainty, regulatory friction, and media skepticism, stablecoins are no longer a speculative curiosity, rather they are foundational to the next chapter of programmable finance. Our research suggests that the convergence of policy shifts, institutional adoption, and new economic use cases has thrust stablecoins into the spotlight. In short: crypto’s ChatGPT moment has arrived, and its name is stablecoin. In our view, IBM delivered one of its strongest quarters in recent memory, reinforcing a narrative we’ve tracked for some time – i.e. the pivot from legacy to a modern, AI-driven hybrid cloud company is finally showing up in the numbers. The company beat expectations across revenue, profit, margin, and free cash flow, and perhaps more importantly, demonstrated credible traction While the NASDAQ seems to reach new highs daily, enterprise tech spending remains persistently cautious at the macro amid continued uncertainty. That’s not necessarily bad news but it can be disconcerting to decision makers. Often during transitional cycles, like the one we’re in now, executives don’t want to overrotate on capital allocations that deliver outcomes, which could potentially be achieved much more cost effectively with emerging technologies like AI. We’ve seen similar patterns in previous waves. There was a period of “great softness” in enterprise IT spending when transitioning from mainframes and minis to the PC era, a huge backlash from overly exuberant Y2K and dotcom spending; and a steady deterioration of traditional enterprise tech momentum during the cloud, mobile, SaaS, social, big data era. Each wave is different but two common themes remain: 1/ strong conviction that a new era is here; and 2/ fear of disruption, which sometimes leads to hasty decision making and waste. These countervailing forces seem to be in play today as 87% of enterprises report taking a cautious approach to AI investments. And that caution is showing up in the macro spend environment. Intel’s new CEO has promised to clean up the balance sheet, slim down the company, return to a culture of engineering, sharpen its customer focus, shore up its products, become a world class independent foundry and lead Intel for as long as it takes to achieve success, however that is defined. As our audience knows, unlike most other analysts, we have aggressively emphasized the icebergs ahead for Intel since 2013, culminating in our prediction that Intel would go bankrupt trying to execute on its most previous strategy. While we would have preferred a different approach to Intel’s foundry – i.e. JV with TSM – Lip-Bu Tan at least has what we consider to be a viable go forward plan. The steady state outcome of this new direction, however is far from certain. In last week’s Breaking Analysis we argued that Snowflake was attempting to cross the Rubicon, vaulting from cloud data warehouse innovator into AI leader and intelligent application platform. This week the competitive fire got a fresh accelerant. As usual, Databricks followed up Snowflake Summit and put forth bold claims of its own, emphasizing unified governance, data intelligence, simplified user experiences, transactional capabilities and, of course, open data. Cisco hasn’t enjoyed much organic revenue growth in more than a decade. It just rolled into San Diego claiming this year’s Cisco Live is the “most consequential” event in the company’s history. Hyperbole? Maybe. But after three days on-site comprising Q&A with Chuck Robbins and Jeetu Patel, closed-door roadmap dives, and a flood of product reveals in public, our assessment is that Cisco finally has a credible, end-to-end story for the AI era. Our research indicates that data platform wars have entered an entirely new phase, one where open data is no longer a marketing slogan and governance catalogs are now the new control point. We see this as the first of several structural changes to the software industry. The next price of entry we think will be an emerging layer that we call systems of intelligence, or SOI, which we believe will become a high value piece of real estate in the AI-optimized software stack. In this Breaking Analysis, and just a few days removed from Snowflake Summit 2025, we unpack how Snowflake has moved from steward of its pristine proprietary data platform to orchestrating an ecosystem in a world that enables any compute engine to operate on any open data formats. Last week, we framed the company’s Rubicon moment, meaning the pivot from analytic warehouse to enabler of intelligent data apps. The data industry has arrived at a pivotal juncture that echoes the themes we’ve charted in previous Breaking Analysis episodes, from The Sixth Data Platform through The Yellow Brick Road to Agentic AI; Why Jamie Dimon is Sam Altman’s Biggest Competitor all the way to the Faceoff between Benioff and Nadella. Those analyses have chronicled the steady convergence of analytic data platforms such as Snowflake and Databricks, not only with the hyperscalers’ estates, but increasingly, with the operational applications that run businesses. Our research indicates that this merger is not a side-effect of Gen AI hype, rather it’s a structural shift in how enterprises will create value from data and software over the next several decades. Thirty months into the GenAI awakening, the jury is still out on how much enterprises are benefiting from investments in artificial intelligence. While the vast majority of customers continue to spend on AI, reported returns are no greater than, and frankly lag those, typically associated with historical IT initiatives like ERP, data warehousing and cloud computing. Let’s face it, the multi-hundred billion dollar annual CAPEX outlay from hyperscalers and sovereign nations is fueling the euphoria and essentially supporting blind faith in the AI movement. But ground truth returns from enterprise AI adoption remain opaque. This combined with geopolitical unrest, fluctuating public policy and GDP estimates in the low single digits, have buyers tempering expectations for tech spending relative to January of this year. Dell’s founder-led business is one of the most remarkable and under appreciated stories in tech. Dell Technologies is not particularly sexy, nor does it put forth an earth- shattering vision that bends the mind. Yet it’s a company that has consistently figured out how to ride successive waves without becoming driftwood. And like Hyman Roth of Godfather fame, Michael Dell always seems to make money for his partners. Unlike Roth, Mr. Dell is not a gangster, rather he’s a gentleman that literally wrote the book on how to play nice and win. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of DTW 2025, we examine the question, how will Dell capture the explosive AI opportunity, while transitioning the millions of servers, arrays, and PCs it already has in the field to this new AI era? The Road to ‘Service-as-Software.’ Salesforce co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff is articulating a bold vision for the next era of enterprise software. In an exclusive interview with theCUBE on April 25, 2025, Benioff outlined how AI-driven agents and a unified data architecture will transform Software as a Service (SaaS) into what we’re calling “Service as Software” – a model where software-based digital agents augment every business process. The Salesforce chief has often quipped that today’s CEOs are “the last generation of executives leading exclusively human workforces,” underscoring his conviction that AI agents (what many call agentic AI) will soon work alongside humans in every enterprise. Our premise is that this “digital labor” revolution could be more disruptive than the cloud and mobile waves of 15 years ago, fundamentally redefining how applications function. Our view is that IBM has crystallized a coherent, differentiated AI thesis based on smaller, domain‑tuned models running on an open, hybrid‑cloud fabric. The goal is to unlock what it claims is the 99 percent of enterprise data still untouched by GenAI. If execution matches the marketing—particularly on integration speed and cost transparency—IBM will change the perception from perennial AI underdog to a primary or even default choice for risk‑averse enterprises seeking tangible ROI. The next two quarters of Watsonx bookings and Granite adoption will tell us whether the strategy is hitting escape velocity, merely clearing the launchpad or needs a reset. Based on this quarter’s earnings reports, it’s clear to us that demand is not the constraint for hyperscale clouds. They are, however running head‑long into the hard limits of physics. Access to megawatts, liquid‑cooled racks, and a GPU supply chain that begins and ends with NVIDIA are now critical paths to tapping what appears to be unlimited demand. AWS, Microsoft, and Google each chalked up record‑setting capital outlays last quarter—collectively dropping around $63 billion in CAPEX—yet even that eye‑popping sum can’t fully satiate the compute‑hungry AI models racing toward trillion‑parameter scale. We believe the real story isn’t simply “AI is expensive”; it’s that power availability, not revenue potential, is now the gating factor on hyperscaler growth. In our view, the winners of the next cycle will be the providers that secure sustainable energy footprints, master GPU allocation, and—critically—translate all that infrastructure into margin‑accretive AI services before the depreciation schedules kick in. Welcome to the ironic era where megawatts equal market share. As RSAC 2025 approaches, key themes are emerging that are set to dominate the world’s largest cybersecurity gathering. Industry dynamics are shifting rapidly – from AI enabling higher velocity threats, an intensified platform consolidation debate, high-profile M&A, rising interest in AI agents (with somewhat tepid adoption in cyber) and shifting security budget priorities. Our research shows that while cybersecurity remains At last week’s AI Agent Builder Summit, hosted by Scott Hebner of theCUBE Research at SiliconANGLE’s Palo Alto Studios, the hype around “agentic AI” – autonomous software agents that can orchestrate complex tasks – was on full display. Demos and keynotes painted a bold vision of AI-driven business processes. But scratch beneath the surface, and a sobering reality emerges: Most enterprises are far from ready to reap the benefits of fully autonomous agents. Much work needs to be done to realize the promise of agentic systems, including organizational alignment to create a true data culture, cleaning up data silos, harmonizing that data, data ownership, data product thinking, getting governance and security right, choosing technology partners, rationalizing your SaaS and on-prem applications portfolio, and of course change management to get all this done. Starting the journey toward an agentic enterprise is an exciting imperative, but in our view will take the better part of a decade to realize. We estimate that Google’s Cloud business will exceed $50B in annual revenue this year with Google Cloud Platform comprising more than 50% of its cloud revenue for the first time ever. Why is it then that Google’s cloud business, a $50B+ entity growing deep into the double digits gets so much criticism? The answer is simple. Google’s cloud, with arguably the best technology in the industry, is 2.5 – 3.5 times smaller than the cloud businesses of AWS and Microsoft. We are in the midst of a fundamental transformation of computing architectures. We’re moving from a world where we create data, store it, retrieve it, harmonize it and present it so that we can make better decisions, to a world that creates content from knowledge using tokens as a new unit of value; and increasingly takes action in real time with or without human intervention, driving unprecedented increases in value. What this means is every part of the computing stack, from silicon, infrastructure, security, middleware, development tools, applications and even services, is changing. As with other waves in computing, consumer adoption leads us up the innovation curve where the value is clear, the volume is high and the velocity is accelerated, leading to lower costs and eventual adoption into and disruption of enterprise applications. Importantly, to do this work on today’s data center infrastructure would be 10X more expensive, trending toward 100X by the end of the decade. As such, virtually everything is going to move to this new model of computing. Automation generally and AI specifically, render today’s cybersecurity stacks ineffective. Previously, stopping 99% of attacks and leaving the 1% for armed human hunters to deal with was, while not ideal, at least feasible. With AI, that all goes away because adversaries can scale phishing and other attacks at unprecedented rates, which overwhelms the ability of humans. This creates a wider gap between exfiltration times, which are shrinking, and mean time to remediation, giving even greater advantage to attackers. As such, the only way to fight AI is with AI. Moreover, the ever expanding number of tools in an organization’s security stack continues to exacerbate the problem. According to Palo Alto Networks, the answer is a complete makeover of your cybersecurity stack where consolidating multiple tools into a single platform and gaining comprehensive access to the right data, simplifies security operations and enables AI to operate in real time. The analyst relations (AR) function is undergoing a fundamental transformation. Once dominated by a handful of large research houses, such as Gartner, IDC and Forrester, the market now features a spectrum of independent analysts and influencers. The fast-paced nature of the tech industry, its speed of change, the relentless competition and ubiquity of technology, make it a challenging sector for Since the Gen AI awakening, we’ve said consistently that NVIDIA and Broadcom are the #1 and #2 AI plays in tech. Since peaking in mid-December of last year, Broadcom shares have been under pressure, off on sympathy with other semiconductor stocks and the general confusion about the economy, tariffs, inflation, jobs, geopolitics, debt, etc. Broadcom’s Q1 results were impressive and assuaged some of these fears. At one point last night after hours the stock was up 15% from its previous close and midday Friday was up around 6-7% despite continued pressure on tech shares. Market transitions such as the one we’re in now often bring confusion and market volatility as the new high growth sectors are not large enough to offset the slowdown in the larger declining markets. NVIDIA doesn’t have this problem because it is at the mainspring of the new wave. Broadcom is facing a similar but different dynamic in that its traditional businesses are ones that are extremely durable. Moreover, we see two relatively new dynamics coming into play for Broadcom: 1) Hyperscalers are coming to Broadcom to enable their custom AI accelerators; and 2) Broadcom’s VMware strategy is working, lifting the company to new software heights. A seismic shift is underway in enterprise software, one that pits two of the most influential leaders in the industry—Microsoft’s Satya Nadella and Salesforce’s Marc Benioff—against each other in a war of words that highlights the broader transformation unfolding in enterprise applications. Nadella predicts the demise of traditional SaaS applications, arguing that AI-powered agents will take over, fundamentally redefining enterprise software. Benioff, on the other hand, argues that AI will serve as an augmentation layer and rely on his existing platform to supply the digital workforce of the future. Few brands in technology carry the storied pedigree of Intel. For decades, “Intel Inside” was synonymous with progress in computing—an American icon that repeatedly raised the bar for processor performance and innovation. Today, Intel finds itself in a precarious position. Its once-vaunted manufacturing machine has fallen behind TSMC, which dominates advanced process nodes. Meanwhile, Intel’s core CPU design business—a substantial, if bruised, revenue engine—remains overshadowed by the mounting losses and capital burn in its foundry operations. Rumors swirl that Broadcom might step in and scoop up Intel’s design arm. But for those who believe in competition, national security, and the long-term integrity of an American technology brand, that outcome would be deeply misguided. Earnings reports from the big three cloud players disappointed investors this week. All three US hyperscalers fell a bit short of consensus for their cloud revenues in the December quarter and investor reaction has been negative. But squinting through the data, there’s a lot to like about the position of AWS, Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure. In particular, the IaaS and PaaS revenue alone for the big 3 approached $200B in 2024 and grew 25%. All three cited capacity constraints and, along with Meta, are committing more than $300B in CAPEX spend this year, most of it to support current and future AI demand. As is often the case, when a new wave hits it tends to be overhyped at the beginning of the cycle and underestimated when it hits a steady state. And in between points A and B we often see blips and bumps that represent opportunities for long term investors. Make no mistake. We are entering a technology cycle that is completely new. Massively parallel computing and the Gen AI awakening is creating an entirely different industry focus that has altered customer spending patterns. Moreover, this new computing paradigm has changed competitive dynamics almost overnight. Decisions whether to spend tens of billions or hundreds of billions on CAPEX are being challenged by novel approaches to deploying AI. Geopolitical tensions are higher than at any time in the history of tech. While the pace of change appears to be accelerating, causing consternation and confusion, the reality is that broad technology adoption evolves over long periods of time, creating opportunities, risks, and tectonic shifts in industry structures. At the beginning of each year, as is our tradition, we collaborate with ETR to dig through the latest data and craft ten predictions for the coming year. This year’s batch follows some annual favorites and some new territory. In this Breaking Analysis we put forth our top ten predictions for enterprise tech in 2025 with our usual data-heavy opinions and prognostications. In just two short years, the entire data and technology industry has undergone a seismic shift. Tech stacks—from top to bottom—are being tuned to harness extreme parallel computing, often called Accelerated Computing. From silicon to infrastructure and throughout the software layer, nowhere is this transformation more pronounced than in the data stack. Over the past seven years, modern cloud-native data platforms set the agenda. Today, however, the rise of open table formats, shifting control points, open-source governance catalogs, and a heightened focus on AI are creating both challenges and opportunities for enterprises and the tech providers who serve them. In this special breaking analysis, we’re pleased to host our fourth annual data predictions power panel with some of our collaborators in the Cube Collective and members of the Data Gang. With us today are five of the top industry analysts focused on data platforms. Sanjeev Mohan of Sanjmo, Tony Bear of DB Insight, recent IDC graduate Carl Olofson, Dave Menninger of ISG and Brad Schimmin with Omdia. We are witnessing the rise of a completely new computing era. Within the next decade, a trillion-dollar-plus data center business is poised for transformation, powered by what we refer to as extreme parallel computing (EPC)—or as some prefer to call it, accelerated computing. While artificial intelligence is the primary accelerant, the effects ripple across the entire technology stack. Nvidia sits in the vanguard of this shift, forging an end-to-end platform that integrates hardware, software, systems engineering, and a massive ecosystem. Our view is that Nvidia has a 10-to-20-year runway to drive this transformation, but the market forces at play are much larger than a single player. This new paradigm is about reimagining compute from the ground up: from the chip level to data center equipment, to distributed computing at scale, data and applications stacks and emerging robotics at the edge. The road to agentic AI will be paved with stepping stones that progressively build on each other. Our research suggests that Agentic AI will not suddenly appear without a strong data foundation built on: 1) cloud-like scalability; 2) a unified metadata model; 3) data mesh organizing principles; 4) harmonized data and business process logic; and an orchestration framework that incorporates governance, security and observability. The time for Intel to shed its foundry business is now. While former CEO Pat Gelsinger made a persuasive case for U.S.-based advanced semiconductor manufacturing, his vision was flawed from the start. Intel’s foundry operation, like IBM’s Microelectronics business a decade ago, is an asset with negative value. Yet, its strategic significance for U.S. competitiveness in the semiconductor race cannot be overstated. If financial institutions are deemed too big to fail, then Intel’s foundry represents a similarly critical infrastructure for U.S. national interests. AWS re:Invent 2024 ushered in a transformative chapter for both Amazon Web Services and the broader tech ecosystem. This year’s event marked the debut of Matt Garman as CEO of AWS, stepping into a role that aligns with what John Furrier aptly describes as a “wartime CEO”—a technically adept leader and trusted consigliere. Garman’s keynote set the tone for AWS’s strategic focus: doubling down on core infrastructure capabilities across silicon, compute, storage, and networking, while extending its Graviton playbook to GPUs and potentially large language models (LLMs). The inboxes are overflowing once again with predictions about the future of enterprise tech, as we gear up for 2025. While many of these forecasts are insightful, we’ll sift through them carefully before releasing our own predictions later in January of next year. True to tradition, we aim to set a higher bar for our forecasts by focusing on measurable outcomes—whether it’s tied to a specific number or a clear binary result. Our philosophy remains consistent: a good prediction should be testable, enabling us to look back a year later and determine, with confidence and supporting data, whether it held true. In this Breaking Analysis, we evaluate the 2024 predictions we made alongside ETR’s Erik Bradley. We revisit our January forecasts on topics like the macro IT spending environment, GenAI ROI, security, on-prem AI, technology priorities and more. The ever expanding cloud has become ubiquitous. No longer is the cloud some remote set of services, somewhere up in the sky. Rather, the cloud is seeping into every industry, hybrid on-prem models, edge workloads, telco markets and has its sights on space. The market size is staggering and will surpass $1T in revenue when including infrastructure – IaaS and PaaS – SaaS and professional services. Much AI work is being done today in the public cloud and despite indications that bringing AI to on-prem data will be a growing trend, it’s unlikely that the cloud will stop expanding any time soon. Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware is proceeding almost exactly as we expected when the deal was announced in May of 2022. While much of the media and competitor narrative is focused on the increased license fees Broadcom is imposing and the urgency of migrating off VMware, customer conversations and recent surveys show that while migrations are happening, the real story is that VMware’s more narrow focus and cost discipline are allowing Broadcom to integrate VMWare into its highly successful business model. Specifically, we see two seemingly countervailing trends that are both possible to be true: 1) Customers are actively moving many low value workloads off VMware; and 2) Most mission critical work is staying put, allowing Broadcom to dramatically increase the contribution from its software business and deliver a roadmap for customers that will be more cost effective than migrating. Investors have poured north of $30B into independent foundation model players including OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, Mistral and others. OpenAI itself has raised more than $20B. To keep pace, both Meta and xAI will have to spend comparable amounts. In our view, the stampeding herd of LLM investors is blindly focused on the false grail of so-called artificial general intelligence AGI. We believe the greatest value capture exists in what we’re calling enterprise AGI, metaphorically represented by the proprietary data estates and managerial know-how locked inside of firms like JP Morgan Chase, and virtually every enterprise. The tools to curate and harness that collective intelligence will allow these firms to capture the majority of value in the race for AI leadership. Gen AI enthusiasm has lately turned to AI skepticism. Lack of clarity on tangible ROI for mainstream businesses, a narrow list of early winners and relentless vendor marketing around AI has caused cynicism and media backlash. But the reality remains that we have entered a new era in technology innovation that has a high probability of transforming industries, public policy, company leadership and the related fortunes of individuals and organizations. Moreover, 97% of leading Gen AI adopters report that they’re achieving tangible benefits from their deployments. Adoption of Gen AI is relentlessly on the rise and nearly two years in, is poised to begin throwing off enough value that it will heighten a mandate to apply AI to drive business results. As such, we believe that as we exit Q4 into 2025, the demand for AI solutions will continue to occupy the headspace of business technology pros and AI momentum will maintain its accelerated pace. It’s estimated that organizations spend more than $200B annually on security hardware, software and services globally. That’s a big number. But consider that the economic impact of cybercrime ranges from $500B – $2T annually. There’s even an estimate from cybersecurity ventures that says the figure is as high as $9.5T. Each year, it seems the more we spend, the more vulnerable we become, which is especially concerning given the exposure to critical infrastructures. Governments around the world have stepped up their involvement with executive orders, privacy regulations and lots of “finger wagging” at the technology industry and its customers. Frankly some of that is justified. The technology industry does much good but has a subpar record at solving this problem. One premise that we’ve put forth at theCUBE Research is that the industry must find ways to better collaborate and share resources to combat cyber threats. Two firms, IBM and Palo Alto Networks, have joined forces to combine deep expertise, AI and platform approach to better protect organizations from attackers. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the security landscape and unpack the multi-dimensional relationship between IBM and Palo Alto Networks to better understand how industry collaboration can improve cyber defenses and modernize security operations. With us are two senior executives from each firm, Mohamad Ali, SVP and Head of IBM Consulting and BJ Jenkins, the President of Palo Alto Networks. Microsoft’s new financial disclosures include changes to the way it reports Azure metrics. The company said the change was to better align Azure with consumption revenue and by inference, more closely aligning with how AWS, the leader in cloud computing infrastructure, reports its metrics. The accounting change removed certain mature, slower growth revenue streams and consequently raised the growth rates for Azure. It also had the effect of increasing the AI services contribution within Azure. While this was reported and often applauded in the media and financial circles, what wasn’t widely discussed is that while such a change increases growth rates, by definition it reduces the size of the Azure business and its resulting revenue market share. Regardless, in our view, Microsoft is comfortable that the future AI revenue contribution within Azure combined with both higher growth rates and a greater AI contribution will foster greater investor confidence and enthusiasm over time. They’re probably correct. Data from recent surveys shows that the scenarios we’ve been putting forth throughout 2024 continue to be in play. Specifically, we cite three main dynamics affecting the tech spending climate, including: 1) IT budgets continue to be constrained as; 2) GenAI is being funded by stealing from other budget buckets; and 3) The ROI for AI initiatives remains tepid, as expectations for break even continue to be pushed out to the right. Nonetheless, customers remain highly optimistic about the prospects for AI driving productivity improvements. Moreover, the cloud remains a key ingredient in supporting AI workloads. We believe the AI center of gravity for enterprise value creation is shifting from LLMs to SLMs. Where the S not only stands for small but encompasses a system of small, specialized, secure and sovereign models. Moreover, we see LLMs and SLMs evolving to become agentic, hence SAM – i.e. small action models. In our view, it’s the collection of these “S-models,” combined with an emerging data harmonization layer, that will enable systems of agents to work in concert and create high impact business outcomes. These multi-agent systems will completely reshape the software industry generally and more specifically, unleash a new productivity paradigm for organizations globally. Technology generally and big tech specifically are regularly cited by politicians, media and governments around the world as the root of many societal problems today. Accusations like privacy invaders, fake news amplifiers, job destroyers, discriminators and more are commonly lobbed at technology firms with little recognition for the substantial value large tech companies have delivered over the decades. Moreover, many powerful government officials have rewritten the history of effective government oversight and are attempting to apply antitrust law in novel ways that have virtually killed M&A and threaten to stifle American exceptionalism and innovation. For over a decade we’ve been sounding the alarm on Intel. Five years ago, like some on Wall Street, we recommended a strategy to recreate Intel by splitting up its design and manufacturing divisions. Most recently we posited that a miracle would be needed for Intel to achieve its aspirations of becoming a viable number two foundry by 2030. The majority of industry pundits have finally come to the realization that Intel’s current path is unsustainable. However some still feel that splitting Intel’s fabs from its design business doesn’t make sense. We disagree. Oracle Corporation is seeing renewed business momentum powered by a combination of an entrenched database business, years of investment in cloud infrastructure, an integrated application suite and AI technologies that are being infused throughout its product line. This includes its autonomous database, 23ai, Exadata/Exascale, other Oracle infrastructure and its vast applications portfolio. Oracle has a highly differentiated strategy that is hitting on most if not all cylinders. And it appears the best is yet to come. It’s one reason that, year to date, the stock is up 54%, compared to the Nasdaq which is up 19% as of the recording of this recording. Input from theCUBE and data practitioner communities suggests that acceleration in compute performance and the sophistication of the modern data stack (MDS) is outpacing the needs of many traditional analytic workloads. Most analytics workloads today are performed on small data sets and generally can run on a single node, somewhat neutralizing the value of distributed, highly scalable data platforms. As We believe enterprise applications are undergoing a profound change. By next year, highly capable agentic systems will emerge to create new application classes and alter the way organizations think about their backend systems, data platforms and user interfaces. The extent of the transformation, we believe, will be more impactful to the application stack than were the changes brought about by innovations seen during the modern GUI, Web, cloud and mobile eras. Customers and partners are pivoting to address Broadcom’s swift changes to its VMware packaging, pricing and partnership programs. Our data suggests customers and MSPs have moved beyond the emotional shock phase to implementing their options in earnest. Our advice to large VMware customers has been to evaluate your ELA expiration and work backwards from that timeframe. Isolate core workloads that The investor community is realizing that the return on invested capital for the AI buildout is going to take some time. The payback period for enterprise AI investments is not akin to the dopamine rush from completing a great workout. This realization combined with several other macro factors, has caused the big AI names to pullback hard recently. But the The so-called modern data stack is getting a facelift and perhaps a complete body makeover. As the point of control shifts from the DBMS to the governance layer we cite three dynamics that highlight a reshaping of today’s data landscape, including: 1) Key data players are disrupting the established norm as they expand their aspirations; 2) Data platform vendors used Three main pressure points are transforming the modern data landscape: 1) Increased interest in adopting open table formats to allow any compute to operate on any data; 2) The point of control is shifting from the DBMS to the governance layer; and 3) AI is enabling the emergence of a new class of intelligent data apps that promise to radically automate business processes and drive unprecedented levels of productivity. The chaos caused by yesterday’s CrowdStrike content update shows that even the most successful cybersecurity firms with great management, award-winning products and a growing business, are exposed to unexpected events. What’s even more important is that it underscores the fragility of our connected world and the critical infrastructure that makes it run. Virtually every industry, and who knows how many AI continues to lead all enterprise IT sectors by a wide margin in terms of spending momentum. But that momentum has not led to an across the board boost in productivity or meaningful revenue gains for firms. Specifically, the adoption of Gen AI is increasing steadily but the use cases are not yet self-funding. As such, the outlook for IT spending, while slowly improving in the second half of 2024, remains constrained. In this Breaking Analysis we share our thoughts on the emerging trends around agentic AI. We’ll define what it is, how agentic builds on (and is additive to) generative AI, what’s missing to make it real, what the stack components look like and some of the likely players in the space. As customers try to “get AI right,” the need to rationalize siloed data becomes increasingly important. Data practitioners could put all their data eggs into a single platform basket, but that’s proving impractical. As such, firms are moving to an open model where they maintain control of their data and can bring any compute engine to any of their data. While compelling, the capabilities to govern open data across an entire estate remain immature. Regardless, the move toward open table formats is gaining traction and the point of control in the data platform wars is shifting from the database to the governance catalog. Earnings prints from the likes of Dell, Supermicro and more recently HPE have shown the AI server trend is not just benefiting cloud hyperscalers but also firms with large on-premises installed bases. Oracle as well is trading at an all time high citing cloud momentum and recent deals with Google, OpenAI and prior deals with Microsoft. But make no mistake, Snowflake Summit 2024 marks the next chapter in the company’s history with new CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy taking center stage, driving even faster product innovation and an ambitious TAM expansion strategy. Snowflake has moved beyond being a friendly and simpler data warehouse to tackling new problems including how to bring AI value to enterprise customers, helping ecosystem partners monetize and providing tools and services to build AI-powered enterprise data apps. Snowflake is at a crossroads. The company, which defined the modern data platform, now faces fresh challenges on four fronts. Specifically, Snowflake must: 1) advance its data cloud vision; 2) transform into an AI leader; 3) become a platform for data apps; and 4) address external market forces that pressure its core values of simplicity, efficiency, and trusted data. In this research we quantify the semiconductor ecosystem which we believe is being led by a transition to AI. Four companies stand out including NVIDIA, TSMC, Broadcom and Qualcomm to make up 45% of a $900B market by 2028. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, ahead of IBM Think and Dell Technologies World, we shine a spotlight on these two firms as leading examples of hybrid AI players that we believe will benefit from the AI wave that is upon us. And of course we’ll share several survey data points from ETR to support our assertions. RSAC 2024 was crowded, buzzy, vibrant and chaotic, underscoring the very nature of the cybersecurity industry. This market has a kind of self-propelling energy with a dynamic that blends tons of money, an ever-present and capable adversary, technical innovation, public policy, geopolitics, and a smashing together of the digital and physical worlds. In this Breaking Analysis we introduce you to Blue Yonder, a builder of digital supply chain management solutions that we believe represents an emerging example of intelligent data applications. Organizations continue to spend more on security with 87% of firms expecting to increase spend on cyber in the next twelve months. But are we safer? It’s estimated that firms on average have between 60-75 security tools installed. While leading vendors logically market the benefits of addressing tools sprawl and complexity through consolidation, the data suggests that more than half the firms are increasing the number of security vendors installed with a very small percentage able to affect vendor consolidation. In another big week we saw the AI battles continue to escalate. Google reorged to better focus on AI, Meta’s Llama 3 was released, TSM is doubling its manufacturing capacity for NVIDIA high end chips, Samsung got a $6.4B tranche of the chips act money, a Microsoft paper describes VASA-1 that turns photos into a kinda creepy talking head, Mistral Enterprises are fighting a dual mandate of operating inside a tight IT budget envelope while at the same time transforming their organization into an AI-first company. Navigating macroeconomic headwinds while driving innovation is an exciting challenge for IT decision makers. To deliver the goods, technology leaders are stealing from other budgets to fund AI, finding quick wins with fairly unspectacular AWS’ AI strategy combines foundation model optionality from partners with its own innovations across a three layered AI stack. In this Breaking Analysis we review takeaways from our AI field trip to NYC. Adobe Summit 2024 put highlighted AI powered digital experiences and personalization at scale. By applying AI, Adobe showed off its ability to bring custom experiences to the masses and do so with trusted, enterprise-grade content. Adobe’s TAM is approaching $300B and the company is demonstrating the ability to monetize AI at scale. We attended both NVIDIA GTC and Broadcom’s investor day this week where the AI platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. When you think of AI leadership, which companies come to mind? NVIDIA, OpenAI, the hyperscalers, Meta, Hugging Face, Anthropic and names like that, right? You don’t typically think of Broadcom do you? You should. Many people question whether the current AI boom will end in the same way that the dotcom bubble burst. It’s understandable as there are many similarities, especially with the exuberance seen this past week in the stock market following NVIDIA’s earnings print. The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, i.e. a capability that allows a globally consistent, real time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and non-relational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. Predictions become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true– ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Recent spending intentions data from more than 1,700 IT decision makers indicates that executives expect technology budgets to grow at 4.3% this year. That’s up from roughly 3.5% in 2023 and is higher than the expectation in October which was 3.8%. But the forecasts for 2024 are backend loaded. Moreover, while some sectors such as energy and regions like APAC With George Gilbert We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with With Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer, Carl Olofson, Dave Menninger and Doug Henschen In the words of famous people like Nobel laureate Neils Bohr and baseball legend Yogi Berra, predictions are very difficult, especially if they’re about the future. In this special Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to host our third annual data predictions power panel with some of our collaborators in Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them The rapid awareness and adoption of AI has increased concerns around security, governance, compliance and business risk. The digital business imperative to improve customer experience combined with a vastly more complex technology environment, comprising multiple clouds, IoT, containers, app integration and the popularity of open source, are driving need for better observability across technology stacks. But fragmented IT environments, lack Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, With George Gilbert We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s With George Gilbert Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to Episode 207 Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by Cisco’s $28B acquisition of Splunk represents a good outcome for Splunk and a strategic growth opportunity for Cisco. Splunk’s painful transition to a cloud and subscription pricing model was largely through the knot hole as seen by its margins and recent P&L performance. But questions remained with respect to its growth prospects and competitiveness in the hot observability space. For Cisco’s $28B acquisition of Splunk represents a good outcome for Splunk and a strategic growth opportunity for Cisco. Splunk’s painful transition to a cloud and subscription pricing model was largely through the knot hole as seen by its margins and recent P&L performance. But questions remained with respect to its growth prospects and competitiveness in the hot observability space. For With George Gilbert The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, realtime system. The premise is that increasingly, George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this With George Gilbert and Rob Strechay At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. With George Gilbert Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent With Rob Strechay and Zeus Kerravala The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting.

Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates.

As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration With George Gilbert, Rob Strechay & Andy Thurai The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, With George Gilbert Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data With Rob Strechay & Andy Thurai HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with With George Gilbert Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created.

But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley With Andy Thurai, VP & Principal Analyst, Constellation Research The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of AI raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing.

Once hopeful that the security industry would be shielded from macroeconomic conditions, the past year has been painful for many investors with some exceptions – most notably those investors who stuck with Palo Alto Networks and Fortinet. That On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll An AI-powered rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over The financial services industry has always been a leading consumer of tech with big IT budgets. The recent banking crisis will add even more headwinds to the already challenging IT spending climate and several tech firms are exposed. In particular, we believe those companies with a higher than average mix of business in financial sectors, combined with decelerating spend momentum The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and With George Gilbert When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC.

The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most With Erik Bradley, ETR Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not.

They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2021 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, With Andy Thurai, VP & Principal Analyst, Constellation Research A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities.

AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0.

The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up The following definition is the result of direct and indirect feedback from more than fifty technology experts, practitioners, consultants, analysts and business leaders. The methodology used to develop this definition was to put forth a premise about a new architectural framework called supercloud and iterate the definition with community input over a nine month period. The primary input for this With David Floyer While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger The rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Today we’ll address the following frequently asked questions: 1. In an industry full of hype and buzzwords, why After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. But judging by the attendance and enthusiasm at Despite fears of inflation, supply chain issues, skyrocketing energy and home prices and global instability caused by the Ukraine crisis, CIOs and IT buyers continue to expect overall spending to increase more than 6% in 2022. While this is lower than our 8% prediction made in January of this year, it remains in line with last year’s roughly 6-7% growth Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud.

Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches.

The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it?

As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it.

Built on rigid infrastructure and managed by specialized gatekeepers, data warehouses of the past were, as one financial customer once told us, “like a snake swallowing a basketball.” Slide from Wikibon’s 2014 Big Data Capital Markets Event: The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every With Erik Bradley The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional In the 2010s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon Despite the more than $100B spent each year fighting cybercrime, when we do an end of year look back and ask, “how did we do” — the answer is invariably the same; worse than last year. Pre-pandemic, the picture was disheartening. But since March of 2020 the situation has only worsened as cybercriminals have become increasingly sophisticated, better funded and Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead.

Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance What Could Disrupt Amazon? Weigh in and take the survey. Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars.

We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation.

This strategy is the most ambitious attempt we’ve seen in the industry to bring a full public cloud experience to organizations’ premises. Global 2000 customers running mission-critical large-scale applications on Oracle Databases should assume that they will migrate to one of Oracle’s new Cloud@Custmer offerings.

Implications for IoT, Intel and the three tiered edge… Arm (formerly ARM) today announced it has acquired Treasure Data, a cloud-based big data management company. Bloomberg reported the transaction value, which was not disclosed by the companies, at $600M. Arm is Premise Server SAN continues to grow fast, and is projected to replace most traditional storage arrays by 2026. Wikibon projects Enterprise Hyperscale Server SAN will migrate to True Private Cloud (TPC) Server SAN. Wikibon also projects that True Private Cloud Server SAN will make some headway together with Hyperscale Server SAN in public cloud storage. Definitions for the Wikibon Server SAN classifications are Premise. The digital twin programming concept will extend well beyond IoT. It presents a richer representation of real things that traditional programming technologies. Users need conventions for core concepts and how they fit together. In our conversations with the Wikibon community, we hear both interest and confusion regarding the notion of digital twins. We believe digital twins will have enormous If you’ve been following IBM’s strategic moves over the past 6 months in data and analytics, it’s hard not to have some concerns. The announcements they’ve been making this year err on the side of excessive caution. What they illustrate is IBM Analytics’ ongoing retrenchment into mainframes, private clouds, and end-to-end data governance. IBM seems to be re-crafting its core Wikibon projects that 3D XPoint will not make it in volume in either the enterprise or consumer markets; it may reside in some specialist application niches. The areas of uniqueness claimed for 3D XPoint will be addressed by DRAM, 3D NAND, and innovative non-volatile combinations of DRAM and 3D NAND. CIOs and CTOs should assume 3D XPoint will NOT be important to the enterprise, and not evaluate it further. The focus should be on deployment of 3D NAND technologies, and expect a rapid cadence of increases in performance, density, form factor, and volume. Hybrid DIMMs with DRAM and 3D NAND should also be evaluated as the technologies mature, as well as UniGrid Architectures. Premise By mid 2018, 3D NAND will become the backbone of almost all deliveries and all vendors of NAND flash, to both the consumer and enterprise markets, with a clear path to increased density, higher performance, and decreasing cost. Consumer NAND announcements are a leading indicator of enterprise NAND capabilities. Toshiba Consumer SSD NAND Announcement The concept of Private Cloud has been in the market since 2008, but the ability of IT organizations to build Private Cloud services that match Public Cloud have been limited. Wikibon forecasts the Private Cloud market revenues from 2015-2026, as well as introducing the enhanced concept of “True” Private Cloud. As more companies transition into digital businesses, it is critical to understand the business and technology trends that will shape Cloud Computing for the next decade. Wikibon examines the critical elements to help companies understand this rapidly evolving landscape and marketplace. Customers are asking how to choose from the rich and growing array of tools in the Hadoop ecosystem. Part of the consideration centers on how to insulate them from fragmentation in the continually evolving Hadoop ecosystem. The incredibly rapid pace of innovation distinguishes the ecosystem but it also has its downsides. The mix and match richness of choice introduces complexity for administrators and developers. At some point it makes sense for customers to consider investing in tools that can hide much of that complexity in data ready for analysis. To be clear, there is no magic product that can hide all these technologies. But when customers take the perspective of simplifying specific end-to-end processes, solutions are available to address the problem. IT leaders can no longer treat stream processors as esoteric functionality employed solely by leading-edge consumer Internet services. They are becoming core functionality that works side-by-side with the more familiar batch processing engines such as Hive, HBase, or Impala. Application developers that need near real-time functionality can start to evaluate stream processors as part of design patterns. However, their analytics functionality is still a bit primitive and most of them need a lot of hardening in order to be resilient enough for mainstream customers.

Application developers that need near real-time functionality can start to evaluate stream processors as part of design patterns. However, their analytics functionality is still a bit primitive and most of them need a lot of hardening in order to be resilient enough for mainstream customers. Wikibon Research has forecasted Public Cloud revenues from 2015 through 2026; with the expectations that 33% of all IT spending ($500B) will move to Public Cloud services within the next decade. The impact this will have on IT vendors and IT strategy will be significant as more applications focus on mobile and real-time data analytics. In this research paper, Wikibon looks back at the introductory Server SAN research, adjusts the Server SAN definition to include System Drag, and increases the speed of adoption of Server SAN based on very fast adoption from 2012 to 2014. The overall growth of Server SAN is projected to be about a 23% CAGR from 2014 to 2026, with a faster growth from 2014 to 2020 of 38%. The total Server SAN market is projected to grow to over $48 billion by 2026. The traditional enterprise storage market is projected to decline by -16% CAGR, leading to an overall growth in storage spend of 3% CAGR through 2026. Traditional enterprise storage is being squeezed in a vice between a superior, lower cost and more flexible storage model with Enterprise Server SAN, and the migration of IT towards cloud computing and Hyperscale Server SAN deployments. Wikibon strongly recommends that CTOs & CIOs initiate Server SAN pilot projects in 2015, particularly for applications where either low cost or high performance is required. Mainstream IT, LoB execs and application development professionals each provide different yet critical perspectives to Systems of Intelligence. IT exes must be in a position to deliver the right infrastructure (e.g. cloud, on-prem, etc.) with the proper performance and SLA profile to support LoB requirements. Line-of-Business execs must have enough knowledge to specify the real-time needs of applications while application development pros must ensure the right skills are in place to deliver and maintain services to Systems of Intelligence over a full life cycle. The Big Data market continued its maturation in 2014, experiencing both significant growth as measured by vendor revenue and increased adoption of Big Data tools and technologies by large enterprises across vertical markets. In this exclusive report for Wikibon Premium members, Wikibon details Big Data vendor revenue and extends its groundbreaking market forecast through 2020. Converged infrastructure is a trend that has been growing for over 5 years and is rapidly transforming the way that users consume IT. In 2012, Wikibon forecasted (see Converged Infrastructure Takes the Market By Storm) that 2/3 of infrastructure for enterprise applications would be packaged as some form of converged infrastructure by 2017. Now there are billions of dollars of Hortonworks plans to go public in 2015 and its S-1 filing, revealed to the world yesterday, says a lot about the state of the Hadoop market generally and, obviously, Hortonworks specifically. First, a mea culpa. In Wikibon’s latest Big Data market forecast, my colleagues and I provided our estimate for Hortonworks’ 2013 revenue (along with revenue estimates of all the other players See Primer on the EMC Federation for an update including new information from EMC World 2014 Contents 1 The EMC, VMware, Pivotal Federation 2 VMware sticks to virtualization 2.1 SDDC 2.2 Hybrid Cloud 2.3 PC to Mobility 3 EMC II 4 Pivotal Inc The EMC, VMware, Pivotal Federation Can a market leader also lead a transformation?

In addition to the broadcast, we’re also throwing a IBM’s annual revenue last year dropped below $100 billion for the first time since 2010. The company’s fourth quarter results were particularly weak, coming in 5.5% below expectations. This was due in large part to IBM’s struggling hardware business, with revenue dropping a staggering 27%. Much of the blame can be attributed to the cloud, or I should say to IBM’s slowness IBM’s annual revenue last year dropped below $100 billion for the first time since 2010.

Much of the blame can be attributed to the cloud, or I should say to See Wikibon’s software-led infrastructure page for more on how converged infrastructure fits into the SDDC at Wikibon.com/SLI. Converged Infrastructure Moving to Early Majority The growth of converged infrastructure solutions is impossible to miss in conversations across the marketplace (see videos from the recent VMworld conference). Customers, however, are not looking to buy “convergence”; rather, IT is in desperate need for solutions While VMware is still dominant in the x86 server virtualization market, there are clear signs that the hypervisor is being commoditized and that competing solutions are closing the functionality gap. Over half of respondents to Wikibon’s survey last year were running multiple hypervisors. Wikibon is digging deeper into customer adoption including both multi-hypervisor environments and what is driving customers to Web Giant Targets the Cloud Google has spent the last 14 years building one of the largest networks and most scalable architectures in the world. The Google Compute Engine (GCE) is a public cloud now generally available that brings Google’s architecture to the masses. While it is undeniable that Google has immense resources (having spent over $2.9B on infrastructure) and The research behind this article drills down into the database components, Big Data SQL database revenue, and Big Data NoSQL database revenue. The total represents 10.4% of total Big Data in 2012, and remains at about 10% of total through 2017. Last week at the Open Compute Summit Winter 2013 event, Facebook shared insight into its IT infrastructure. While hyperscale companies like Google, Amazon, and Facebook are quite different from the typical enterprise, it is Wikibon’s belief that those companies are driving key changes to how infrastructure is consumed that will filter down to the service provider and enterprise worlds in the Providing effective business analytics tools and technologies to the enterprise is a top priority of CIOs and for good reason. Effective business analytics – from basic reporting to advanced data mining and predictive analytics — allows data analysts and business users alike to extract insights from corporate data that, when translated into action, deliver higher levels of efficiency and profitability to the enterprise. Underlying every business analytics practice is data. Traditionally, this meant structured data created and stored by enterprises themselves, such as customer data housed in CRM applications, operational data stored in ERP systems or financial data tallied in accounting databases. But the volume and type of data now available to enterprises — and the need to analyze it in near-real time for maximum business value — is growing rapidly thanks to the popularity of social media and networking services like Facebook and Twitter, data-generating sensor equipped and networked devices, both machine- and human-generated online transactions, and other sources of unstructured and semi-structured data. We call this Big Data.

with Dave Vellante Dive into tech news and cutting-edge insights on current technology topics with Breaking Analysis hosted by Dave Vellante. Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and theCUBE Research communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Salesforce is moving from the hype phase of generative AI into doing the harder engineering work to create the agentic enterprise. Dreamforce 2025 showed us that the company which created the original SaaS model now wants to lead what we call service as software. In our view, this represents a profound revolution, not just in technology but in business. In a world where AI agents deliver outcomes across systems of record, systems of engagement and systems of intelligence. Our assessment is that Salesforce’s AgentForce 360 platform is crossing day one early version to attack day two problems and customer requirements. What does that mean? It’s no longer just demoing copilots inside Customer 360. Rather, the company is going after the messy problems of observability, orchestration, data quality, etc. that determine whether agent systems can scale in the enterprise. The shift to service as software will bring learning curve advantages, software- like marginal economics, and winner- take- most dynamics to all companies across every industry, not just tech vendors. We believe those firms that can more quickly jump on the AI experience curve will see substantially increased benefits relative to their competitors. However, our research suggests that data management We’re on the cusp of a new software- enabled business model that will determine winners and losers in the coming decades. We call this service -as-software. Specifically, we believe enterprises will begin to organize knowledge work in new ways, that harmonize islands of automation into a build-to-order assembly line for knowledge work. Firms that aggressively pursue this opportunity will be on a learning curve that we think will create sustainable competitive advantage, and, importantly, a winner-take-most dynamic. Now, we’re not just talking about technology vendors here. Rather, we believe new technology, operational, and business models will emerge, and apply to all enterprises across every industry. In this breaking analysis, theCUBE Research team presents a new way to think about how businesses will operate in the AI era; with implications for application developers, edge deployments, and security / governance models. With a glimpse toward the path that we think organizations can take to go from where they are today into the future. For the past several decades, Cybersecurity has been an unfair fight. The economics have favored attackers, which have access to sophisticated resources, lower costs, fast innovation cycles and deep knowledge of vulnerabilities. Defenders, by contrast, bear the full burden of securing sprawling networks, fragmented technologies, and human error, all while operating under legal, regulatory, and financial scrutiny. In our view, the Intel–NVIDIA pact further accentuates NVIDIA’s dominance and represents a final handoff of the baton in the race to the next era of computing. Just as Intel had a lock on the market in the 80s and 90s, NVIDIA has now extended its moat deep into the x86 ecosystem (in both PCs and the data center) and expanded its TAM by $500B to $1T by our estimates. The subtext here is that Lip-Bu Tan is taking necessary steps to save Intel. In doing so, he’s hitching the company’s wagon to the future, which is being defined by CUDA, NVIDIA’s software platform. This move by our estimates, increases Intel’s TAM by $100B and breathes new life into the x86 franchise, which was rapidly deteriorating. In our view, Intel foundry remains problematic but will get a boost from the system on chip (SoC) products that this partnership will produce. On balance we see this as a win for both companies, x86 customers and a further boost for AI’s momentum. CrowdStrike used Fal.con 2025 to harden its ongoing value proposition that security is a speed game. But the company extended its messaging emphasizing that platforms which orchestrate fleets of AI agents will set the bar for the future of security. In our view, George Kurtz’s keynote and theCUBE interview (below) mark a goal to create a clean hand-off from “assistive The threat landscape is undergoing a profound transformation. At CrowdStrike’s Fal.Con 2025 event in Las Vegas, Adam Meyers, who heads counter-adversary operations, provided a rare window into how the world’s most capable adversaries are adapting their tactics. His insights underscore a sobering reality in that artificial intelligence has become both a weapon and a defense shield, underscoring the asymmetry between attackers and defenders. We believe CrowdStrike (CRWD) has re-established growth momentum while still working through the financial and reputational overhang of the July 19, 2024 global outage. The company recently delivered net new ARR reacceleration ahead of expectations, showcased strong platform expansion across cloud, identity, and Next-Gen SIEM, and leaned on Falcon Flex as a durable consolidation lever. In our view, the near-term debate centers not only on churn or Flex conversion but more on net new ARR performance, valuation skepticism, and whether identity and SIEM can offset a maturing core endpoint business while fending off intensifying competition. The mainspring of CrowdStrike’s success remains relentless product innovation, increasingly defined by its platform. We believe its unified platform and AI-driven threat defense at scale underpin the company’s premium valuation through customer consolidation, stickiness, and durable ARR growth. We believe the prevailing narrative that Broadcom and NVIDIA are locked in a zero-sum battle for AI data center dominance is misleading. The reality is these companies are playing very different games. NVIDIA has built a vertically integrated compute and software platform that has become the engine of the AI factory era. Broadcom, by contrast, has constructed a durable business model around connectivity, custom silicon, and high-margin software. The strategies overlap but are not mutually exclusive. We believe the real story is how these firms are carving out complementary positions in the most important technology cycle since the dawn of the Internet. We believe the industry’s broad interpretation of Jensen’s Law — i.e. “Jensen’s Law accelerates Moore’s Law” — understates a fundamental economic reality of AI Factories. Jensen Huang’s own language and NVIDIA’s operating model point to a financial law of motion for AI factories: When power is the binding constraint and demand is elastic, perf/watt increases raise monetizable throughput faster than they raise total cost. The result is an extension to existing laws of tech that we’ve come to know. Specifically, Jensen’s invoking of Buy ore to make more (i.e. revenue up) and spend more to save more (i.e. unit cost down) has explicit economic implications that we believe need further examination. In addition, there is a corollary in this new regime in that, under certain conditions, fabric‑driven utilization unlocks are so valuable that high‑speed networking becomes “economically free” (i.e. where utilization gains exceed amortized fabric cost). In this Breaking Analysis we explain in detail what we’re referring to as a new Jensen’s Law. We’ll explore why this phenomenon is so important, review the math behind it, share some concrete examples of where the law is applicable, when the corollary of “the network is free” holds, implications for investors and operators; and where the law is not applicable. We believe the center of gravity in AI infrastructure has shifted from servers to AI factories, where networking is perhaps as critical as compute. Our analysis of an interview with NVIDIA SVP of Networking, Gilad Shainer, indicates NVIDIA’s thesis is straightforward. Specifically, that scale-up fabrics (NVLink/NVLink Fusion) plus scale-out Ethernet purpose-built for AI (Spectrum-X) — and increasingly scale-across for multi–data center topologies (Spectrum-XGS) — deliver superior determinism, efficiency, and time-to-outcomes at giga-scale. At the same time, the market is too large and heterogeneous for any single fabric to dominate; open standards and merchant Ethernet will continue to win broad adoption, and even NVIDIA is embracing open interfaces and ecosystems to complement its proprietary advantages. In our view, NVIDIA is a somewhat rare case where first-mover advantage has paid off. Its early conviction in parallel computing, GPUs, CUDA/NCCL software moats, and the Mellanox acquisition now underpin a defensible systems position across scale-up, scale-out, and (increasingly) scale-across. Cybersecurity is the number one risk facing enterprises today, and yet organizations remain dangerously unprepared. Executives are not blind to the problem — they understand the financial exposure, the reputational stakes, and the business impact of a major breach. They acknowledge gaps in their defenses and recognize the vulnerabilities that could cripple their mission-critical systems. But awareness has not translated into readiness and true business resilience remains elusive for the vast majority of firms. Data strategies are especially important – specifically data governance, data protection, and data quality. These remain essential elements of cyber resilience, but they’re only part of the equation. True business resilience requires confronting a multitude of dimensions — from application security to identity, supply chain integrity, operational continuity, infrastructure defenses and more. The uncomfortable truth is that most firms still lack the cohesive strategy, investment, and execution to protect their most vital assets. Donald Trump’s 180 on Intel is at least directionally correct, certainly more so than calling for the ouster of Lip-Bu Tan, Intel’s CEO. But a contemplated investment by the US in Intel, as reported by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, without a significant restructuring of Intel’s entire business, is a recipe for failure in our view. Specifically, we continue to urge Intel’s board to spin out its foundry business. Every day it waits further decreases foundry’s value. Moreover, we call on the U.S. government to use money from the CHIPS Act and its influence on large US chip designers, and TSMC, to secure a position for a US-domiciled company in advanced semiconductor manufacturing. AI is currently running on a one lane, CapEx highway that is capacity constrained. Hyperscalers are the largest contributor to the momentum and as such, investors keep score with cloud growth rates. But this past quarter you had to read the footnotes and the fine print to go beyond the massive investments fueling the wave. Microsoft put up eye-popping Azure growth again, but a big part of that acceleration is Azure serving AI inference — notably ChatGPT — now neatly included in the revised definition of what’s included in Azure. This is great for headlines but not conducive to apples-to-apples comparisons over time. Meanwhile, AWS delivered the largest revenue for cloud infrastructure and sent a clear message that demand exceeds supply. Meaning growth is capped by power and components, not pipeline. That creates a weird optics penalty — AWS showing growth in the high teens on a $120B-plus run rate and it’s deemed “concerning.” But it also telegraphs future upside as capacity goes online and depreciation cycles progress. OpenAI and NVIDIA just dropped news with implications for every model lab, cloud, and enterprise AI customer and vendor. The two companies released gpt-oss-20B and gpt-oss-120B, open-weight reasoning models trained on H100, tuned across NVIDIA’s full stack, and capable of spitting out 1.5 million tokens per second on a single Blackwell GB200 NVL72 rack. The weights ship under a permissive license; the inference path spans DGX Cloud, Blackwell servers, and RTX PCs via Ollama, llama.cpp, vLLM, FlashInfer, Hugging Face, and Microsoft AI Foundry Local. Last November, we argued that Jamie Dimon is sitting on a treasure trove of proprietary data that will never find its way into proprietary LLMs via the Internet. And as such, he was Sam Altman’s biggest competitor because his data is more valuable than the democratized insights from these LLMs. Our premise was and continues to be that foundation model companies are waging an internecine battle chasing artificial general intelligence (Messiah AGI) and the true holy grail is what we called “enterprise AGI;” meaning applying AI to proprietary data inside of enterprises will ultimately prove to be the most valuable endeavor. Today we extend that argument and posit that agents and enterprise digital twins, powered by that proprietary data, will drive the next wave of AI value. By all accounts, Microsoft just delivered one of the most powerful quarters in its history. But this wasn’t just a blowout print, it was a signal that Microsoft is playing a new game. The company’s performance is redefining what hyperscale looks like in the AI era. An objective analysis of the Q4 FY2025 earnings call suggests that Microsoft is firing on all cylinders in cloud, AI, and infrastructure execution, and it’s building for a future measured in gigawatts, not racks. The only potential negatives for investors are: 1) Capital expenditures are expected to be more than $30B in the coming quarter, signalling continued spending ahead of revenue and negatively affecting cash flow; and 2) Gross margin pressure continues in cloud due to the lower margins realized in its Azure / infrastructure business. The stablecoin market is rapidly maturing into one of the most consequential sectors of the digital asset econoour. After years of uncertainty, regulatory friction, and media skepticism, stablecoins are no longer a speculative curiosity, rather they are foundational to the next chapter of programmable finance. Our research suggests that the convergence of policy shifts, institutional adoption, and new economic use cases has thrust stablecoins into the spotlight. In short: crypto’s ChatGPT moment has arrived, and its name is stablecoin. In our view, IBM delivered one of its strongest quarters in recent memory, reinforcing a narrative we’ve tracked for some time – i.e. the pivot from legacy to a modern, AI-driven hybrid cloud company is finally showing up in the numbers. The company beat expectations across revenue, profit, margin, and free cash flow, and perhaps more importantly, demonstrated credible traction While the NASDAQ seems to reach new highs daily, enterprise tech spending remains persistently cautious at the macro amid continued uncertainty. That’s not necessarily bad news but it can be disconcerting to decision makers. Often during transitional cycles, like the one we’re in now, executives don’t want to overrotate on capital allocations that deliver outcomes, which could potentially be achieved much more cost effectively with emerging technologies like AI. We’ve seen similar patterns in previous waves. There was a period of “great softness” in enterprise IT spending when transitioning from mainframes and minis to the PC era, a huge backlash from overly exuberant Y2K and dotcom spending; and a steady deterioration of traditional enterprise tech momentum during the cloud, mobile, SaaS, social, big data era. Each wave is different but two common themes remain: 1/ strong conviction that a new era is here; and 2/ fear of disruption, which sometimes leads to hasty decision making and waste. These countervailing forces seem to be in play today as 87% of enterprises report taking a cautious approach to AI investments. And that caution is showing up in the macro spend environment. Intel’s new CEO has promised to clean up the balance sheet, slim down the company, return to a culture of engineering, sharpen its customer focus, shore up its products, become a world class independent foundry and lead Intel for as long as it takes to achieve success, however that is defined. As our audience knows, unlike most other analysts, we have aggressively emphasized the icebergs ahead for Intel since 2013, culminating in our prediction that Intel would go bankrupt trying to execute on its most previous strategy. While we would have preferred a different approach to Intel’s foundry – i.e. JV with TSM – Lip-Bu Tan at least has what we consider to be a viable go forward plan. The steady state outcome of this new direction, however is far from certain. In last week’s Breaking Analysis we argued that Snowflake was attempting to cross the Rubicon, vaulting from cloud data warehouse innovator into AI leader and intelligent application platform. This week the competitive fire got a fresh accelerant. As usual, Databricks followed up Snowflake Summit and put forth bold claims of its own, emphasizing unified governance, data intelligence, simplified user experiences, transactional capabilities and, of course, open data. Cisco hasn’t enjoyed much organic revenue growth in more than a decade. It just rolled into San Diego claiming this year’s Cisco Live is the “most consequential” event in the company’s history. Hyperbole? Maybe. But after three days on-site comprising Q&A with Chuck Robbins and Jeetu Patel, closed-door roadmap dives, and a flood of product reveals in public, our assessment is that Cisco finally has a credible, end-to-end story for the AI era. Our research indicates that data platform wars have entered an entirely new phase, one where open data is no longer a marketing slogan and governance catalogs are now the new control point. We see this as the first of several structural changes to the software industry. The next price of entry we think will be an emerging layer that we call systems of intelligence, or SOI, which we believe will become a high value piece of real estate in the AI-optimized software stack. In this Breaking Analysis, and just a few days removed from Snowflake Summit 2025, we unpack how Snowflake has moved from steward of its pristine proprietary data platform to orchestrating an ecosystem in a world that enables any compute engine to operate on any open data formats. Last week, we framed the company’s Rubicon moment, meaning the pivot from analytic warehouse to enabler of intelligent data apps. The data industry has arrived at a pivotal juncture that echoes the themes we’ve charted in previous Breaking Analysis episodes, from The Sixth Data Platform through The Yellow Brick Road to Agentic AI; Why Jamie Dimon is Sam Altman’s Biggest Competitor all the way to the Faceoff between Benioff and Nadella. Those analyses have chronicled the steady convergence of analytic data platforms such as Snowflake and Databricks, not only with the hyperscalers’ estates, but increasingly, with the operational applications that run businesses. Our research indicates that this merger is not a side-effect of Gen AI hype, rather it’s a structural shift in how enterprises will create value from data and software over the next several decades. Thirty months into the GenAI awakening, the jury is still out on how much enterprises are benefiting from investments in artificial intelligence. While the vast majority of customers continue to spend on AI, reported returns are no greater than, and frankly lag those, typically associated with historical IT initiatives like ERP, data warehousing and cloud computing. Let’s face it, the multi-hundred billion dollar annual CAPEX outlay from hyperscalers and sovereign nations is fueling the euphoria and essentially supporting blind faith in the AI movement. But ground truth returns from enterprise AI adoption remain opaque. This combined with geopolitical unrest, fluctuating public policy and GDP estimates in the low single digits, have buyers tempering expectations for tech spending relative to January of this year. Dell’s founder-led business is one of the most remarkable and under appreciated stories in tech. Dell Technologies is not particularly sexy, nor does it put forth an earth- shattering vision that bends the mind. Yet it’s a company that has consistently figured out how to ride successive waves without becoming driftwood. And like Hyman Roth of Godfather fame, Michael Dell always seems to make money for his partners. Unlike Roth, Mr. Dell is not a gangster, rather he’s a gentleman that literally wrote the book on how to play nice and win. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of DTW 2025, we examine the question, how will Dell capture the explosive AI opportunity, while transitioning the millions of servers, arrays, and PCs it already has in the field to this new AI era? The Road to ‘Service-as-Software.’ Salesforce co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff is articulating a bold vision for the next era of enterprise software. In an exclusive interview with theCUBE on April 25, 2025, Benioff outlined how AI-driven agents and a unified data architecture will transform Software as a Service (SaaS) into what we’re calling “Service as Software” – a model where software-based digital agents augment every business process. The Salesforce chief has often quipped that today’s CEOs are “the last generation of executives leading exclusively human workforces,” underscoring his conviction that AI agents (what many call agentic AI) will soon work alongside humans in every enterprise. Our premise is that this “digital labor” revolution could be more disruptive than the cloud and mobile waves of 15 years ago, fundamentally redefining how applications function. Our view is that IBM has crystallized a coherent, differentiated AI thesis based on smaller, domain‑tuned models running on an open, hybrid‑cloud fabric. The goal is to unlock what it claims is the 99 percent of enterprise data still untouched by GenAI. If execution matches the marketing—particularly on integration speed and cost transparency—IBM will change the perception from perennial AI underdog to a primary or even default choice for risk‑averse enterprises seeking tangible ROI. The next two quarters of Watsonx bookings and Granite adoption will tell us whether the strategy is hitting escape velocity, merely clearing the launchpad or needs a reset. Based on this quarter’s earnings reports, it’s clear to us that demand is not the constraint for hyperscale clouds. They are, however running head‑long into the hard limits of physics. Access to megawatts, liquid‑cooled racks, and a GPU supply chain that begins and ends with NVIDIA are now critical paths to tapping what appears to be unlimited demand. AWS, Microsoft, and Google each chalked up record‑setting capital outlays last quarter—collectively dropping around $63 billion in CAPEX—yet even that eye‑popping sum can’t fully satiate the compute‑hungry AI models racing toward trillion‑parameter scale. We believe the real story isn’t simply “AI is expensive”; it’s that power availability, not revenue potential, is now the gating factor on hyperscaler growth. In our view, the winners of the next cycle will be the providers that secure sustainable energy footprints, master GPU allocation, and—critically—translate all that infrastructure into margin‑accretive AI services before the depreciation schedules kick in. Welcome to the ironic era where megawatts equal market share. As RSAC 2025 approaches, key themes are emerging that are set to dominate the world’s largest cybersecurity gathering. Industry dynamics are shifting rapidly – from AI enabling higher velocity threats, an intensified platform consolidation debate, high-profile M&A, rising interest in AI agents (with somewhat tepid adoption in cyber) and shifting security budget priorities. Our research shows that while cybersecurity remains At last week’s AI Agent Builder Summit, hosted by Scott Hebner of theCUBE Research at SiliconANGLE’s Palo Alto Studios, the hype around “agentic AI” – autonomous software agents that can orchestrate complex tasks – was on full display. Demos and keynotes painted a bold vision of AI-driven business processes. But scratch beneath the surface, and a sobering reality emerges: Most enterprises are far from ready to reap the benefits of fully autonomous agents. Much work needs to be done to realize the promise of agentic systems, including organizational alignment to create a true data culture, cleaning up data silos, harmonizing that data, data ownership, data product thinking, getting governance and security right, choosing technology partners, rationalizing your SaaS and on-prem applications portfolio, and of course change management to get all this done. Starting the journey toward an agentic enterprise is an exciting imperative, but in our view will take the better part of a decade to realize. We estimate that Google’s Cloud business will exceed $50B in annual revenue this year with Google Cloud Platform comprising more than 50% of its cloud revenue for the first time ever. Why is it then that Google’s cloud business, a $50B+ entity growing deep into the double digits gets so much criticism? The answer is simple. Google’s cloud, with arguably the best technology in the industry, is 2.5 – 3.5 times smaller than the cloud businesses of AWS and Microsoft. We are in the midst of a fundamental transformation of computing architectures. We’re moving from a world where we create data, store it, retrieve it, harmonize it and present it so that we can make better decisions, to a world that creates content from knowledge using tokens as a new unit of value; and increasingly takes action in real time with or without human intervention, driving unprecedented increases in value. What this means is every part of the computing stack, from silicon, infrastructure, security, middleware, development tools, applications and even services, is changing. As with other waves in computing, consumer adoption leads us up the innovation curve where the value is clear, the volume is high and the velocity is accelerated, leading to lower costs and eventual adoption into and disruption of enterprise applications. Importantly, to do this work on today’s data center infrastructure would be 10X more expensive, trending toward 100X by the end of the decade. As such, virtually everything is going to move to this new model of computing. Automation generally and AI specifically, render today’s cybersecurity stacks ineffective. Previously, stopping 99% of attacks and leaving the 1% for armed human hunters to deal with was, while not ideal, at least feasible. With AI, that all goes away because adversaries can scale phishing and other attacks at unprecedented rates, which overwhelms the ability of humans. This creates a wider gap between exfiltration times, which are shrinking, and mean time to remediation, giving even greater advantage to attackers. As such, the only way to fight AI is with AI. Moreover, the ever expanding number of tools in an organization’s security stack continues to exacerbate the problem. According to Palo Alto Networks, the answer is a complete makeover of your cybersecurity stack where consolidating multiple tools into a single platform and gaining comprehensive access to the right data, simplifies security operations and enables AI to operate in real time. The analyst relations (AR) function is undergoing a fundamental transformation. Once dominated by a handful of large research houses, such as Gartner, IDC and Forrester, the market now features a spectrum of independent analysts and influencers. The fast-paced nature of the tech industry, its speed of change, the relentless competition and ubiquity of technology, make it a challenging sector for Since the Gen AI awakening, we’ve said consistently that NVIDIA and Broadcom are the #1 and #2 AI plays in tech. Since peaking in mid-December of last year, Broadcom shares have been under pressure, off on sympathy with other semiconductor stocks and the general confusion about the economy, tariffs, inflation, jobs, geopolitics, debt, etc. Broadcom’s Q1 results were impressive and assuaged some of these fears. At one point last night after hours the stock was up 15% from its previous close and midday Friday was up around 6-7% despite continued pressure on tech shares. Market transitions such as the one we’re in now often bring confusion and market volatility as the new high growth sectors are not large enough to offset the slowdown in the larger declining markets. NVIDIA doesn’t have this problem because it is at the mainspring of the new wave. Broadcom is facing a similar but different dynamic in that its traditional businesses are ones that are extremely durable. Moreover, we see two relatively new dynamics coming into play for Broadcom: 1) Hyperscalers are coming to Broadcom to enable their custom AI accelerators; and 2) Broadcom’s VMware strategy is working, lifting the company to new software heights. A seismic shift is underway in enterprise software, one that pits two of the most influential leaders in the industry—Microsoft’s Satya Nadella and Salesforce’s Marc Benioff—against each other in a war of words that highlights the broader transformation unfolding in enterprise applications. Nadella predicts the demise of traditional SaaS applications, arguing that AI-powered agents will take over, fundamentally redefining enterprise software. Benioff, on the other hand, argues that AI will serve as an augmentation layer and rely on his existing platform to supply the digital workforce of the future. Few brands in technology carry the storied pedigree of Intel. For decades, “Intel Inside” was synonymous with progress in computing—an American icon that repeatedly raised the bar for processor performance and innovation. Today, Intel finds itself in a precarious position. Its once-vaunted manufacturing machine has fallen behind TSMC, which dominates advanced process nodes. Meanwhile, Intel’s core CPU design business—a substantial, if bruised, revenue engine—remains overshadowed by the mounting losses and capital burn in its foundry operations. Rumors swirl that Broadcom might step in and scoop up Intel’s design arm. But for those who believe in competition, national security, and the long-term integrity of an American technology brand, that outcome would be deeply misguided. Earnings reports from the big three cloud players disappointed investors this week. All three US hyperscalers fell a bit short of consensus for their cloud revenues in the December quarter and investor reaction has been negative. But squinting through the data, there’s a lot to like about the position of AWS, Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure. In particular, the IaaS and PaaS revenue alone for the big 3 approached $200B in 2024 and grew 25%. All three cited capacity constraints and, along with Meta, are committing more than $300B in CAPEX spend this year, most of it to support current and future AI demand. As is often the case, when a new wave hits it tends to be overhyped at the beginning of the cycle and underestimated when it hits a steady state. And in between points A and B we often see blips and bumps that represent opportunities for long term investors. Make no mistake. We are entering a technology cycle that is completely new. Massively parallel computing and the Gen AI awakening is creating an entirely different industry focus that has altered customer spending patterns. Moreover, this new computing paradigm has changed competitive dynamics almost overnight. Decisions whether to spend tens of billions or hundreds of billions on CAPEX are being challenged by novel approaches to deploying AI. Geopolitical tensions are higher than at any time in the history of tech. While the pace of change appears to be accelerating, causing consternation and confusion, the reality is that broad technology adoption evolves over long periods of time, creating opportunities, risks, and tectonic shifts in industry structures. At the beginning of each year, as is our tradition, we collaborate with ETR to dig through the latest data and craft ten predictions for the coming year. This year’s batch follows some annual favorites and some new territory. In this Breaking Analysis we put forth our top ten predictions for enterprise tech in 2025 with our usual data-heavy opinions and prognostications. In just two short years, the entire data and technology industry has undergone a seismic shift. Tech stacks—from top to bottom—are being tuned to harness extreme parallel computing, often called Accelerated Computing. From silicon to infrastructure and throughout the software layer, nowhere is this transformation more pronounced than in the data stack. Over the past seven years, modern cloud-native data platforms set the agenda. Today, however, the rise of open table formats, shifting control points, open-source governance catalogs, and a heightened focus on AI are creating both challenges and opportunities for enterprises and the tech providers who serve them. In this special breaking analysis, we’re pleased to host our fourth annual data predictions power panel with some of our collaborators in the Cube Collective and members of the Data Gang. With us today are five of the top industry analysts focused on data platforms. Sanjeev Mohan of Sanjmo, Tony Bear of DB Insight, recent IDC graduate Carl Olofson, Dave Menninger of ISG and Brad Schimmin with Omdia. We are witnessing the rise of a completely new computing era. Within the next decade, a trillion-dollar-plus data center business is poised for transformation, powered by what we refer to as extreme parallel computing (EPC)—or as some prefer to call it, accelerated computing. While artificial intelligence is the primary accelerant, the effects ripple across the entire technology stack. Nvidia sits in the vanguard of this shift, forging an end-to-end platform that integrates hardware, software, systems engineering, and a massive ecosystem. Our view is that Nvidia has a 10-to-20-year runway to drive this transformation, but the market forces at play are much larger than a single player. This new paradigm is about reimagining compute from the ground up: from the chip level to data center equipment, to distributed computing at scale, data and applications stacks and emerging robotics at the edge. The road to agentic AI will be paved with stepping stones that progressively build on each other. Our research suggests that Agentic AI will not suddenly appear without a strong data foundation built on: 1) cloud-like scalability; 2) a unified metadata model; 3) data mesh organizing principles; 4) harmonized data and business process logic; and an orchestration framework that incorporates governance, security and observability. The time for Intel to shed its foundry business is now. While former CEO Pat Gelsinger made a persuasive case for U.S.-based advanced semiconductor manufacturing, his vision was flawed from the start. Intel’s foundry operation, like IBM’s Microelectronics business a decade ago, is an asset with negative value. Yet, its strategic significance for U.S. competitiveness in the semiconductor race cannot be overstated. If financial institutions are deemed too big to fail, then Intel’s foundry represents a similarly critical infrastructure for U.S. national interests. AWS re:Invent 2024 ushered in a transformative chapter for both Amazon Web Services and the broader tech ecosystem. This year’s event marked the debut of Matt Garman as CEO of AWS, stepping into a role that aligns with what John Furrier aptly describes as a “wartime CEO”—a technically adept leader and trusted consigliere. Garman’s keynote set the tone for AWS’s strategic focus: doubling down on core infrastructure capabilities across silicon, compute, storage, and networking, while extending its Graviton playbook to GPUs and potentially large language models (LLMs). The inboxes are overflowing once again with predictions about the future of enterprise tech, as we gear up for 2025. While many of these forecasts are insightful, we’ll sift through them carefully before releasing our own predictions later in January of next year. True to tradition, we aim to set a higher bar for our forecasts by focusing on measurable outcomes—whether it’s tied to a specific number or a clear binary result. Our philosophy remains consistent: a good prediction should be testable, enabling us to look back a year later and determine, with confidence and supporting data, whether it held true. In this Breaking Analysis, we evaluate the 2024 predictions we made alongside ETR’s Erik Bradley. We revisit our January forecasts on topics like the macro IT spending environment, GenAI ROI, security, on-prem AI, technology priorities and more. The ever expanding cloud has become ubiquitous. No longer is the cloud some remote set of services, somewhere up in the sky. Rather, the cloud is seeping into every industry, hybrid on-prem models, edge workloads, telco markets and has its sights on space. The market size is staggering and will surpass $1T in revenue when including infrastructure – IaaS and PaaS – SaaS and professional services. Much AI work is being done today in the public cloud and despite indications that bringing AI to on-prem data will be a growing trend, it’s unlikely that the cloud will stop expanding any time soon. Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware is proceeding almost exactly as we expected when the deal was announced in May of 2022. While much of the media and competitor narrative is focused on the increased license fees Broadcom is imposing and the urgency of migrating off VMware, customer conversations and recent surveys show that while migrations are happening, the real story is that VMware’s more narrow focus and cost discipline are allowing Broadcom to integrate VMWare into its highly successful business model. Specifically, we see two seemingly countervailing trends that are both possible to be true: 1) Customers are actively moving many low value workloads off VMware; and 2) Most mission critical work is staying put, allowing Broadcom to dramatically increase the contribution from its software business and deliver a roadmap for customers that will be more cost effective than migrating. Investors have poured north of $30B into independent foundation model players including OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, Mistral and others. OpenAI itself has raised more than $20B. To keep pace, both Meta and xAI will have to spend comparable amounts. In our view, the stampeding herd of LLM investors is blindly focused on the false grail of so-called artificial general intelligence AGI. We believe the greatest value capture exists in what we’re calling enterprise AGI, metaphorically represented by the proprietary data estates and managerial know-how locked inside of firms like JP Morgan Chase, and virtually every enterprise. The tools to curate and harness that collective intelligence will allow these firms to capture the majority of value in the race for AI leadership. Gen AI enthusiasm has lately turned to AI skepticism. Lack of clarity on tangible ROI for mainstream businesses, a narrow list of early winners and relentless vendor marketing around AI has caused cynicism and media backlash. But the reality remains that we have entered a new era in technology innovation that has a high probability of transforming industries, public policy, company leadership and the related fortunes of individuals and organizations. Moreover, 97% of leading Gen AI adopters report that they’re achieving tangible benefits from their deployments. Adoption of Gen AI is relentlessly on the rise and nearly two years in, is poised to begin throwing off enough value that it will heighten a mandate to apply AI to drive business results. As such, we believe that as we exit Q4 into 2025, the demand for AI solutions will continue to occupy the headspace of business technology pros and AI momentum will maintain its accelerated pace. It’s estimated that organizations spend more than $200B annually on security hardware, software and services globally. That’s a big number. But consider that the economic impact of cybercrime ranges from $500B – $2T annually. There’s even an estimate from cybersecurity ventures that says the figure is as high as $9.5T. Each year, it seems the more we spend, the more vulnerable we become, which is especially concerning given the exposure to critical infrastructures. Governments around the world have stepped up their involvement with executive orders, privacy regulations and lots of “finger wagging” at the technology industry and its customers. Frankly some of that is justified. The technology industry does much good but has a subpar record at solving this problem. One premise that we’ve put forth at theCUBE Research is that the industry must find ways to better collaborate and share resources to combat cyber threats. Two firms, IBM and Palo Alto Networks, have joined forces to combine deep expertise, AI and platform approach to better protect organizations from attackers. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the security landscape and unpack the multi-dimensional relationship between IBM and Palo Alto Networks to better understand how industry collaboration can improve cyber defenses and modernize security operations. With us are two senior executives from each firm, Mohamad Ali, SVP and Head of IBM Consulting and BJ Jenkins, the President of Palo Alto Networks. Microsoft’s new financial disclosures include changes to the way it reports Azure metrics. The company said the change was to better align Azure with consumption revenue and by inference, more closely aligning with how AWS, the leader in cloud computing infrastructure, reports its metrics. The accounting change removed certain mature, slower growth revenue streams and consequently raised the growth rates for Azure. It also had the effect of increasing the AI services contribution within Azure. While this was reported and often applauded in the media and financial circles, what wasn’t widely discussed is that while such a change increases growth rates, by definition it reduces the size of the Azure business and its resulting revenue market share. Regardless, in our view, Microsoft is comfortable that the future AI revenue contribution within Azure combined with both higher growth rates and a greater AI contribution will foster greater investor confidence and enthusiasm over time. They’re probably correct. Data from recent surveys shows that the scenarios we’ve been putting forth throughout 2024 continue to be in play. Specifically, we cite three main dynamics affecting the tech spending climate, including: 1) IT budgets continue to be constrained as; 2) GenAI is being funded by stealing from other budget buckets; and 3) The ROI for AI initiatives remains tepid, as expectations for break even continue to be pushed out to the right. Nonetheless, customers remain highly optimistic about the prospects for AI driving productivity improvements. Moreover, the cloud remains a key ingredient in supporting AI workloads. We believe the AI center of gravity for enterprise value creation is shifting from LLMs to SLMs. Where the S not only stands for small but encompasses a system of small, specialized, secure and sovereign models. Moreover, we see LLMs and SLMs evolving to become agentic, hence SAM – i.e. small action models. In our view, it’s the collection of these “S-models,” combined with an emerging data harmonization layer, that will enable systems of agents to work in concert and create high impact business outcomes. These multi-agent systems will completely reshape the software industry generally and more specifically, unleash a new productivity paradigm for organizations globally. Technology generally and big tech specifically are regularly cited by politicians, media and governments around the world as the root of many societal problems today. Accusations like privacy invaders, fake news amplifiers, job destroyers, discriminators and more are commonly lobbed at technology firms with little recognition for the substantial value large tech companies have delivered over the decades. Moreover, many powerful government officials have rewritten the history of effective government oversight and are attempting to apply antitrust law in novel ways that have virtually killed M&A and threaten to stifle American exceptionalism and innovation. For over a decade we’ve been sounding the alarm on Intel. Five years ago, like some on Wall Street, we recommended a strategy to recreate Intel by splitting up its design and manufacturing divisions. Most recently we posited that a miracle would be needed for Intel to achieve its aspirations of becoming a viable number two foundry by 2030. The majority of industry pundits have finally come to the realization that Intel’s current path is unsustainable. However some still feel that splitting Intel’s fabs from its design business doesn’t make sense. We disagree. Oracle Corporation is seeing renewed business momentum powered by a combination of an entrenched database business, years of investment in cloud infrastructure, an integrated application suite and AI technologies that are being infused throughout its product line. This includes its autonomous database, 23ai, Exadata/Exascale, other Oracle infrastructure and its vast applications portfolio. Oracle has a highly differentiated strategy that is hitting on most if not all cylinders. And it appears the best is yet to come. It’s one reason that, year to date, the stock is up 54%, compared to the Nasdaq which is up 19% as of the recording of this recording. Input from theCUBE and data practitioner communities suggests that acceleration in compute performance and the sophistication of the modern data stack (MDS) is outpacing the needs of many traditional analytic workloads. Most analytics workloads today are performed on small data sets and generally can run on a single node, somewhat neutralizing the value of distributed, highly scalable data platforms. As We believe enterprise applications are undergoing a profound change. By next year, highly capable agentic systems will emerge to create new application classes and alter the way organizations think about their backend systems, data platforms and user interfaces. The extent of the transformation, we believe, will be more impactful to the application stack than were the changes brought about by innovations seen during the modern GUI, Web, cloud and mobile eras. Customers and partners are pivoting to address Broadcom’s swift changes to its VMware packaging, pricing and partnership programs. Our data suggests customers and MSPs have moved beyond the emotional shock phase to implementing their options in earnest. Our advice to large VMware customers has been to evaluate your ELA expiration and work backwards from that timeframe. Isolate core workloads that The investor community is realizing that the return on invested capital for the AI buildout is going to take some time. The payback period for enterprise AI investments is not akin to the dopamine rush from completing a great workout. This realization combined with several other macro factors, has caused the big AI names to pullback hard recently. But the The so-called modern data stack is getting a facelift and perhaps a complete body makeover. As the point of control shifts from the DBMS to the governance layer we cite three dynamics that highlight a reshaping of today’s data landscape, including: 1) Key data players are disrupting the established norm as they expand their aspirations; 2) Data platform vendors used Three main pressure points are transforming the modern data landscape: 1) Increased interest in adopting open table formats to allow any compute to operate on any data; 2) The point of control is shifting from the DBMS to the governance layer; and 3) AI is enabling the emergence of a new class of intelligent data apps that promise to radically automate business processes and drive unprecedented levels of productivity. The chaos caused by yesterday’s CrowdStrike content update shows that even the most successful cybersecurity firms with great management, award-winning products and a growing business, are exposed to unexpected events. What’s even more important is that it underscores the fragility of our connected world and the critical infrastructure that makes it run. Virtually every industry, and who knows how many AI continues to lead all enterprise IT sectors by a wide margin in terms of spending momentum. But that momentum has not led to an across the board boost in productivity or meaningful revenue gains for firms. Specifically, the adoption of Gen AI is increasing steadily but the use cases are not yet self-funding. As such, the outlook for IT spending, while slowly improving in the second half of 2024, remains constrained. In this Breaking Analysis we share our thoughts on the emerging trends around agentic AI. We’ll define what it is, how agentic builds on (and is additive to) generative AI, what’s missing to make it real, what the stack components look like and some of the likely players in the space. As customers try to “get AI right,” the need to rationalize siloed data becomes increasingly important. Data practitioners could put all their data eggs into a single platform basket, but that’s proving impractical. As such, firms are moving to an open model where they maintain control of their data and can bring any compute engine to any of their data. While compelling, the capabilities to govern open data across an entire estate remain immature. Regardless, the move toward open table formats is gaining traction and the point of control in the data platform wars is shifting from the database to the governance catalog. Earnings prints from the likes of Dell, Supermicro and more recently HPE have shown the AI server trend is not just benefiting cloud hyperscalers but also firms with large on-premises installed bases. Oracle as well is trading at an all time high citing cloud momentum and recent deals with Google, OpenAI and prior deals with Microsoft. But make no mistake, Snowflake Summit 2024 marks the next chapter in the company’s history with new CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy taking center stage, driving even faster product innovation and an ambitious TAM expansion strategy. Snowflake has moved beyond being a friendly and simpler data warehouse to tackling new problems including how to bring AI value to enterprise customers, helping ecosystem partners monetize and providing tools and services to build AI-powered enterprise data apps. Snowflake is at a crossroads. The company, which defined the modern data platform, now faces fresh challenges on four fronts. Specifically, Snowflake must: 1) advance its data cloud vision; 2) transform into an AI leader; 3) become a platform for data apps; and 4) address external market forces that pressure its core values of simplicity, efficiency, and trusted data. In this research we quantify the semiconductor ecosystem which we believe is being led by a transition to AI. Four companies stand out including NVIDIA, TSMC, Broadcom and Qualcomm to make up 45% of a $900B market by 2028. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, ahead of IBM Think and Dell Technologies World, we shine a spotlight on these two firms as leading examples of hybrid AI players that we believe will benefit from the AI wave that is upon us. And of course we’ll share several survey data points from ETR to support our assertions. RSAC 2024 was crowded, buzzy, vibrant and chaotic, underscoring the very nature of the cybersecurity industry. This market has a kind of self-propelling energy with a dynamic that blends tons of money, an ever-present and capable adversary, technical innovation, public policy, geopolitics, and a smashing together of the digital and physical worlds. In this Breaking Analysis we introduce you to Blue Yonder, a builder of digital supply chain management solutions that we believe represents an emerging example of intelligent data applications. Organizations continue to spend more on security with 87% of firms expecting to increase spend on cyber in the next twelve months. But are we safer? It’s estimated that firms on average have between 60-75 security tools installed. While leading vendors logically market the benefits of addressing tools sprawl and complexity through consolidation, the data suggests that more than half the firms are increasing the number of security vendors installed with a very small percentage able to affect vendor consolidation. In another big week we saw the AI battles continue to escalate. Google reorged to better focus on AI, Meta’s Llama 3 was released, TSM is doubling its manufacturing capacity for NVIDIA high end chips, Samsung got a $6.4B tranche of the chips act money, a Microsoft paper describes VASA-1 that turns photos into a kinda creepy talking head, Mistral Enterprises are fighting a dual mandate of operating inside a tight IT budget envelope while at the same time transforming their organization into an AI-first company. Navigating macroeconomic headwinds while driving innovation is an exciting challenge for IT decision makers. To deliver the goods, technology leaders are stealing from other budgets to fund AI, finding quick wins with fairly unspectacular AWS’ AI strategy combines foundation model optionality from partners with its own innovations across a three layered AI stack. In this Breaking Analysis we review takeaways from our AI field trip to NYC. Adobe Summit 2024 put highlighted AI powered digital experiences and personalization at scale. By applying AI, Adobe showed off its ability to bring custom experiences to the masses and do so with trusted, enterprise-grade content. Adobe’s TAM is approaching $300B and the company is demonstrating the ability to monetize AI at scale. We attended both NVIDIA GTC and Broadcom’s investor day this week where the AI platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. When you think of AI leadership, which companies come to mind? NVIDIA, OpenAI, the hyperscalers, Meta, Hugging Face, Anthropic and names like that, right? You don’t typically think of Broadcom do you? You should. Many people question whether the current AI boom will end in the same way that the dotcom bubble burst. It’s understandable as there are many similarities, especially with the exuberance seen this past week in the stock market following NVIDIA’s earnings print. The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, i.e. a capability that allows a globally consistent, real time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and non-relational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. Predictions become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true– ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Recent spending intentions data from more than 1,700 IT decision makers indicates that executives expect technology budgets to grow at 4.3% this year. That’s up from roughly 3.5% in 2023 and is higher than the expectation in October which was 3.8%. But the forecasts for 2024 are backend loaded. Moreover, while some sectors such as energy and regions like APAC With George Gilbert We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with With Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer, Carl Olofson, Dave Menninger and Doug Henschen In the words of famous people like Nobel laureate Neils Bohr and baseball legend Yogi Berra, predictions are very difficult, especially if they’re about the future. In this special Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to host our third annual data predictions power panel with some of our collaborators in Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them The rapid awareness and adoption of AI has increased concerns around security, governance, compliance and business risk. The digital business imperative to improve customer experience combined with a vastly more complex technology environment, comprising multiple clouds, IoT, containers, app integration and the popularity of open source, are driving need for better observability across technology stacks. But fragmented IT environments, lack Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, With George Gilbert We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s With George Gilbert Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to Episode 207 Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by Cisco’s $28B acquisition of Splunk represents a good outcome for Splunk and a strategic growth opportunity for Cisco. Splunk’s painful transition to a cloud and subscription pricing model was largely through the knot hole as seen by its margins and recent P&L performance. But questions remained with respect to its growth prospects and competitiveness in the hot observability space.

For With George Gilbert The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, realtime system. The premise is that increasingly, George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this With George Gilbert and Rob Strechay At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. With George Gilbert Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent With Rob Strechay and Zeus Kerravala The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting.

Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates.

Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration With George Gilbert, Rob Strechay & Andy Thurai The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, With George Gilbert Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data With Rob Strechay & Andy Thurai HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with With George Gilbert Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created.

We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley With Andy Thurai, VP & Principal Analyst, Constellation Research The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of AI raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing.

Once hopeful that the security industry would be shielded from macroeconomic conditions, the past year has been painful for many investors with some exceptions – most notably those investors who stuck with Palo Alto Networks and Fortinet. That On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll An AI-powered rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over The financial services industry has always been a leading consumer of tech with big IT budgets. The recent banking crisis will add even more headwinds to the already challenging IT spending climate and several tech firms are exposed. In particular, we believe those companies with a higher than average mix of business in financial sectors, combined with decelerating spend momentum The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and With George Gilbert When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC.

The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in.

They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2021 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, With Andy Thurai, VP & Principal Analyst, Constellation Research A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities.

Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0.

The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations.

IPOs have dried up The following definition is the result of direct and indirect feedback from more than fifty technology experts, practitioners, consultants, analysts and business leaders. The methodology used to develop this definition was to put forth a premise about a new architectural framework called supercloud and iterate the definition with community input over a nine month period. The primary input for this With David Floyer While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger The rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Today we’ll address the following frequently asked questions: 1. In an industry full of hype and buzzwords, why After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. But judging by the attendance and enthusiasm at Despite fears of inflation, supply chain issues, skyrocketing energy and home prices and global instability caused by the Ukraine crisis, CIOs and IT buyers continue to expect overall spending to increase more than 6% in 2022. While this is lower than our 8% prediction made in January of this year, it remains in line with last year’s roughly 6-7% growth Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud.

But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches.

The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it?

As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten.

Built on rigid infrastructure and managed by specialized gatekeepers, data warehouses of the past were, as one financial customer once told us, “like a snake swallowing a basketball.” Slide from Wikibon’s 2014 Big Data Capital Markets Event: The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every With Erik Bradley The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional In the 2010s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon Despite the more than $100B spent each year fighting cybercrime, when we do an end of year look back and ask, “how did we do” — the answer is invariably the same; worse than last year. Pre-pandemic, the picture was disheartening. But since March of 2020 the situation has only worsened as cybercriminals have become increasingly sophisticated, better funded and Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy.

We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation.

The year 2020 has acted as a hasty but effective proof of concept for how to digitally transform businesses. CIOs report that generally, technology spending levels have either rebounded or will do so in the near future, Cloud computing has been the single most transformative force in IT over the last decade – what will Cloud 2030 look like? As we enter the 2020s, we believe that cloud will become the underpinning of a ubiquitous, intelligent and autonomous resource that will disrupt the operational stacks of virtually every company in all industries. This Breaking Analysis is a CISOs see Permanent Shifts in Cyber Strategies due to COVID & Remote Work As we’ve reported extensively, the pandemic has affected cyber security markets perhaps more than any other. Remote work has caused CISOs to shift spending priorities toward identity access management, endpoint and cloud security. COVID has been a benefactor for nextgen security companies that participate in these sectors. Fixing A Flawed Data Warehouse Model Snowflake will not grow into its valuation by simply stealing share from the on-prem data warehouse vendors. Even if it got 100% of the data warehouse business it wouldn’t come close to justifying its market cap. Rather Snowflake must create an entirely new market based on completely changing the way organizations think about monetizing Despite softer tech spending, cloud revenue shows continued momentum into 2021. As we watch an historic election unfold before our eyes, we look back at the early days of this millennium and the memorable presidential race of 2000. That decade was defined by 9/11, which permanently re-shaped our thinking. We exited the ’00s at the tail end of a massive Azure cloud is the linchpin of Microsoft’s go forward innovation strategy.

The suit draws on section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, which makes it illegal to monopolize trade or commerce. Of course As we reported in our last update, tech spending overall continues to be significantly muted relative to 2019– CIOs Report a Cautious Outlook for Q4 Tech Spending. We currently project a 4 to 5 percent decline in 2020 spending and a tepid 2 percent increase in 2021. Nonetheless, there continue to be some sector and vendor bright spots in an CIOs Report Slow Thaw of Spending Freezes. In the most recent September ETR spending survey, CIOs expect a slight sequential improvement in Q4 spending relative to Q3– but still down 4% from Q4 2019. So the picture is still not pretty but not bleak either. Firms are adjusting to the “new abnormal” and are taking positive actions that can be Application performance management (APM) has been around since the days of the mainframe. As systems architectures became more complex, the technology evolved to accommodate client server, Web tier architectures, mobile and now cloud-based systems. A spate of new vendors emerged to solve the sticky problems associated with ensuring consistent and predictable user experiences.

Leaving them wondering what’s next? The steepest drop in the stock market since June 11th flipped the narrative and sent investors scrambling. Tech got hammered after a 2-month run and people are asking questions. Is this a bubble popping or a healthy correction? Are we now going to see Enterprise software markets are dominated by mega cap companies like SAP, Oracle, Salesforce and Microsoft. SaaS leaders like ServiceNow and Workday have solidified their market positions by to a great extent, replicating the Salesforce model in their respective domains. There is still room for innovative upstarts that are introducing new cloud native services and value pricing models but the traditional Cloud, IAM & Endpoint Security are rocking the markets. Over the past 150 days, everyone in the technology industry has become an expert on COVID in some way shape or form.

We have all lived the reality that COVID-19 has accelerated by at least 2 years, many trends that were in motion well before the virus hit. The cyber security Cloud Remains Strong but not Immune to COVID. While cloud computing is generally seen as a bright spot in tech spending, the sector is not immune from the effects of COVID-19. It’s better to be cloud than not cloud, no question, but recent survey data shows that the V-shaped recovery in the stock market looks much more like a square RPA competitors vie for a bigger prize… RPA Leads all Sectors in Spending Intentions Robotic process automation (RPA) solutions remain one of the most attractive investments for business technology buyers. This despite our overall 2020 tech spending forecasts, which remain at the depressed levels of -4% to -5% for the year. Relative to previous surveys, we do see some softness According to reports, Snowflake recently filed a confidential IPO document with the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission. Sources suggest that Snowflake’s value could be pegged as high as $20B. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we address five questions that we’ve been getting from theCUBE, Wikibon and ETR communities.

ETR’s Erik Bradley provides data and insights from customer roundtable discussions and Oracle Autonomous Database on Exadata Cloud@Customer and Dedicated Region Cloud@Customer is a radical approach at bringing cloud services on-premises. Our initial take is those substantial customers running mission-critical Oracle applications can cut costs by up to 40% with this offering. This strategy is the most ambitious attempt we’ve seen in the industry to bring a full public cloud experience to organizations’ premises. Global 2000 customers running mission-critical large-scale applications on Oracle Databases should assume that they will migrate to one of Oracle’s new Cloud@Custmer offerings. Wikibon recommends that CxOs begin engaging with Oracle to conduct their TCO/ROI/IRR analyses now. Despite its faster growth in infrastructure-as-a-service relative to AWS and Azure, Google Cloud Platform remains a third wheel in the race for cloud dominance. Google begins its Cloud Next online event starting July 14th in a series of nine rolling sessions through early September.

Yet the valuations of In this Breaking Analysis we dig into the cloud database market and take a closer look at how Snowflake competes with Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery and Microsoft Synapse, among others. New Cloud Workloads As we’ve reported, there is a new class of workloads emerging in the cloud. Early cloud was all about infrastructure-as-a-service ( IaaS). That is, the spinning up Data shows that most CIOs expect a U-Shaped recovery from COVID-19. Specifically, 44% of roughly 700 executives surveyed believe revenue declines will continue through most of 2020 with growth returning next year. This is a key finding of the latest flash survey data from ETR. Not surprisingly however, the shape of the recovery will be mixed and vary substantially by CIOs and IT execs report strong RPA adoption plans in a post-pandemic environment. We’ve been reporting that the COVID pandemic has created a bifurcated IT spending outlook. Legacy on-prem infrastructure and traditional software licensing models are giving way to approaches that enable more flexibility and business agility. Automation initiatives that reduce human labor that is not value add has been gaining AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Momentum in the Post-COVID Era Analysis from company earnings reports and customer surveys continues to show that Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) are closing the gap on AWS’ cloud dominance. While reporting definitions of cloud remain fuzzy, it’s clear that the big three U.S. cloud players are leading the steady march into the The COVID-19 pandemic has created a bifurcated IT spending climate. Several vendors taking advantage of cloud and work from home tailwinds are thriving while others relying on legacy stacks and maintenance streams are struggling to show momentum.

This according to the latest survey data and analysis by ETR. While the drop represents a 900 basis swing from 4% consensus growth entering 2020, tech spending remains bifurcated with some suppliers and sectors showing significantly stronger spending momentum than others. How CIOs and CISOs are Taking the COVID-19 Budget Hit CIOs and CISOs in some of the hardest hit industries see significant near-term and many permanent shifts to their IT and security strategies. This was the consensus of four technology executives at leading companies that are feeling the brunt of the coronavirus pandemic.

Wikibon projects Enterprise Hyperscale Server SAN will migrate to True Private Cloud (TPC) Server SAN. Wikibon also projects that True Private Cloud Server SAN will make some headway together with Hyperscale Server SAN in public cloud storage. Definitions for the Wikibon Server SAN classifications are Premise. The digital twin programming concept will extend well beyond IoT. It presents a richer representation of real things that traditional programming technologies. Users need conventions for core concepts and how they fit together. In our conversations with the Wikibon community, we hear both interest and confusion regarding the notion of digital twins. We believe digital twins will have enormous If you’ve been following IBM’s strategic moves over the past 6 months in data and analytics, it’s hard not to have some concerns. The announcements they’ve been making this year err on the side of excessive caution. What they illustrate is IBM Analytics’ ongoing retrenchment into mainframes, private clouds, and end-to-end data governance. IBM seems to be re-crafting its core Wikibon projects that 3D XPoint will not make it in volume in either the enterprise or consumer markets; it may reside in some specialist application niches. The areas of uniqueness claimed for 3D XPoint will be addressed by DRAM, 3D NAND, and innovative non-volatile combinations of DRAM and 3D NAND. CIOs and CTOs should assume 3D XPoint will NOT be important to the enterprise, and not evaluate it further. The focus should be on deployment of 3D NAND technologies, and expect a rapid cadence of increases in performance, density, form factor, and volume. Hybrid DIMMs with DRAM and 3D NAND should also be evaluated as the technologies mature, as well as UniGrid Architectures. Premise By mid 2018, 3D NAND will become the backbone of almost all deliveries and all vendors of NAND flash, to both the consumer and enterprise markets, with a clear path to increased density, higher performance, and decreasing cost. Consumer NAND announcements are a leading indicator of enterprise NAND capabilities. Toshiba Consumer SSD NAND Announcement The concept of Private Cloud has been in the market since 2008, but the ability of IT organizations to build Private Cloud services that match Public Cloud have been limited. Wikibon forecasts the Private Cloud market revenues from 2015-2026, as well as introducing the enhanced concept of “True” Private Cloud. As more companies transition into digital businesses, it is critical to understand the business and technology trends that will shape Cloud Computing for the next decade. Wikibon examines the critical elements to help companies understand this rapidly evolving landscape and marketplace. Customers are asking how to choose from the rich and growing array of tools in the Hadoop ecosystem. Part of the consideration centers on how to insulate them from fragmentation in the continually evolving Hadoop ecosystem. The incredibly rapid pace of innovation distinguishes the ecosystem but it also has its downsides. The mix and match richness of choice introduces complexity for administrators and developers. At some point it makes sense for customers to consider investing in tools that can hide much of that complexity in data ready for analysis. To be clear, there is no magic product that can hide all these technologies. But when customers take the perspective of simplifying specific end-to-end processes, solutions are available to address the problem. IT leaders can no longer treat stream processors as esoteric functionality employed solely by leading-edge consumer Internet services. They are becoming core functionality that works side-by-side with the more familiar batch processing engines such as Hive, HBase, or Impala. Application developers that need near real-time functionality can start to evaluate stream processors as part of design patterns. However, their analytics functionality is still a bit primitive and most of them need a lot of hardening in order to be resilient enough for mainstream customers.

Wikibon Research has forecasted Public Cloud revenues from 2015 through 2026; with the expectations that 33% of all IT spending ($500B) will move to Public Cloud services within the next decade. The impact this will have on IT vendors and IT strategy will be significant as more applications focus on mobile and real-time data analytics. In this research paper, Wikibon looks back at the introductory Server SAN research, adjusts the Server SAN definition to include System Drag, and increases the speed of adoption of Server SAN based on very fast adoption from 2012 to 2014. The overall growth of Server SAN is projected to be about a 23% CAGR from 2014 to 2026, with a faster growth from 2014 to 2020 of 38%. The total Server SAN market is projected to grow to over $48 billion by 2026. The traditional enterprise storage market is projected to decline by -16% CAGR, leading to an overall growth in storage spend of 3% CAGR through 2026. Traditional enterprise storage is being squeezed in a vice between a superior, lower cost and more flexible storage model with Enterprise Server SAN, and the migration of IT towards cloud computing and Hyperscale Server SAN deployments. Wikibon strongly recommends that CTOs & CIOs initiate Server SAN pilot projects in 2015, particularly for applications where either low cost or high performance is required. Mainstream IT, LoB execs and application development professionals each provide different yet critical perspectives to Systems of Intelligence. IT exes must be in a position to deliver the right infrastructure (e.g. cloud, on-prem, etc.) with the proper performance and SLA profile to support LoB requirements. Line-of-Business execs must have enough knowledge to specify the real-time needs of applications while application development pros must ensure the right skills are in place to deliver and maintain services to Systems of Intelligence over a full life cycle. The Big Data market continued its maturation in 2014, experiencing both significant growth as measured by vendor revenue and increased adoption of Big Data tools and technologies by large enterprises across vertical markets. In this exclusive report for Wikibon Premium members, Wikibon details Big Data vendor revenue and extends its groundbreaking market forecast through 2020. Converged infrastructure is a trend that has been growing for over 5 years and is rapidly transforming the way that users consume IT. In 2012, Wikibon forecasted (see Converged Infrastructure Takes the Market By Storm) that 2/3 of infrastructure for enterprise applications would be packaged as some form of converged infrastructure by 2017. Now there are billions of dollars of Hortonworks plans to go public in 2015 and its S-1 filing, revealed to the world yesterday, says a lot about the state of the Hadoop market generally and, obviously, Hortonworks specifically.

In addition to the broadcast, we’re also throwing a IBM’s annual revenue last year dropped below $100 billion for the first time since 2010. The company’s fourth quarter results were particularly weak, coming in 5.5% below expectations. This was due in large part to IBM’s struggling hardware business, with revenue dropping a staggering 27%. Much of the blame can be attributed to the cloud, or I should say to IBM’s slowness IBM’s annual revenue last year dropped below $100 billion for the first time since 2010.

Converged Infrastructure Moving to Early Majority The growth of converged infrastructure solutions is impossible to miss in conversations across the marketplace (see videos from the recent VMworld conference). Customers, however, are not looking to buy “convergence”; rather, IT is in desperate need for solutions While VMware is still dominant in the x86 server virtualization market, there are clear signs that the hypervisor is being commoditized and that competing solutions are closing the functionality gap. Over half of respondents to Wikibon’s survey last year were running multiple hypervisors. Wikibon is digging deeper into customer adoption including both multi-hypervisor environments and what is driving customers to Web Giant Targets the Cloud Google has spent the last 14 years building one of the largest networks and most scalable architectures in the world. The Google Compute Engine (GCE) is a public cloud now generally available that brings Google’s architecture to the masses.

The total represents 10.4% of total Big Data in 2012, and remains at about 10% of total through 2017. Last week at the Open Compute Summit Winter 2013 event, Facebook shared insight into its IT infrastructure. While hyperscale companies like Google, Amazon, and Facebook are quite different from the typical enterprise, it is Wikibon’s belief that those companies are driving key changes to how infrastructure is consumed that will filter down to the service provider and enterprise worlds in the Providing effective business analytics tools and technologies to the enterprise is a top priority of CIOs and for good reason. Effective business analytics – from basic reporting to advanced data mining and predictive analytics — allows data analysts and business users alike to extract insights from corporate data that, when translated into action, deliver higher levels of efficiency and profitability to the enterprise. Underlying every business analytics practice is data. Traditionally, this meant structured data created and stored by enterprises themselves, such as customer data housed in CRM applications, operational data stored in ERP systems or financial data tallied in accounting databases. But the volume and type of data now available to enterprises — and the need to analyze it in near-real time for maximum business value — is growing rapidly thanks to the popularity of social media and networking services like Facebook and Twitter, data-generating sensor equipped and networked devices, both machine- and human-generated online transactions, and other sources of unstructured and semi-structured data. We call this Big Data.

Nvidia hits $4.5 trillion valuation amid unprecedented AI investment frenzy. Deals between OpenAI, Nvidia, AMD and Oracle raise red flags reminiscent of the dot-com bubble. Leaders like Sam Altman and Jeff Bezos acknowledge investor overexuberance but insist AIâs transformative potential is real. Experts warn of a "sharp correction" if AI fails to deliver promised productivity gains. Some argue open-source AI could mitigate risks of centralized control and financial instability.

Some argue open-source AI could mitigate risks of centralized control and financial instability. A historic surge in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks has Wall Street buzzingâbut also bracing for a potential crash. Nvidia, once a niche chipmaker, now boasts a staggering $4.5 trillion valuation, while OpenAIâs deals with tech giants like Microsoft, AMD and Oracle raise concerns about financial circularity. With industry leaders warning of overinvestment and economists comparing the frenzy to past bubbles, the question looms: Is AI the next dot-com bust waiting to happen? The AI stock surge: Euphoria or excess? Since ChatGPTâs 2022 debut, AI has dominated markets. Nvidiaâs chips power the AI revolution, fueling its meteoric rise. Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google and Meta have also seen explosive growth, collectively driving 80% of S&P 500 gains. Oracleâs stock soared 40% in a single day after securing OpenAI contractsâa sign of investor euphoria. But skepticism mounts. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman admits investors are "overexcited," while Amazon founder Jeff Bezos warns of an "industrial bubble." Bank of England analysts caution that markets are "exposed" if AI optimism falters. The parallels to the late-1990s dot-com bubbleâwhen vendor financing inflated valuations before a brutal crashâare hard to ignore. Circular deals and financial engineering Recent AI financing arrangements have drawn scrutiny for their self-reinforcing nature: Nvidia invests $100B in OpenAI, which then builds data centers using Nvidia chips. OpenAI buys AMD chips, taking a potential 10% stake in the company. Microsoft funds OpenAI while also relying on Nvidia-powered cloud services. Critics call this "vendor financing"âa tactic used during the dot-com bubble to artificially inflate demand. Goldman Sachs acknowledges "elements of investor behavior" mirror past bubbles but argues todayâs AI boom is backed by real profitsâfor now. The bubble debate: Optimism vs. caution Proponents insist AIâs transformative potential justifies the spending. OpenAIâs revenue growth is unprecedented, and Altman argues the industry is still undervalued. Federal Reserve officials even suggest this could be a "good bubble," driving innovation despite financial risks. Yet MIT research found that 95% of AI initiatives fail to deliver returns, despite $30â40B in spending. Venture capitalist Alan Patricof warns, "The losses will be pretty significant." Meanwhile, AIâs impact on jobs remains uncertainâAnthropicâs CEO predicts mass white-collar layoffs, while McKinsey sees AI as a productivity booster, not a replacement. The road ahead: Crash or correction? Three scenarios could burst the AI bubble: Concentration risk: If OpenAI or Nvidia stumble, a domino effect could destabilize the sector. Governance failures: Poor oversight (like FTXâs collapse) could trigger regulatory crackdowns. Technological disruption: Quantum computing breakthroughs could render current AI infrastructure obsolete. Despite warnings, AIâs momentum shows no signs of slowing. The question isnât if but when reality catches upâand whether the fallout will be a minor correction or a catastrophic crash. A bubble with a fifference? Unlike the dot-com era, todayâs AI investments are fueled by trillion-dollar tech giants with vast cash reservesânot speculative startups. Yet history suggests unchecked exuberance rarely ends well. Whether AI reshapes the economy or becomes the next speculative bust, one truth remains: Investors should tread carefully.

No more FOMO. Any tips on which filaments to order for a first timer? Just ordered the P2S combo from the deal, hoping to print using only PLA for board game inserts, basic models and things like that :) PLA will be the easiest to print with - for models, I recommend PLA Meta, which is great for printing fine details, and comes in a lot of colour variety (which conveniently is the cheapest in this deal!). TPU is surprisingly handy too, so I'd recommend grabbing a roll of that to play with, great when you need something nearly indestructible and rubbery. If you're after some stronger materials, PETG is a good starter option too, but I tend to find I'm not using it too much due to it never printing as nicely as PLA or ABS. ABS and ASA create some noxious odours when printing, and have a tendency to warp, so may cause problems when printing, but have extra heat resistance and strength that can be useful. Your printer will handle these and the higher-grade engineering filaments too (like carbon fibre filaments, nylon, polycarbonate, or PPA) but PLA Meta is a really great start point. Thank you so much for your detailed reply, I really appreciate it! Possibly the most helpful reply I've seen on ozb in the last week or two! Everyone be more like Flippsy PLA is much easier to use. If you are using it for board game inserts, you will want more grey as it looks nicer. You might also want a variety of different colours if you are printing tokens. So for wood pieces you might want chocolate as a colour or red/blue/yellow/green to print player dashboards for something like Catan. Congrats! I bought the P1S for my 10yr old during their Anniversary Sale. The P2S looks to be a step up. matte PLA is great for board game inserts Getting eBay forcing a postage cost on a random filament when in cart, even though items say free postage on the item page. when I remove the product that has postage, it adds it to another one that didn't have postage cost before, anyone else seeing this too? I had this when it didn't like my postage address. It would add $10 postage. When I updated the suburb and postcode it went back to free. Excludes QLD South East? I'm South East and just checked the first link, I get free shipping and can use that code? Yeah the coverage is a bit more than those exclusions - I've updated the post to be a bit more accurate. Some stores will also ship to regional areas and charge a fee. South East QLD is where the capital city is though heh Anyone have any experience with PLA meta? Is it any different from PLAs you can get from Bambu's official store? I use PLA meta for printing figurines and models, I find that it has less noticeable layer lines and a smooth finish without being overly shiny, compared to the other PLAs. One minor downside is that when printing with supports, the scarring can be a bit more noticeable compared to PLA matte or PLA+, leaving white discolouration. It's pretty comparable to Bambu's PLA basic, just a lot cheaper. Awesome, thanks for sharing! nice work @Flippsy Nice deals but will wait for black friday.

Subscribe Mihir Kshirsagar Comments Authored by: Mihir Kshirsagar This week, Open AI announced a multibillion dollar deal with Broadcom to develop custom AI chips for data centers projected to consume 10 gigawatts of power. This investment is separate from another multibillion dollar deal OpenAI struck with AMD last week. There is no question that we are in the midst of making one of the largest industrial infrastructure bets in United States history. Eight major companies—Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Meta, Oracle, OpenAI, and others—are expected to invest over $300 billion in AI infrastructure in 2025 alone. Spurred by news about the vendor-financed structure of the AMD investment and a conversation with my colleague Arvind Narayanan, I started to investigate the unit economics of the industry from a competition perspective. What I have found so far is surprising. It appears that we’re making important decisions about who gets to compete in AI based on financial assumptions that may be systematically overstating the long-run sustainability of the industry by a factor of two. That said, I am open to being wrong in my analysis and welcome corrections as I write these thoughts up in an academic article with my colleague Felix Chen. Here is the puzzle: the chips at the heart of the infrastructure buildout have a useful lifespan of one to three years due to rapid technological obsolescence and physical wear, but companies depreciate them over five to six years. In other words, they spread out the cost of their massive capital investments over a longer period than the facts warrant—what The Economist has referred to as the “$4trn accounting puzzle at the heart of the AI cloud.” This accounting mismatch has significant competition implications, especially upstream of the model layer of the GenAI stack. (Figure 1.) In the application layer enterprises choose AI models to integrate into their operations. Incumbent coalitions—hyperscalers (Microsoft, Amazon, Google) partnered with their model developers (OpenAI, Anthropic)—can effectively subsidize application-layer pricing during the critical years when customer relationships are being formed. This could create advantages that prove insurmountable even when better technology becomes available. The core issue isn’t whether chips wear out faster than accounting suggests. It’s whether the market structure being formed is fueled by accounting conventions that obscure true long-run economics, allowing incumbent coalitions to establish customer lock-in at the application layer before true costs become visible. In other words, the accounting subsidy creates a window of roughly three to six years where reported costs are artificially low. After that, the overlapping depreciation schedules catch up to operational reality. Here’s why this timing matters: that three-to-six-year window is precisely when the market structure for AI applications is being determined. Customer relationships are being formed. Enterprise integrations are being built. Multi-year contracts are being signed. Switching costs are accumulating. By the time the accounting catches up—when companies face the full weight of replacement costs hitting their income statements—the incumbent coalitions will have already locked in their customer base. The temporary subsidy enables permanent competitive advantage. Even if we ignore the accounting question, a September 2025 Bain report estimates that AI firms will face an annual $800 billion revenue hole in 2030 to fund their capital expenses—a gap larger than Amazon’s entire annual revenue. Per my calculations, this hole grows to over $1.5 trillion annually if the true total cost of ownership is taken into account. (For reference, that is roughly equivalent to the size of the global foodservice industry.) Even assuming these self-reported figures are inflated by 50%, the revenue challenge remains unprecedented in scale. If these coalitions establish durable customer relationships in the initial years, the market structure crystallized during this window may persist regardless of whether the underlying investment economics are sustainable at true replacement costs. The lessons from the efforts to unwind Google’s dominance of the search market are instructive here. Technical analyses have converged on estimating the useful lifespan of AI chips at one to three years. One unnamed Google architect assessed that GPUs running at 60-70% utilization—standard for AI workloads—survive one to two years, with three years as a maximum. The reason: thermal and electrical stress is simply too high. But physical failure isn’t the only concern. Technological obsolescence drives replacement cycles. Nvidia’s GB200 (“Blackwell”) chip provides 4-5x faster inference than the H100. When competitors deploy hardware with significantly better performance, three-year-old chips become economically obsolete even if they still function. Investment analysts have run the numbers on what happens if accounting catches up to reality. Barclays, for example, is cutting earnings forecasts of AI firms by up to 10% for 2025 to account for more realistic depreciation assumptions. The physical evidence, the technological trajectory, and the emerging financial data all point in the same direction: actual useful life is at least half the accounting life, and this does not even account for the significant operational expenditures required. These aren’t loose partnerships—they’re deeply integrated coalitions where the hyperscaler’s infrastructure economics directly enable their coalition’s competitive positioning at the application layer. True outsiders trying to compete at the application layer include companies like Cohere (enterprise-focused models), AI21 Labs, Mistral, and application builders like Harvey (legal AI), Glean (enterprise search), and Writer (enterprise content). Many have struggled to scale or ended up partnering with hyperscalers—Mistral now has a partnership with Microsoft, and Cohere partners with Oracle. The emerging pattern suggests that coalition membership is becoming necessary for survival. The accounting subsidy creates competitive advantages that flow through the coalition structure. A recent McKinsey analysis projects that approximately 60% of AI infrastructure spending in the next five years goes to computing hardware (chips, servers, memory), 25% to power and cooling infrastructure, and 15% to physical construction. Assuming half of the infrastructure spending goes to computing hardware with 1-3 year useful life: companies can depreciate this hardware over 5-6 years rather than the realistic 1-3 years. This effectively halves their reported annual depreciation expense. This cushion between reported costs and actual replacement economics creates a capital subsidy that allows coalition leaders to subsidize application-layer pricing, expand capacity faster than true economics justify, and report profitability metrics that attract capital on more favorable terms than their operational reality warrants. The Microsoft-OpenAI Example Microsoft’s Azure AI infrastructure investments, when depreciated over six years rather than the more realistic three years, allow Microsoft to report more attractive margins on its infrastructure business. Consider Microsoft’s ~$80 billion annual AI infrastructure spend. If half goes to computing hardware with a true three-year lifespan, Microsoft faces actual replacement costs of approximately $13 billion per year. But by depreciating over six years, Microsoft’s reported annual depreciation is only $6.5 billion—creating an apparent $6.5 billion annual cushion. This cushion enables Microsoft to subsidize OpenAI’s infrastructure costs during the critical years when customer relationships are being formed. OpenAI can price its APIs aggressively to win enterprise customers while operating on a cost structure that wouldn’t be sustainable at true market rates for infrastructure. Microsoft benefits because every enterprise customer that integrates OpenAI’s models becomes more deeply embedded in the Azure ecosystem. The same pattern holds for Amazon-Anthropic. Amazon’s AWS can depreciate AI infrastructure over extended periods, subsidize Anthropic’s infrastructure costs through favorable terms, and benefit from the resulting AWS consumption as Anthropic wins customers. Incumbent coalitions can: New entrants—whether independent model developers or application builders—face steeper economics. Even with access to chips at market rates, they can’t match the pricing of model developers whose infrastructure is subsidized by hyperscaler partners using six-year depreciation. Their profitability looks worse on paper, making it harder to raise capital and compete for customers during the critical window when market structure is being determined. The strategic bet: By years 4-5, when accounting reality might catch up to operational reality, customer relationships will be locked in through switching costs, integration depth, and organizational inertia. The durability of incumbent advantages involves some complex projections. Let me lay out three scenarios and examine how the accounting subsidy affects competition in each. If frontier models keep improving meaningfully with more compute, then training capacity matters more than inference efficiency. This is a strong assumption that does not appear supported by current science. Nevertheless, playing out this world, we see that model quality differentiates providers, customers pay premium prices for frontier capabilities, and incumbent coalitions who built massive training capacity have lasting advantages. The moat is capability-based, reinforced by infrastructure scale. Incumbent coalitions face profitability pressure when accounting catches up to operational reality, but they retain competitive advantages through superior models. New entrants with better unit economics can’t easily compete because the game is about model quality, not inference cost. The capital requirements are enormous and ongoing. Whoever builds scale first maintains advantages. There is also a policy question about whether private capital can sustain the hundred of billions in annual replacement cycles indefinitely, or whether maintaining leadership requires ongoing policy support once true costs become visible. If model capabilities hit diminishing returns and most models become “good enough,” competition shifts to inference efficiency, cost, and building applications. When the market power moves upstream, that creates the most troubling competitive dynamics. In this world, models plateau in capability, inference costs have fallen dramatically, and open source models match or approach proprietary quality. But incumbent coalitions who built scale in the early years retain advantages through: New entrants might have better unit economics, but if switching costs are high enough, customers stick. This is where the Google search case becomes the crucial analytical framework. The Justice Department’s case against Google in search provides a roadmap for understanding how customer lock-in can persist even when competitive alternatives exist with comparable or better economics. Google maintained search dominance through default placements and integration lock-in. Google paid billions annually to be the default search engine on Safari, Android devices, and elsewhere. These defaults created inertia: users rarely switched even when alternatives were “one click away.” The court found this lock-in was anticompetitive. The insight for AI infrastructure is that even in a market where switching takes literally a few clicks, default positions and integration created durable advantages that competitors couldn’t overcome with better economics or comparable quality. Now consider that switching costs are far higher in the AI market: In other words, the lock-in is to the entire hyperscaler infrastructure stack. If Google could maintain dominance in search with relatively low switching costs, how much more durable might AI application-layer lock-in prove when enterprises are deeply integrated into coalition stacks? There is an alternative scenario where the competitive effects could be less severe. Here, models plateau, inference commoditizes, and switching costs prove lower than expected. APIs standardize across providers, models are equally capable, price becomes the primary differentiator, and integration depth matters less than anticipated. New entrants can now compete effectively on price and service, leveraging newer, more efficient infrastructure. The early years’ investment by incumbents might look wasteful in retrospect. Better technology in newer chips defeats scale advantages on older infrastructure. For competition, this means there is no permanent foreclosure—just wasteful spending that created temporary advantages and shaped the market structure during a critical period, even though those advantages don’t persist. The short answer is that we don’t know yet. The available evidence suggests model capabilities have plateaued and inference scaling is the name of the game. As a result, inference costs will fall, but we don’t know how dramatically. Customer lock-in at the application layer might prove durable (like Google search) or weaker than expected. If we’re in Scenario B (models plateau, enterprise lock-in), the accounting subsidy lets incumbent coalitions foreclose competition at the application layer during the critical window, and switching costs prevent correction even when better alternatives emerge. This is the Google search outcome. If we’re in Scenario C (models plateau, low switching costs), the asset-life treatment enables wasteful overinvestment that may temporarily distort competition, but it does not create permanent harm to the market structure. One intuitive consideration is that better chips and algorithms should undermine incumbent advantages over time. The problem is that technology improvement helps everyone, but it helps incumbents more when lock-in exists. For coalitions with locked-in customers, capability expands through replacement spending alone. They are continuously upgrading infrastructure, and existing customers automatically benefit. New entrants with better technology have lower unit economics, but they still must acquire customers. This is challenging when customers are already integrated with the OpenAI APIs through Azure, operating under multi-year contracts, built compliance frameworks around the incumbent stack, facing switching costs that exceed savings from better technology, and receiving continuous capability upgrades from their current provider. The core insight from the Google search case: the technology deflation curve that should enable new entry actually reinforces incumbent advantages when lock-in is strong. The competitive dynamics become more concerning when combined with the circular financing structure at the heart of the AI infrastructure boom. The circular structure reinforces the coalition dynamics and makes it harder for new entrants to compete in the future. Nvidia has embarked on a strategy of making strategic equity investments in its customers. CoreWeave is the clearest example. Nvidia owns roughly 7% of the company, a stake worth about $3 billion as of June 2025. CoreWeave has purchased at least 250,000 Nvidia GPUs—mostly H100s at roughly $30,000 each, totaling around $7.5 billion. Essentially, all the money Nvidia invested in CoreWeave has come back as revenue. In turn, CoreWeave signed $22.4 billion in contracts with OpenAI to provide AI infrastructure. Nvidia participated in OpenAI’s $6.6 billion funding round in October 2024, then announced a $100 billion investment commitment in September 2025. The circle takes shape: Nvidia invests in OpenAI. OpenAI signs contracts with CoreWeave. CoreWeave buys GPUs from Nvidia. Nvidia has equity in CoreWeave. The money flows in a loop, with each transaction appearing as legitimate revenue or investment depending on which company’s books you examine. Not many details have been released about the AMD deal with OpenAI, but reports suggest it involves similar features of circular financing. We’ve seen circular vendor financing disrupt market structures before. During the late 1990s telecom boom, equipment makers financed their own customers to drive sales. Lucent offered $8.1 billion in vendor financing ($15.8 billion in today’s dollars), which represented 24% of revenue. Nortel had $3.1 billion ($6.0 billion today). And Cisco was $2.4 billion ($4.7 billion today). The strategy: lend money to cash-strapped telecom companies so they could buy your equipment. Everyone wins. You book revenue. Your customers build networks. The market bids up your stock. Repeat. Until the music stopped. Forty-seven competitive local exchange carriers went bankrupt between 2000 and 2003. When customers defaulted, vendor financing became bad debt. Lucent wrote off $3.5 billion in customer loans. Today’s numbers are larger. Nvidia’s disclosed investments and financing commitments total roughly $110 billion against $165 billion in last-twelve-months revenue. That’s 67% of revenue—nearly three times Lucent’s exposure at the peak. There are crucial differences. First, there are no allegations of fraud or any untoward activity. Second, the competitive implications differ because of asset lifespans. In telecom, assets had long useful lives. When companies went bankrupt, carriers could buy that fiber at fire-sale prices and use it for decades. The short lifespan of AI chips changes this fundamentally. If the current buildout proves excessive and coalitions face financial pressure, excess capacity won’t be available for new entrants to acquire and deploy effectively. Three-year-old chips at fire-sale prices don’t provide a competitive foundation when incumbent coalitions are running current-generation hardware. Even if the circular financing unwinds, it won’t necessarily enable competitive entry at the application layer. The evidence shows that the market structure is being determined by competition among 3 coalitions, with no realistic path for true outsiders to compete at the application layer during the critical window when customer relationships are being formed. Competition authorities are starting to look at market concentration in AI, focusing on traditional antitrust metrics: market share, pricing power, exclusionary conduct. As far as I know, the competitive effects of vendor financing and accounting policy have not yet been discussed extensively. Two policy proposals can help maintain competition. First, enhanced disclosure requirements about capital and operating costs. Any AI infrastructure project receiving government support should disclose realistic useful life assumptions for hardware, expected replacement schedules and costs, total capital requirements under multiple technology scenarios, relationships between vendor financing and equipment procurement, partnership economics showing how infrastructure costs flow from hyperscalers to model developers, and analysis of customer lock-in mechanisms at the application layer. Second, developing interoperability standards to prevent lock in. Interoperable standards on model APIs and cloud integration frameworks make it easier for enterprises to switch between providers. The Google search remedy focused on reducing switching costs—the same principle applies here. In summary, the market structure for AI firms is coalescing around models that rely on a combination of massive capital flows, circular financing structures, and accounting assumptions that may not match operational reality. The accounting subsidy enables incumbent coalitions to establish market share in the early years, when critical customer relationships at the application layer are being formed. The Google search case demonstrates that lock-in can be decisive even with low switching costs. AI application-layer integration has far higher switching costs. As I’ve said, we don’t yet know which scenario we’re in. But the decisions being made now—based on assumptions that may overstate financial sustainability by a factor of two—are determining the future market for AI services at the application level.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kent Ha, a 37-year-old job seeker in Portland, Oregon, who previously worked as a digital marketing strategist at Intel. He holds a bachelor's degree in new media communications from Oregon State University and an MBA from George Fox University with a concentration in leadership and management. He's looking for product marketing and digital experience roles. Business Insider has verified Ha's past employment with documentation. It has been edited for length and clarity. On July 9, I learned I'd been laid off by Intel. While I enjoyed my five years at the company, I didn't have the reaction some people describe — getting the news, breaking down, and cycling through emotions. Part of the reason is that I saw the layoff coming. In recent years, Intel has conducted thousands of layoffs, which made many of us worried about our job security. When our CEO left the company last December, we were worried that more cuts could be coming. My role fell under the company's sales and marketing group. In the months leading up to July, Intel had taken steps to outsource some of my team's work to another company. That made it seem even more likely that our group would be hit. The other reason the layoff news didn't affect me too much was that I'd already been laid off twice by other companies since 2015 — once during a restructuring and again during the pandemic. By the time it happened a third time, my mindset had already shifted. I'd seen it coming, I knew what it was like to lose a job, and I was already looking for my next role. Business Insider has heard from dozens of tech workers about how corporate strategy shifts, layoffs, and hiring slowdowns have affected their careers.

Read more on the topic: Before I was laid off, I'd started focusing on building my skills in hopes of reducing the chances I'd be let go. But at the same time, I began monitoring the job market to assess the types of roles available. As the company's outlook worsened, I began browsing roles more actively, and it became clear that finding a new job could be challenging. By June, I believed there was a decent chance I'd be let go in the coming months, so I took two steps to prepare. The first was reaching out to my financial advisor. I told them a layoff seemed likely and that the job market looked tough. They advised me not to overreact to something that hadn't happened yet, but said that if I was let go, I should file for unemployment — and that my wife and I should cut back spending on things like eating out and vacations. The second step I took to prepare for the layoff was to start applying for jobs. I figured worst case, I'd land another offer and have a backup plan. Best case, I'd keep my job and wouldn't have to make any changes. It was a contingency plan — that's how I thought about it. As I began searching for jobs, with a focus on product marketing and digital experience positions, I found myself reflecting on the two previous times I'd been laid off. In 2015, I moved from Portland, Oregon, to San Diego for a new role. Six months later, I was let go due to company restructuring. After that layoff, it took me about two and a half months to secure my next role, a three-month contract position. Knowing there wouldn't be a chance for an extension, I kept searching — and was able to find a full-time job that started shortly after the contract ended. In 2020, I was working at a home improvement company that focused on in-home services. When the pandemic hit, those services came to a halt. To cut costs, the company laid off workers — and I was among them. I was fortunate to land a content manager contract role at Intel in less than a month. That role eventually led to a promotion into a full-time digital marketing strategist position, which I held until I was laid off this year. In both 2015 and 2020, I cold-applied to jobs — but what actually worked was posting my résumé on sites like Indeed, CareerBuilder, and Monster. Staffing agencies would reach out, which led to interviews. Compared to my prior layoffs, this job search has been particularly challenging. I'm not having as much luck with those job boards, and when I do hear back, it's usually for entry-level roles. There also seems to be an increase in scams — for example, I recently got an email where the subject line said Audi was hiring, but the body of the message referenced the Marriott Hotel. My other strategies have included updating my résumé — with help from ChatGPT — to ensure it reflects the skill sets needed for the roles I'm targeting. I also strengthened my personal website, hoping to showcase my capabilities to potential employers. I've also reached out to my network to let them know I'm looking for work. I was fortunate to be part of a supportive team at Intel, and even now, many of us continue to share job leads and support each other. That's helped quite a bit. While these strategies have helped me get some interviews, I'm still struggling to land a job. The search has been an emotional roller coaster because there are roles that seem like a perfect fit, and then they go nowhere. I've been fortunate enough to secure some interviews, but it's really difficult to prepare for them and convey the right information within a short timeframe. As I go through my job search, I'm very grateful to my wife, who listens to me talk about companies day in and day out. Knowing how stressful it is for me, she's made us go on nightly walks to decompress. It's also been extremely helpful to have her income coming in — she works in the healthcare industry. I have a few pieces of advice for others who have been laid off: The first is related to your mindset. My first layoff in 2015 hit me hard — I'd just moved to California for the role, and six months later, I lost it. Over time, I realized it wasn't personal. Companies evolve, and so must you. That perspective helped me stay grounded during later layoffs, including this one. Second, find ways to grow. I noticed that one role I was interested in preferred a certified Scrum Product Owner certification, which I was already planning to pursue, so I took the course. I'm now planning to explore AI courses as well to stay current and competitive. And finally: Take a breath. As hard as this is, it might be the only time in your career when you can pause. I remind myself it's a marathon. Having a routine, staying sharp, and preparing for the next opportunity — that's what keeps me going.

Title: Tech Workers Versus Enshittification

Full Content:
The men who appeared on the dais behind President Trump at his inauguration were never good men. Take Tim Cook. Cook owes his elevation to Apple CEO—which made him a billionaire twice over—to his leadership in moving Apple manufacturing to “iPhone City” in south China.3 Other Apple execs had tried this, but they could never get the precision and reliability Apple demanded. Cook managed it, but the brutal working conditions created by Foxconn, Apple’s contract manufacturer there, led to the installation of suicide nets5 to catch workers who leapt to their death rather than facing another shift. Or look at Jeff Bezos. Workers in Bezos’s warehouses are injured (often critically) at three times the rate of workers in other companies’ warehouses.7 Bezos’s contract drivers have to relieve themselves in bottles because they are not given toilet breaks. They are also monitored by AI cameras that score their eyeball movements.11 Google’s top bosses covered up for a senior manager who allegedly preyed on a female subordinate, whom he subjected to violent sex acts. He was given millions of dollars to go away quietly12 while his victim was prohibited from suing by the “binding arbitration” waivers in her contract. These men have always abused anyone they could get away with abusing. If they seemed to treat some people well—for example, the pampered coders who get gourmet cafeterias, free massages, and all the kombucha they can drink—it was because they feared the difficulties of replacing those workers. Now that U.S. Big Tech has shed more than 400,000 jobs in just two years, there’s a reserve army of desperate techies who can be given the suicide-net-and-urine-bottle treatment. One of the first official acts of the current administration was to cancel every single labor investigation and enforcement action in the entire country.8 The administration’s antitrust boss canceled investigations into predatory pricing (selling goods below cost to drive out competitors) and surveillance pricing (using commercial surveillance data to charge you more (for example, by increasing the price of your breakfast sandwich on payday) or pay you less (for example, offering nurses lower wages if they are known to have overdue credit card bills).10 Instead of helping workers and shoppers resist predatory assaults fueled and perpetrated by Big Tech, Trump’s Federal Trade Commission chair is focusing all his energies on a new snitch line where FTC employees can report “wokeism.”4 The men who run Big Tech have always wanted to “enshittify” their services—to shift as much as they can from users, workers, suppliers, and business customers to themselves. The forces that prevented that—militant, scarce workers; competitors; regulators; and rival technologies—were critically weakened and even eliminated over the past 40 years. Biden’s administration was the first in two generations to take fighting corporate abuses seriously.1 Is it any wonder that Big Tech were all in for his rival? Enshittification would be much, much worse if not for tech workers. Tech workers have historically enjoyed remarkable workplace status—not just the material perks, from dry cleaning to personal trainers, but also the power to tell their bosses to go to hell. When your skills are in such high demand that you can quit your job, walk across the street, and get a better one later that same day, your boss has a real incentive to make you feel like you are their social equal, empowered to say and do whatever feels technically right, or just, you know, show up for work with facial piercings, a green mohawk, and a black t-shirt from Defcon with writing on it that your boss doesn’t understand but still feels uncomfortable about. Tech workers may have given their bosses tsuris and demanded sky-high wages, but at least they were wildly productive. The per-worker revenue for successful tech companies is unfathomable—tens or even hundreds of times their wages and stock compensation packages.2 What’s more, many tech businesses had more work than they could hire skilled workers to perform, so bosses’ strategy focused on getting the workers they could hire to put in longer hours. That strategy has a name: “vocational awe,” a term coined by the librarian-theorist Fobazi Ettarh to describe the grueling hours endured by workers who believe in the social value of their work. Teachers, nurses, librarians—any profession whose practitioners are motivated by a sense of duty is a profession vulnerable to vocational awe. Tech companies have been widely derided for their grandiose mission statements, such as Google’s “organize all the world’s information and make it useful” or Facebook’s “making the world more open and connected.” But whether the management of these companies believed in these high-minded words, they were absolutely internalized by employees, who—despite their job security—worked every hour god sent, sleeping under their desks and missing their parents’ funerals to hit their bosses’ arbitrary deadlines. As a motivational tactic, vocational awe (or, as Elon Musk puts it, “being extremely hardcore”) works very well, but it fails very badly. It turns out that when you actually care about your job, and when your boss can’t replace you, and when you can get a new job whenever you want, it’s damned hard to convince you to wreck the things you built and harm your users, even if that will make your boss more money. For many years, tech workers have been the last line of defense between Internet users and tech bosses, bravely holding the line on enshittification. But once tech started to shed workers en masse—260,000 layoffs in 2023,6 another 160,000 in 20249—the power of workers was shattered. Scarcity can give workers power, but scarcity is temporary: Eventually, enough people train to work in your industry, or your boss figures out how to outsource your job to overseas workers with fewer protections and rights, and your power is shattered. No wonder tech bosses are so excited about AI coding tools, which promise to turn skilled programmers from creative problem-solvers to mere code reviewers for AI as it produces tech debt at scale. Code reviewers never tell their bosses to go to hell, and they are a lot easier to replace. Now that tech workers are as disposable as Amazon warehouse workers and drivers, as disposable as the factory workers in iPhone City, it’s only a matter of time until the job conditions are harmonized downward. Jeff Bezos doesn’t force his delivery drivers to relieve themselves in bottles because he hates delivery drivers. Jeff Bezos doesn’t allow his coders to use a restroom whenever they need to because he loves hackers. The factor that determines how Jeff Bezos treats workers is “What is the worst treatment those workers can be forced to accept?” Throughout the entire history of human civilization, there has only ever been one way to guarantee fair wages and decent conditions for workers: unions. Even non-union workers benefit from unions, because strong unions are the force that causes labor protection laws to be passed, which protect all workers. Tech workers have historically been monumentally uninterested in unionization, and it’s not hard to see why. Why go to all those meetings and pay those dues when you could tell your boss to go to hell on Tuesday and have a new job by Wednesday? That’s not the case anymore. It will likely never be the case again. Interest in tech unions is at an all-time high. Groups such as Tech Solidarity and the Tech Workers Coalition are doing a land-office business, and copies of Ethan Marcotte’s You Deserve a Tech Union are flying off the shelves. Now is the time to get organized. Your boss has made it clear how you’d be treated if they had their way. They’re about to get it. Walking a picket line is a slog, to be sure, but picket lines beat piss bottles, hands down.

Title: Nvidia, Microsoft, and BlackRock Just Struck a Massive AI Data Center Deal

AI darling Nvidia just struck another big data center deal—this time as part of a group with Microsoft, BlackRock, and others. A consortium including BlackRock (BLK), Nvidia (NVDA), and Microsoft (MSFT) said Wednesday it would buy AI data center infrastructure company Aligned Data Centers in an agreement valued at $40 billion. Aligned Data Centers is one of the world’s largest and fastest-growing data center firms, and the group said the purchase “will fuel the expansion of next-generation cloud and AI infrastructure.” The massive deal could be taken as another strong signal of AI demand expectations, with Nvidia, Microsoft, and BlackRock making big bets on AI-driven growth. The deal marks the latest in a string of high-profile agreements and partnerships for AI chip leader Nvidia, and infrastructure deals for BlackRock, which has been eying energy providers as another way to ride the AI boom. BlackRock CEO and AIP Chair Larry Fink said that with the acquisition, “we further our goal of delivering the infrastructure necessary to power the future of AI, while offering our clients attractive opportunities to participate in its growth.” Shares of Nvidia and Microsoft pared back early gains and were down about 1% in recent trading. Shares of BlackRock were less than 1% lower. This article has been updated since it was first published for clarity and to reflect more recent stock price values.

Title: Khosla Ventures And Cleveland Clinic Partner On Healthcare Tech
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/innovationrx/2025/10/15/khosla-ventures-and-cleveland-clinic-partner-on-healthcare-tech/
Time Published: 2025-10-15T16:00:22Z

ByAmy Feldman, Forbes Staff andAlex Knapp, Forbes Staff. In this week’s edition of InnovationRx, we look at the Khosla Ventures-Cleveland Clinic partnership, Town Hall Ventures’ $440 million haul, the CDC’s “Friday night massacre,” Boehringer’s new pulmonary fibrosis drug, and more. To get it in your inbox, subscribe here. New technologies are transforming the way that hospitals operate. To try and gain an edge, Khosla Ventures and Cleveland Clinic signed a deal in which the health system will test new technologies that span AI, digital health and next-generation therapeutics from the VC firm’s portfolio companies—and the two will explore opportunities to incubate new companies together. “I think this is a novel approach,” Hal Paz, Khosla Ventures’ operating partner, told Forbes. Discussions that led to the agreement, announced at Cleveland Clinic’s Life Sciences Summit in London on Tuesday, had been in the works for a year. The storied VC firm, with $17 billion in assets under management and more than 300 portfolio companies (about one-third of them in healthcare), gains a substantial healthcare partner with whom to test new technologies from clinical validation through adoption, that may also become a valuable customer for the companies it’s invested in. Meanwhile, Cleveland Clinic, the highly-regarded non-profit health system that spans 23 hospitals and 280 outpatient facilities, gets access to a pipeline of emerging technologies that could help it improve care and efficiency. Already, some 10 to 12 of Khosla’s portfolio companies, mostly in AI and digital health, are in discussions with Cleveland Clinic about how they could work with the health system, Paz said. One, Vista AI, which has developed AI to automate and simplify cardiac MRIs, is already working with Cleveland Clinic at its Akron hospital. Vista’s software enables more scans to be done on a single machine with improved quality and consistency. The two are also already working on a first startup incubation, though neither the final idea nor the timing of its launch has been set. “We are at an inflection point in the industry,” said JD Friedland, Cleveland Clinic’s executive director of venture. “New transformational technologies are emerging that we believe are going to fundamentally address some of the perpetual challenges in healthcare.” The agreement comes as tech-based venture firms have increasingly viewed healthcare as an area of opportunity and as hospitals and health systems have been testing how technology could improve patient care, reduce physician burnout and increase razor-thin margins. It also follows a move by General Catalyst to acquire health system Summa Health, a $515 million deal that created the first hospital system to be owned by a VC firm. “I bet the more significant venture investors in healthcare are going to find different ways to get access to that clinical and research expertise,” Cleveland Clinic’s Friedland said. “It certainly costs a lot less money to partner with Cleveland Clinic than to buy a hospital, and it comes with less strings attached and less brain damage.” For both Khosla and Cleveland Clinic, their non-exclusive partnership could be the first of multiple collaborations—but both Paz and Friedland stressed there was much to do first. Said Paz: “Before we get over our skis and think about the second health system to partner with and the third, we need to give this a little time and learn from it.” When Andy Slavitt left government, he wanted to prove that you could use technology to improve healthcare for underserved and low-income communities—and still make a profit. The former acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and overseer of the successful turnaround of healthcare.gov, set up healthcare-focused VC firm Town Hall Ventures in the summer of 2018 to do just that. “I’ve got a little bit of a chip on my shoulder,” he told Forbes. “If [investors] think you are impact, they’ll put you in this bucket—people who do nice things and maybe some nice family office wants to invest in you because they’ve got an impact mandate. I have always resisted that.” Since its launch seven years ago, Town Hall Ventures has invested in 35 companies and started seven others, including kidney care specialist Strive and Suvida, which offers primary care focused on Hispanic seniors and their families. Its first fund posted top-decile performance, with a net internal rate of return from its July 2018 inception (thru June 30) of 33% versus 12% for the median VC fund. A total of 10 its bets surpassed a billion-dollar valuation, including Cityblock Health, a healthcare provider focused on low-income communities that was one of its initial investments and has since reached a valuation of $6.2 billion; SignifyHealth, a provider of tech-enabled at-home risk assessment acquired by CVS for $8 billion in 2023; and Landmark Health, a startup offering in-home medical care to patients with chronic conditions purchased by Optum Health for $3.5 billion in 2021. Buoyed by that track record, Town Hall Ventures told Forbes it has now raised $440 million for a fourth fund, bringing its total assets under management to $1.4 billion. While the New York-based firm, whose general partners consist of Slavitt, David Whelan and Meera Mani, remains small compared to venture capital giants like Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst or Sequoia, each of which has tens of billions in assets under management, it’s a well-regarded player in healthcare.

Pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive disease in which scarring on the lungs makes it increasingly difficult to breathe. Martin Beck, head of Boehringer’s inflammation disease area, told trade publication Fierce Pharma that the drug represented a major shift forward in treating a disease that had been a “graveyard of clinical development” with more than 36 failed trials over the past decade. Jascayd blocks a type of enzyme, called PDE4B, that’s involved in the honeycomb-patterned lung scarring and inflammation associated with the disease. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that it slowed patients’ decline in lung function compared to a placebo over the course of a year. Plus: Obesity startup Kailera Therapeutics raised $600 million, led by Bain Capital Private Equity, to start Phase III trials of its lead drug candidate, an injectable GLP-1 drug similar to Lilly’s Zepbound. The size of the round ties it with Isomorphic Labs for the largest biotech fundraise of the year. Forbes profiled Kailera earlier this year. Kailera was worth $1.5 billion before the new funding; its new valuation was not disclosed. Duos, a digital health company focused on seniors, raised $130 million, led by FTV Capital, at an undisclosed valuation. The two-year-old company helps members enroll in government programs, retain Medicaid coverage and figure out benefits they may be eligible for but aren’t using. Plus: Umar Afridi, a pharmacist who previously cofounded Truepill, raised $20 million to bring AI to pharmacy operations with Foundation Health. Truepill was acquired by LetsGetChecked for $525 million last year. Digital Health-focused VC firm Define Ventures led the funding round. Biotech startup Immusoft safely re-dosed a patient with its experimental gene therapy for progressive genetic disorder called mucopolysaccharidosis type I that causes skeletal abnormalities, heart disease and vision loss. The company’s gene therapy makes use of engineered B-cells, which the body typically uses to make antibodies, to make specific proteins that treat diseases instead. The benefit of the approach is that it doesn’t require immunosuppression or chemotherapy as other gene therapies do. The ability to safely re-dose makes the therapy more long-lasting, which had been a question during its clinical trial. Forbes spoke with CEO Sean Ainsworth about the company’s technology earlier this year. Plus: Johnson & Johnson is spinning off its orthopedics business, which generated $9.2 billion in revenue in 2024. The new company, called DePuy Synthes, is expected to launch in 2027. Last Friday, around 1,300 CDC employees received notices that they’d been laid off with no warning. Over the weekend, more than half appear to have been told their firing was rescinded, though some 600 employees still appear to remain fired, according to the National Public Health Coalition, an organization of former CDC employees. So far, many of the departments hit appear to be core to the agency’s work, including the CDC library, which provides access to crucial scientific data for agency scientists; the agency’s entire Washington office, which provides information and support to Congress, the Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and staff focused on data collection and disease surveillance. The Health and Human Services Department blamed the layoffs on the current government shutdown and said that employees laid off had been declared non-essential. This is one of several waves of layoffs that have eliminated around 25% of the CDC’s staff since Trump took office. The American Federation of Government Employees has sued the Trump Administration, challenging the legality of layoffs during a government shutdown. In a lawsuit over a previous round of layoffs, a federal judge found that the Administration’s firing of CDC staff was likely unlawful. “Many experts, including myself, are concerned that we are no longer prepared for the next big outbreak or disaster because of the Trump Administration’s continued erosion of our nation’s ability to respond to public health emergencies,” John Brooks, former chief medical officer for CDC’s Division of HIV Prevention, told reporters at an National Public Health Coalition press conference on Tuesday. In response these ongoing program cuts, the Wall Street Journal reported today that 15 states, all with Democratic governors, are building an alliance to manage public health threats. The states have agreed that they will “help one another prepare for pandemics, track infectious diseases, write public-health guidelines, share expertise on preventive care and buy vaccines and supplies in bulk.” Novo Nordisk agreed to acquire Akero Therapeutics for up to $5.2 billion for its experimental liver disease treatment. San Francisco-based Akero has been testing its drug, efruxifermin, as a treatment for MASH, which causes fat to build up on the liver, leading to fibrosis. The deal follows Roche’s announcement last month that it was buying 89bio for $3.5 billion for its experimental MASH drug. Amazon sellers made millions from banned “Dechoker” medical devices, according to the FDA. Biotech dealmaking, from M&A to venture investments, ticked up in the third quarter. Political pressures are influencing work at FDA, according to career staffers there. Consumer Reports found that some protein shakes and powders contain extremely high levels of lead. Mixtures of common drugs that wind up in waterways may accelerate the evolution of antibiotic resistant bacteria, according to research led by the University of Exeter. Wearable health company Oura raised $900 million led by Fidelity, bringing its valuation to $11 billion. That’s more than double the $5.2 billion it was worth last December. The United Nations World Food Programme warned that nearly 14 million people faced severe hunger due to cuts in global aid, especially from the Trump Administration.

Title: What Chipmaking Equipment Giant ASML's Q3 Results Said About AI Demand, China Trade
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/what-chipmaking-equipment-giant-asml-q3-results-said-about-ai-demand-china-trade-11830006

Chipmaking equipment supplier ASML says it's upbeat on AI demand, even in the face trade policy headwinds. The Netherlands-based firm said it doesn't see its 2026 sales falling from 2025 levels even though it expects sales in China to “decline significantly,” thanks in part to strong demand for its machines to make chips supporting AI data centers. CEO Christophe Fouquet said the company has seen “continued positive momentum around investments in AI, and (has) also seen this extending to more customers.” U.S.-listed shares of ASML (ASML) were up about 3% in recent trading. Shares of other companies in the semiconductor industry, including Nvidia (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Lam Research (LRCX), also gained after a down day for the sector yesterday. As one of the world’s leading suppliers of chipmaking equipment, ASML's results can be taken as a signal of whether chipmakers are feeling confident in the future of their businesses. ASML reported third-quarter earnings per share of 5.49 euros ($6.38), above analysts' estimates compiled by Visible Alpha, though its revenue of 7.52 billion euros ($8.74 billion) missed. Fouquet said ASML sees current-quarter sales of between 9.2 billion and 9.8 billion euros ($10.7 billion and $11.4 billion), above the analyst consensus, and that the company plans to provide more details on its 2026 outlook in January. With Wednesday's gains, ASML shares have added 46% in 2025 so far.

Amazon is reportedly planning significant layoffs, targeting about 15% of its human resources staff and potentially impacting other departments. This move aligns with the tech giant's strategy to invest heavily in artificial intelligence while reducing employee costs. CEO Andy Jassy has previously indicated that AI adoption will lead to workforce reductions as the company seeks efficiency gains.

Title: AI Won’t Replace Jobs, but Tech Bros Want You to Be Afraid It Will

reading time 5 minutes AI is overrated, according to author Cory Doctorow. “I don’t think AI can do your job,” Doctorow said, but despite that, bosses across industries are “insatiably horny” about the idea that AI will replace jobs. Top of the list is tech bosses. Tech is one of the industries where AI is scaling significantly faster in the workforce than average (the bigger picture corporate AI adoption is much slower, and some studies claim the returns on investments are low). Many tech CEOs have made statements expressing their wishes to automate tasks that would have regularly gone to human workers. A new report by Source, a consulting firm that works with the tech industry, claimed that over half of tech companies are considering restructuring because of AI. “Tech bosses love the story of AI replacing programmers,” Doctorow said at an event hosted by the Brooklyn Public Library last week, where he was answering former FTC chair Lina Khan’s questions. During her tenure in the Biden administration, Khan was known for her firm regulatory stance against big tech monopolies. Computer programming was once the most lucrative industry to go into, with a surplus of demand for workers; there were numerous job opportunities with great pay and benefits, and cushy amenities. Now, the script has completely switched. Many have blamed the rise of generative AI for it. But Doctorow argues “that’s just not a thing AI is doing” or even can do. “AI can write sub-routines, it can’t do software architecture. Can’t do engineering, because engineering is about having a long, broad context window to understand all the pieces that came before, all the pieces that are coming in the future, and the pieces that sit adjacent to code, and if you know anything about AI, the one thing that is most expensive to do with AI is expanding the context window,” Doctorow said. Doctorow is famous for having coined the term “enshittification” to describe the common, modern-day phenomenon of almost every tech platform becoming soulless, dysfunctional and widely-hated corpses that internet users are still trapped under.Â It’s a cathartically profane critique of capitalism in the tech age that Macquaire Dictionary picked as its word of the year in 2024. He argues that what tech bosses actually like is to have tech workers “terrified that they’re about to be replaced by a chatbot, it gives them a chance to put them in their place.” To understand why, you need to look into how the dynamic has changed in the tech workplace in the past two decades. “The way that tech bosses motivated tech workers was appealing to their sense of mission,” Doctorow said. It was a double-edged sword: it both motivated the tech workers to work grueling hours, but it also made them passionate about the product and its purpose. So, if the boss decided to make changes at the expense of that vision of greater good and in the pursuit of greater margins, the workers tended to fight for the user. One example of that was the Google employee protests over the controversial military AI initiative Project Maven, which successfully saw the tech giant walk back its involvement. Back then, Doctorow argues, tech workers were a good way to keep the industry in check because they had a sense of purpose and they had power. Demand for workers far exceeded the supply, so if things were going awry in the company’s progress towards its mission, they could threaten to leave. There were many other opportunities that they could switch to. But things have since changed, and supply has caught up with demand. Roughly 400,000 tech employees have been laid off in the past two years alone. Silicon Valley companies are asking their employees to work 9 am to 9 pm, six days a week, a schedule known as “996” that was popularized in China. Meanwhile, big tech companies are spending big and making record profits. Nvidia just became the first and only company to hit a $4.5 trillion market cap. The power dynamic has now switched, and the power is with the bosses. And this time around, according to Doctorow, they want to make sure that the power dynamic stays that way. “Tech bosses have shown us how they treat workers they’re not afraid of,” Doctorow said, pointing the finger at Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Federal injury data from 2022 found that Amazon warehouse workers were seriously injured at more than twice the rate at other warehouses. A subsequent Senate probe from 2024 concluded that Amazon had been manipulating its self-reported injury data to make its warehouses appear safer. “The minute Jeff Bezos can put a piss jar next to your workstation, he will,” Doctorow said. “At this point, when Google is firing 12,000 workers, and then doing a $70 billion stock buyback that would have paid their wages for the next 27 years, you need a union,” he advised. If Doctorow’s estimates are true, then AI won’t take over any jobs. But then what about the billions and billions of dollars that have been poured into the AI industry, so much so that those investments are almost entirely driving American economic growth? “The great kind of tragedy and terror of all of this is that AI, if it can’t do your job, then whatever benefits we get from it are not commensurate with the capital expenditures that we’ve made for it, nor will they be sufficiently profitable to incur the operational expenses associated with maintaining these large foundation models,” Doctorow said. TLDR on that: He thinks there is an AI bubble. And he is not alone in thinking like this; many other experts have been sounding the alarms of a rapidly growing AI bubble. In a notable addition this week, the United Kingdom’s central bank said that “equity market valuations appear stretched, particularly for technology companies focused on Artificial Intelligence,” and that this could lead to a sudden, sharp correction. The Bank said that stock market price valuations were comparable to the peak of the dot-com bubble, and that the market share of the top five members of the S&P 500 was at its highest concentration in 50 years. Those five are the AI-heavy big tech giants Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Meta. Lina Khan painted a picture of some other reasons why experts believe there is an AI bubble at the event on Thursday. “There have been increasing discussion about how we may actually be just seeing a big AI bubble,” the former FTC chair said. “We’re seeing all of these circular investments where it’s like the same five to seven companies just handing each other big bags of cash, saying, IOU, we’re seeing, you know, increasing reporting in the business press that even though we’re seeing such significant investment in AI, increasingly, firms are being candid that they don’t know what the profitable use case is going to be, but are just kind of afraid of missing out.” In her time in office, Khan’s FTC opened inquiries into the various deals and partnerships between big tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft and the then-rising, now-reigning AI labs OpenAI and Anthropic. A bubble is worrying. A pop is even more worrisome. “I think we’re going to see a collapse, and it’s going to be very bad,” Doctorow said. “I think 2008 is going to look like a golden age when AI pops.” Explore more on these topics Share this story Subscribe and interact with our community, get up to date with our customised Newsletters and much more. Innovation meets stagnation. Warning bells have been ringing for months, and now experts are providing the data to back that up. Yet another tale of AI's less-than-stellar employee track record has emerged. If you work with dead bodies, AI probably won't steal your career.

Title: Amazon plans layoffs: From Accenture to TCS, these companies have handed pink slips to employees this year

Amazon plans layoffs: Global e-commerce giant Amazon is planning to cut nearly 15% job roles in its human resources department, along with certain other roles, Fortune reported on Wednesday, 15 October 2025. According to the news portal's report, Amazon's HR department, also known as the People eXperience Technology team or PTX, will bear the majority of the cuts, while other departments, such as the consumer business, may also experience some impact. Amazon's HR department has more than 10,000 people employed globally. The company is reportedly laying off staff as the e-commerce giant aims to reduce its employee costs amid heavy investment in artificial intelligence (AI) products and infrastructure. Big IT companies such as TCS, Accenture, Microsoft, Salesforce, and Google are among other firms that have carried out restructuring to improve efficiency and reduce costs amid the rise of AI. TCS is cutting nearly 12,000 employees, or around 2% of its global workforce, in the financial year 2025-26, amid restructuring plans and a push for AI expansion. In the case of Wipro, although there is no official confirmation of layoffs, media reports suggest that the IT major has cut 24,516 jobs to improve its cost efficiency and productivity in the sector. Global IT services giant Accenture announced in September 2025 that it would lay off more than 11,000 employees across its global workforce, while Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has cut 4,000 customer support staff as AI tools take over. Salesforce reportedly reduced its customer support workforce to 5,000 employees, down from its earlier 9,000 employees, marking a reduction of approximately 4,000 employees. 1. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) — Laid off 6,000 employees or 1% of its headcount. It will lay off another 6,000 employees to cut a total of 12,000 jobs or 2% of its total workforce. 2. Google — Laid off 100 employees in design-related roles. 3. Accenture — To lay off 11,000 employees across its global workforce. 4. Salesforce — Cut nearly 4,000 customer support staff. 5. Microsoft — Cut more than 40% or nearly 4,000 jobs in its software engineering business. 6. IBM — Cut nearly 1,000 job roles as the firm shifted to its hybrid cloud and AI business. 7. Cognizant — Laid off 3,500 employees in an effort to simplify the organisation's structure. 8. Wipro — Cut 24,516 jobs to improve its cost efficiency and productivity in the sector. Many tech companies around the world are facing challenges due to pressure from their US business and recent concerns about US President Donald Trump's proposed increase in the H-1B visa fee. Jobs are at risk of being replaced by artificial intelligence, which some companies might prefer to boost productivity and efficiency over that of the human workforce.

Title: How LLY Stock Delivered $47 Billion To Shareholders
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/15/how-lly-stock-delivered-47-billion-to-shareholders/
Time Published: 2025-10-15T13:40:48Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. In the last decade, Eli Lilly stock (NYSE: LLY) has returned $47 billion to its shareholders via dividends and buybacks. This shareholder-centric approach has delivered solid results in 2025, with the stock posting 9% year-to-date returns, despite experiencing some volatility from its peak of $937 earlier in the year, while demonstrating remarkable resilience in the face of increased competition in the diabetes and obesity treatment markets. Eli Lilly's commitment to rewarding shareholders reached new heights with the board's approval of a massive $15 billion share repurchase program in December 2024, replacing the completed $5 billion buyback and representing one of the largest capital return initiatives in pharmaceutical industry history. The diabetes and obesity treatment leader further reinforced its shareholder-first philosophy by announcing a 15% dividend increase for the seventh consecutive year, raising the quarterly dividend from $1.30 to $1.50 per share, bringing the annual dividend to $6.00 and yielding approximately 0.74% at current levels. Eli Lilly’s exceptional financial performance has been driven by the blockbuster success of its GLP-1 medications Mounjaro and Zepbound, with 2024 revenues reaching $45.04 billion (up 32% year-over-year) and earnings of $10.59 billion (up 102%), providing the robust cash generation that enables both aggressive share buybacks and consistent dividend growth while maintaining substantial R&D investments for pipeline advancement. These two drugs alone accounted for $11.5 billion in total sales last year, and in the first half of 2025, this figure has surged 115% y-o-y to $14.5 billion. Let’s look at some numbers and compare how this payout power stacks up against the market's biggest capital-return machines. Interestingly, LLY stock ranks 58th in history in total shareholder returns. Why does this matter? Because dividends and buybacks represent direct returns to shareholders and reflect management’s confidence in future cash generation. Many companies follow this strategy. Below is a list of the top 10 companies by total capital returned through dividends and repurchases. While that’s one perspective, Trefis High Quality Portfolio considers many more factors to help reduce company-specific risk while maintaining growth exposure. For the complete list, visit Buybacks & Dividends Ranking. Key takeaway: Total shareholder returns as a percentage of market cap often appear inversely related to growth potential. Companies like Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) are expanding faster and more predictably but have returned smaller proportions of their value to shareholders. That’s the trade-off: attractive capital returns can sometimes come at the cost of growth. Keeping that in mind, let’s examine Eli Lilly’s fundamentals. (See Buy or Sell Eli Lilly Stock for more.) That’s a solid snapshot, but a complete investment evaluation requires a broader view. That’s exactly what the Trefis High Quality Portfolio delivers—balancing lower risk with upside exposure. Still, Lilly isn’t immune to volatility. It dropped 51% during the Global Financial Crisis and 43% in the Dot-Com bubble. Even during more recent events—the 2018 correction, inflation shock, and Covid pandemic—it declined between 18% and 22%. So, while fundamentals remain strong, the stock can still see notable drawdowns during market downturns. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio of 30 stocks has consistently outperformed major benchmarks such as the S&P 500, S&P MidCap, and Russell 2000. Why? Collectively, HQ stocks have offered higher returns with lower volatility—a smoother ride, as reflected in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Still not ready for Black Friday 2025? Here is your last minute rescue plan

Drive more traffic to your site. Use AI to save time doing SEO tasks. Make SEO easier. And get 24/7 support. Includes Local SEO, Video SEO & News SEO. Heads up! Black Friday is almost here, and if you still haven’t prepared, it’s time to act fast. The clock is ticking, but you can still make meaningful updates that count. This article covers practical and straightforward last minute Black Friday tips to help you make quick, effective changes to your eCommerce store. Even with just a few days left, there’s still room to attract customers and make the most of the biggest shopping event of the year. Did you know? Numbers show that Black Friday 2024 broke all records, as U.S. shoppers spent a staggering $ 10.8 billion online, representing a 10.2 percent increase from 2023. These numbers prove one thing: it is never too late to take action and grab your share of the Black Friday rush. The fastest way to put your Black Friday campaign on pilot mode is by focusing on a few essentials that make an immediate difference. These must-do, last minute Black Friday tips are your quick wins, helping you cover the basics, build momentum, and set up the foundation for a successful marketing campaign. When shoppers land on your website, your Black Friday deals should be impossible to miss. Highlight your best offers right on the homepage or add a static banner so visitors see them immediately. The clearer your offers are, the easier it is for customers to take action. One of the most innovative ways to increase engagement is by using countdown timers. They build urgency, encourage faster decisions, and make shoppers feel like they’re part of something time-sensitive. The Diamond Store saw this in action when they added a live countdown clock to their 24-hour Black Friday email campaign. The result? A 400% higher conversion rate compared to their previous emails. For WordPress users, OptinMonster is a quick way to get started. It lets you create dynamic floating bars and banners with countdowns, all through a simple drag-and-drop builder. If you’re using Shopify, the Essential Countdown Timer Bar app works perfectly for creating announcement bars or cart countdowns to drive urgency and prevent cart abandonment. Did you know a long or confusing checkout process is one of the biggest reasons shoppers abandon their carts, especially during high-traffic days like Black Friday? That’s the last thing you want when every second counts. Before the rush begins, take a few minutes to go through your own checkout process on both desktop and mobile. Place a test order just like a customer would. Verify that your discount codes are applied correctly, your payment options load smoothly, and the overall flow feels quick and effortless. Read more: Boost your checkout page UX: Vital tips for online stores Ask a few friends, family members, or even teammates to try it too. Fresh eyes often spot friction points you might miss, such as unclear buttons, confusing forms, or slow-loading pages. Trust also plays a huge role. Ensure your checkout page displays secure payment badges and recognizable gateways, such as PayPal, Apple Pay, or Stripe. When shoppers feel confident their payment is safe, they’re far more likely to hit “Buy now.” And one last tip: keep it simple. The fewer distractions and clicks, the smoother the path to purchase. That’s precisely what drives conversions during a last minute Black Friday rush. Black Friday emails have been shown to generate 33 percent higher conversion rates than regular marketing messages. That alone makes it one of the smartest last minute Black Friday tips to focus on. When time is short, your existing customer base is your best asset. They already trust your brand and are far more likely to act quickly on your offers. Keep your email focused and straightforward. Start with a subject line that clearly highlights your best deal or most significant discount. For example, in the screenshot below, you can see how the key offer or discount is prominently displayed in the subject line, while the body reinforces the offer with a clear call to action. Inside the email, make your main offer impossible to miss. Emphasize the key benefits of your product or service, and include a direct call to action that takes users straight to your Black Friday sale page. Make it visually engaging by adding a countdown timer or a short GIF that brings energy and urgency to the message. Remember, this isn’t about crafting a perfect campaign. It’s about getting the right message to the right people at the right time. A simple, well-timed email can make a real difference in your Black Friday sales. Social media continues to play a significant role in Black Friday success. It has seen a 7 percent year-over-year increase in traffic, now driving around 10 percent of all global mobile traffic referrals during the holiday season. Your audience is already scrolling, searching, and shopping, so this is your opportunity to be where they are. In these last few days, your social media strategy should focus on building anticipation and trust. If you have customer review videos, testimonials, or any user-generated content, start sharing them now. Boosting these posts or running quick ad campaigns featuring real customer stories can help you build credibility fast. People are far more likely to buy when they see genuine experiences from others. You can also collaborate with a micro-influencer or a brand advocate who already has a connection with your target audience. Even a brief post, story, or reel from them can draw attention to your sale and help you gain visibility. If you are short on time, focus only on your most active platform, whether that is Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, or LinkedIn. Post your best offer as a pinned post or a story highlight and use countdown stickers or short video snippets to create a sense of urgency. Lastly, remember to engage. Reply to comments, answer questions, and reshare posts from happy customers. Small interactions can make your brand feel more approachable and help you stand out during the Black Friday rush. Must read: How to handle comments on your blog If you haven’t touched your SEO yet, don’t worry. There’s still time to make a few quick updates that can help your store appear in the search results. These last minute Black Friday SEO tweaks can enhance visibility, attract the right audience, and might give your deals a competitive edge. Start with your meta titles and meta descriptions. Add words like Black Friday 2025, sale, or deal to your titles so searchers know what to expect. For example, instead of ‘Women’s handbags – Classic collection,’ you can try ‘Black Friday 2025 deals on women’s handbags.’ Keep it relevant, natural, and clear. Next, check your product and landing pages. Make sure they’re up to date with current pricing, stock status, and offers. Highlight the discounts in your product descriptions, and, if possible, include keywords that shoppers might search for, such as ‘best Black Friday deals’ or ‘holiday gift offers.’ Another smart move is to reuse your existing content. If you already have an older Black Friday or holiday gift guide, simply refresh it for 2025 by updating the year, offers, and internal links. It’s a fast way to keep your content relevant without having to start from scratch. Lastly, take a minute to review your page experience. A fast, mobile-friendly site can make or break your Black Friday sales. Run a quick check using Google’s PageSpeed Insights and fix anything that’s slowing your pages down. Even minor improvements can help increase conversions. These quick wins may not replace a comprehensive Black Friday SEO strategy. However, they can still make your website more discoverable and help you capture traffic from shoppers actively seeking deals. Okay, so the must-dos can help you frame a solid last minute marketing campaign. But if you’ve managed to check those off quickly and still have a little time on your hands, don’t stop there. The following few ideas may seem optional, but they can give your campaign the extra boost it needs to capture more attention, convert hesitant shoppers, and capitalize on the Black Friday rush. Don’t let potential buyers slip away after visiting your store. Retargeting ads help remind them of products they viewed or added to their carts, increasing the chances of conversion. Even a short, time-bound campaign with strong visuals and clear CTAs can make a difference during the Black Friday rush. Shoppers love convenience, especially during the holidays. Bundling complementary products or creating quick gift sets can simplify decision-making and increase your average order value. Highlight these as limited-time deals to develop a sense of urgency and drive faster sales. Many customers abandon their carts when questions go unanswered. Adding a live chat feature helps resolve last minute queries instantly and keeps buyers engaged throughout the checkout process. Tools like Tidio and LiveChat integrate seamlessly with both WordPress and Shopify, making setup quick and easy. Getting your offers in front of the right people starts with how your website appears and performs in search results. That’s where Yoast SEO can be a real game-changer during the Black Friday rush.

A few smart tweaks to your product descriptions, meta titles, or site speed can often drive better conversions than a full-scale overhaul. The key to winning Black Friday isn’t scale, it’s strategy.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Arista Networks (NYSE: ANET) stock dropped by 6% on October 14, and is now trading at $139. This decline was triggered by investor concern over new reports. Specifically, reports that Meta and Oracle plan to adopt NVIDIA's Spectrum-X Ethernet networking devices for their AI data centers were perceived as a significant competitive threat to Arista, a major provider of cloud networking solutions. Our algorithm-based multi-factor evaluation indicates that it might be the right time to purchase additional ANET shares. Overall, we maintain a positive outlook on the stock, and a target price of $181 seems feasible. We think there is nothing to fear in ANET stock, considering its overall Very Strong operational performance and financial health. Therefore, despite its Very High valuation, the stock is seen as Attractive but Volatile.

Stock futures are rising as investors monitor developments on U.S.-China trade tensions and digest strong earnings reports from major financial institutions; the Fed’s Beige Book will offer some economic insights amid a data blackout due to the federal government shutdown; ASML Holding shares are rising after the semiconductor equipment maker reported better-than-expected quarterly income; and Jeep-maker Stellantis plans to invest $13 billion in U.S. production. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are moving higher after major indexes turned in a mixed performance yesterday amid ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Futures tied to the tech-heavy Nasdaq were up 1% recently, while those linked to the benchmark S&P 500 rose 0.8% and Dow Jones Industrial Average Futures added 0.5%. Gold futures were up more than 1% at $4,215 an ounce, as the precious metal continues hitting record highs amid economic uncertainty and stock market volatility. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) was trading at $112,000, down from from an overnight high of $113,600 and well below its all-time high of $126,000 set early last week. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which can influence a variety of consumer loans, was holding steady at 4.02%, near a five-week low. Bank of America (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS) this morning released quarterly results that beat Wall Street expectations, joining several other major institutions that released strong earnings reports yesterday. Bank of America reported third-quarter revenue of $28.24 billion, better than the $27.5 billion expected from analysts tracked by Visible Alpha, while its earnings per share of $1.06 topped the consensus view of 95 cents. Morgan Stanley reported revenue of $18.2 billion, compared with the consensus estimate of $16.69 billion, while EPS of $2.80 came in above estimates of $2.11. Investors will be keeping tabs on what bank executives are saying about the outlook for their businesses after JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon warned Tuesday "of uncertainty stemming from complex geopolitical conditions, tariffs and trade uncertainty, elevated asset prices and the risk of sticky inflation." Shares of Bank of America and Morgan Stanley were up more than 4% in recent premarket trading. With data releases delayed as the federal government shutdown enters its third week, investors will be closely watching today’s 2 p.m. ET release of the Federal Reserve’s “Beige Book.” The Beige Book provides a summary of economic conditions in each of the 12 regions of the Federal Reserve and is published two weeks before each Fed meeting, with the next scheduled for Oct. 28-29. While investors won’t get the Consumer Price Index report for September that was originally scheduled for release today, that report will be published on Oct. 24, as officials said that the data was needed to determine Social Security payment levels. ASML Holding (ASML) shares are rising in premarket trading after the Dutch semiconductor equipment maker reported better-than-expected income and sought to reassure investors on 2026 sales, even as its third quarter sales came in below analysts' estimates. ASML reported quarterly revenue of 7.516 billion euros ($8.74 billion), compared with expectations of 7.67 billion euros ($8.92 billion) from analysts tracked by Visible Alpha. Net income of 2.125 billion euros ($2.47 billion) was above the analyst consensus of 2.083 billion ($2.42 billion). The company said it expected 2026 sales to exceed 2025 levels, but would provide more information in January. ASML warned in July that it couldn’t guarantee growth in 2026 due to ongoing trade tensions with China. ASML shares, which have gained more than 40% since the start of the year, rose more than 4% ahead of the bell. Big Three automaker Stellantis (STLA) said it would invest $13 billion into U.S. auto manufacturing over the next four years, the largest single investment in the company’s 100-year U.S. history. The investment will support the introduction of five new vehicles across the company’s brands, which includes Jeep and Chrysler, and the addition of 5,000 new jobs at plants in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana. The automaker recently reported a rise in third-quarter U.S. sales, which snapped a two-year streak of year-over-year sales declines. Shares of Stellantis were up 0.5% in recent premarket trading.

Title: AI Bubble May Pop — Wiping Out $40 Trillion. Learn What Could Happen And What To Do

ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. The GenAI boom faces significant risks, including a projected $1.5 trillion in debt for AI data centers by 2028 and a high failure rate (95%) for enterprise AI pilot projects.OpenAI's substantial cash burn and reliance on continuous capital raises make its financial stability a critical potential trigger for an industry downturn.The article outlines three possible futures: a soft landing, an OpenAI bankruptcy cascade, or a continued boom, with specific indicators for investors to monitor. The generative AI boom grew even bigger this week when Open AI announced its latest multibillion-dollar chip deal, this time with Broadcom – sending its stock up 10%, CNBC reported. The agreement, along with pacts with AMD and Oracle, is one of many that’s pumping money into an AI bubble that looks like it could end much like the dot-com bust did -- sending the Nasdaq down 78%. If such a value decimation began today, it would ultimately swipe $40 trillion from the Nasdaq’s market capitalization. Or will the Gen AI boom continue for decades? Read on to learn how to tell which scenario is most likely. In March 2000, the dot-com bubble – which began with the 1995 initial public offering of Netscape – began bursting. The collapse subtracted $3.6 trillion from the Nasdaq’s market capitalization. There was also lots of debt -- $500 billion borrowed to build fiber optic networks went largely unrepaid due to the bankruptcy of telecom providers such as WorldCom and Global Crossing. While the Nasdaq began declining from its peak on March 10, two events on March 20, 2000 lit the fuse to this cash conflagration. That day "Burning Up," a Barron’s cover story by Jack Willoughby – who interviewed me for the article – was published. Willoughby’s column listed 51 publicly traded Internet firms he forecast would burn through their cash out of 207 by March 2001. That same day, MicroStrategy – whose CEO Michael Saylor is now Executive Chairman leading the renamed company’s strategy of selling stock to buy bitcoin – announced a revenue restatement for 1998 to 1999 due to "aggressive accounting practices," according to the Securities and Exchange Commission. MicroStrategy’s accounting irregularities further shattered investor confidence. By April, the company also restated 1997 results – news of which sent the stock down 91% from its peak. The GenAI boom has certain parallels with the dot-com one. There is OpenAI – the cash incinerating startup driving the hype; debt-heavy infrastructure operators such as CoreWeave; and cash rich providers of customer financing – notably Nvidia and Oracle – to encourage those cash-burning startups to buy more of their picks and shovels, about which I wrote in my book Brain Rush. To build data centers, infrastructure operators are borrowing more than $1 trillion, according to a recent Morgan Stanley study. This could end badly if the cash required to repay that debt is insufficient to cover interest payments. I see three scenarios: GenAI keeps booming, there’s a soft-landing in which valuations decline somewhat, and the OpenAI bankruptcy scenario which brings it all down abruptly should the company be unable to raise more capital to fund its money-losing operations. The bursting of the dot-com bubble wiped out more equity – much of it held by individuals because so many dot-com companies had gone public – than debt. But the unpaid debt damaged lenders and other institutions. For example, WorldCom’s $41 billion bankruptcy and Global Crossing’s $12.4 billion collapse resulted from debt service way in excess of their money losing operations’ ability to repay. During the telecom boom, companies laid 80 million miles of fiber optic cable – between 85% and 95% of which remained unused years after the crash, The Bubble Bubble reported. Today’s GenAI boom could wipe out a significant amount of privately held equity value. While it does not appear a peak has been reached, the debt taken on to finance the building of AI data centers is expected to be even larger than it was during the dot-com boom. Major tech companies pledged a record $320 billion in capital expenditures for 2025, Fortune wrote. That number is growing so much that capex is forecast to reach $2 trillion by 2028 – a whopping $1.5 trillion of which will come from various forms of debt, according to Morgan Stanley. Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft generate massive cash flows. But the growth in debt to build AI data centers highlights the strain on their internal resources. The Morgan Stanley report suggests external financing, including high-cost private credit deals, is necessary to supplement their free cash flow. Investors should note Oracle’s recent experience: the company is already losing $100 million quarterly on its data center rentals to OpenAI noted AInvest despite signing a $300 billion, five-year deal, as I wrote in a September Forbes post. By the end of fiscal 2028, Oracle is forecast to burn nearly $29 billion in free cash flow, noted a Visible Alpha report featured by the Wall Street Journal. If Oracle — a relatively disciplined operator— can’t make AI infrastructure profitable, who can? The most alarming parallel to 2000 involves circular financing arrangements in which a company finances its customer’s purchases. Nvidia, Microsoft and others are now engaging in this practice. Here are five examples: These circular deals are not enough to satisfy OpenAI’s ambition. The company aims to build 250 gigawatts of new computing capacity by 2033 with a price tag exceeding $10 trillion, noted Bloomberg. What if enterprises – which are consuming much of the data center capacity being built to train and operate AI chatbots – decide they are wasting their money? With 95% of AI pilot projects failing to yield meaningful results, according to MIT NANDA, that absence of a return on their $40 billion investment could come soon if a recession is near. What could trigger a bursting of the AI boom? OpenAI needs to reach $125 billion in revenue just to break even—a target not expected until 2029, Reuters reported. Until then, the ChatGPT provider must finance its losses by raising capital. A loss of confidence in the industry’s ability to borrow money to build more AI data centers could send investors scrambling for the exits. However, given the small number of publicly-traded AI chatbot providers, it is difficult to envision another article like Willoughby’s March 2000 “Burning Up” – which was based on dozens of public companies likely to burn through their cash. Differences between today and 2000 may make a GenAI crash less severe. Unlike the dot-com era’s 2,288 IPOs, noted International Banker, many of today’s AI companies remain private. More than 300 enterprise software unicorns are trapped without exits. Their median age is “11.5 years, and 50% need to raise or exit within 12 months,” wrote SaaStr. The relatively small number of GenAI IPOs could limit the damage of a crash. In 2000, retail investors were borrowing money to bet on publicly-traded Internet companies which collapsed after they burned through their cash. Retail investors’ losses spread the dot-com collapse’s pain more widely. If recently public GenAI companies – such as CoreWeave or SoundHound -- were to implode, the relatively small number of GenAI IPOs might cause less damage to retail investors than did the dot-com bust. Another thing that’s better about today is the high profitability of many of the tech giants betting on AI. Today, the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 contribute 28.8% of total earnings – a big jump from 2000’s 16.1%, reported Fortune. Investors should prepare for three scenarios: To get a sense of which scenario is most likely, investors should monitor these indicators: When today’s equivalent of Willoughy’s Barron’s article appears — providing specific data on which companies will run out of cash when — the psychological foundation will crack. The question is not if such a moment comes, but when, and whether the AI boom’s stronger fundamentals can cushion the fall that the dot-com boom’s relative lack of substance made inevitable.

Title: 4 New AI Jobs That Pay Up To $200,000+ In 2026
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelwells/2025/10/15/4-new-ai-jobs-that-pay-up-to-200000-in-2026/

ByRachel Wells, Contributor. We hear a lot about AI disrupting the workforce and making millions of jobs obsolete. We’ve seen AI-related layoffs last year and this year, with plans being drawn up for more layoffs at large companies like Amazon. But what roles is artificial intelligence actually creating? What are the new jobs of the future, the roles that will be in high demand in 2026 and beyond? In this article, you’ll learn about four AI jobs that you’ve probably never heard of, which offer eye-watering lucrative salaries of up to $200,000 and above. These will be the hot jobs of 2026 and will continue to grow in demand as AI implementation is rolled out across organizations. Keep reading to discover what these AI jobs are, the responsibilities involved, and how much they pay: This is the hottest new addition to the C-suite in 2025 and will continue to rise in demand in 2026. According to Asana’s Global State of AI at Work report, companies that have experienced the most success in terms of ROI and productivity when it comes to rolling out AI across their organizations, have designated roles in place, and have a strong strategy, treating it as a business-critical resource (82%). Part of this strategy involves having someone dedicated to AI implementation, digital transformation, and AI ethics and policy in the organization. This has carved the way for this new role, Chief AI Officer, who sits at the executive level and oversees all things AI implementation and strategy. Because this role, and many of the others listed below, are fairly new, we still don’t have access to broad numbers of salary data. However, based on the available information from salary comparison sites such as ZipRecruiter, Glassdoor, and analyzing job listings, here is what you can expect as an average pay rate in the U.S.: Average salary: $259,502 (some companies offer eye-watering pay packages in excess of $1 million) As a generative AI content expert, you would be optimizing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), by creating high-quality training data, using your own judgment to close gaps of information, and using your creativity to train AI models that produce the best outputs. An AI content expert or strategist’s job title can also refer to using AI tools to create and deliver a content schedule on behalf of a business, using your eye for detail to tweak the output and ensure accuracy while maintaining the company’s voice. Because this title is used to mean different responsibilities, take time to thoroughly review the job description before applying, so you know what you’re getting into. This role is best suited for professionals with extensive writing experience and a strong grasp on grammar, original creativity, problem-solving, and attention to detail. Having STEM background may also be preferred by some employers. Average salary: $55,000 to $90,000+ (there aren’t many advertized salaries in this field yet) An applied AI engineer builds, develops, and deploys customized AI solutions for a business to use internally and for their clients. Many of these roles are associated with building and deploying AI agents, which are the buzzword in workplaces right now. These customized solutions enable a business to implement AI and work at scale, using artificial intelligence in a way that best works for their needs, rendering them more effective when it comes to AI integration, or AI scalers, as Asana's State of AI report refers to them. As an example of what you’d be expected to deliver in this role, a job posting by The General Intelligence Company of New York says: When describing what they’d look for in their ideal Applied AI Agent Engineer candidate, the job posting says: Average salary: $154,442 When AI is being rolled out in an organization, there has to be guardrails in place. Otherwise, the company can incur great risk. One thing Asana’s report noted is that AI infrastructure requires three Ps: policy, psychological safety, and performance. The first P, policy, is where an AI ethics lead comes in. You’ll be responsible for “developing clear frameworks that provide guardrails without bureaucracy, defining who does what, when AI is appropriate, and how quality gets maintained.” This ensures safe practices for users as well as those on the receiving end of the output. As an example, OpenAI is currently hiring for a software engineer for AI safety, and the salary on offer is $210,000 – $325,000 plus equity. Average salary: $242,471 To succeed in these roles and land lucrative, niche, AI jobs, here’s what you need to start doing now: Keep upskilling and make your skills niche and relevant. Focus on ways that you can provide direct financial value and translate your technical expertise to niche business solutions. This is what enterprises are looking for. Constantly update and share your portfolio on LinkedIn. Then, monetize your expertise by teaching it online or by selling your projects. Finally, learn how to make your skills marketable so that you can catch the attention of employers and high-caliber clients.

Δ Those cuts could include up to 15% of the tech giant’s human resources (HR) staff, Fortune reported late Tuesday (Oct. 14), citing multiple sources familiar with the plans. Aside from HR, other areas of the company’s consumer business are also likely to be affected, two of the sources said. The Fortune report notes that the cuts are happening at a time when Amazon is seeking ways to reduce employee costs while spending heavily on artificial intelligence (AI) products and infrastructure for in-house use and as an enterprise offering. Amazon has said it aims to spend more than $100 billion in capital expenditures this year, as it expands its cloud and AI datacenters. This follows a series of layoffs in other parts of the company earlier this year, including consumer devices unit, the Wondery podcast arm, and in Amazon Web Services (AWS). At the time, Amazon noted that it was still hiring throughout the company, including AWS roles. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue While those layoffs came soon after Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that artificial intelligence (AI) would lead to job cuts, the company stressed to PYMNTS at the time that these cuts were not connected to AI, but instead followed a review of areas that could be streamlined. PYMNTS has reached out to Amazon for comment about this latest round of cuts, but has not yet gotten a reply. Jassy in June sent a message to Amazon workers saying that employees who have learned to use AI will be in a better position to be a part of the company. He added that Amazon’s corporate workforce would likely shrink in the next few years as the company embraces AI, calling it the most transformative technology since the advent of the internet. “Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company,” Jassy said in the message. Research from PYMNTS Intelligence, from the report “Workers Say Fears About GenAI Taking Their Jobs Is Overblown,” found that more than half (54%) of workers said that generative AI posed a “significant risk of widespread job displacement.” The study also found that 38% of workers said they were worried the technology could eventually lead to their jobs being eliminated.

Title: Reasons Behind Microsoft's Recent 40% Stock Surge
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/15/reasons-behind-microsofts-recent-40-stock-surge/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. From a quantitative perspective, the 40.1% fluctuation in Microsoft (MSFT) stock between 4/17/2025 and 10/14/2025 can be largely attributed to a 27.5% variation in the company's P/E Multiple. Although there is more to this narrative than mere figures, let’s first analyze the stock price trends and their influencing factors. Investing in a single stock can be risky, but there is considerable advantage to a more diversified strategy, such as the one we take with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Should you invest in one stock that appeals to you, or should you create a portfolio that is structured to succeed throughout market cycles? Our analyses indicate that the High Quality Portfolio has transformed the uncertainty of stock selection into reliable market-outperforming results. This portfolio is part of the asset allocation framework of Empirical Asset Management – a Boston-based wealth management firm and Trefis collaborator – whose asset allocation strategy achieved positive returns during the 2008-09 crisis when the S&P 500 plummeted by over 40%. Returning to the "change": The shifts in fundamental aspects such as valuation, revenue, and profit margins reflect underlying business dynamics and investor sentiment. Below, we outline the key factors that affected the stock price movements for MSFT. For context, MSFT provides software, services, devices, and solutions, including Office, Microsoft Teams, Windows OEM licensing, and productivity tools to meet both business and personal computing demands. Opinion: At present, we view MSFT stock as relatively overpriced. Why is that the case? Investigate the complete narrative. Read Buy or Sell MSFT Stock to understand the factors influencing our current viewpoint. Risk: Nonetheless, Microsoft is not immune to significant declines. It experienced a drop of approximately 65% during the Dot-Com bubble and nearly 58% in the Global Financial Crisis. Recent shocks have also led to considerable declines — around 37% in the inflation spike and nearly 28% amid the Covid sell-off. The lesser correction in 2018 still resulted in a fall of over 18%. Strong fundamentals are essential, but when the market undergoes severe sell-offs, even leading stocks like MSFT can be caught in the downturn. Consistently identifying winners is a challenging endeavor — particularly given the volatility that comes with an individual stock. Instead, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising of 30 stocks, has a proven history of significantly outperforming the S&P 500 throughout the last four years. Why does that happen? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; it’s been less of a roller-coaster experience, as illustrated by the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Are Leveraged ETFs to Blame for Selloffs? JPM Says Yes

Analysts from JPMorgan on Monday wrote that levered ETFs might worsen macro swings by increasing intraday volatility. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com When markets tumble, everyone starts looking for a suspect, and leveraged ETFs could be next in the police lineup. JPMorgan analysts blamed levered ETFs for Friday’s stock selloff, which resulted in the S&P 500’s biggest one-day loss since April, in a research note published Monday. JPMorgan Managing Director Bram Kaplan said leveraged products will “likely trigger further systematic selling flows this week, leaving markets fragile.” Although the drop was triggered initially by President Donald Trump’s threat of new tariffs against China, the note estimated that roughly $26 billion of selloffs from leveraged ETFs worsened the decline. While experts agreed on the dangers posed to individual investors by leveraged funds, not everyone was convinced of their widespread risks. “I wouldn’t say that leveraged ETFs wholesale create systemic issues,” said Bryan Armour, Morningstar’s director of ETF and passive strategies. “But there definitely have been instances where they make things worse.” Leveraged ETFs are still relatively new to the scene, but the role they play in shaping macroeconomic trends might be outsized. Leveraged ETFs typically hold swaps instead of options. Because of the structure and high liquidity of swaps, their price can swing wildly, particularly in leveraged products, which promise 2x or 3x returns on underlying holdings. “Forced buying and selling when everyone knows roughly what they’re going to have to do can be very problematic,” Armour said. “It can increase volatility [and] hurt investors in the leveraged ETF, because then they have to sell lower and buy higher each day.” Still, there is reason to believe levered products aren’t all to blame: Ultimately, Armour doesn’t think the amount of assets these ETFs currently hold is significant enough to have much of an impact. The largest 3x leveraged product is the ProShares UltraPro QQQ (TQQQ), which only has around $29 billion in AUM, according to VettaFi data. Doesn’t Ring a Bell. The hope is that individuals will recognize the risks of these funds before buying into them, said Morningstar research analyst Lan Anh Tran. “It’s hard to tell where investors are interested in putting their money next,” she said. “With these leveraged or inverse leveraged ETFs, they blow up every once in a while, and then the next year, it seems people are going through a collective amnesia. They forget that that ever happened.” No one knows the future, but high inflation could make some investments virtually worthless. As regulators have warmed up to crypto and assets have poured into ETFs, advisors who ignore the trend risk losing clients, proponents said. The firm has waited until now to expand its US product line as sales trends are favoring ETFs over many mutual funds. As the iShares Bitcoin Trust nears the milestone, dozens of spot-price crypto ETFs are being prepped to come to market. Low-fee products tracking indexes have outperformed their higher-fee ETF counterparts and have raked in assets. The meme stock category isn’t about stonks and tendies anymore, and the new iteration focuses on broader retail sentiment. Investors have been piling into gold ETFs amid uncertainty exacerbated by the government shutdown and the dollar’s declining status. A slew of 3x leveraged single-stock ETF filings highlights issuer appetite for increasingly risky strategies. Categories outside of the US are seeing double the returns of the S&P 500, despite high tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The SEC halted operations last week amid the federal government shutdown, pausing dozens of ETF applications. It may not be an ideal time for high-yield corporate bonds, but State Street is filling out its target-maturity suite with several new ETFs. Active managers like to tout their defy-the-odds abilities, but chances to get in on tomorrow’s large cap stocks slimmer, Morningstar says. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: How I Became a Populist

I got the call a little before 5 p.m. on a Friday. My wife, Sima, and I were sitting on the couch with our kids, probably watching Curious George. The White House vetting process had gone on for months. Yet, despite the Zooms and document requests and endless online forms, I had a strange certainty that I ultimately would not be selected. “You’ve said … a lot of stuff,” observed the twentysomething staffer who got my file. The end of the day Friday is when Washington takes out the trash. It’s when you push out the bad news so it’s old news by Monday’s news cycle. So when the call came in, I looked at my phone, looked at Sima, and dismissively said as I stood to take the call something like: “Ah. This is the White House saying they’re not picking me.” Indeed, until the precise moment the words came out of the phone—“President Biden is going to nominate you to the Federal Trade Commission on Monday”—I remained convinced it was never going to happen. But it did. By that point, in September 2021, I’d spent most of my career working for two causes: privacy and immigrant rights. I stood up the Senate privacy subcommittee for Senator Al Franken and organized oversight hearings into Google and Apple and Facebook and the National Security Agency. I started the D.C. area’s first college scholarship that was blind to immigration status. As a law professor, I built a team that figured out how Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, finds people it wants to deport by pooling and mining their gas, water, and electric bills. I also served on the board of CASA, an extraordinary immigrant rights group that calls Kilmar Ábrego García a dues-paying member. I denounced the Trump administration’s decision to separate parents from their children at the border. I called ICE an “out of control domestic surveillance agency.” I even called the president a racist on social media. I got confirmed by the skin of my crooked teeth. It didn’t matter that I had deep experience on privacy—a core issue in the FTC’s consumer protection work. No Republican voted for me in the Senate Commerce Committee. No Republican voted for me on the floor of the Senate either. Vice President Kamala Harris had to travel to the Capitol to cast a tie-breaking vote in my favor—three times. One Republican senator told me why. We’d just had a long conversation about what social media was doing to teenagers’ mental health, and what I wanted to do about it. “I like you,” he said. “I look forward to working with you. But I can’t vote for you because of what you said about the president.” I came into office an unabashed advocate for immigrants. I left office the same way. But while that hasn’t changed, after three years as a commissioner, the way I look at the world has. I used to think that the defining fight for our country was between the left and the right. Now, I am much more worried about the money at the top crushing everyone underneath. That sounds grim because it is. But I also think this perspective can unite our country in a way that feels almost impossible today. When you are confirmed to the FTC, after you get your badge and keys and figure out your computer, the conference invitations start chiming in your inbox: Aspen, Brussels, Vegas, Davos. I declined those invites. My first trip was to Charleston, West Virginia. I had spent a lot of time during my confirmation process trying to teach myself about the pharmaceutical supply chain, and the way it affected pharmacies in rural and urban America. Along the way, I spent some time on the phone with Lynne Fruth, the second-generation owner of an independent pharmacy chain in Appalachia. She told me about how insurance companies were using intermediaries called “pharmacy benefit managers” to systematically steer lucrative prescriptions to their own mail-order pharmacies—not the ones that were convenient for their patients. I later read a West Virginia state insurance commissioner’s report about a family who had almost been turned away from a local pharmacy. Their child was sick with cancer. The pharmacy had the right medicine in stock. But an insurance company middleman told them to go home and wait up to two weeks for the medicine to arrive in the mail. So one night, after feeding the kids dinner, I got in my car and drove out to meet Fruth. As I left my house in Rockville, I turned on a podcast whose sole purpose was to explain the acronym soup of pharmaceutical pricing: “WAC,” “MAC,” “NADAC.” It got me well past Harper’s Ferry—more than an hour away. The next morning, in an office park just outside of Charleston, a roomful of independent pharmacists told me about the bizarre “negotiations” with those middlemen. Any wins were made on the phone. But the middlemen could undo those concessions at any time via fax. The pharmacists described being “audited” by those middlemen. Somehow, they were always fined by those same middlemen for noncompliance. And now, drug reimbursements from those insurers were going through the floor. In the pandemic, those independent pharmacists had vaccinated thousands of people, often in the poorest and most isolated areas unserved by national pharmacy chains. Their customers had heard all sorts of things about the vaccine online or on television. But they trusted their local pharmacists. Now, those independent pharmacies were closing, one after another. One pharmacist said, with a sad laugh, that he had started selling Jack Daniel’s just to keep the lights on. Toward the end of our session, a retired accountant named Jim Rossi started to speak. He had joined the meeting at Fruth’s request. He ticked through his daily routine of 15 pills for nine medicines treating three autoimmune disorders and a heart condition that required a pacemaker. He then told me what it was like to get all that via mail-order pharmacy. “It takes about a week to resolve any kind of a small issue with them,” he said. “Then, it takes them another week to fill the prescription. Then after that additional week wait, they ship the medication to me.” That took another three days to a week. His specialist had warned him to stick with the same manufacturer for each prescription. That’s not what came in the mail. “I open up the bottle, and there are three different colors of pills in it, which tells me there’s three different manufacturers in that bottle.” But there was one drug, for his Crohn’s disease, that the mail-order pharmacy filled unfailingly fast and in advance. He sometimes had a nine-month supply in a drawer at home. That one cost $1,000 a month. My second trip on the job was to Des Moines, where I met with nine corn growers and cattlemen in a hotel conference room on the sidelines of a law enforcement conference. The session was organized by my adviser, Max Miller, who had just left a job as an Iowa assistant attorney general to join my staff. This was the meat and potatoes of Max’s practice. I felt out of place in a suit and an N-95 mask. That went away when they started talking. Every person described a situation in which corporate power was squeezing them. They used to have any number of vendors to buy their seeds from; now there were two. The suppliers of all their inputs—feed, fertilizer, pesticides, you name it—had slowly consolidated and were jacking up prices. The ag industry was known for relentless innovation. “We doubled our yields in a generation,” the farmers said. But now, the companies weren’t focused on research and development. “They’re using their wealth to buy their competitors,” they said. The ranchers used to have any number of places to process their cattle. Now, a lot of them had just one meatpacking plant accessible to them. When you have just one place to sell your livestock, no one competes to buy it. What the processor pays is what you get. They used to fix their own tractors. Now, John Deere locked down its software, forcing them to take those tractors to a company dealership. “It’s like getting picked apart by a chicken,” said one of them. Said another: “We have a noose around our necks, and we’re standing on an ice cube.” But the problem went beyond income. When there’s just one processor, you have to get to that processor regardless of how far it is. Cattle die in the heat of the drive. And when that processor closes—as many did during Covid—there’s nowhere else to take your livestock. One rancher had to gas his hogs, dig ditches, and hire high schoolers “to fill holes with dead hogs.” Another rancher told me about how his one processor treated his animals. A cow had slipped upon arrival at the lot. She was injured and could not regain her footing. The rancher begged staff to let him take her home to heal, but that request was denied. No livestock could leave the premises. She was attached to a log chain, dragged out of the trailer, killed with a bolt to the head, and thrown in a dumpster. One of the last places I visited as a commissioner was a community center in a small park in Miami’s Little Havana. It was after sunset in early April, but it was already 80 degrees and muggy. Amid the sounds of creaking swings and little kids cutting their bikes through the playground, a dozen men trickled into the room after finishing construction and landscaping shifts in the Miami region, home to Jeff Bezos, billionaire hedge fund manager Ken Griffin, and over a hundred centimillionaires. Most of them were in their twenties and thirties. They wore baseball caps and crisp T-shirts. They looked like they had gone home, showered, and walked into the room a few moments later. They were tired. I expected their main problem to be that they didn’t get unemployment insurance, workers’ compensation, or overtime. And I was right to a point. They didn’t. Even though they showed up at work and did what they were told, how they were told, and when they were told to do it, their bosses deemed them “independent contractors”—independent business owners, not W-2 employees. (I later heard an interview with an organizer who said he met workers who didn’t even know what overtime was—they’d never heard of it. “No saben que cosa es ‘overtime,’” he said.) But that wasn’t their main complaint. Their main complaint was that they didn’t get water. I did not expect that. “Maybe there’s a thermos that’s filled with water that’s not potable,” said an organizer from WeCount!, the group that called the meeting. “Maybe there’s a thermos that’s covered in mold.” One of the men worked for hours in over 100-degree heat while staring at a cooler—his only source of bottled water. The cooler was locked. The prior year, a 47-year-old worker had died while remodeling a multimillion-dollar home in Coral Gables. The heat index was 104. A Tampa Bay Times investigation found that 37 outdoor workers died from heat-related causes in Florida over the past decade, “some just hundreds of feet from air conditioning and running water.” Federal safety inspectors were nowhere to be found. “There’s no water. There’s no harness training. We’ll go a month without the most minimum contact with OSHA”—the Occupational Safety and Health Administration—said a painter named Ronny. What if he complained to his employer? Most of the workers were undocumented, Ronny explained. “When you ask for the law, you lose your job.” So, the workers had gone to the county commission, and they succeeded in securing the passage of a law mandating water breaks for local construction sites. Six days after we met, Republican Governor Ron DeSantis blocked the ordinance. My second-to-last trip was to New York City, where I met with rideshare drivers gathered in a lecture hall at Fordham Law School near Lincoln Center. There were about 20 or 25 of them. They described being lured by promises of lucrative earnings accompanied by near-total control of their schedules. Many of them invested tens of thousands of dollars in new vehicles so they could get the best fares. A lot of them had a good experience; some had had it good for years. But recently, the apps started locking them out at seemingly random times of day. The first driver I heard from was named Mohamed Mohamed. He had maintained a five-star rating and a 100 percent acceptance rate over 21,000 rides and nine years of driving. At the start, he liked that the companies called him a “partner.” “You’re a partner for us,” he recalled them telling him. Now, “I take three trips, I stop to go to the bathroom, and I’m locked out for the end of the day,” he said. He was in $2,000 of credit card debt. And he now had to drive 12 hours to earn what he previously earned in four. Then another driver sat down to speak. I didn’t catch his name; I noticed he was shaking. His wife had died unexpectedly that morning. But he had been inexplicably kicked off the apps altogether with no explanation. He showed up anyway, because someone in government was finally going to listen to him. “This is not fair,” he yelled. “And I need the account back on to go to work. Because the city provided me a license to work, to be a good citizen. I am.” He was crying. “I do everything. Pandemic, I work. Snow, I work. Why I cannot live like a decent people?” The despair in this country is far deeper than most of us understand. It’s worse than that, actually: It’s so pervasive that we don’t even see it. It’s become normal. In the wealthiest country on Earth, it’s normal for people who are diagnosed with cancer to set up a web page to beg their friends and family for money. It’s normal for those people to go bankrupt. Getting sick is the most normal reason to go bankrupt. In a country that celebrates farmers, it’s normal for those farmers to kill themselves at a rate far beyond the rest of the population. At a time when billionaires compete to launch rockets into space, it’s normal—completely normal—for construction workers to die of heat and thirst. Many liberals remain baffled that America elected Donald Trump. They genuinely have no idea how he could have won the election. I don’t think that Trump won because of “wokeism” or the “trans agenda,” whatever that is. I think he won by speaking to that despair and telling people that he alone could fix it. His tirades against China and “illegals”? Some people listened to them and heard bigotry and xenophobia. I heard it, too. But more people heard a guy talking about how he was going to help them make rent. At least enough people to win the election. My time as a commissioner changed the way I saw things. I always suspected that despite Trump’s promises to cap credit card fees and slash prices and bring manufacturing back home, all of it would more or less amount to nothing. So far, other than temporarily reducing taxes on tips, that’s pretty much what’s happened. Instead, we face looming health care and childcare cuts for millions, a slowdown in manufacturing, and on-again-off-again tariffs indexed to whether a country will nominate Donald Trump for a Nobel Prize. Chaos and cruelty don’t pay the rent. But I expected all that. What I did not expect was that over time, people I’d seen as bold progressives started to look quite different. I always thought of Colorado Governor Jared Polis as a pathbreaker: the first openly gay man and first Jewish person elected governor in the state. Now, all I can think about is how he vetoed a law that would make it dramatically easier for people in Colorado to form a union … and a law that would have barred landlords from using algorithms to collude on rent hikes … and a law, passed unanimously in the state legislature, to end surprise ambulance bills … in two weeks. I always liked how Illinois Governor JB Pritzker stood up for the little guy: for undocumented people, for trans kids. I love how he seems genuinely unafraid of this president. But it’s harder to see him in the same light after watching him veto a bill that would have protected workers at Amazon warehouses—where injuries are so frequent that the company puts vending machines on its warehouse floors that dispense not potato chips, but painkillers. Why can’t Pritzker fight for the people in warehousing? Perhaps my biggest change is in how I think about what’s happening with ICE. The masked police, the flash renditions, the swamp gulag—we now live in the dystopia that we were loudly warned about during the president’s first term. But when I see police tackle a teenager with a baby’s teething toy in her hand, when I see them peel a child off of her dad’s arm at the courthouse, or cuff a shrieking mother saying she needs to get her kids from school, my first thought is not to “immigrant rights.” No. Now, I can’t stop thinking about the lawyer in a hand-stitched suit sitting at my old FTC conference table, telling me, over 70 minutes and a 30-page PowerPoint, how it could not possibly be in the interest of the United States government to sue her corporate client. And I’m not talking about one particular case; I’m talking about all of them. When the federal government does things like investigate a corporate landlord for packing rent checks with fake charges, or an oil executive allegedly trying to “align U.S. oil production with OPEC,” or pharmacy middlemen accused of trying to raise the price of insulin—it’s sternly worded letters, PDF white papers, and multiple hour-long meetings where the company gets to tell us what we got wrong. That’s standard process. But when you’re a cleaning lady whose papers aren’t right? It’s five men in bulletproof vests on your doorstep, and your four-year-old crumpled in your arms begging “no quiero please, please, please.” It’s an agent saying, “I’m sorry, but I don’t have any choice.” And that difference enrages me. Soon after taking office, Trump’s designated chairman of the FTC, Andrew Ferguson, announced that the agency would “usher in a new Golden Age for American businesses, workers, and consumers.” What has followed has been a Golden Age for the C-suite. The ban on noncompete clauses that keep everyone from pediatric surgeons to Jimmy John’s sandwich-makers in dead-end positions, or keep them from working entirely? Not worth defending in court. The rule banning companies from doing that thing where they sign you up for a subscription online, but only let you unsubscribe over the phone? Enforcement delayed to mid-July to give companies “ample time” to comply … and the federal court a window to strike it down. The order barring that oil executive from the board of Exxon? Undone. He’s free and clear to join. A similar scene unfolded 10 blocks west at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The bank that was systematically hitting service members with surprise overdraft fees and forced to send them $80 million in refunds? Don’t have to pay them back anymore. The lawsuit against a Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary that allegedly tricked people into taking out loans for mobile homes when they had $57.78 in discretionary income? Gone. As everyone knows, these are just the lowlights. What people may not know is how thoroughly unprepared we are for this reality. Picture the inauguration. If the president tries to illegally deport you or illegally strip you of your voting rights or (ahem) illegally fire you, there are dozens of nonprofits that can step up to defend you in court, free of cost. Many struggle to make payroll. Some have tens of millions of dollars in the bank. The American Civil Liberties Union has $829 million. But what if the billionaires over the president’s shoulder hurt you? If they use legal loopholes to deny you health care? If they dock or block your pay for no apparent reason? If they buy all of your buyers so that only they buy your goods, and they set the price? If they use their market power not to outcompete you, but to bully you out of the market? There are maybe a handful of national nonprofit organizations that will represent you pro bono. And the ACLU fights the government, not the oligarchs. This all-encompassing focus on fighting government overreach may have made sense when our tax system actually taxed the rich, when union membership was at an all-time high, and when CEO earnings were not a vulgarity. Now, Fortune 500 firms regularly pay zero dollars in taxes. Unions protect just one in 10 workers. And CEOs parade like modern-day Roman emperors, in private jets, to private islands, with their private Praetorian firefighters and guards. And all of this is happening when the government agencies built to check corporate power are being torn apart. My daughter likes me to watch her gymnastics class. Let me try that again. My daughter really doesn’t like it when I stare at my phone during her gymnastics class. She has her mother’s strength. So when she makes it around the uneven bars a little faster than her peers, the first thing she does is shoot me a look. If I’m looking at my phone, that’s a big “L” for dad. And so, on a Tuesday this March, when I got a call a few moments after arriving at the gym from my colleague, Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, asking, “Hey, have you checked your email?”—I proudly said I had not! “Well, I just got an email from the White House saying they were firing me. You should probably check yours.” Sure enough, I had an email from someone named Trent Morse informing me that the president was firing me, effective immediately. Curiously, Morse did not claim I had neglected my duties or misused my authority; he went out of his way to not give a reason for the firing. That was a problem—for them. Because the Supreme Court had said, 90 years earlier, that the president could only remove an FTC commissioner “for cause.” The court said that unanimously. Suddenly, we had to answer a really weird question really quickly: If the president says you’re fired, but the Supreme Court says he can’t fire you, did you get fired? Or did you not get fired? Becca and I decided we did not get fired. We would keep doing our jobs. We’d keep on taking meetings, issuing statements, testifying before Congress. And we thought we should be loud about it. I called Sima, and my chief of staff. Then I put out a statement saying that the president was trying to turn the FTC, a fierce corporate watchdog, into “a lapdog for his golfing buddies.” The calls started. The New York Times, Bloomberg, a producer for Chris Hayes. My daughter got out of class, and I told her I’d been fired. She gave me a hug, got in the car, and asked if she could watch her favorite Lego builder on YouTube. FTC staff started calling. Then, more reporters. Ten minutes into the drive home, a little voice in the back seat piped up, “Papa, why are we going this way?” I was missing turns from the notifications on my screen, then missing more turns when my phone, which kept on dinging, was slow to update the map. When we finally got home, I recorded a video to explain how this wasn’t about hurting me, but about helping the men at the inauguration—Musk, Bezos, Zuckerberg, Pichai. Between the two of us, Becca and I had sued, or were actively suing, each of the men’s companies. And we were weeks from a federal trial against Meta. We did a virtual press conference with some senators and congressmen; I did more interviews after that. A little before midnight, there was a knock at our door. Domino’s. It was my first break since 5 p.m., and I was grateful for what I thought was a gesture from a friend who knew I’d be up late. I opened the box: meat lover’s, loaded with bacon. We don’t do bacon. I asked the delivery guy if he’d gotten a tip—he said no—so I started trying to find an app to pay him, when he spoke up to say, “Well, ah, sir, you still haven’t paid for the pizza.” That’s when we realized that the pizza was not from a friend. It was from someone, somewhere, telling me they knew where I lived. The days and weeks ping-ponged between the thrill of being able to publicly denounce what was happening to our agency—and the dull fear a parent feels when things are not right for their family. I hold virtual roundtables with rideshare drivers in Denver, fishermen from Maine, and small retailers in Massachusetts—someone tries to take out a half-million-dollar line of credit in my name. I speak at the Bernie and AOC rally in Denver; I scream so loud I pull a muscle in my neck. I realize we can’t buy a house on a single income, even though we’d been planning a move for months. Commissioner Slaughter and I quickly sued to block the attempt to remove us. The financial ramifications of the legal fight started to set in. Sima and I looked at our accounts and figured we could afford about three months for it to play out. The three-month mark approached with no ruling from the judge. So I decided to call the guys in Iowa. My very last visit as a commissioner was to a family farm in Ankeny, just north of Des Moines. It was scheduled for a Saturday morning in June. Going in, I knew that by Monday, unless I woke up to a ruling reinstating me, I’d issue a statement formally resigning as a commissioner, letting me start to look for a new job. Max, my former adviser, put me up at his house the night before. We woke up and went to the farmer’s market with his new wife and their now five kids. I got a coffee and a kielbasa. We drove up to Ankeny. The Iowa Farmers Union had organized a listening session at a fifth-generation diversified farm that grew corn, soybeans, oats, and alfalfa, along with a range of livestock. The owner, LaVon Griffieon, had attended that first meeting; so had a few others in the audience. This time, I was able to talk about our lawsuit against two pesticides manufacturers that were trying to push cheaper generics off the market, as well as about our lawsuit, filed just that January, against John Deere for locking down its software. The group was kind to me. They appreciated it, they said. But so many of their stories were the same that they were three years earlier. A corn and soybean grower said that fertilizer prices were moving in lockstep, such that the moment the farmers finally saw some profit, prices would go up and erase those profits. “Iowans like to claim they feed the world,” said Griffieon. “But the pandemic proved to us with bare store shelves that Iowa can’t even feed Iowa very easily.” A half-hour in, there was a speaker I hadn’t met—a tall, young farmer with long hair, also fifth-generation, named Sean Dengler. On the first day of the winter harvest, he had gotten up and turned on the combine. It roared, then whimpered, then went into “limp mode.” The circuit board was fried, and only John Deere could fix it. Sean’s father called the dealership right away, but the technician took hours to get there. A line of other farmers had called in first. The soybeans were already dry, and it was hot and windy. So they paid extra for the part to be delivered the next day; and again paid extra for the second visit. “We lost time waiting, which meant lost yield potential,” he said. “And we lost money because John Deere could charge us more because that is their business plan.” Our lawsuit was a few months too late. It was Sean’s last harvest. “Both of my grandparents were farmers,” he said. “I’m the last Dengler to ever farm in Tama County.” The session lasted another hour. I had lunch at a Mexican restaurant with the union president, his vice president, an ag reporter, and Josh Manske, a board member from Algona, Iowa. The lunch lasted about an hour. And that was it. I was done. Josh and I met Max in a park back in Des Moines, got some beers, and found an empty picnic table. We talked about Max’s blended family. I thanked Josh for hosting a liminal FTC commissioner. We laughed about that. We talked about the session. While a lot of things had come up, I kept coming back to Sean Dengler. Then, I thought about those rideshare drivers in New York City. It may not look this way at first, but the Iowa farmer who can’t run his combine because of a farm equipment monopoly has a heck of a lot in common with the Bangladeshi dad who can’t work the morning commute because he’s locked out by Uber and Lyft. If you focus on the conflict between left and right, if the most important thing is what you are—your party, your state, your race, your ethnicity—the people I met could not be more different. On the one hand, you have rural, white small-business owners, generations into building a life in this country. On the other, you have urban Latino, Haitian, African, and South Asian immigrants, every one of them a worker. The line between them is sharp, almost tribal. What could they possibly have in common? Everything—if you look at what they need. The people I met as a commissioner may look different, but what they need is surprisingly the same: They need a government that gives them a level playing field against the powerful and wealthy. They need the courts to check corporations when they abuse that power and wealth. They need basic dignity and control in their material lives. Looking at things that way, everyone I met was part of one huge group: people working themselves to the bone who were getting screwed by billionaires and corporations—regardless of party or state or race or ethnicity. Regardless, even, of whether they are workers or the owners of farms or small businesses. Populism is not an indictment, but an opportunity. Focusing on the conflict between the haves and the have-nots is not divisive; it’s a way to build coalitions with astonishing potential. Our nation’s first antitrust law was passed at the demand of small farmers bled dry by the railroads and grain elevators. But when Ohio’s John Sherman stood on the floor of the Senate to call for its passage in 1890, he didn’t just do it for the Grangers. He also talked about labor. The trust “commands the price of labor without fear of strikes,” he declared, “for in its field it allows no competitors.” When the law was abused to crack down on strikers, Samuel Gompers mobilized the American Federation of Labor and won corrections in the 1914 Clayton Act to try to guarantee them that right, while tightening other loopholes that John Rockefeller and the other robber barons had exploited. Gompers called the law a “Magna Carta for labor.” Then in 1936, small-town grocers came in to press for and win a separate law to stop the incipient A&P grocery chain—ancestor of the modern big-box stores—from cutting secret deals with their suppliers that slashed prices for A&P while marking them up for the little guys. Our anti-monopoly laws exist because of the work of farmers, labor unions, and country grocers. If that seems like an unlikely bunch, consider that Minnesota still does not have a “Democratic” party, but rather a Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, because of a resurgence of that coalition 30 years after the Sherman Act. Consider that the pharmacy deserts in Appalachia are caused by the same ruthless middlemen who create those deserts in Philadelphia. I know, because a session I had with the Philadelphia pharmacists was nearly identical to one I’d had in Charleston. The same goes for independent grocers. The people in Pine Ridge, South Dakota, live in an incipient food desert for the same reason that the people of downtown North Tulsa do: The government stopped enforcing the 1936 law (it was called the Robinson-Patman Act). And when we start enforcing it again, poor people in small towns and big cities—people told every day that they have nothing in common—will benefit in equal measure. I feel the potential for those fights anytime I hear how some conservatives talk about the tenure of Lina Khan, whom I served alongside when she was chair of the Federal Trade Commission. I felt it when I talked to people about my job. I had a favorite kind of conversation as a commissioner. I had some version of it at least three or four times. It was when a MAGA conservative asked me—a certified “left-wing activist,” “provocateur,” “bomb-thrower,” and “extremist”—to quote my friend Ted Cruz: What exactly is it you do in government? I would tell anyone who asked that I was investigating the pharmacy middlemen who were shutting down independent pharmacies across rural and urban America. I’d tell them I was suing Amazon for screwing over small retailers. I’d tell them I was making sure that the biggest grocery store in town doesn’t buy the next biggest grocery store in town—which will make eggs even more expensive and union negotiations even harder. I’d tell them I was trying to let gig workers organize so that Uber and Lyft and DoorDash couldn’t lie to them or cheat them out of their pay. I’d tell them I was suing landlords who pack rent bills with hidden fees. I definitely told them that we were trying to end that horrible thing where you sign up for something online but can only cancel on the phone before 4 p.m., after 45 minutes on hold. And usually, by that point, the conversation had changed. Their suspicion had turned into cautious interest, maybe even excitement. Undocumented people have become the new American underclass: good enough to pick our crops, bus our tables, and build our buildings—not good enough for us to protect their life or liberty, let alone their pursuit of happiness. There are many reasons for this. Some are legal. A lot of it is anger. I understand where some of the anger comes from. Take the construction industry. A generation of working-class kids grew up watching their dads provide for their families by working construction. They were hard jobs, but they were good ones. You could buy a house, send your kid to college, maybe even buy a boat for the weekends. Now, those jobs pay a fraction of what they used to. And those kids are now adults, voting adults, and they see those jobs occupied by men from Central and South America, many of whom are undocumented. What would it look like to confront undocumented immigration not as a left-right issue, but as a conflict between billionaires and working people? Maybe we focus less on the tension between undocumented people and the native-born workers that they seem to displace. Maybe we focus more on the billionaire developers who pretended that the people they hired were “independent contractors,” turning what used to be middle-class jobs into subsistence work, while also making it easier to hire and exploit undocumented laborers. Maybe we ask ourselves: Who gets rich from that? Is it the guy working in 100-degree heat with no water? Or is it the guy downing a steak while toasting his new development? Maybe we try to become skeptical of the idea that the least powerful people are the most responsible for our problems. Maybe we punch up instead of punching the neighbor. Nowadays, I think a lot about what’s happened to Ábrego García. The media has rightly focused on the outpouring of support for an apprentice sheet metal worker and his young family in Beltsville, Maryland. They are right to focus on the courthouse protests. They made a difference. But I have been moved by a different scene, which occurred in early April in a Washington, D.C., conference hall filled with electricians, ironworkers, and other tradespeople, members of the North America’s Building Trades Unions, where Ábrego García’s union is an affiliate. In this scene, NABTU president Sean McGarvey stands in front of his members, and says: We need to make our voices heard. We’re not red, we’re not blue. We’re the building trades, the backbone of America. You want to build a $5 billion data center? Want more six-figure careers with health care, retirement, and no college debt? You don’t call Elon Musk. You call us! [...] And yeah, that means all of us—all of us! Including our brother, SMART apprentice Kilmar Ábrego García, who we demand to be returned to us and his family now. He slams his fist on the podium. “Bring him home!” he shouts, as the audience gets out of their seats for a standing ovation. And that, to me, feels like the future. Alvaro M. Bedoya served as a federal trade commissioner from 2022 until President Trump fired him in March.

Title: How I Became a Populist

I got the call a little before 5 p.m. on a Friday. My wife, Sima, and I were sitting on the couch with our kids, probably watching Curious George. The White House vetting process had gone on for months. Yet, despite the Zooms and document requests and endless online forms, I had a strange certainty that I ultimately would not be selected. “You’ve said … a lot of stuff,” observed the twentysomething staffer who got my file. The end of the day Friday is when Washington takes out the trash. It’s when you push out the bad news so it’s old news by Monday’s news cycle. So when the call came in, I looked at my phone, looked at Sima, and dismissively said as I stood to take the call something like: “Ah. This is the White House saying they’re not picking me.” Indeed, until the precise moment the words came out of the phone—“President Biden is going to nominate you to the Federal Trade Commission on Monday”—I remained convinced it was never going to happen. But it did. By that point, in September 2021, I’d spent most of my career working for two causes: privacy and immigrant rights. I stood up the Senate privacy subcommittee for Senator Al Franken and organized oversight hearings into Google and Apple and Facebook and the National Security Agency. I started the D.C. area’s first college scholarship that was blind to immigration status. As a law professor, I built a team that figured out how Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, finds people it wants to deport by pooling and mining their gas, water, and electric bills. I also served on the board of CASA, an extraordinary immigrant rights group that calls Kilmar Ábrego García a dues-paying member. I denounced the Trump administration’s decision to separate parents from their children at the border. I called ICE an “out of control domestic surveillance agency.” I even called the president a racist on social media. I got confirmed by the skin of my crooked teeth. It didn’t matter that I had deep experience on privacy—a core issue in the FTC’s consumer protection work. No Republican voted for me in the Senate Commerce Committee. No Republican voted for me on the floor of the Senate either. Vice President Kamala Harris had to travel to the Capitol to cast a tie-breaking vote in my favor—three times. One Republican senator told me why. We’d just had a long conversation about what social media was doing to teenagers’ mental health, and what I wanted to do about it. “I like you,” he said. “I look forward to working with you. But I can’t vote for you because of what you said about the president.” I came into office an unabashed advocate for immigrants. I left office the same way. But while that hasn’t changed, after three years as a commissioner, the way I look at the world has. I used to think that the defining fight for our country was between the left and the right. Now, I am much more worried about the money at the top crushing everyone underneath. That sounds grim because it is. But I also think this perspective can unite our country in a way that feels almost impossible today. When you are confirmed to the FTC, after you get your badge and keys and figure out your computer, the conference invitations start chiming in your inbox: Aspen, Brussels, Vegas, Davos. I declined those invites. My first trip was to Charleston, West Virginia. I had spent a lot of time during my confirmation process trying to teach myself about the pharmaceutical supply chain, and the way it affected pharmacies in rural and urban America. Along the way, I spent some time on the phone with Lynne Fruth, the second-generation owner of an independent pharmacy chain in Appalachia. She told me about how insurance companies were using intermediaries called “pharmacy benefit managers” to systematically steer lucrative prescriptions to their own mail-order pharmacies—not the ones that were convenient for their patients. I later read a West Virginia state insurance commissioner’s report about a family who had almost been turned away from a local pharmacy. Their child was sick with cancer. The pharmacy had the right medicine in stock. But an insurance company middleman told them to go home and wait up to two weeks for the medicine to arrive in the mail. So one night, after feeding the kids dinner, I got in my car and drove out to meet Fruth. As I left my house in Rockville, I turned on a podcast whose sole purpose was to explain the acronym soup of pharmaceutical pricing: “WAC,” “MAC,” “NADAC.” It got me well past Harper’s Ferry—more than an hour away. The next morning, in an office park just outside of Charleston, a roomful of independent pharmacists told me about the bizarre “negotiations” with those middlemen. Any wins were made on the phone. But the middlemen could undo those concessions at any time via fax. The pharmacists described being “audited” by those middlemen. Somehow, they were always fined by those same middlemen for noncompliance. And now, drug reimbursements from those insurers were going through the floor. In the pandemic, those independent pharmacists had vaccinated thousands of people, often in the poorest and most isolated areas unserved by national pharmacy chains. Their customers had heard all sorts of things about the vaccine online or on television. But they trusted their local pharmacists. Now, those independent pharmacies were closing, one after another. One pharmacist said, with a sad laugh, that he had started selling Jack Daniel’s just to keep the lights on. Toward the end of our session, a retired accountant named Jim Rossi started to speak. He had joined the meeting at Fruth’s request. He ticked through his daily routine of 15 pills for nine medicines treating three autoimmune disorders and a heart condition that required a pacemaker. He then told me what it was like to get all that via mail-order pharmacy. “It takes about a week to resolve any kind of a small issue with them,” he said. “Then, it takes them another week to fill the prescription. Then after that additional week wait, they ship the medication to me.” That took another three days to a week. His specialist had warned him to stick with the same manufacturer for each prescription. That’s not what came in the mail. “I open up the bottle, and there are three different colors of pills in it, which tells me there’s three different manufacturers in that bottle.” But there was one drug, for his Crohn’s disease, that the mail-order pharmacy filled unfailingly fast and in advance. He sometimes had a nine-month supply in a drawer at home. That one cost $1,000 a month. My second trip on the job was to Des Moines, where I met with nine corn growers and cattlemen in a hotel conference room on the sidelines of a law enforcement conference. The session was organized by my adviser, Max Miller, who had just left a job as an Iowa assistant attorney general to join my staff. This was the meat and potatoes of Max’s practice. I felt out of place in a suit and an N-95 mask. That went away when they started talking. Every person described a situation in which corporate power was squeezing them. They used to have any number of vendors to buy their seeds from; now there were two. The suppliers of all their inputs—feed, fertilizer, pesticides, you name it—had slowly consolidated and were jacking up prices. The ag industry was known for relentless innovation. “We doubled our yields in a generation,” the farmers said. But now, the companies weren’t focused on research and development. “They’re using their wealth to buy their competitors,” they said. The ranchers used to have any number of places to process their cattle. Now, a lot of them had just one meatpacking plant accessible to them. When you have just one place to sell your livestock, no one competes to buy it. What the processor pays is what you get. They used to fix their own tractors. Now, John Deere locked down its software, forcing them to take those tractors to a company dealership. “It’s like getting picked apart by a chicken,” said one of them. Said another: “We have a noose around our necks, and we’re standing on an ice cube.” But the problem went beyond income. When there’s just one processor, you have to get to that processor regardless of how far it is. Cattle die in the heat of the drive. And when that processor closes—as many did during Covid—there’s nowhere else to take your livestock. One rancher had to gas his hogs, dig ditches, and hire high schoolers “to fill holes with dead hogs.” Another rancher told me about how his one processor treated his animals. A cow had slipped upon arrival at the lot. She was injured and could not regain her footing. The rancher begged staff to let him take her home to heal, but that request was denied. No livestock could leave the premises. She was attached to a log chain, dragged out of the trailer, killed with a bolt to the head, and thrown in a dumpster. One of the last places I visited as a commissioner was a community center in a small park in Miami’s Little Havana. It was after sunset in early April, but it was already 80 degrees and muggy. Amid the sounds of creaking swings and little kids cutting their bikes through the playground, a dozen men trickled into the room after finishing construction and landscaping shifts in the Miami region, home to Jeff Bezos, billionaire hedge fund manager Ken Griffin, and over a hundred centimillionaires. Most of them were in their twenties and thirties. They wore baseball caps and crisp T-shirts. They looked like they had gone home, showered, and walked into the room a few moments later. They were tired. I expected their main problem to be that they didn’t get unemployment insurance, workers’ compensation, or overtime. And I was right to a point. They didn’t. Even though they showed up at work and did what they were told, how they were told, and when they were told to do it, their bosses deemed them “independent contractors”—independent business owners, not W-2 employees. (I later heard an interview with an organizer who said he met workers who didn’t even know what overtime was—they’d never heard of it. “No saben que cosa es ‘overtime,’” he said.) But that wasn’t their main complaint. Their main complaint was that they didn’t get water. I did not expect that. “Maybe there’s a thermos that’s filled with water that’s not potable,” said an organizer from WeCount!, the group that called the meeting. “Maybe there’s a thermos that’s covered in mold.” One of the men worked for hours in over 100-degree heat while staring at a cooler—his only source of bottled water. The cooler was locked. The prior year, a 47-year-old worker had died while remodeling a multimillion-dollar home in Coral Gables. The heat index was 104. A Tampa Bay Times investigation found that 37 outdoor workers died from heat-related causes in Florida over the past decade, “some just hundreds of feet from air conditioning and running water.” Federal safety inspectors were nowhere to be found. “There’s no water. There’s no harness training. We’ll go a month without the most minimum contact with OSHA”—the Occupational Safety and Health Administration—said a painter named Ronny. What if he complained to his employer? Most of the workers were undocumented, Ronny explained. “When you ask for the law, you lose your job.” So, the workers had gone to the county commission, and they succeeded in securing the passage of a law mandating water breaks for local construction sites. Six days after we met, Republican Governor Ron DeSantis blocked the ordinance. My second-to-last trip was to New York City, where I met with rideshare drivers gathered in a lecture hall at Fordham Law School near Lincoln Center. There were about 20 or 25 of them. They described being lured by promises of lucrative earnings accompanied by near-total control of their schedules. Many of them invested tens of thousands of dollars in new vehicles so they could get the best fares. A lot of them had a good experience; some had had it good for years. But recently, the apps started locking them out at seemingly random times of day. The first driver I heard from was named Mohamed Mohamed. He had maintained a five-star rating and a 100 percent acceptance rate over 21,000 rides and nine years of driving. At the start, he liked that the companies called him a “partner.” “You’re a partner for us,” he recalled them telling him. Now, “I take three trips, I stop to go to the bathroom, and I’m locked out for the end of the day,” he said. He was in $2,000 of credit card debt. And he now had to drive 12 hours to earn what he previously earned in four. Then another driver sat down to speak. I didn’t catch his name; I noticed he was shaking. His wife had died unexpectedly that morning. But he had been inexplicably kicked off the apps altogether with no explanation. He showed up anyway, because someone in government was finally going to listen to him. “This is not fair,” he yelled. “And I need the account back on to go to work. Because the city provided me a license to work, to be a good citizen. I am.” He was crying. “I do everything. Pandemic, I work. Snow, I work. Why I cannot live like a decent people?” The despair in this country is far deeper than most of us understand. It’s worse than that, actually: It’s so pervasive that we don’t even see it. It’s become normal. In the wealthiest country on Earth, it’s normal for people who are diagnosed with cancer to set up a web page to beg their friends and family for money. It’s normal for those people to go bankrupt. Getting sick is the most normal reason to go bankrupt. In a country that celebrates farmers, it’s normal for those farmers to kill themselves at a rate far beyond the rest of the population. At a time when billionaires compete to launch rockets into space, it’s normal—completely normal—for construction workers to die of heat and thirst. Many liberals remain baffled that America elected Donald Trump. They genuinely have no idea how he could have won the election. I don’t think that Trump won because of “wokeism” or the “trans agenda,” whatever that is. I think he won by speaking to that despair and telling people that he alone could fix it. His tirades against China and “illegals”? Some people listened to them and heard bigotry and xenophobia. I heard it, too. But more people heard a guy talking about how he was going to help them make rent. At least enough people to win the election. My time as a commissioner changed the way I saw things. I always suspected that despite Trump’s promises to cap credit card fees and slash prices and bring manufacturing back home, all of it would more or less amount to nothing. So far, other than temporarily reducing taxes on tips, that’s pretty much what’s happened. Instead, we face looming health care and childcare cuts for millions, a slowdown in manufacturing, and on-again-off-again tariffs indexed to whether a country will nominate Donald Trump for a Nobel Prize. Chaos and cruelty don’t pay the rent. But I expected all that. What I did not expect was that over time, people I’d seen as bold progressives started to look quite different. I always thought of Colorado Governor Jared Polis as a pathbreaker: the first openly gay man and first Jewish person elected governor in the state. Now, all I can think about is how he vetoed a law that would make it dramatically easier for people in Colorado to form a union … and a law that would have barred landlords from using algorithms to collude on rent hikes … and a law, passed unanimously in the state legislature, to end surprise ambulance bills … in two weeks. I always liked how Illinois Governor JB Pritzker stood up for the little guy: for undocumented people, for trans kids. I love how he seems genuinely unafraid of this president. But it’s harder to see him in the same light after watching him veto a bill that would have protected workers at Amazon warehouses—where injuries are so frequent that the company puts vending machines on its warehouse floors that dispense not potato chips, but painkillers. Why can’t Pritzker fight for the people in warehousing? Perhaps my biggest change is in how I think about what’s happening with ICE. The masked police, the flash renditions, the swamp gulag—we now live in the dystopia that we were loudly warned about during the president’s first term. But when I see police tackle a teenager with a baby’s teething toy in her hand, when I see them peel a child off of her dad’s arm at the courthouse, or cuff a shrieking mother saying she needs to get her kids from school, my first thought is not to “immigrant rights.” No. Now, I can’t stop thinking about the lawyer in a hand-stitched suit sitting at my old FTC conference table, telling me, over 70 minutes and a 30-page PowerPoint, how it could not possibly be in the interest of the United States government to sue her corporate client. And I’m not talking about one particular case; I’m talking about all of them. When the federal government does things like investigate a corporate landlord for packing rent checks with fake charges, or an oil executive allegedly trying to “align U.S. oil production with OPEC,” or pharmacy middlemen accused of trying to raise the price of insulin—it’s sternly worded letters, PDF white papers, and multiple hour-long meetings where the company gets to tell us what we got wrong. That’s standard process. But when you’re a cleaning lady whose papers aren’t right? It’s five men in bulletproof vests on your doorstep, and your four-year-old crumpled in your arms begging “no quiero please, please, please.” It’s an agent saying, “I’m sorry, but I don’t have any choice.” And that difference enrages me. Soon after taking office, Trump’s designated chairman of the FTC, Andrew Ferguson, announced that the agency would “usher in a new Golden Age for American businesses, workers, and consumers.” What has followed has been a Golden Age for the C-suite. The ban on noncompete clauses that keep everyone from pediatric surgeons to Jimmy John’s sandwich-makers in dead-end positions, or keep them from working entirely? Not worth defending in court. The rule banning companies from doing that thing where they sign you up for a subscription online, but only let you unsubscribe over the phone? Enforcement delayed to mid-July to give companies “ample time” to comply … and the federal court a window to strike it down. The order barring that oil executive from the board of Exxon? Undone. He’s free and clear to join. A similar scene unfolded 10 blocks west at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The bank that was systematically hitting service members with surprise overdraft fees and forced to send them $80 million in refunds? Don’t have to pay them back anymore. The lawsuit against a Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary that allegedly tricked people into taking out loans for mobile homes when they had $57.78 in discretionary income? Gone. As everyone knows, these are just the lowlights. What people may not know is how thoroughly unprepared we are for this reality. Picture the inauguration. If the president tries to illegally deport you or illegally strip you of your voting rights or (ahem) illegally fire you, there are dozens of nonprofits that can step up to defend you in court, free of cost. Many struggle to make payroll. Some have tens of millions of dollars in the bank. The American Civil Liberties Union has $829 million. But what if the billionaires over the president’s shoulder hurt you? If they use legal loopholes to deny you health care? If they dock or block your pay for no apparent reason? If they buy all of your buyers so that only they buy your goods, and they set the price? If they use their market power not to outcompete you, but to bully you out of the market? There are maybe a handful of national nonprofit organizations that will represent you pro bono. And the ACLU fights the government, not the oligarchs. This all-encompassing focus on fighting government overreach may have made sense when our tax system actually taxed the rich, when union membership was at an all-time high, and when CEO earnings were not a vulgarity. Now, Fortune 500 firms regularly pay zero dollars in taxes. Unions protect just one in 10 workers. And CEOs parade like modern-day Roman emperors, in private jets, to private islands, with their private Praetorian firefighters and guards. And all of this is happening when the government agencies built to check corporate power are being torn apart. My daughter likes me to watch her gymnastics class. Let me try that again. My daughter really doesn’t like it when I stare at my phone during her gymnastics class. She has her mother’s strength. So when she makes it around the uneven bars a little faster than her peers, the first thing she does is shoot me a look. If I’m looking at my phone, that’s a big “L” for dad. And so, on a Tuesday this March, when I got a call a few moments after arriving at the gym from my colleague, Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, asking, “Hey, have you checked your email?”—I proudly said I had not! “Well, I just got an email from the White House saying they were firing me. You should probably check yours.” Sure enough, I had an email from someone named Trent Morse informing me that the president was firing me, effective immediately. Curiously, Morse did not claim I had neglected my duties or misused my authority; he went out of his way to not give a reason for the firing. That was a problem—for them. Because the Supreme Court had said, 90 years earlier, that the president could only remove an FTC commissioner “for cause.” The court said that unanimously. Suddenly, we had to answer a really weird question really quickly: If the president says you’re fired, but the Supreme Court says he can’t fire you, did you get fired? Or did you not get fired? Becca and I decided we did not get fired. We would keep doing our jobs. We’d keep on taking meetings, issuing statements, testifying before Congress. And we thought we should be loud about it. I called Sima, and my chief of staff. Then I put out a statement saying that the president was trying to turn the FTC, a fierce corporate watchdog, into “a lapdog for his golfing buddies.” The calls started. The New York Times, Bloomberg, a producer for Chris Hayes. My daughter got out of class, and I told her I’d been fired. She gave me a hug, got in the car, and asked if she could watch her favorite Lego builder on YouTube. FTC staff started calling. Then, more reporters. Ten minutes into the drive home, a little voice in the back seat piped up, “Papa, why are we going this way?” I was missing turns from the notifications on my screen, then missing more turns when my phone, which kept on dinging, was slow to update the map. When we finally got home, I recorded a video to explain how this wasn’t about hurting me, but about helping the men at the inauguration—Musk, Bezos, Zuckerberg, Pichai. Between the two of us, Becca and I had sued, or were actively suing, each of the men’s companies. And we were weeks from a federal trial against Meta. We did a virtual press conference with some senators and congressmen; I did more interviews after that. A little before midnight, there was a knock at our door. Domino’s. It was my first break since 5 p.m., and I was grateful for what I thought was a gesture from a friend who knew I’d be up late. I opened the box: meat lover’s, loaded with bacon. We don’t do bacon. I asked the delivery guy if he’d gotten a tip—he said no—so I started trying to find an app to pay him, when he spoke up to say, “Well, ah, sir, you still haven’t paid for the pizza.” That’s when we realized that the pizza was not from a friend. It was from someone, somewhere, telling me they knew where I lived. The days and weeks ping-ponged between the thrill of being able to publicly denounce what was happening to our agency—and the dull fear a parent feels when things are not right for their family. I hold virtual roundtables with rideshare drivers in Denver, fishermen from Maine, and small retailers in Massachusetts—someone tries to take out a half-million-dollar line of credit in my name. I speak at the Bernie and AOC rally in Denver; I scream so loud I pull a muscle in my neck. I realize we can’t buy a house on a single income, even though we’d been planning a move for months. Commissioner Slaughter and I quickly sued to block the attempt to remove us. The financial ramifications of the legal fight started to set in. Sima and I looked at our accounts and figured we could afford about three months for it to play out. The three-month mark approached with no ruling from the judge. So I decided to call the guys in Iowa. My very last visit as a commissioner was to a family farm in Ankeny, just north of Des Moines. It was scheduled for a Saturday morning in June. Going in, I knew that by Monday, unless I woke up to a ruling reinstating me, I’d issue a statement formally resigning as a commissioner, letting me start to look for a new job. Max, my former adviser, put me up at his house the night before. We woke up and went to the farmer’s market with his new wife and their now five kids. I got a coffee and a kielbasa. We drove up to Ankeny. The Iowa Farmers Union had organized a listening session at a fifth-generation diversified farm that grew corn, soybeans, oats, and alfalfa, along with a range of livestock. The owner, LaVon Griffieon, had attended that first meeting; so had a few others in the audience. This time, I was able to talk about our lawsuit against two pesticides manufacturers that were trying to push cheaper generics off the market, as well as about our lawsuit, filed just that January, against John Deere for locking down its software. The group was kind to me. They appreciated it, they said. But so many of their stories were the same that they were three years earlier. A corn and soybean grower said that fertilizer prices were moving in lockstep, such that the moment the farmers finally saw some profit, prices would go up and erase those profits. “Iowans like to claim they feed the world,” said Griffieon. “But the pandemic proved to us with bare store shelves that Iowa can’t even feed Iowa very easily.” A half-hour in, there was a speaker I hadn’t met—a tall, young farmer with long hair, also fifth-generation, named Sean Dengler. On the first day of the winter harvest, he had gotten up and turned on the combine. It roared, then whimpered, then went into “limp mode.” The circuit board was fried, and only John Deere could fix it. Sean’s father called the dealership right away, but the technician took hours to get there. A line of other farmers had called in first. The soybeans were already dry, and it was hot and windy. So they paid extra for the part to be delivered the next day; and again paid extra for the second visit. “We lost time waiting, which meant lost yield potential,” he said. “And we lost money because John Deere could charge us more because that is their business plan.” Our lawsuit was a few months too late. It was Sean’s last harvest. “Both of my grandparents were farmers,” he said. “I’m the last Dengler to ever farm in Tama County.” The session lasted another hour. I had lunch at a Mexican restaurant with the union president, his vice president, an ag reporter, and Josh Manske, a board member from Algona, Iowa. The lunch lasted about an hour. And that was it. I was done. Josh and I met Max in a park back in Des Moines, got some beers, and found an empty picnic table. We talked about Max’s blended family. I thanked Josh for hosting a liminal FTC commissioner. We laughed about that. We talked about the session. While a lot of things had come up, I kept coming back to Sean Dengler. Then, I thought about those rideshare drivers in New York City. It may not look this way at first, but the Iowa farmer who can’t run his combine because of a farm equipment monopoly has a heck of a lot in common with the Bangladeshi dad who can’t work the morning commute because he’s locked out by Uber and Lyft. If you focus on the conflict between left and right, if the most important thing is what you are—your party, your state, your race, your ethnicity—the people I met could not be more different. On the one hand, you have rural, white small-business owners, generations into building a life in this country. On the other, you have urban Latino, Haitian, African, and South Asian immigrants, every one of them a worker. The line between them is sharp, almost tribal. What could they possibly have in common? Everything—if you look at what they need. The people I met as a commissioner may look different, but what they need is surprisingly the same: They need a government that gives them a level playing field against the powerful and wealthy. They need the courts to check corporations when they abuse that power and wealth. They need basic dignity and control in their material lives. Looking at things that way, everyone I met was part of one huge group: people working themselves to the bone who were getting screwed by billionaires and corporations—regardless of party or state or race or ethnicity. Regardless, even, of whether they are workers or the owners of farms or small businesses. Populism is not an indictment, but an opportunity. Focusing on the conflict between the haves and the have-nots is not divisive; it’s a way to build coalitions with astonishing potential. Our nation’s first antitrust law was passed at the demand of small farmers bled dry by the railroads and grain elevators. But when Ohio’s John Sherman stood on the floor of the Senate to call for its passage in 1890, he didn’t just do it for the Grangers. He also talked about labor. The trust “commands the price of labor without fear of strikes,” he declared, “for in its field it allows no competitors.” When the law was abused to crack down on strikers, Samuel Gompers mobilized the American Federation of Labor and won corrections in the 1914 Clayton Act to try to guarantee them that right, while tightening other loopholes that John Rockefeller and the other robber barons had exploited. Gompers called the law a “Magna Carta for labor.” Then in 1936, small-town grocers came in to press for and win a separate law to stop the incipient A&P grocery chain—ancestor of the modern big-box stores—from cutting secret deals with their suppliers that slashed prices for A&P while marking them up for the little guys. Our anti-monopoly laws exist because of the work of farmers, labor unions, and country grocers. If that seems like an unlikely bunch, consider that Minnesota still does not have a “Democratic” party, but rather a Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, because of a resurgence of that coalition 30 years after the Sherman Act. Consider that the pharmacy deserts in Appalachia are caused by the same ruthless middlemen who create those deserts in Philadelphia. I know, because a session I had with the Philadelphia pharmacists was nearly identical to one I’d had in Charleston. The same goes for independent grocers. The people in Pine Ridge, South Dakota, live in an incipient food desert for the same reason that the people of downtown North Tulsa do: The government stopped enforcing the 1936 law (it was called the Robinson-Patman Act). And when we start enforcing it again, poor people in small towns and big cities—people told every day that they have nothing in common—will benefit in equal measure. I feel the potential for those fights anytime I hear how some conservatives talk about the tenure of Lina Khan, whom I served alongside when she was chair of the Federal Trade Commission. I felt it when I talked to people about my job. I had a favorite kind of conversation as a commissioner. I had some version of it at least three or four times. It was when a MAGA conservative asked me—a certified “left-wing activist,” “provocateur,” “bomb-thrower,” and “extremist”—to quote my friend Ted Cruz: What exactly is it you do in government? I would tell anyone who asked that I was investigating the pharmacy middlemen who were shutting down independent pharmacies across rural and urban America. I’d tell them I was suing Amazon for screwing over small retailers. I’d tell them I was making sure that the biggest grocery store in town doesn’t buy the next biggest grocery store in town—which will make eggs even more expensive and union negotiations even harder. I’d tell them I was trying to let gig workers organize so that Uber and Lyft and DoorDash couldn’t lie to them or cheat them out of their pay. I’d tell them I was suing landlords who pack rent bills with hidden fees. I definitely told them that we were trying to end that horrible thing where you sign up for something online but can only cancel on the phone before 4 p.m., after 45 minutes on hold. And usually, by that point, the conversation had changed. Their suspicion had turned into cautious interest, maybe even excitement. Undocumented people have become the new American underclass: good enough to pick our crops, bus our tables, and build our buildings—not good enough for us to protect their life or liberty, let alone their pursuit of happiness. There are many reasons for this. Some are legal. A lot of it is anger. I understand where some of the anger comes from. Take the construction industry. A generation of working-class kids grew up watching their dads provide for their families by working construction. They were hard jobs, but they were good ones. You could buy a house, send your kid to college, maybe even buy a boat for the weekends. Now, those jobs pay a fraction of what they used to. And those kids are now adults, voting adults, and they see those jobs occupied by men from Central and South America, many of whom are undocumented. What would it look like to confront undocumented immigration not as a left-right issue, but as a conflict between billionaires and working people? Maybe we focus less on the tension between undocumented people and the native-born workers that they seem to displace. Maybe we focus more on the billionaire developers who pretended that the people they hired were “independent contractors,” turning what used to be middle-class jobs into subsistence work, while also making it easier to hire and exploit undocumented laborers. Maybe we ask ourselves: Who gets rich from that? Is it the guy working in 100-degree heat with no water? Or is it the guy downing a steak while toasting his new development? Maybe we try to become skeptical of the idea that the least powerful people are the most responsible for our problems. Maybe we punch up instead of punching the neighbor. Nowadays, I think a lot about what’s happened to Ábrego García. The media has rightly focused on the outpouring of support for an apprentice sheet metal worker and his young family in Beltsville, Maryland. They are right to focus on the courthouse protests. They made a difference. But I have been moved by a different scene, which occurred in early April in a Washington, D.C., conference hall filled with electricians, ironworkers, and other tradespeople, members of the North America’s Building Trades Unions, where Ábrego García’s union is an affiliate. In this scene, NABTU president Sean McGarvey stands in front of his members, and says: We need to make our voices heard. We’re not red, we’re not blue. We’re the building trades, the backbone of America. You want to build a $5 billion data center? Want more six-figure careers with health care, retirement, and no college debt? You don’t call Elon Musk. You call us! [...] And yeah, that means all of us—all of us! Including our brother, SMART apprentice Kilmar Ábrego García, who we demand to be returned to us and his family now. He slams his fist on the podium. “Bring him home!” he shouts, as the audience gets out of their seats for a standing ovation. And that, to me, feels like the future. Alvaro M. Bedoya served as a federal trade commissioner from 2022 until President Trump fired him in March.

Title: Exclusive: JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon on AI, gold, tariffs, and crypto

Diane Brady is an award-winning business journalist and author who has interviewed newsmakers worldwide and often speaks about the global business landscape. As executive editorial director of the Fortune CEO Initiative, she brings together a growing community of global business leaders through conversations, content, and connections. She is also executive editorial director of Fortune Live Media and interviews newsmakers for the magazine and the CEO Daily newsletter. I wasn’t surprised to see JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon on stage yesterday at Fortune’s Most Powerful Women Summit. I’ve interviewed several women leaders over the years—TIAA CEO Thasunda Brown Duckett, Travelers Chief Marketing Officer Lisa Caputo, Mary Callahan Erdoes, who runs JPMorgan Chase’s Asset & Wealth Management, and veteran finance executive Heidi Miller, among others—who consider Dimon an important mentor. Women make up half of JPMorgan’s board and seven of the 13 members of its operating committee. Dimon spoke with Fortune editor-in-chief Alyson Shontell about topics ranging from AI to blockchain, which you can read about here and here. Fresh from reporting a banner quarter, the bank chief expounded on AI, gold, regulation, jobs, tariffs, debt, government waste, New York’s mayoral race, and “the need to keep the Western world together economically.” You can check out the full interview here. And here’s what I’ve gleaned from attendees, when it comes to Dimon’s mentorship approach: Bet on Winners: Dimon helps people who’ve earned his respect and trust, whether it’s hiring people like Miller at multiple companies or advising Duckett during her inaugural year as CEO of TIAA. That instinct isn’t limited to women: Wells Fargo’s Charlie Scharf comes to mind. Dimon says he’s guided by performance, not gender or loyalty. To do otherwise, in his view, is a disservice to the team. Share your network: Lisa Caputo met Dimon after he’d been fired from Citigroup and she had just arrived there. As she put it yesterday: “I was trying to build a women’s business from scratch. Every time Jamie would call, he would give me the names of three people to talk to inside the company, and he would also ask me what I’d learned so far. Through my conversations with him, he was literally helping me shape what the business model could look like.” Go Beyond Borders: Anyone who launches a $1.5 trillion initiative is seeking a purpose beyond their own company. After almost two decades as CEO, Dimon expects ambitious people may leave. Part of his job is to help good people become better leaders wherever they go. The world needs more of them. Relationships matter. And having friends in far places helps a leader learn.Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com Why the U.S. Supreme Court might keep Trump’s tariffs On their face, President Trump’s trade tariffs are illegal because Congress did not approve them and because routine trade is not the “emergency” that Trump claims. But the U.S. Supreme Court may rule to leave them in place anyway because of the logistical difficulty of undoing them, according to former Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar. “The government is coming to court and saying, ‘We would have to unwind billions or trillions of dollars. It could bankrupt our nation,’” she said. Trump considers cooking oil ban for China “I believe that China purposefully not buying our Soybeans, and causing difficulty for our Soybean Farmers, is an Economically Hostile Act. We are considering terminating business with China having to do with Cooking Oil, and other elements of Trade, as retribution. As an example, we can easily produce Cooking Oil ourselves, we don’t need to purchase it from China,” the president said on Truth Social. Investors took it as a signal that there would be no immediate compromise in the trade war, sending the S&P 500 down 0.16% on the day. Trump preps list of programs he will eliminate The U.S. government shutdown shows no sign of coming to an end. Yesterday the president said he was drawing up a list of “egregious socialist, semi-communist” government programs that he would eliminate permanently if Democrats in Congress don’t help him pass his spending bill. “We're closing up programs ... that we wanted to close up or that we never wanted to happen,” Trump said. “We're not going to let them come back.” Dimon issues private credit warning: “When you see one cockroach, there are probably more” JPMorgan Chase wrote off $170 million in debt it was owed in the collapse of auto parts supply company First Brands, the company reported in its Q3 earnings call, and JPM CEO Jamie Dimon warned there may be more cracks in the private credit markets to come: “I probably shouldn’t say this, but when you see one cockroach, there are probably more. Everyone should be forewarned on this one.” Apollo Global Management chief Marc Rowan also warned of “late-cycle accidents” but Blackstone president Jonathan Gray said it was not a systemic problem. Powell hints at further rate cuts In a speech on Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell hinted that the institution is likely to cut rates again as a weak job market trumps inflation concerns. Policy changes may need to “take another step toward a more neutral stance,” Powell said at the National Association for Business Economics. Amazon is preparing a new round of layoffs Amazon is planning to lay off as much as 15% of the company’s human resources staff, according to sources familiar with the situation, with other departments likely to be affected as well. Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel declined to comment on the situation. Mark Cuban says employees deserve more stock Billionaire Mark Cuban wrote in a post on X that companies should be better incentivized to give shares to their employees as stock gains multiply. The post was in response to a recent report from Oxfam showing that billionaire wealth has increased by $33 trillion since 2015. Sam Altman says OpenAI will allow “erotica for verified adults” “Now that we have been able to mitigate the serious mental health issues and have new tools, we are going to be able to safely relax the restrictions in most cases,” he said. Separately, Deutsche Bank reported that subscriptions at OpenAI have “flatlined.” S&P 500 futures were up 0.47% this morning. The index closed down 0.16% in its last session. STOXX Europe 600 was up 0.53% in early trading. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 was down 0.31% in early trading. Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 1.76%. China’s CSI 300 was up 1.48%. The South Korea KOSPI was up 2.68%.

Title: Amazon likely to cut 15% jobs in new round of AI-driven layoffs: Report
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/amazon-new-round-of-ai-driven-layoffs-report-10308167/

Amazon is looking to eliminate 15 per cent of jobs from its human resources division even as the tech giant continues to aggressively invest in developing AI products and infrastructure. Internally referred to as the People Experience Technology (PXT) team, the HR division at Amazon comprises over 10,000 employees across the world, including a recruiting team, technology staff, and other HR-related roles. The upcoming round of layoffs at Amazon is expected to impact the PXT team hardest, according to a report by Fortune. Employees in other divisions involving Amazon’s core consumer business could also be affected by the layoffs, the report said. The exact number of employees that will be let go and when the layoffs are expected to happen is still unclear. The latest round of job cuts at Amazon comes amid a deteriorating job market for those in the tech sector, with several big tech companies looking to leverage AI tools in order to shrink headcounts and lower costs. While many AI-related layoffs are being framed as ‘restructuring’ efforts, big tech firms are simultaneously ramping up investments in data centres and compute to stay ahead in the AI arms race. Amazon, for instance, has earmarked over $100 billion in capital expenditures this year to build out its cloud and AI data centres. In June this year, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy had announced in a memo to its 1.5 million employees that, as the company embraces AI tools across the organisation, it will ultimately “reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains” over time. “Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company,” he wrote. At the same time, Jassy also made a point to note that there won’t be room on the bus for everyone: “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” Jassy added that generative AI will ‘change the way our work is done,’ and said the company will eventually ‘need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.’ “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company,” he further said. Taking over as CEO from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in 2021, Jassy oversaw the largest layoffs in the company’s history roughly two years ago, when Amazon cut at least 27,000 corporate jobs. Earlier this year, Amazon also laid off employees in its consumer devices unit, Wondery podcast division, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Meanwhile, the e-commerce giant also announced this week that it will be hiring over 2,50,000 seasonal employees across its warehouses and logistics networks in the US ahead of the holiday season. Omar Abdullah, former and current CM of Jammu and Kashmir, plans to join the legal fight for restoring statehood to the UT. He believes his experience makes him best suited to understand the drawbacks of being a UT. The case, with multiple petitions from citizens, was last heard on October 10.

Title: Layoff news: Amazon to slash 15% HR roles, others in new round of job cuts, says report

Amazon layoff news: E-commerce and tech giant Amazon is set to slash as much as 15 per cent roles in its human resources department, besides some other roles, in a new round of layoffs, Fortune reported citing sources. Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel declined to respond, it added. While it is expected that Amazon's HR team, known internally as the People eXperience Technology team or PTX, which has over 10,000 staff globally, will take the most cuts, other core consumer business departments could also see some impact, two sources told the publication. As per the report, these job cuts come as the giant looks to reduce employee costs amid heavy investment in artificial intelligence products and AI infrastructure. Amazon has stated it aims to spend over $100 billion capex in 2025 to build its AI data centres and cloud computing centres. These will be for sale to customers and for internal use, the report added. From late 2022 into 2023, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy signed off on at least 27,000 job cuts at Amazon — largely from its corporate offices. The period saw many large tech companies, including Meta and Google, slashing jobs. In June, Andy Jassy in a company memo stressed the importance of AI adoption to employees. “Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company,” he wrote. “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company,” he added. Amazon.com Inc. plans to hire 2,50,000 workers during its peak holiday season in full-time, part-time and seasonal roles. The company in a statement said that temporary workers will earn $19 per hour on average, and permanent roles will pay $23 per hour on average. The 2,50,000 workers on holiday hire is unchanged from the previous two years, a Bloomberg report noted.

Title: Amazon Plans To Reduce 15% Human Resources Staff, Fortune Reports

Amazon is planning to cut human resources staff by 15%, Fortune reported, citing sources. People eXperience Technology Team, human resource department of the company, will be the worst hit in the move. Core consumer business will probably to be affected by the move as well. Fortune's report did not mention how many number of employees, and when they will be laid off. Amazon's PXT division has more than 10,000 employees worldwide. The team includes a large recruiting team, plus technology staff and other traditional human resource roles, the report said. Compared to other companies, Amazon has laid off a relatively small number of people early this year. The layoffs happened in its consumer devices unit, Wondery podcast division, and in the Amazon web series. The company is looking for ways to lower employee costs while investing aggressively in artificial intelligence products and infrastructure. Amazon intends to increase the use of AI for internal use and to sell to enterprise customers, Fortune said. Amazon has planned to spend upwards of $100 billion capital expenditure this year as it builds its cloud and AI data centres, according to the report. Meanwhile, Amazon will likely add 250,000 to its workforce during its peak season, Bloomberg reported. The aggressive hiring during holiday season makes the company a standout in an otherwise bleak holiday labour market. Amazon will hire for full-time, part-time, and season roles with temporary workers earning an average of $19 per hour, Bloomberg reported, citing a statement from Amazon. Pay for permanent roles averages $23 per hour. US shoppers will likely spend $253.4 billion on online shopping during November and December, which indicates a 5.3% upside from 2024, according to Adobe Inc. However, shoppers are also planning to curb overall holiday spending because of tariff-related price increases and a weakening labour market, according to a survey released in September by PricewaterhouseCoopers, Bloomberg reported.

Title: Amazon is planning a new wave of layoffs, sources say
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/10/14/amazon-layoffs-pxt-hr-andy-jassy/
Time Published: 2025-10-15T00:52:22Z

Jason Del Rey is a technology correspondent at Fortune and a co-chair of the Fortune Brainstorm Tech and Fortune Brainstorm AI conferences. Amazon is preparing to cut as much as 15% of its human resources staff, with additional layoffs likely in other divisions, according to multiple sources familiar with the plans. Two sources told Fortune that Amazon’s human resources division—known internally as PXT or the People eXperience Technology team—will be hard-hit, but that other areas of Amazon’s core consumer business are also likely to be affected. It couldn’t be learned how many employees in total Amazon plans to let go, nor the exact timing of the cuts. The company laid off relatively small numbers of employees earlier this year in areas such as its consumer devices unit, its Wondery podcast division, and in Amazon Web Services. Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel declined to comment.Amazon’s PXT division, which reports to senior vice president Beth Galetti, has more than 10,000 employees worldwide, and includes a large recruiting team, plus technology staff and other traditional HR roles. The new cuts come as Amazon continues to look for ways to lower employee costs while investing aggressively in AI products and infrastructure—both for internal use and to sell to enterprise customers. The company has said it intends to devote upwards of $100 billion to capital expenditures this year, as it builds out its cloud and AI data centers. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy already oversaw the largest layoffs in company history from late 2022 into 2023, when the company cut at least 27,000 corporate jobs, which accounted for a high-single-digit percentage of the company’s office jobs. Many other Big Tech companies also slashed their headcounts around that time as the pandemic receded and consumer demand trends changed.Now, many employers are looking to harness the power of AI—initially for mundane and repetitive tasks and eventually for more complicated jobs—to reduce the need to maintain the same level of human staffers on their payrolls.Jassy himself is one of them. The CEO fired a bit of a warning shot to his own employees in June, when he encouraged them to welcome this new AI-powered era. “Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company,” he wrote in a companywide email that was also published on Amazon’s corporate blog. At the same time, Jassy also made a point to note that there won’t be room on the bus for everyone: “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” Jassy, who succeeded Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in the CEO job in 2021, has earned a reputation as a cost-cutter (though to be fair, he inherited a company that many say had become wasteful and bloated in some areas). Amazon executives regularly require managers to hit a certain percentage goal for unregretted attrition, or URA—essentially a percentage of employees that the company would be okay losing, whether through voluntary departures, being “managed out,” or through formal layoffs. But sources told Fortune that these cuts are being discussed in a different way internally than the typical URA process. While Amazon plans these layoffs of corporate roles, the company announced its usual holiday hiring spree of warehouse staff on Tuesday. This year, the company will hire 250,000 seasonal employees across its U.S. warehouse and logistics networks. Amazon’s stock price is down a little more than 1% this calendar year, but 15% higher than it was 12 months earlier. The company will report earnings later this month.

Title: A Paralegal’s AI Best Friend
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/the-prompt/2025/10/14/a-paralegals-ai-best-friend/
Time Published: 2025-10-14T23:45:05Z
Full Content:
ByRashi Shrivastava, Forbes Staff. Welcome back to The Prompt. About a year ago, Viraj Bindra watched as his friend’s law firm struggled with a deluge of cases, far more than it had the capacity to handle. In the end, the firm had to turn away cases that had a fair chance of winning simply because it didn’t have the bandwidth. Bindra soon learned that this is a widespread problem that impacts a lot of people: Some 77% of American households can’t access legal help when they need it, in part due to staffing shortages at law firms. “For everyday Americans, counsel is more of a luxury than a right,” he said. So Bindra, an ex-DoorDash product manager, decided to build AI software to ease that burden–and help lawyers more easily manage lots of clients. In April 2025, he launched Finch, a voice-based AI system that automates administrative tasks typically done by paralegals, such as retrieving medical records, setting up and tracking insurance claims, etc. The startup also hires its own paralegals to ensure and improve the accuracy of its product. Finch is “taking on the work that otherwise a law firm would've had to hire staff to do,” he said. The New York-based startup is selling its technology to personal injury lawyers and plaintiff firms that make money based on contingency, meaning they aren’t paid unless there’s a settlement or victory at trial. These lawyers are more incentivized to use AI than those who bill their clients hourly, as it helps their staff’s productivity and allows them to take on more cases, Bindra said. In just six months, Bindra claims his startup has seen significant revenue growth though he declined to disclose specific numbers. The company announced today it has raised $20 million in Series A funding led by Redpoint Ventures, which valued it at $100 million, according to a person familiar with the round. It’s a solid start, but Finch faces a growing cluster of competitors with startups like Harvey, Legora and EvenUp already emerging as front runners in the AI legal landscape. Meera Clark, a partner at Redpoint Ventures said Finch’s biggest differentiator is its focus on helping smaller law firms save direct labor costs. Let’s get into the headlines. BIG PLAYS Retail giant Walmart is doubling down on AI. The company announced a partnership with OpenAI that will allow users to shop for its products directly through ChatGPT. The idea is that people who are already using the tool to plan meals and find new recipes can also buy needed ingredients while they’re at it. In recent months, OpenAI has made a concerted effort to add e-commerce capabilities to ChatGPT, recently forging similar deals with Shopify and Etsy. CHIPS + COMPUTE On the heels of its massive deal with chip giant AMD, OpenAI announced yet another partnership, this time with Broadcom. Under this deal, OpenAI will design its own chips to train and run its models while Broadcom will provide infrastructure support like networking systems and custom chips for its planned buildout of 10 gigawatts worth of AI data centers. Broadcom’s shares jumped after the announcement, similar to other companies that have announced multi-billion dollar partnerships with OpenAI. CEO Sam Altman is clearly adept at crafting these deals, Bloomberg’s Matt Levine writes, by selling established companies a “world-changing vision” of the future of artificial intelligence to raise historic amounts of capital. SHOW ME THE MONEY Salesforce plans to invest $15 billion in San Francisco over the next five years to ramp up AI adoption across enterprises, the company said at its annual Dreamforce conference, though details on the investment are still unclear. The funding will be used to create an AI incubator hub on its San Francisco campus and upskill employees on how to use AI. Investors seemed unimpressed by the announcement–its share price closed down 3.6%, continuing the 28% slide it's seen so far this year. DEEP DIVE It’s been a big year for AI infrastructure deals. In just the last month, OpenAI, Oracle, Nvidia, AMD and others have announced epic transactions worth hundreds of billions of dollars. The deals are complex, unconventional—and often circular: Nvidia’s up to $100 billion investment in OpenAI, announced late last month, for instance, will allow OpenAI to purchase Nvidia GPUs to build out its own data center capacity. In a similar deal that flips who gets equity, AMD and OpenAI recently announced their own strategic partnership in which OpenAI got a warrant for up to 160 million shares of AMD common stock, or 10% of AMD’s shares, that vests in tranches based on OpenAI using 6 gigawatts of AMDs GPUs over a period of time. Behind this spate of deals is something of a stampede mentality. “The world needs much more compute,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted on X announcing the AMD deal. Altman has been trumpeting that “more compute is more important now than ever before to succeed at our mission” for years. “There's so much impatience and desire to move quickly and fear of getting left behind that there’s a very high premium on getting the most you can the fastest,” says Stella Biderman, executive director of AI nonprofit EleutherAI, which trained an open-source version of GPT-3 on CoreWeave GPUs. And that’s leading them to make these scratch-my-back deals that are literally set up to help them help one another. Thanks in large part to the big deals, valuations are skyrocketing, and the billionaire founders, executives and investors tied to the massive AI data center buildout have benefited the most. By Forbes’ count, 20 of the most notable billionaires tied to the explosive growth in AI infrastructure spending have already added more than $450 billion to their fortunes since January 1. Read the full story on Forbes. MODEL BEHAVIOR AI-powered bots accounted for around 51 percent of internet traffic in 2024. Thanks to Sora, OpenAI’s social media platform to share AI-generated videos, more AI slop is proliferating across social media, making it harder to distinguish between what’s real and what’s fake. Large language models are writing everything from tweets to blog posts to resumes while fake candidates are giving job interviews to AI agents, opening bank accounts and buying concert tickets. All that AI has led tech leaders like Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman to propound the “dead internet theory”— the idea that the internet is dominated by bots instead of humans. Once dismissed as a conspiracy theory, this may be coming true in the age of AI.

Title: This Gold Rush Is Ominous

The king of precious metals is having a good run right now. That might be a problem. Listen to more stories on the Noa app. This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here. When prices are high and global conflicts destabilize the world, some investors start looking backwards—away from an uncertain future and toward the predictability of the past. And what’s older and more dependable than gold? Last week, amid widespread geopolitical turmoil and a weakening U.S. dollar, the price of gold hit a historic high of $4,000 an ounce. This year has so far been gold’s best since 1979, a moment of instability so profound that it led to recession. Gold prices are much closer to a genuine “recession indicator” than, say, the resurgence of frozen yogurt or an uptick in Uber Eats orders. That’s because, over the past 50 years, spikes in the price of gold have typically been correlated with widespread inflation and geopolitical dysfunction. In 1979, amid double-digit inflation numbers in the United States and a global energy crisis, investors stocked up on the precious metal as a way to counter those shocks. In the years following the 2008 financial crisis, as investors lost trust in major institutions once seen as “too big to fail,” gold prices shot up again. And when persistent inflation was crushing the U.S. dollar after the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, gold once again soared. The precious metal has long been considered a safe-haven asset, because, unlike the U.S. dollar, its inherent value isn’t determined by any state government. Although it’s probably not realistic for everyone to start piling into Diamond District jewelry shops and hoarding gold bars, gold remains an appealing, if old-fashioned, alternative to more contemporary investments: Its value stems from its shine and rarity, not its ability to produce a line of credit. Some investors see gold as a standard way to diversify their portfolio. Others, stereotypically known as goldbugs, tend to be broadly skeptical about contemporary monetary policy. Just as investors in bitcoin, so-called digital gold, have historically skewed libertarian and anti-institutional, the most extreme goldbugs are betting against the system, doubtful that the Federal Reserve is capable of keeping the U.S. dollar strong. There’s also only so much of the metal lodged in the planet’s crust, compared with the dollar, which can be printed ad infinitum. At least until someone like Elon Musk figures out how to increase its supply by mining asteroids, gold will likely remain the doomer’s hedge of choice. Whereas a different sort of investor looks to get in early on promising new technological innovations, the goldbug doesn’t lose sight of what’s tried-and-true. Gold prices have already risen more than 50 percent this year and are showing no signs of stopping. The story of today’s gold boom began in 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine and Western governments decided to sanction the Russian central bank by freezing its foreign-exchange reserves. The scale of these sanctions was a reminder of why countries might want to own assets that can’t be easily frozen. Especially in emerging markets, central banks around the world “realized that the truly only safe asset” is gold, Daan Struyven, a co-head of Global Commodities Research at Goldman Sachs, told me. The whiplash of President Donald Trump’s tariff spree this spring introduced new uncertainties for the global market. No nation or territory was off-limits (including remote islands inhabited only by penguins and seals). Trump’s scattershot approach has had clear consequences, especially for countries with fledgling markets. Kazakhstan, Bulgaria, and Indonesia are among the many nations now buying gold by the ton, according to World Bank data—ostensibly to insulate themselves from any future shocks caused by U.S. policy. Meanwhile, Struyven explained, the ongoing question of whether America’s own central bank will retain its independence could also be contributing to gold’s historic run, because “the gold price tends to rise when questions about central-bank governance rise.” The other main driver of this price spike is less abstract. Some Wall Streeters are concerned that the value of the U.S. dollar will continue to erode as the national debt climbs and the Federal Reserve loses its grip on the currency. They’re making what’s become known as the “Debasement Trade,” shifting money away from the weakening U.S. dollar and into harder, more independent assets such as gold and bitcoin. Shrinkflation, stagflation, good-old-fashioned inflation—all of it means that your paycheck doesn’t go as far as it once did, and all of it is good for gold. The mystery of the current gold rally is that the S&P 500 is also up. The stock-market index reached an all-time high earlier this month, which would seem to suggest that the American economy isn’t quite as close to the brink as the price of gold might indicate. But the reality probably has to do with a bifurcated market. Joe Davis, Vanguard’s global chief economist, told The New York Times on Saturday that this rare case of gold and stocks moving in a parallel upward trend has to do with “dramatically different” investor perspectives: The optimists are going with equities, and the pessimists are going with gold. In today’s economy, there’s room enough for both. Another way to put it is that a bet on the S&P 500 amounts to faith in the fruits of modern industry: AI and renewable energy, to name a couple. A bet on gold is a recognition that all empires eventually fall, and a return to something much more ancient.

Evening Read The Drink That Americans Won’t Give Up Without a Fight By Ellen Cushing Coffee is in trouble. Even before the United States imposed tariffs of 50 percent on Brazil and 20 percent on Vietnam—which together produce more than half of the world’s coffee beans—other challenges, including climate-change-related fires, flooding, and droughts, had already forced up coffee prices globally. Today, all told, coffee in the U.S. is nearly 40 percent more expensive than it was a year ago. Futures for arabica coffee—the beans most people in the world drink—have increased by almost a dollar since July. And prices may well go up further: Tariffs have “destabilized an already volatile market,” Sara Morrocchi, the CEO of the coffee consultancy Vuna, told me. This is a problem for the millions of people who grow and sell coffee around the world. It is also a problem for the people who rely on coffee for their base executive functioning—such a problem that Congress recently introduced a bipartisan bill to specifically protect coffee from Trump’s tariffs.

I spent this past weekend reading American Pastoral, which I’ve somehow never done before, and there’s a sad moment when one character, a sort of crotchety older man, attempts to send a check to his son’s jilted ex-wife. In the accompanying letter, meant as an apology on behalf of his womanizing son, the man recommends putting all of the money straight into gold, because “the dollar isn’t going to be worth a thing.” This is the prototypical goldbug, the staunch cynic and old-school prepper who might come across as scolding and bitter but is usually right at the end of the day. If a character in a novel or film is broadly “into gold,” you already know quite a bit about them. — Will Rafaela Jinich contributed to this newsletter.

Listen to more stories on the Noa app. This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here. When prices are high and global conflicts destabilize the world, some investors start looking backwards—away from an uncertain future and toward the predictability of the past. And what’s older and more dependable than gold? Last week, amid widespread geopolitical turmoil and a weakening U.S. dollar, the price of gold hit a historic high of $4,000 an ounce. This year has so far been gold’s best since 1979, a moment of instability so profound that it led to recession. Gold prices are much closer to a genuine “recession indicator” than, say, the resurgence of frozen yogurt or an uptick in Uber Eats orders. That’s because, over the past 50 years, spikes in the price of gold have typically been correlated with widespread inflation and geopolitical dysfunction. In 1979, amid double-digit inflation numbers in the United States and a global energy crisis, investors stocked up on the precious metal as a way to counter those shocks. In the years following the 2008 financial crisis, as investors lost trust in major institutions once seen as “too big to fail,” gold prices shot up again. And when persistent inflation was crushing the U.S. dollar after the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, gold once again soared. The precious metal has long been considered a safe-haven asset, because, unlike the U.S. dollar, its inherent value isn’t determined by any state government. Although it’s probably not realistic for everyone to start piling into Diamond District jewelry shops and hoarding gold bars, gold remains an appealing, if old-fashioned, alternative to more contemporary investments: Its value stems from its shine and rarity, not its ability to produce a line of credit. Some investors see gold as a standard way to diversify their portfolio. Others, stereotypically known as goldbugs, tend to be broadly skeptical about contemporary monetary policy. Just as investors in bitcoin, so-called digital gold, have historically skewed libertarian and anti-institutional, the most extreme goldbugs are betting against the system, doubtful that the Federal Reserve is capable of keeping the U.S. dollar strong. There’s also only so much of the metal lodged in the planet’s crust, compared with the dollar, which can be printed ad infinitum. At least until someone like Elon Musk figures out how to increase its supply by mining asteroids, gold will likely remain the doomer’s hedge of choice. Whereas a different sort of investor looks to get in early on promising new technological innovations, the goldbug doesn’t lose sight of what’s tried-and-true. Gold prices have already risen more than 50 percent this year and are showing no signs of stopping. The story of today’s gold boom began in 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine and Western governments decided to sanction the Russian central bank by freezing its foreign-exchange reserves. The scale of these sanctions was a reminder of why countries might want to own assets that can’t be easily frozen. Especially in emerging markets, central banks around the world “realized that the truly only safe asset” is gold, Daan Struyven, a co-head of Global Commodities Research at Goldman Sachs, told me. The whiplash of President Donald Trump’s tariff spree this spring introduced new uncertainties for the global market. No nation or territory was off-limits (including remote islands inhabited only by penguins and seals). Trump’s scattershot approach has had clear consequences, especially for countries with fledgling markets. Kazakhstan, Bulgaria, and Indonesia are among the many nations now buying gold by the ton, according to World Bank data—ostensibly to insulate themselves from any future shocks caused by U.S. policy. Meanwhile, Struyven explained, the ongoing question of whether America’s own central bank will retain its independence could also be contributing to gold’s historic run, because “the gold price tends to rise when questions about central-bank governance rise.” The other main driver of this price spike is less abstract. Some Wall Streeters are concerned that the value of the U.S. dollar will continue to erode as the national debt climbs and the Federal Reserve loses its grip on the currency. They’re making what’s become known as the “Debasement Trade,” shifting money away from the weakening U.S. dollar and into harder, more independent assets such as gold and bitcoin. Shrinkflation, stagflation, good-old-fashioned inflation—all of it means that your paycheck doesn’t go as far as it once did, and all of it is good for gold. The mystery of the current gold rally is that the S&P 500 is also up. The stock-market index reached an all-time high earlier this month, which would seem to suggest that the American economy isn’t quite as close to the brink as the price of gold might indicate. But the reality probably has to do with a bifurcated market. Joe Davis, Vanguard’s global chief economist, told The New York Times on Saturday that this rare case of gold and stocks moving in a parallel upward trend has to do with “dramatically different” investor perspectives: The optimists are going with equities, and the pessimists are going with gold. In today’s economy, there’s room enough for both. Another way to put it is that a bet on the S&P 500 amounts to faith in the fruits of modern industry: AI and renewable energy, to name a couple. A bet on gold is a recognition that all empires eventually fall, and a return to something much more ancient.

Evening Read The Drink That Americans Won’t Give Up Without a Fight By Ellen Cushing Coffee is in trouble. Even before the United States imposed tariffs of 50 percent on Brazil and 20 percent on Vietnam—which together produce more than half of the world’s coffee beans—other challenges, including climate-change-related fires, flooding, and droughts, had already forced up coffee prices globally. Today, all told, coffee in the U.S. is nearly 40 percent more expensive than it was a year ago. Futures for arabica coffee—the beans most people in the world drink—have increased by almost a dollar since July. And prices may well go up further: Tariffs have “destabilized an already volatile market,” Sara Morrocchi, the CEO of the coffee consultancy Vuna, told me. This is a problem for the millions of people who grow and sell coffee around the world. It is also a problem for the people who rely on coffee for their base executive functioning—such a problem that Congress recently introduced a bipartisan bill to specifically protect coffee from Trump’s tariffs.

I spent this past weekend reading American Pastoral, which I’ve somehow never done before, and there’s a sad moment when one character, a sort of crotchety older man, attempts to send a check to his son’s jilted ex-wife. In the accompanying letter, meant as an apology on behalf of his womanizing son, the man recommends putting all of the money straight into gold, because “the dollar isn’t going to be worth a thing.” This is the prototypical goldbug, the staunch cynic and old-school prepper who might come across as scolding and bitter but is usually right at the end of the day. If a character in a novel or film is broadly “into gold,” you already know quite a bit about them. — Will Rafaela Jinich contributed to this newsletter.

Title: AI Deals Are Scaling to Massive Valuations. But In Many Cases—Also Massive Dilution. See e.g., OpenAI

by Jason Lemkin | Artificial Intelligence (AI), SaaStr.Ai So there has never been a “start-up” like OpenAI. Already with 800,000,000+ users and a breathtaking $500 Billion (!) valuation. But it’s also raised and spent epic amounts. So as the chart from FT below shows — all the historic investors together, as a group, will likely own 10% after the company converts to a for-profit. All of them. From Khosla to Thrive to Founders Fund and more. OpenAI has now raised approximately $58 billion in primary funding across 11 rounds, with an additional $6.6 billion secondary sale in October 2025 at the $500 billion valuation. But the cash burn? That’s where it gets interesting. The company now projects it will burn $115 billion through 2029—that’s $80 billion higher than previously expected. Let that sink in. Not $115 billion raised. $115 billion burned. Breaking it down: This isn’t mismanagement. This is the cost of competing in frontier AI. The numbers are staggering: A 17x increase in less than three years. But when you’ve raised $58 billion and are burning over $100 billion to get there, the ownership math tells a different story. Looking at the projected ownership post-restructure (per FT Research and other sources): For founders and early investors who weren’t Microsoft, the dilution has been severe. Eight of the eleven original co-founders have left. Early VCs who got in at sub-$30 billion valuations have seen their ownership percentages compressed dramatically—even as the absolute dollar value has grown. The cap table now includes 11 funding rounds. What makes OpenAI’s story unique is who’s investing and why: Microsoft isn’t just an investor—they’re existentially dependent on OpenAI. Their entire AI strategy—Azure growth, Office Copilots, enterprise AI positioning—runs through OpenAI infrastructure. They’ll keep funding to protect that relationship. But they also receive ~20% of OpenAI’s revenue through their partnership agreement, creating a circular funding dynamic. Nvidia invested $100 million in October 2024 and gets paid back immediately through GPU purchases. They’ve invested in 50+ AI startups creating a circular economy where investment dollars flow back as compute revenue. Part of Microsoft’s and Nvidia’s investment effectively returns to their own coffers. SoftBank went from a $500 million investor in October 2024 to leading a $30 billion round six months later. That’s not normal venture behavior—that’s Masayoshi Son making a macro bet on AGI. Their commitment is so aggressive that if OpenAI doesn’t complete its for-profit conversion by December 31, 2025, SoftBank’s investment could be slashed from $30 billion to as low as $20 billion. Traditional VCs are playing a different game: raising larger funds on the AI narrative, marking up valuations in subsequent rounds, and hoping an exit materializes. But with 60+ investors on the cap table, exit dynamics will be complicated. Honestly it’s kind of based that employees will own 3x as much of OpenAI as VCs https://t.co/7MoOk6L8A1 — Luke Metro (@luke_metro) October 14, 2025 The October 2025 secondary sale is particularly revealing. OpenAI had authorized up to $10.3 billion in shares for sale but only about $6.6 billion ultimately changed hands. Why did employees sell less than authorized? Two possibilities: Either way, this was the second major secondary in a year—a clear signal that liquidity events are necessary to retain talent competing with Meta’s nine-figure offers and public company stock compensation. Here’s the structural complexity that matters: current investors still don’t own actual equity. They hold convertible notes that only convert to shares after the nonprofit-to-for-profit restructuring completes. This requires: The deadline? December 31, 2025. If the conversion fails, SoftBank’s investment drops from $30 billion to $20 billion, and other investors can demand their money back with 9% interest. That’s a potential $40+ billion liability. The OpenAI model isn’t replicable—but the dynamics are instructive: For AI infrastructure founders: If you’re building frontier models, you’re signing up for capital requirements that dwarf traditional SaaS. You’ll need to raise 4-5x your revenue run rate continuously. You might own 5-15% of something huge rather than 25% of something modest. And you’ll need to accept strategic investors who become customers, partners, and dependencies simultaneously. For AI application founders: The good news is you probably don’t need the OpenAI model. If you’re building on top of foundation models, your capital requirements are dramatically lower. But you’re also betting that OpenAI, Anthropic, or another provider maintains reasonable API pricing as they burn billions. For investors: Traditional venture math is broken in frontier AI. A 10x return on a $500 billion valuation requires a $5 trillion outcome. You’re not investing for returns—you’re investing for: To be fair, the revenue growth is real: At a $500 billion valuation on $12.7 billion revenue, that’s roughly a 39x revenue multiple. For context, Salesforce trades at 8-9x, ServiceNow at 20x. But both are profitable. The bet is that by 2029, at $100 billion in revenue, a $500 billion valuation would be 5x revenue—reasonable for a high-growth software company. But that requires executing flawlessly for four years while burning $115 billion and fending off Google, Meta, Anthropic, and everyone else building AGI. Yes, OpenAI scaled to a $500 billion valuation faster than any company in history. Yes, they’re generating $12.7 billion in revenue with 500 million weekly users. Yes, they’ve created a new market category and changed how the world thinks about AI. But they’ve also: The valuation is spectacular. The dilution is equally spectacular. The capital requirements are unprecedented. The burn rate is staggering. All of these things are true simultaneously. This is the new reality of frontier AI. Not every hot AI deal will look like this, but many infrastructure plays will require similar capital intensity. The question isn’t whether you can raise at massive valuations—OpenAI proved you can. The question is whether the dilution, complexity, and burn make sense for your business model and your exit strategy. For most AI companies, the answer is no. For foundation model companies competing for AGI, it might be the only path forward.

October 14, 2025 14:26 ET | Source: Rocket Lab Corporation Rocket Lab Corporation Long Beach, CA Long Beach, CA MAHIA, New Zealand, Oct. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today successfully launched its 15th mission of the year and the first of 21 new launches for Synspective. The “Owl New World” mission launched on Electron from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand at 16:33 UTC on October 14 to deploy the seventh StriX satellite to a 583km low Earth orbit. The mission was the first of a series of 21 dedicated Electron launches to take place between now and the end of the decade for Synspective, a leading Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite data and analytics company from Japan. It was also the seventh Electron mission completed for Synspective since launches to deploy their constellation began in December 2020. Altogether, Rocket Lab will launch 27 missions for Synspective, making Electron the primary launcher of their constellation. Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, said: “Another Electron launch for Synspective with 100% mission success, and a fantastic start to an exciting run of upcoming launches to deploy their constellation. Precise, direct access to orbit is essential to the iteration and growth of constellations already in space, and I’m proud of the Rocket Lab team for delivering this again and again for Synspective across every launch.” Synspective founder and CEO, Dr. Motoyuki Arai, said: “I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the team at Rocket Lab for safely and successfully carrying out this mission, as well as to all the members of Synspective who made this achievement possible. Moving forward, we will continue to leverage our satellite and data analytics technologies to address global challenges, such as security, disaster management, and environmental sustainability, thereby contributing to the creation of a more resilient and sustainable future.” Electron’s unbeaten combination of reliability, rapid execution, and exceptional satellite deployment accuracy in the space industry’s commercial small-lift launch class has made it the favored rocket for constellation operators globally. Rocket Lab is expected to surpass its previous annual launch record achieved in 2024 with 16 launches, with scheduled missions for other commercial constellation operators and international space agencies in the coming weeks that are set to meet the Company’s forecast of 20+ launches in 2025.

Title: This Protects You From An AI Bubble, Pays 7.7% Dividends

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. I know, I know. This levitating stock market feels like a bubble that will burst any day. So I get it if you’re nervous. And that’s actually a good thing. It pays to be wary when everyone else is throwing money at any asset—stocks included. My take? Well, it might surprise you, but it’s this: We’re not in a bubble—AI-driven or otherwise. But I get the fear—which is why we’re going to look at a two-step move that addresses it. This “best of both worlds” play gives us yields up to 8.2% and a hedge if, say, bullish analysts (like me!) end up wrong and the so-called “AI bubble” pops. Like I said, I think that’s unlikely. But in any market, it always pays to spread out our risks, which is why I think this two-step move makes a lot of sense now. You don’t have to look far to see what’s driving bubble worries. Over the last six months, stocks have soared 32.4%, or 65% annualized. There’s no way that can continue. Right? This perspective keeps people out of stocks, but we need to zoom out. Over the long haul, stocks have done well (but not too well) no matter when you bought them. Over the last decade, stocks have risen 12.9% on average per year. That’s above the century-long average of 10.5%, but not far above. And a higher gain now than in, say, the 1930s, makes sense. After all, our technology is better, and our companies are more efficient. So why shouldn’t stocks rise a bit faster than they used to? So, at the very least, we can say that the last decade has been very good for stocks, but not bubbly. To see what a real bubble looks like, let’s flip back 30 years or so. From 1996 to 2000, stocks returned 24.3% annualized. But most important, that was after several years of strong performance. Meantime, our recent strong market comes after two big selloffs: first due to the pandemic in 2020, and second due to misplaced recession fears in 2022. So a bit of short-term outperformance to offset short-term underperformance makes sense. And that’s before we talk about AI. I had a chat with an old friend who’s now the head of the English department at a small liberal-arts school. He was telling me that he doesn’t know how to plan the curriculum for the upcoming school year because, as he put it, “All anyone wants to talk about is artificial intelligence.” If even liberal-arts schools are obsessed over AI, should we worry that we’re in a bubble? If you look at Google Trends for the phrase “AI bubble,” you can see that, well, there is a bubble of worry about AI. No wonder the AI-bubble case is capturing the thinking of banks, private equity investors and journalists. But let’s stress test this assumption. Our first stop? The CNN Fear and Greed Index. A lack of greed has led to a “neutral” reading, or a market where the fears of bubble prognosticators and the hopes of pollyanna-ish speculators cancel each other out. This is a realistic indicator that, no, we’re not in a bubble—at least not at the inflationary peak of the bubble cycle. A lot of data is telling us that the economy is strong and inflation is high—and that’s not me talking, it’s Apollo Investment’s chief economist, who makes this argument clearly with a slew of charts. Let me just share what I think is the most important point. If Americans’ fear about their jobs is declining and well off earlier peaks (see the far right side of the above chart), we’re far from a situation where this harms the economy. I’m not saying that will never happen—just that it isn’t coming soon. Moreover, a recent study has shown AI isn’t taking jobs. “The labor market doesn’t feel great, so it feels correct that AI is taking people’s jobs,” says Martha Gimbel, one of the Yale academics who authored the study. “But we’ve looked at this many, many different ways, and we really cannot find any sign that this is happening.” So, what is happening? In short, AI is boosting corporate profits. Over the long-term, we’ve seen earnings growth on a steady upward track, with the pandemic breaking that trend. But setting that aside, we’re back on that trend. In part, that’s thanks to things getting back to normal (hence the big jump in late 2021 and early 2022), but it’s also partly due to the 10% earnings rise in the past year, far above the 6.7% annual earnings growth of the S&P 500 over the last 50 years. In other words, stocks are rising more now because profits are doing the same, and technology will likely cause that trend to continue. Nonetheless, if you’re still concerned we’re in a bubble, I have a solution: a closed-end fund (CEF) that sells covered-call options. Under these deals, the fund sells investors the right to buy its stocks when they hit a certain price at a fixed future date. No matter what happens, the fund keeps the fee it charges for this and uses it to fund its dividend. It’s a strategy that does best in volatile markets. So if you hold a fund that invests in the S&P 500 broadly, you have a nice setup for gains in an up market and a bit of a hedge in a down one—say if we do see some short-term correction around AI. That leads us to the Nuveen S&P 500 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (SPXX), which yields 7.7%—handing us a nice “cash cushion” in the form of that high dividend. It also owns the S&P 500, so you’re getting a nice mix of large cap AI players, like Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL), and those that benefit from AI, like Visa (V). The problem with the covered-call strategy is that it can cap our upside in the long run, as the fund’s best stocks are sold, or “called away.” That’s why I prefer the 8.2%-yielding Liberty All-Star Growth Fund (ASG), a “pure” equity CEF that’s a holding in my CEF Insider service. This one not only has a strong long-term track record (it’s up over 200% in the last decade, including dividends) but has both increased regular payouts and paid out some huge special dividends, too. Sure, that dividend does float a bit, but that’s because it’s tied to the fund’s underlying performance. It’s actually a good setup as it gives management latitude to reinvest its profits without worrying about being tied to a fixed payout. That, in turn, drives further upside for us. Moreover, as I write this, ASG trades at an 8.2% discount to NAV, which is much more generous than its historical average of 2.2%. That puts additional upside (beyond the stock market’s future gains) on the table as that discount returns to normal. It’s a sweet setup that lets us ride further AI gains and grab big dividends, too—something those who limit themselves to mainstream AI stocks simply can’t get.

Title: What’s Behind The 40% Rise In META Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/14/whats-behind-the-40-rise-in-meta-stock/
Time Published: 2025-10-14T15:53:29Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. META’s stock has seen a solid 43% rise in the last six months. This growth is primarily fueled by a mix of factors, including upbeat quarterly performance and significant AI investments that boosted the core advertising business, leading to a rise in ad impressions and ad prices. Furthermore, rising user engagement across its apps contributed to investor optimism, all while the company returned capital to shareholders via $9.76 billion in share repurchases and $1.33 billion in dividend payments in Q2 alone. From a quantitative perspective, the 43% surge in Meta Platforms stock in the last six months was largely driven by a 33.5% change in the company's P/E Multiple. While there is more to this narrative than mere numbers, let's first dissect the stock price movement into its contributing factors. Investing in a single stock can be fraught with risk, but there is substantial benefit to a more diversified strategy, like the one we employ with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Additionally, think about the potential long-term performance for your portfolio if you integrated 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto alongside equities. Separately, see – What's Happening With RGTI Stock? Returning to the “change”: The alterations in fundamental aspects like valuation, revenue, and margins carry with them a narrative related to business and investor sentiment. Below, we have pinpointed significant developments that impacted the stock price movements for META stock. As a quick background: META offers products that allow users to connect and share through various devices, including mobile phones, PCs, VR headsets, wearables, and augmented reality, promoting connectivity anytime and anywhere. Opinion: Currently, we view META stock as fairly valued. Why is that the case? Take a look at the full narrative. Read Buy or Sell META Stock to understand what informs our current viewpoint. Risk: Nonetheless, META is not immune to significant declines. It dropped approximately 43% during the 2018 correction, 35% amid the Covid pandemic, and sustained a heavier blow of 77% during the inflation crisis. Despite all the positives surrounding the stock, real risks remain. When markets sour, META can still experience serious downturns. Consistently selecting winners is a challenging endeavor, particularly given the volatility linked to a single stock. Instead, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has a proven record of surpassing the S&P 500 during the past 4-year period. Why is this the case? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered superior returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; resulting in a steadier performance, as evidenced in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: AVGO Stock AI Jackpot: $51B Shareholder Returns

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Over the past decade, Broadcom stock (NASDAQ: AVGO) has returned an impressive $51 billion to its investors through direct cash in the form of dividends and buybacks. This shareholder-focused strategy has delivered extraordinary results in 2025, with the stock posting a remarkable 50% year-to-date return, dramatically outperforming the broader market and establishing AVGO as one of the year’s most compelling semiconductor investments despite recent volatility. See – What’s Behind The Surge In Broadcom’s Stock? – for more details. Broadcom's commitment to consistent income generation continues through its steady quarterly dividend of $0.59 per share, maintaining an annualized dividend of $2.36 that yields approximately 0.68%, with the company successfully sustaining 13 consecutive years of dividend increases since becoming a public company. The semiconductor giant's robust capital allocation was significantly amplified in April 2025 when the board authorized a massive $10 billion share repurchase program running through December 31, 2025, reflecting management's confidence in the company's strong cash flow generation and its dominant position in AI infrastructure and mission-critical software. Broadcom’s exceptional financial performance has been underpinned by robust revenue growth, with Q3 2025 revenues reaching $16 billion and generating an impressive free cash flow of $7 billion (44% of revenue), while Q4 guidance of $17.4 billion represents a 24% year-over-year increase driven by accelerating demand for AI semiconductors and infrastructure software solutions. Let’s examine some statistics and evaluate how this payout capability compares to the market’s leading capital-return powerhouses. That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like AVGO, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Separately, see – What's Happening With RGTI Stock? Interestingly, AVGO stock ranks as the 53rd largest return to shareholders in history. Why should you care? This is because dividends and share buybacks signify direct and tangible returns of capital to investors. They also indicate management’s confidence in the company’s financial well-being and its capacity to generate sustainable cash flows. Furthermore, there are numerous other stocks with similar characteristics. Below is a list of the top 10 companies ranked by the total capital returned to investors via dividends and stock repurchases. For the complete ranking, visit Buybacks & Dividends Ranking What do you observe here? The overall capital returned to investors as a percentage of the current market capitalization seems inversely related to growth potential for reinvestments. Companies such as Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) are expanding at a quicker pace, in a more predictable manner, compared to others, yet they have delivered a significantly lower percentage of their market valuation to stockholders. That’s the downside to substantial capital returns. While they are appealing, one must reflect on the question: Am I forfeiting growth and robust fundamentals? Keeping that in perspective, let’s analyze some figures for AVGO. (see Buy or Sell Broadcom Stock for further details) Nonetheless, AVGO isn’t immune to significant declines. It experienced a drop of nearly 48% during the COVID-19 pandemic, approximately 35% in the 2021 inflation shock, and around 27% in the 2018 correction. Even with robust fundamentals, it’s apparent that the stock can endure substantial setbacks when the market shifts. Quality companies still suffer when investor sentiment changes dramatically. However, the risk isn't restricted to considerable market declines. Stocks can decrease even when markets are favorable – consider events such as earnings reports, business updates, and changes in outlook. To understand how the stock has bounced back from sharp downturns in the past, read AVGO Dip Buyer Analyses. Remember, investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CrowdStrike stock (NASDAQ: CRWD) has climbed 12% over the past month, fueled by optimism following its mid-September investor day. At that event, the company issued long-term guidance that exceeded analyst expectations, projecting net new Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) growth of at least 20% in fiscal year 2027 and setting a target of $10 billion in ARR by FY2031. Given this strong guidance and the company’s robust operating performance and financial condition, we believe there isn’t much to worry about regarding CRWD stock. The primary concern, however, is its very high valuation, which makes the stock seem relatively expensive following the recent run-up. Here is our multi-factor evaluation to determine if it’s still a buy. That is one perspective on stocks. Trefis High Quality Portfolio assesses much more and is structured to minimize stock-specific risk while providing upside exposure. Separately, see – What's Happening With RGTI Stock?

This table illustrates how CRWD is valued compared to the broader market. For further details see: CRWD Valuation Ratios This table shows how CRWD is growing relative to the broader market. For additional details see: CRWD Revenue Comparison This table highlights how CRWD's profitability compares to the broader market. For more details see: CRWD Operating Income Comparison CRWD experienced an effect slightly better than the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns. We determine this based on both (a) how considerably the stock declined and, (b) how swiftly it recovered. 2022 Inflation Shock 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic However, the risk isn't confined to major market crashes.

Title: Tim Ferriss at a Career Crossroads: How Should He Shape His Next Chapter?

Time Published: 2025-10-14T15:15:00Z
Full Content:
Author, podcaster, and angel investor Tim Ferriss considers what to do next to meet his career and life goals. In April 2024, writer, podcaster, and entrepreneur Tim Ferriss—known for his hugely popular podcast “The Tim Ferriss Show” and NYT-bestselling books like The 4-Hour Workweek—found himself at a crossroads. Although his podcast was generating millions annually, he questioned the sustainability of podcasting and his own competitive advantage given the increasingly saturated market and the advent of AI tools and video-centric formats. Plus, he had built his career on anticipating cultural shifts in knowledge work, health, and media consumption while making early angel investments in companies like Uber, Shopify, Facebook, and Twitter. But his podcast’s reliable cash flow also funded his science-focused foundation, so making any shifts would be very consequential. He faced a difficult choice: innovate from within his proven format, pivot to entirely new ventures—possibly in film, premium consumer products, or venture capital—or risk a slow decline by maintaining the status quo. Complicating matters further was Ferriss’s desire to start a family, a goal he prioritized above all business ventures. Every month of indecision narrowed his window for successfully transitioning. Senior Lecturer Reza Satchu and Tim Ferriss joined Cold Call host Brian Kenny to discuss the case, “Tim Ferriss: What Might This Look Like If It Were Easy?” in front of a live audience on October 7, 2025 in Harvard Business School’s Klarman Hall auditorium. Using “The Founder Mindset” framework from the course created by Satchu, they explore testing assumptions, calibrating risk, and how to choose the next path in the face of multiple options—which can often lead to inaction. BRIAN KENNY: Welcome to Cold Call, the podcast where we dive deep into the stories behind groundbreaking Harvard Business School case studies. Tim Ferriss has been called the Oprah of Audio. His podcast, the Tim Ferriss Show, surpassed a billion downloads and reshaped the digital media landscape. Yet at the height of his success, Ferriss found himself at a crossroads. With podcasting becoming a crowded competitive space, he wondered whether the medium that had defined his career was still the best vehicle for his curiosity, creativity, and impact. How should a creator who has always thrived by reinventing himself decide what’s next? Especially when personal priorities, like starting a family, collide with professional ambitions. Today, on Cold Call, I’m joined by Professor Reza Satchu and case protagonist Tim Ferriss to discuss the case, “Tim Ferriss, What Might This Look Like If It Were Easy?” I’m your host Brian Kenny, and you’re listening to a live taping of Cold Call coming to you from Klarman Hall on the campus of HBS, Harvard Business School. Make some noise, folks. All right, can we have a warm welcome for our guests? Reza Satchu teaches entrepreneurship at Harvard Business School, including the Founder Mindset and Founder Launch, both courses that he created. He is also a serial entrepreneur, having founded multiple highly successful ventures. Reza, welcome. REZA SATCHU: Thank you very much. Thanks for having us. BRIAN KENNY: Tim Ferriss, the subject of today’s case is a bestselling author, entrepreneur, speaker, and early stage investor. You may have heard that he hosts a podcast. Tim, welcome. TIM FERRISS: Thanks. Thanks for having me. Hi, everybody. BRIAN KENNY: It’s great to have you here. I’m a little nervous actually because your podcast gets a lot of listens, so I want to make sure that we do this right. TIM FERRISS: I’m sure you’ll be fine. You have a better voice for radio. We were both commenting, the intonation and delivery. I thought it was so good. I was like, man. BRIAN KENNY: Why don’t we just dive right in? Reza, I’m going to start with you. Can you tell us what drew you to Tim’s story? Why did you think it was a good subject for a case study, particularly for the Founder’s Mindset class, and what makes it particularly relevant for aspiring founders today? REZA SATCHU: Yeah, so look, I think I was thrilled. Actually, my research associate who’s here, Denise Koller, came up with the idea of interviewing Tim. Initially, I thought, “Does this make sense?” The more I got to know Tim and study his work, his mindset is exactly in sync with some of the things that we’re trying to get our founders to think about, starting with, he imagines a world that doesn’t exist today. He imagines that there are things he can do that are different than are existing today. He imagines a space where he can actually think about something, take a series of actions, trust his judgment, and hopefully build something of consequence. So many people stop at that first point, which is, how could I possibly do something different? It started really there, where I thought, “Here’s someone who has done many different things well, trusted his judgment.” Really, that’s a key part of being a founder. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. Tim, let me turn to you the case. Like any good HBS case, it opens up with you thinking pensively about what you’re going to do. You’re probably staring out a window looking at something. I’m wondering, actually, if you can take us back to where the case opens up, where you’re mulling through what your options are. You’ve got a lot of options right now and you’re thinking about what the best thing is. What was going on, what was your mindset at that time? TIM FERRISS: Yeah, I was actually literally looking out, in Austin where I recorded my podcast. I would say fundamentally it was, number one, has this become a crowded red ocean where other people can do this, what I started off doing in 2014. If there are one or more people who can do what I can do, I’m like, “Well, this seems redundant.” I would prefer to do something that is more of a category of one, to borrow from the 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing. There wasn’t a financial pressure to stop. Certainly, there was a little bit of pressure to continue because it funds the foundation, it funds the angel investing, it pays for the bills and employees and so on. But it was more a question of, is this the game I want to play? We’re all playing games past a certain point, past the lowest rungs on Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. Then, beyond that, it’s being aware of what game you’ve currently opted into, what are the rules, what are the wind conditions, the failure modes. Then, authoring something that hopefully stacks the deck in your favor. That’s a lot of what I was thinking about. The entire landscape had become too saturated. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, and so you described this in the case as blue oceans versus red oceans. Reza, if you can talk about, in the Founder Mindset framework, how does Tim’s approach to pattern recognition and assumption testing compare to other founders? REZA SATCHU: I think there’s a critically important point on Tim’s mindset, and how I think it resonates with the Founder Mindset, is people think of committing to an idea as jumping off a cliff into shark-infested waters, and that somehow being a founder is full of risk, full of uncertainty. You close your eyes and you just hope and pray for the best. Okay, I can’t tell you how flawed that is. I’m a serial founder. I will tell you I think about risk all the time. I calculate risk and I’m not paralyzed by it. The key is actually making decisions in the face of risk. What Tim does with what he calls these assumptions or these experiments, he effectively is trusting his judgment to do some things. Nothing terribly consequential, but enough to get data to figure out whether or not he should continue pursuing his curiosity. He gives himself permission to go down a pathway of his curiosity, whereas, most people never give themselves that permission because they just think, “How could I possibly have this idea when others have so many more resources?” I call it “small c commitments.” He calls it these “two-week experiments,” but it’s this idea that he’s willing to suspend disbelief that others haven’t thought of this idea, and that he’s willing to actually test his ideas and dip his toe in before he jumps in. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. Tim, for you, a lot of this began back when you wrote The 4-Hour Work Week, was that 15 years ago, give or take? TIM FERRISS: Almost 20, 2007, back when I had hair. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, that book challenged a lot of assumptions at that time. I’m wondering what assumptions you were testing as you wrote that book, and how do you weigh the risks and opportunities of coming out with something that seems a little audacious? TIM FERRISS: The first part I would say is simply asking questions that address some of the assumptions underlying traditional, let’s just call it, or conventional career planning. The deferred life plan. What would you do if you could not do that? If you could not rely on that. Which by the way is more and more relevant with some of the technologies that are coming. But if you couldn’t rely on that, exactly, as a social contract, what would you do? Then, it just led into lots of my own experiments. That was largely autobiographical. Then, teasing out the principles that allowed me to automate, and at the time use virtual assistants, that would be replaced by a lot of AI right now. That’s the first part. It was testing assumptions, but not just in a theoretical capacity. It was saying, “All right, I tried this thing, it didn’t work. I did this, it did work. I did this, it kind of worked, and here’s how I got it to really work. Here’s how you might think about dipping your toe in the water.” One critical part of that book that I think sometimes gets missed is cultivating a bias towards action. There are these exercises at the end of almost every chapter called Comfort Challenges. It’s just doing things that are very uncomfortable socially. There’s really no risk involved. This is not from the book, but my friend Noah Kagan talks about the Coffee Challenge, where people have to go in, order a coffee, and then ask for 10% off without giving any explanation, and just like, deal with that. It’s amazing. You see these people are like multiple-time founders or HBS grads, they’re pacing. They’re like, “Oh, it’s easy.” They’re pacing around the coffee shop for 30 minutes trying to build up the courage to do it. It’s like, “Yeah, that stuff helps.” From realizing that most stumbles or non-issues to begin with. In terms of presenting something that was contrarian, I first of all pitched the book. It’s a long story as to how I even got to the book, because I never wanted to write a book, but it was turned down by something like 29 publishers, violently. Some of the rejection letters were worthy of framing. Then, Steve Ross and Heather Jackson, at Crown, which was an imprint of Random House at the time, my pitch had been polished after getting rejected 29 times, literally, this is not an exaggeration. They were like, “Sure, kid. We’ll pay you pennies on the dollar to try this.” Their downside risk was very low. I had, as a younger person, I was published when I was 29, but at that time it’s like, what are your advantages? You can take stock of your advantage. At that time, it’s time, it’s speed, experimentation. You don’t have some permanent record of strikes that follows you around everywhere. I think you can afford to experiment. For me, it was ultimately an exercise in writing a book, and the only time it started to click was when I basically wrote it as I would write an email to two very particular friends after two glasses of wine. I threw out two drafts of that book, and then it unfolded, and that bought me permission to do a lot of other things. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, it worked out in the end, didn’t it? TIM FERRISS: It did work out. It’s not the end yet, so we’ll see. BRIAN KENNY: Reza, I had a chance to sit in on your class today, which was really interesting, and thank you for letting me do that. You talked a lot about failure, particularly in the beginning part of the class. What’s the Founder’s Mindset where it comes to being able to get rejected 29 times and still go back and ask for another publishing deal? REZA SATCHU: Okay, so first of all, just on failure, I think human psychology, is you often overestimate your downside, and I think to Tim’s point, you also massively underestimate your ability to recover. People imagine failure as this terrible thing that, oh my God, if this happens, it will be awful. Certainly, sitting here with the HBS students, what you’re doing is looking left and right and wondering, “Oh, my God, these people are going to think I’m a failure.” When in reality they’re barely going to think about you at all, but people are really stressed about that. I think the broader component around failure is not only do you overestimate what failure is, but by not putting yourself in positions of failure, two things don’t happen. One is you don’t learn. You don’t learn what happens through that failure. But the second thing is, I don’t know if this is what happened here, but people actually, when they look at someone who has stayed committed 29 times, I have this phrase which is like, magic happens when you commit, which is it’s not just you learn what you’re capable of. Other people show up precisely because they see the commitment. What people often misprice is that piece of the right tail upside. I think failure is a wonderful thing. I think a life without failure is a terrible life. It’s just a life where you don’t learn what you’re capable of. I think there needs to be a fundamental reframing of failure. Tim, I’d love you to talk about your concept of these one-way doors, irreversible law, like how you price risk, what does risk actually mean to you? TIM FERRISS: Yeah, I can speak to that. I also want to add something I left out of the question around The 4-Hour Work Week. There we go. I’ll let you take it. Just because people are rejecting your idea does not mean it’s a good idea. Just to state the obvious. REZA SATCHU: That’s true. TIM FERRISS: I agree with Paul Graham, Co-Founder of Y Combinator, who wrote an essay roughly around, the more labels you apply to yourself, the dumber you are. If you pride yourself on being contrarian, you’re actually just conforming to an anti-consensus. You’re actually still suffering from a really heavy form of bias. In my case, the reason I persisted through those 29 rejections was that the material that was going to be in the book, I had workshopped with, I don’t know, a thousand students at Princeton doing guest lectures at the invitation of my former professor. I had refined it, refined it like a stand-up comedian working on his 60-minute set, and I knew it worked. REZA SATCHU: Right, so you had an informational advantage. TIM FERRISS: I asked for feedback forms after every class. I had all these annoying pointed questions that students didn’t want to fill out. I knew that for a particular demographic it worked, and that’s why I persisted. If I had not had that data, I don’t think I would’ve persisted. I wouldn’t have had any grounds for plowing head in that way. Then, in terms of risk, I think there’s a lot to be said. I’m echoing Scott Galloway here, but choosing where you’re going to live and operate actually is a really important, sometimes more so than what you’re going to do. Moving to Silicon Valley was incredibly liberating because people fail all the time and they’re never counted out. I’ve invested in so many founders who failed the first time and then, boom. REZA SATCHU: Back at it. TIM FERRISS: Right? StumbleUpon, I was an advisor, didn’t work out. That was a zero for me as an advisor. But then, Garrett Camp a few months later was like, “Hey, I have this idea.” Turned it into Uber. People are never counted out. Being in an environment where that is the case matters a lot. It doesn’t have to be Silicon Valley, although that’s the most obvious. Risk for me, put simply, would be the probability of an irreversible negative outcome. There are some cases where that’s part of the calculus, but typically, I thought about making a journal. I seriously contemplated doing this because everyone’s making a journal now, but I went to the bookstore, I was like, “There are too many journals, I’m not going to do it.” But the journal was going to be called “worries that mostly didn’t happen.” It’s just like you just write down what you’re worried about and then you look back three months later, and again, none of that actually mattered. The cost of “failure” is very low for most things. You can also get a signal, positive or negative, go or no-go, pretty quickly if you’re methodical about it. I try to view, reframe failure, as scientific feedback. You have a hypothesis, you test it, it didn’t pan out, still valuable. If you’re optimizing for learning and relationships that transcend any given project, experiment, company, job, et cetera, those things snowball over time. If you’re keen on doing short-term experiments but long-term greedy, it’s very hard to lose, in my opinion. From what I’ve seen, and this is based on Silicon Valley, so it’s maybe anomalous, but it’s really hard to fail over the long term. REZA SATCHU: The amazing thing about this failure point is if you just think about two different career trajectories, one is a more traditional career trajectory. Let’s pick on consultants because, why not? There’s no real risk of failure. You’re going to get 95 things out of a hundred right on that path. On the Founder path, you are getting most things wrong. You’re asking people for money, they’re saying no. You’re asking customers to transact with you, they’re saying no. You’re trying to hire people, they’re saying no. You’ve got no resources. You’re constantly surrounded by a life of failure. You’ve just got to decide which life sounds better. What you suddenly realize is, wow, well, a life without failure, it’s hard to imagine having the impact that you all want to have, or having the return that you all want to have. I really think this point around risk really ties into failure, which is first of all, you need to reframe risk as a really great thing. Without risk, there’s no return. Risk is a good thing. It is not what you immediately think of, which is, “Oh, I want to stay away from it.” You need risk. Okay? What that doesn’t mean is that you’re jumping off a cliff. What it means is you understand how to operate in terms of risk. You need to incorporate some of the frameworks that you’ve talked about in class today to measure and calibrate it. But Tim’s not writing these books if he’s not willing to encounter risk. TIM FERRISS: Yeah, the 4-Hour Body, still recovering from some injuries from that one, 2010. Just had a surgery on this elbow as a result of that book. REZA SATCHU: Everyone must have thought that was a crazy idea. TIM FERRISS: It was crazy. But to use the 4-Hour Body as an example, the 4-Hour Work Week bought me permission to experiment outside of that lane, and so I did the 4-Hour Body in totally different category. Because the upside of that was so high if it opened the door to me writing books on any subject. The downside was that book doesn’t do well, and I go back to milking this 4-Hour, whatever the hell work week. The downside risk was very, very limited. I would also say that I think my experience with great schools, my experience with analytical people in general, is that they’re very good at thinking about all the possible downsides of doing the new thing or doing the “risky thing”. But they don’t spend as much time thinking about the cost of inaction or the status quo or taking the safe route. If you telescope out six months, a year, three years, five years, what are the emotional costs, financial, maybe relational, et cetera. It turns out when you start to look at these two options with equal weight, that the potentially safer route is just as fraught with all sort of problems as the supposedly risky route. Then, it’s like, “All right, I might as well do the weird thing first.” BRIAN KENNY: Did you ever worry about your brand though, the Tim Ferriss brand? If I do something that’s too contrarian, I may lose some of my brand cachet. TIM FERRISS: I don’t think about brand really at all, which isn’t to fault anyone who does, but I think brand is one of those words that can be a siren song for lots of decisions that compromise. I don’t want to say necessarily integrity and values, although it can be that, but you can be captured by, in my case, like an audience who rewards you for your most outlandish comments. If you follow that incentive structure on something like YouTube, you can wear a mask for so long that you become that mask. I’ve seen that happen to people, and you can’t hit control Z on that very easily, so I don’t think about brand. I pay a lot of attention to truly following my curiosity. When I do say a six, I do these two week experiments, but they’re generally within the context of a six to 12-month project. When I’m in that six to 12-month project, I am all in. I am completely saturated in it. I just find that there are a lot of ways to approach this. There’s no one way for everybody, but most of the hiccups along the way are just little toe stubs. But you have to get used to taking the hits. In other words, it’s like, if you were to go to a boxing class and you’ve never done boxing before and you get hit in the liver with a punch, it’s not even a hard punch. It’s going to be really shocking and unpleasant. If you do it for six months, you’ll be like, “Okay, yeah, I’m going to get 50 of these today. It’s fine.” You get over it, but you have to train your immune response, your stress response to this stuff. The only way to do that is by getting out there and trying stuff. REZA SATCHU: Brian, this is what’s so valuable to Founders, is exactly this, which is what they’re getting is hit all the time, but they’re learning that they can recover much faster through those hits. TIM FERRISS: Yeah. Could I add one more thing? REZA SATCHU: Yeah, of course. TIM FERRISS: I’ll give you an example. I remember the first time that I got, sadly, this is just a tax in the US, my first frivolous lawsuit, I got sued by somebody who was completely, it’s laughably ridiculous. I was so stressed out, I couldn’t sleep, and my publisher was involved, all this craziness. It was filed by the law firm that sued Subway for having 11 and a half inch foot long subs. So I’m dealing with all this and it’s tearing me up inside. Then, I was having a conversation with this friend of mine who’s been on multiple public boards. He’s in private equity for a super long time, very, very good investor. He’s like, “What?” He’s like, “This is the first time you’ve been sued.” He’s like, “I should sue you.” He’s like, “Welcome to the club.” He’s like, “What are you so upset about?” I was like, “What are you talking about?” I tried to justify it, and he’s like, “Ah. It’s fine.” I was like, “Oh, okay.” You just realize that a lot of the things you might contemplate now that you think are very big, huge problems, you can fix. A lot of it is just par for the course. REZA SATCHU: What do you think of this right to recover or what do you think human psychology is around recovery? Do people underestimate or overestimate their ability to recover? TIM FERRISS: I think it depends a lot on who you’re talking to, right? It’s like, if we’re talking to a bunch of refugees who had made hard choices. Then, I would say they probably accurately estimate their adaptiveness. REZA SATCHU: Ability. Yeah. TIM FERRISS: Their ability to adapt. I would say people who have, and this was me for a long time, executed to plan in a system where the rules are known, it’s more or less complete information, like higher education. It’s like, “Okay, great, you’re on the dean’s list, you’re summa cum laude, or whatever.” That those people underestimate their resilience, but I don’t actually think they’re wrong, because to develop the resilience you have to build some scar tissue. The only way you do that is by getting on the field. This sounds all abstract. It’s like, “No, okay, you want to change the world and build a billion-dollar company doing X?” It’s like, “All right, go talk to 10, go pitch 10 customers next week and ask them for money. As a dry run to get prepayment that will fund X, Y, or Z.” But don’t hide, and then I’m quoting Seth Godin, “But don’t hide behind the big.” Get out there and it’s going to be messy. BRIAN KENNY: Reza, I want to talk, so much of the case centers around optionality and all the options that Tim had in front of him, we talked about that a little bit upfront. I’m wondering, once you’ve achieved a certain level of success, a lot of opportunities open up. As a Founder, how do you sort through that? How do you think about what’s worth pursuing, what you shouldn’t pursue? What’s the thought process there? REZA SATCHU: Yeah, so it’s interesting. In my life, as someone who’s founded a few businesses, in some ways, the most recent businesses are harder, surprisingly. One would say, “Well, it’s easier because you’ve got more resources, more expertise, you have less hunger, and you have much more options. It’s not as critical that it has to succeed.” I teach and I found a business at the same time. That’s crazy. Most people would say that is not an optimal way to found a business. Whereas, my first couple of businesses, there’s no way I’d be teaching and founding a business. I’d be fully focused on founding. I think this idea that it gets easier, it might get easier from an expertise perspective, but suddenly you’ve got what I call the curse of optionality, which is you’ve got a number, and Tim, you’re facing some of this right now, frankly, this paradox of choice, which is precisely because of the success you’ve had you’ve got a whole bunch of choices. He mentioned Seth Godin, who’s a wonderful writer, who we interviewed for the case, and he said to Denise and me that we need to lock Tim in a room or in a cabin, and he needs to pick an option. Of course, what he was saying was that the world will be a much better place if Tim commits to something. As opposed to maximizing all of his options. I do think this curse, and for the students, people listening, I think that many of you will fall into this trap of preserving options for far too long and not knowing what you’re capable of when you commit. I’ve not had money and I’ve had money. Not having money is somewhat liberating because you just know what you need to do. When you have options, and those options could be a Harvard Business School degree, you suddenly start thinking, “Well, maybe I can preserve those options for a very long time.” I’m curious, Tim, I would ask you this question, which is you’ve got a whole bunch of options ahead of you. Here’s what I know to be true, is if you committed to one, I’m sure it will be far more impactful than if you preserve all of them. TIM FERRISS: Yeah, that’s true. I agree with that, but I would also say a few things. Number one is that you can validate or invalidate something really quickly. We were talking about this a bit earlier, but I was chatting with a student who was talking about maybe the safer route to finance and then less safe perhaps in entertainment, film potentially. I was saying, I’m saying, “All right, you know what’s going to really get attention, is if you’re an HBS grad who offers to shadow a show runner or a producer in pre-production on a movie, and you’re like, “Nothing is beneath me. Cleaning toilets, getting your coffee, I don’t care.'” It’s like, “All I want to do is observe some deal making and see what goes into making a film.” It’s like, “You can figure out if that is actually your dream or not very, very quickly. You might be completely allergic to it, but you can figure that out after a week of being in the pre-production office.” That’s number one. REZA SATCHU: But are you also suggesting that because that’s a differentiator, meaning, there’s something that it says about you, that you’re willing to do that? TIM FERRISS: Here’s my experience. Even though you might feel there’s very little time and a big rush, there’s not a big rush. You can take time to have these little detours and try things. The second is that even though I’m doing some different things, let’s just say angel investing newsletter foundation focused on mental health therapeutics, nonprofit, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. There’s actually a way in which they reinforce one another. I will use, say, the podcast to interview scientists based on science I’m interested in to determine if I think they’re a good candidate for the foundation, or potentially, it doesn’t have to be a scientist. If I find that their personality is compatible enough and their idea is compelling enough that I want to make an investment in their company. I can use that as a discovery mechanism then for sourcing. I would say, also it depends on how much… Preserving all of your options also is just an illusion. You can’t really do that. The nature of making a decision, it’s like incision, decision to cut away. You are by definition cutting off a lot of paths, which I do for six to 12 months at a time. But you can have a few things, in my case, running at the same time in parallel. I would say optionality might not be all you think it is. If I look at hundreds of people I’ve interviewed on the podcast who are by any measure top performers in their fields, one of the most common comments or concepts that comes up is the power of positive constraints. Positive constraints, commit. It doesn’t have to be commit forever. It shouldn’t probably be commit forever, unless you’re the person who knows at age five that you want to do X. If you’re that, I don’t know, maybe you wouldn’t be here. REZA SATCHU: Positive constraints means cutting off options, in some sense? TIM FERRISS: It means cutting off options, or it could be anything. If you’re writing, it could be a space or page constraint. It could be, I have to write this all in third person or first person. REZA SATCHU: Well, it’s also your comment around, if I’ve got a problem, I will only solve it by taking something away. TIM FERRISS: Right, so in the case of the podcast, I found myself starting to drag my feet because it’s a very saturated marketplace. One of my key advantages that I had early on, besides just starting pretty early in 2014, was my research and the ability that I had to dig and find things that were interesting. Now, you can go in ChatGPT and say, “Give me 10 questions in the style of Tim Ferriss or Lex Friedman or Joe Rogan interviewing this person.” Boom, you’ll get good answers. That advantage has effectively disappeared, and there are a lot of ways to potentially respond to that. But for me, number one, I’m generally not looking for the cutting edge. I’m looking for dull edge. I want to see some proof of concept before I do angel investing or before I do some hare-brained thing, like make a card game, which some of you may have or not. That’s sitting up at the top for anybody who wants a copy. I think that fundamentally a lot of it comes down to asking yourself, how do you maximize for… I know this is, again, it’s so simple, but if you maximize for learning and relationships that transcend whatever that single project or job is, this is particularly effective if you are in a place like San Francisco. I don’t want to sell San Francisco. It’s pretty dirty and filthy. But I think if you were going to choose projects and you decided as a thought exercise to rank order the parameters as who, like who am I directly observing and working with? Then, where, and then what/sector, that actually comes last, I think you could end up with some pretty interesting options on the menu. BRIAN KENNY: We haven’t talked about impact, but I know that’s an important part of the thing that you cover in Founder’s Mindset. Can you talk a little bit about the idea of thinking about impact at the outset and not at the end of the journey? REZA SATCHU: I think so many people fall into this trap. I think I fell into this trap early in my career, which is my life is going to be in these stages. The impact stage will be that last piece of my life when I’ve learned a lot, when I’ve had the benefit of resources, all these sorts of things. The problem is there’s two problems. One is you may or may not be around for that last piece. BRIAN KENNY: Never know. REZA SATCHU: But the second point is it turns out that actually having impact along the way, and I love the way you describe it, which is start with the small things. Start with the people in your life that you’re… We all have these, especially here, have these visions of grandeur around having massive impact. Well, I’d say the most important way to do that is to actually start living a life of impact right away and on the small things. I think that, Tim, when you talk about, so what I view learning, what I view learning as, because a lot of people talk about you want to maximize learning, which I completely agree, and I’d be curious how you define learning. Okay, so I’m going to propose what my definition of learning is, and you tell me whether this, because I think it’s an important concept because learning is… If you had to say, what is the thing that is going to most correlate with impact, it would be learning. He who learns, he or she who learns the most is going to attract the most credibility, resources such that they can have the impact that they most desperately want. I define learning in the age of AI as the spot where you’re making… it’s all about decision making. Meaning, the trait we are most trying to learn is judgment. Judgment occurs when you’re making consequential decisions that you’re accountable for. You must live a life where you’re pushing yourself to make decisions, some of which will be wrong, some of which will be right, in order to build the thing we most want, which is judgment. Okay, so I’m curious to know your thoughts about that. TIM FERRISS: Learning, there’s how to learn, and then there’s what to learn. If you’re looking at say, who to work with, and then the where, and then the what, right? There are certain skills that are not going to transfer. It’s like, okay, if you’re in the waste management business and you’re understanding the ins and outs of waste management, I’m just making that up because I like unsexy stuff, that may not transfer to your hot shot AI startup for whatever, customer service. But if you are observing, this is an old school example, like a Wayne Huizenga. REZA SATCHU: Yeah, Wayne Huizenga. They don’t know who Wayne Huizenga is. TIM FERRISS: I know. REZA SATCHU: You and I know who Wayne Huizenga is. TIM FERRISS: I know, waste management, then Blockbuster, which went extinct back in the Pleistocene era, but that guy was a master deal maker. If you’re able to watch someone acquiring dozens and dozens of companies, and how that entire dance is woven, that transfers. If you’re learning how to communicate, let’s just say, I’m making this up, you work for Cards Against Humanity. This is a very popular game as some of you may know, they were really, really good at PR stunts. If you work at that company when it is small and you’re involved with all of those PR stunts, which fundamentally are thinking about positioning and differentiation, that will apply to everything. It’s just asking yourself, where could this transfer? Where could this apply? Then, that’s the stuff that you focus on. For me, it’s in a sense meta skills, that if you were to copy and paste, you take somebody, look, it doesn’t matter. Well, I’ll give you actually maybe a more contemporary example, like Jeff Bezos. All right. What is Jeff Bezos’ superpower? I would say that it is having longer time horizons than almost everybody else, and defending and justifying and reiterating that in every shareholder letter. He trained Wall Street like a domesticated puppy, like a puppy. REZA SATCHU: From day one, yeah. TIM FERRISS: Talk about just incredible persuasion and the pro sleight of hand and also just business mastery. But the point is, if you have a longer time horizon than other people, that’s a huge competitive advantage also in and of itself. If you can be around someone who exemplifies that, because I can say that, and you’re like, “Okay, I got it.” But it’s like, do you really? You need to see how that is emphasized over and over again. Or, like a Herb Kelleher at Southwest. Would I have loved to have worked for that guy? Would I have quit my tech job to work for him? Absolutely, because such a maniacal focus on being the low cost airline. I remember he was interviewed at one point and he said to the journalists, because they were saying how hard it was, what he did, and he’s like, “No, you can do my job.” Then, he’s like, “All right, give me a situation.” They gave him a situation. He’s like, “All right, does that help us to be the low cost airline or not?” They’re like, “No.” He’s like, “Yeah, that’s a no.” He’s like, “Okay, next one.” He’s like, “Yeah.” If you have the focus, but you need to be around people who are doing that and living it so you can see it in different contexts. This is going to sound bizarre because I’m thinking about adopting another dog. But there’s an expression in dog training, which is basically if the dog hasn’t done it, say a behavior, shaping a behavior in 20 different locations, 20 different durations, they don’t have that behavior. It’s not durable. Humans are the same. It’s conditioning. Having the opportunity to work with someone where you see certain characteristics exemplified; certain behaviors, certain principles enacted that can be applied to different businesses, man, I think that’s an incredible shortcut. But you and I have different perspectives on this. I think working for a startup’s a fantastic way to learn on someone else’s dime with the understanding that- BRIAN KENNY: That’s our youngest audience member, by the way. TIM FERRISS: Yeah. Start them young. Start them young. REZA SATCHU: It’s true. What I’d say, I think just, look, I think the question is, in the age of AI, what are the traits that we can teach people? I think that the challenge is that things like memorization and observation are far less valuable. What is valuable is this elusive thing called judgment. The real question is, how do we get it? I think, yeah, you can get it by watching someone else, but how you really get it is by doing it yourself. Actually being in the arena, making those decisions. One of the things you said, Tim, which is very interesting to me, because I have a similar phrase, when you said you have a bias for action. I have a phrase which is, if in doubt, act, which immediately people say, “Well, wait, Reza, you don’t know what you’re doing, you’re going to act?” No, the reason I say that is because so many people are paralyzed by imperfect or uncertain information, and so they’re like deer in headlights. What I suggest is, even if you’re going to stay the course, train yourself to make a decision that you’re actually staying the course, which is a bias for action. I’m curious how you think about, bias for action is, it feels risky. I’m curious how you view that. TIM FERRISS: What I would say is I have a tendency… My mom literally got me a shirt that says, ”Wait a second, let me overthink this.” My tendency is to, I don’t want to say perseverate, but over consider the ramifications of a lot of decisions. It’s been a practice of conditioning myself to be like, all right, what if I tried what Reid Hoffman of LinkedIn and so on has done, where he wants to enable his chief of staff to act quickly enough that they roughly get things wrong 10% of the time. That’s literally a guideline that he uses with his chief of staff. He says 10% footfall, which is a little confusing because it’s a tennis reference. Anyway, but I think applying that to your own life where you’re like, all right, what can I put on automatic, just no decision autopilot default, number one, where can I just completely remove decisions? Sometimes that’s with diet, exercise. You don’t want to get up in the morning and decide which of 20 toothpaste tubes you’re going to use. You have your toothpaste and you just deal with your toothpaste. Similarly, you could extrapolate that and apply it to giving employees autonomous decision-making power and creating a culture where you actually reward screw-ups. I literally met with, I was having a blood draw this morning because I’m in Boston for proteomics assay. Anyway, it’s a long story. But they have a dedicated discord within the company for celebrating bleep-ups basically. That are not egregious. It’s also like, all right, how do we not do this again? But people get rewarded for ambition, mistakes of ambition, not mistakes of sloth, which is straight from Machiavelli, so I’m not sure how I feel about that. But in any case, I don’t know about also… I got stuck on the AI stuff again, because I don’t know, I wish I could give everybody and myself a strategy for making yourself AI proof. I don’t know what that looks like. I think though you can make a decision about, am I going to use these tools or am I going to stick my head in the sand and try to find a way around them? I think probably the way to go for it is spend your evenings for two weeks vibe coding and messing around with AI, so that you have some idea of how you might utilize it. Because within two or three years, we’re going to have multi-billion dollar companies or billion-dollar companies with one to three employees, I’m very confident in that. They’ll just use agents to fill a lot of roles, like CFO and so on. People are already doing this. I wouldn’t get too hung up on that. Although I would say, if I were to play the counterpoint, that the soft skills that I was mentioning earlier, negotiating, deal-making, this is a very intrinsically human interaction. REZA SATCHU: Human thing. TIM FERRISS: It’s very rare that you’re just going to be able to send pitch emails with the deal structure and you’re like, “Yes or no, thumbs up?” With this emoticon based on my AI chatbot, like, “Great. Let’s do a deal.” Typically, not how it works, especially as the stakes get bigger, which don’t mean they’re huge, that they’re just consequential for whoever you’re dealing with. That stuff I don’t see going away anytime soon. BRIAN KENNY: I want to give time. We’re coming close to the end of our time. I’ve got one more question for each of you, but before we do that, Tim, maybe you want to tell people about your latest venture? Because I think there are some takeaways, some giveaway items. TIM FERRISS: Yeah, if people want, so this is a very off menu thing. BRIAN KENNY: It’s just like the Oprah Show. You’re going to get something to take with you. TIM FERRISS: Yeah, exactly. It’s not a car, but it’s something else. I ended up collaborating with this guy, Elan Lee, who’s one of the world’s best game designers for the last two years to create a card game for off-screen social interaction. That’s my current project, is a card game of all things. I could explain why I chose that, but the biggest one was the who. This Elan Lee, where I was like, “I would pay to just hang out with this guy.” He’s such a soulful, deep thinker, who’s ethical and also happens to be a polymath, top 1% in multiple fields. I was like, “I just want to steep myself in whatever magic juju this guy has.” That’s how fundamentally I made the decision. Yeah, there are games up there, it’s called COYOTE. Then, beyond that, I do have an 800-page draft of a book. That’s not an overstatement. I’ll be whittling that down over the next six months probably. That’s been like eight years in the making. It’s been sitting back there for a long time. There’s other stuff going on. BRIAN KENNY: That’s awesome. Now, this has been a great conversation. I knew it would be. I was so excited to do this today. Before I let you go, I’ll ask the same question of each of you, and I’ll start with you, Tim, and I always give the professor the last word because it’s Harvard Business School, but it’s a pretty simple question. TIM FERRISS: Reza is pretty good at getting the last word anyway. BRIAN KENNY: I think that’s true. REZA SATCHU: That’s true. That is definitely BRIAN KENNY: If you just think about the case, you’ve lived it, what lessons do you think emerging founders should take from the case about navigating similar inflection points in their own journey? TIM FERRISS: Let’s see. I’m going to give credit to a mentor of mine named Ed Zschau. He was a professor of mine at Princeton, taught really the first entrepreneurship class that I’m aware of, “High-tech Entrepreneurship,” ELE 491. Still have all my notes from the class. He used to teach at HBS and then jump-started this entrepreneurship program at Princeton. He was congressman from Silicon Valley, former competitive figure skater, took a couple of companies public. Was one of the first, if not the first computer science teacher at Stanford, even though he had no computer science background. It was like somebody else dropped out and they’re like, “Can anybody else teach this class? He was like, “Oh, I’ll figure it out.” Back in the day. In his last class, I think I’m getting the name of this song right, but he actually gets up and he sings this song. I’m going to do it my way. The whole point is everybody’s making up everything by and large. There is no one right way to do it. I think that what I would hope people to take from my very bizarre case study, and I say that, I couldn’t have been prouder and happier with how everybody put it together, Denise and Reza and so on, is that you don’t have to follow the prescription, whatever the prescription is. You don’t have to meet the expectations, whatever the expectations are. You just don’t have to do it. There are a lot of ways to improvise and zig and zag. As long as you’re not too calcified around what you consider your identity. You just have to be really careful with painting yourself into a corner with that. That’s what I would hope people to take from it, is just there is a lot of room to improvise and maneuver. People ask me a lot, for instance, I’ve done these 800 plus interviews on the podcast, and they’re like, “What are the commonalities?” I’m like, “The greatest commonality is there are no commonalities.” It’s like for every incredible writer who gives me one set of advice, I sit in front of the screen, even if it’s blank for 10 hours a day, chained myself to the desk. To, B.J. Novak of The Office and movies and all sorts of stuff, he was like, “Yeah, I really need to get into the mood.” It’s like, “I’ll have my cappuccino, I’ll read the paper, I’ll do this thing. I really need to be in the right state to write.” They’re both doing amazing jobs, and they have diametrically opposing advice, which means you can figure out what rules and what stories work for you. I would just say mess around. You have your whole life to be safe and conservative and not politically. You get the idea. Like color within the lines. I guess you could have the rest of your life to be conservative too politically. But the point is, there will never, in my opinion, be a better time for you guys coming out of HBS to just embrace your weird self and try some of the stuff that is going to get harder to do later. REZA SATCHU: Look, I think that’s extremely well said. Tim, when we wrote this case study, in some ways it’s probably the longest case study because he’s got so many things going on. My students are probably like, “This is a 20-plus page story.” It’s everything from dancing, to an author, to podcasts, to all sorts of things. If I had to summarize it, I’d want two takeaways. One is, live a life full of curiosity and allow yourself to explore the things that you’re curious with. Whether that’s these experiments, small C commitments, just suspend disbelief and trust your judgment to actually explore things that you’re curious in. The upside is far greater than the downside. That’s the first point. The second point is, I really think Tim’s risk framework is very interesting. In some ways you hear a story and you immediately think, “Well, this guy is embracing risk at every turn.” It’s actually the opposite. He understands that he has to live a life with risk, but he’s actually thinking really hard about how to calibrate it. The way he does that is by actually understanding that his downside is nowhere near as bad as we all think it is. It’s defining his fears, which allows him to hopefully do something extraordinary because he’s shifting what the outcome could be. I think that is really, I would say those are, trust your curiosity and embrace risk, but calibrate it appropriately and understand that, especially coming out of a school like Harvard, your downside is nowhere near as bad as you think it is. TIM FERRISS: I’d love to add just a few things real quick. The risk mitigation stuff and thinking about that, if people are interested, I wrote these a long time ago, but it’s a two-part blog post series called How, I think it’s just “How I Created a Real World MBA.” Related to how I tiptoed my way into angel investing. REZA SATCHU: Well, this is your angel investing. TIM FERRISS: I think that’s worth, I think people in this room might find that an interesting read. The second is really study the outliers. Because if anyone has done it, there is the possibility that you could also do it or chart your own path. A book that you might not expect, it’s one called The Art of Possibility, I think the author’s last name, it’s by a husband and wife duo, Zander, Z-A-N-D-E-R. It’s very fast read, amazing book. There are a lot of book recommendations I could give, but that’s a fast one that I would encourage people to check out. Really study the outliers, like Yvon Chouinard, the early chapters, the early chapters, or if you think of someone who’s a risk-taker, like Richard Branson, read Losing My Virginity. It’s like at every turn that guy is hedging risk and minimizing and mitigating risk. It’s remarkable how good he is at capping downside. I would just say, study the outliers. There are a lot of ways to tiptoe into things to figure out a signal very, very quickly at low cost. BRIAN KENNY: I think that’s a good note to end on.

Title: Tim Ferriss at a Career Crossroads: How Should He Shape His Next Chapter?

Full Content:
Author, podcaster, and angel investor Tim Ferriss considers what to do next to meet his career and life goals. In April 2024, writer, podcaster, and entrepreneur Tim Ferriss—known for his hugely popular podcast “The Tim Ferriss Show” and NYT-bestselling books like The 4-Hour Workweek—found himself at a crossroads. Although his podcast was generating millions annually, he questioned the sustainability of podcasting and his own competitive advantage given the increasingly saturated market and the advent of AI tools and video-centric formats. Plus, he had built his career on anticipating cultural shifts in knowledge work, health, and media consumption while making early angel investments in companies like Uber, Shopify, Facebook, and Twitter. But his podcast’s reliable cash flow also funded his science-focused foundation, so making any shifts would be very consequential. He faced a difficult choice: innovate from within his proven format, pivot to entirely new ventures—possibly in film, premium consumer products, or venture capital—or risk a slow decline by maintaining the status quo. Complicating matters further was Ferriss’s desire to start a family, a goal he prioritized above all business ventures. Every month of indecision narrowed his window for successfully transitioning. Senior Lecturer Reza Satchu and Tim Ferriss joined Cold Call host Brian Kenny to discuss the case, “Tim Ferriss: What Might This Look Like If It Were Easy?” in front of a live audience on October 7, 2025 in Harvard Business School’s Klarman Hall auditorium. Using “The Founder Mindset” framework from the course created by Satchu, they explore testing assumptions, calibrating risk, and how to choose the next path in the face of multiple options—which can often lead to inaction. BRIAN KENNY: Welcome to Cold Call, the podcast where we dive deep into the stories behind groundbreaking Harvard Business School case studies. Tim Ferriss has been called the Oprah of Audio. His podcast, the Tim Ferriss Show, surpassed a billion downloads and reshaped the digital media landscape. Yet at the height of his success, Ferriss found himself at a crossroads. With podcasting becoming a crowded competitive space, he wondered whether the medium that had defined his career was still the best vehicle for his curiosity, creativity, and impact. How should a creator who has always thrived by reinventing himself decide what’s next? Especially when personal priorities, like starting a family, collide with professional ambitions. Today, on Cold Call, I’m joined by Professor Reza Satchu and case protagonist Tim Ferriss to discuss the case, “Tim Ferriss, What Might This Look Like If It Were Easy?” I’m your host Brian Kenny, and you’re listening to a live taping of Cold Call coming to you from Klarman Hall on the campus of HBS, Harvard Business School. Make some noise, folks. All right, can we have a warm welcome for our guests? Reza Satchu teaches entrepreneurship at Harvard Business School, including the Founder Mindset and Founder Launch, both courses that he created. He is also a serial entrepreneur, having founded multiple highly successful ventures. Reza, welcome. REZA SATCHU: Thank you very much. Thanks for having us. BRIAN KENNY: Tim Ferriss, the subject of today’s case is a bestselling author, entrepreneur, speaker, and early stage investor. You may have heard that he hosts a podcast. Tim, welcome. TIM FERRISS: Thanks. Thanks for having me. Hi, everybody. BRIAN KENNY: It’s great to have you here. I’m a little nervous actually because your podcast gets a lot of listens, so I want to make sure that we do this right. TIM FERRISS: I’m sure you’ll be fine. You have a better voice for radio. We were both commenting, the intonation and delivery. I thought it was so good. I was like, man. BRIAN KENNY: Why don’t we just dive right in? Reza, I’m going to start with you. Can you tell us what drew you to Tim’s story? Why did you think it was a good subject for a case study, particularly for the Founder’s Mindset class, and what makes it particularly relevant for aspiring founders today? REZA SATCHU: Yeah, so look, I think I was thrilled. Actually, my research associate who’s here, Denise Koller, came up with the idea of interviewing Tim. Initially, I thought, “Does this make sense?” The more I got to know Tim and study his work, his mindset is exactly in sync with some of the things that we’re trying to get our founders to think about, starting with, he imagines a world that doesn’t exist today. He imagines that there are things he can do that are different than are existing today. He imagines a space where he can actually think about something, take a series of actions, trust his judgment, and hopefully build something of consequence. So many people stop at that first point, which is, how could I possibly do something different? It started really there, where I thought, “Here’s someone who has done many different things well, trusted his judgment.” Really, that’s a key part of being a founder. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. Tim, let me turn to you the case. Like any good HBS case, it opens up with you thinking pensively about what you’re going to do. You’re probably staring out a window looking at something. I’m wondering, actually, if you can take us back to where the case opens up, where you’re mulling through what your options are. You’ve got a lot of options right now and you’re thinking about what the best thing is. What was going on, what was your mindset at that time? TIM FERRISS: Yeah, I was actually literally looking out, in Austin where I recorded my podcast. I would say fundamentally it was, number one, has this become a crowded red ocean where other people can do this, what I started off doing in 2014. If there are one or more people who can do what I can do, I’m like, “Well, this seems redundant.” I would prefer to do something that is more of a category of one, to borrow from the 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing. There wasn’t a financial pressure to stop. Certainly, there was a little bit of pressure to continue because it funds the foundation, it funds the angel investing, it pays for the bills and employees and so on. But it was more a question of, is this the game I want to play? We’re all playing games past a certain point, past the lowest rungs on Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. Then, beyond that, it’s being aware of what game you’ve currently opted into, what are the rules, what are the wind conditions, the failure modes. Then, authoring something that hopefully stacks the deck in your favor. That’s a lot of what I was thinking about. The entire landscape had become too saturated. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, and so you described this in the case as blue oceans versus red oceans. Reza, if you can talk about, in the Founder Mindset framework, how does Tim’s approach to pattern recognition and assumption testing compare to other founders? REZA SATCHU: I think there’s a critically important point on Tim’s mindset, and how I think it resonates with the Founder Mindset, is people think of committing to an idea as jumping off a cliff into shark-infested waters, and that somehow being a founder is full of risk, full of uncertainty. You close your eyes and you just hope and pray for the best. Okay, I can’t tell you how flawed that is. I’m a serial founder. I will tell you I think about risk all the time. I calculate risk and I’m not paralyzed by it. The key is actually making decisions in the face of risk. What Tim does with what he calls these assumptions or these experiments, he effectively is trusting his judgment to do some things. Nothing terribly consequential, but enough to get data to figure out whether or not he should continue pursuing his curiosity. He gives himself permission to go down a pathway of his curiosity, whereas, most people never give themselves that permission because they just think, “How could I possibly have this idea when others have so many more resources?” I call it “small c commitments.” He calls it these “two-week experiments,” but it’s this idea that he’s willing to suspend disbelief that others haven’t thought of this idea, and that he’s willing to actually test his ideas and dip his toe in before he jumps in. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. Tim, for you, a lot of this began back when you wrote The 4-Hour Work Week, was that 15 years ago, give or take? TIM FERRISS: Almost 20, 2007, back when I had hair. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, that book challenged a lot of assumptions at that time. I’m wondering what assumptions you were testing as you wrote that book, and how do you weigh the risks and opportunities of coming out with something that seems a little audacious? TIM FERRISS: The first part I would say is simply asking questions that address some of the assumptions underlying traditional, let’s just call it, or conventional career planning. The deferred life plan. What would you do if you could not do that? If you could not rely on that. Which by the way is more and more relevant with some of the technologies that are coming. But if you couldn’t rely on that, exactly, as a social contract, what would you do? Then, it just led into lots of my own experiments. That was largely autobiographical. Then, teasing out the principles that allowed me to automate, and at the time use virtual assistants, that would be replaced by a lot of AI right now. That’s the first part. It was testing assumptions, but not just in a theoretical capacity. It was saying, “All right, I tried this thing, it didn’t work. I did this, it did work. I did this, it kind of worked, and here’s how I got it to really work. Here’s how you might think about dipping your toe in the water.” One critical part of that book that I think sometimes gets missed is cultivating a bias towards action. There are these exercises at the end of almost every chapter called Comfort Challenges. It’s just doing things that are very uncomfortable socially. There’s really no risk involved. This is not from the book, but my friend Noah Kagan talks about the Coffee Challenge, where people have to go in, order a coffee, and then ask for 10% off without giving any explanation, and just like, deal with that. It’s amazing. You see these people are like multiple-time founders or HBS grads, they’re pacing. They’re like, “Oh, it’s easy.” They’re pacing around the coffee shop for 30 minutes trying to build up the courage to do it. It’s like, “Yeah, that stuff helps.” From realizing that most stumbles or non-issues to begin with. In terms of presenting something that was contrarian, I first of all pitched the book. It’s a long story as to how I even got to the book, because I never wanted to write a book, but it was turned down by something like 29 publishers, violently. Some of the rejection letters were worthy of framing. Then, Steve Ross and Heather Jackson, at Crown, which was an imprint of Random House at the time, my pitch had been polished after getting rejected 29 times, literally, this is not an exaggeration. They were like, “Sure, kid. We’ll pay you pennies on the dollar to try this.” Their downside risk was very low. I had, as a younger person, I was published when I was 29, but at that time it’s like, what are your advantages? You can take stock of your advantage. At that time, it’s time, it’s speed, experimentation. You don’t have some permanent record of strikes that follows you around everywhere. I think you can afford to experiment. For me, it was ultimately an exercise in writing a book, and the only time it started to click was when I basically wrote it as I would write an email to two very particular friends after two glasses of wine. I threw out two drafts of that book, and then it unfolded, and that bought me permission to do a lot of other things. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, it worked out in the end, didn’t it? TIM FERRISS: It did work out. It’s not the end yet, so we’ll see. BRIAN KENNY: Reza, I had a chance to sit in on your class today, which was really interesting, and thank you for letting me do that. You talked a lot about failure, particularly in the beginning part of the class. What’s the Founder’s Mindset where it comes to being able to get rejected 29 times and still go back and ask for another publishing deal? REZA SATCHU: Okay, so first of all, just on failure, I think human psychology, is you often overestimate your downside, and I think to Tim’s point, you also massively underestimate your ability to recover. People imagine failure as this terrible thing that, oh my God, if this happens, it will be awful. Certainly, sitting here with the HBS students, what you’re doing is looking left and right and wondering, “Oh, my God, these people are going to think I’m a failure.” When in reality they’re barely going to think about you at all, but people are really stressed about that. I think the broader component around failure is not only do you overestimate what failure is, but by not putting yourself in positions of failure, two things don’t happen. One is you don’t learn. You don’t learn what happens through that failure. But the second thing is, I don’t know if this is what happened here, but people actually, when they look at someone who has stayed committed 29 times, I have this phrase which is like, magic happens when you commit, which is it’s not just you learn what you’re capable of. Other people show up precisely because they see the commitment. What people often misprice is that piece of the right tail upside. I think failure is a wonderful thing. I think a life without failure is a terrible life. It’s just a life where you don’t learn what you’re capable of. I think there needs to be a fundamental reframing of failure. Tim, I’d love you to talk about your concept of these one-way doors, irreversible law, like how you price risk, what does risk actually mean to you? TIM FERRISS: Yeah, I can speak to that. I also want to add something I left out of the question around The 4-Hour Work Week. There we go. I’ll let you take it. Just because people are rejecting your idea does not mean it’s a good idea. Just to state the obvious. REZA SATCHU: That’s true. TIM FERRISS: I agree with Paul Graham, Co-Founder of Y Combinator, who wrote an essay roughly around, the more labels you apply to yourself, the dumber you are. If you pride yourself on being contrarian, you’re actually just conforming to an anti-consensus. You’re actually still suffering from a really heavy form of bias. In my case, the reason I persisted through those 29 rejections was that the material that was going to be in the book, I had workshopped with, I don’t know, a thousand students at Princeton doing guest lectures at the invitation of my former professor. I had refined it, refined it like a stand-up comedian working on his 60-minute set, and I knew it worked. REZA SATCHU: Right, so you had an informational advantage. TIM FERRISS: I asked for feedback forms after every class. I had all these annoying pointed questions that students didn’t want to fill out. I knew that for a particular demographic it worked, and that’s why I persisted. If I had not had that data, I don’t think I would’ve persisted. I wouldn’t have had any grounds for plowing head in that way. Then, in terms of risk, I think there’s a lot to be said. I’m echoing Scott Galloway here, but choosing where you’re going to live and operate actually is a really important, sometimes more so than what you’re going to do. Moving to Silicon Valley was incredibly liberating because people fail all the time and they’re never counted out. I’ve invested in so many founders who failed the first time and then, boom. REZA SATCHU: Back at it. TIM FERRISS: Right? StumbleUpon, I was an advisor, didn’t work out. That was a zero for me as an advisor. But then, Garrett Camp a few months later was like, “Hey, I have this idea.” Turned it into Uber. People are never counted out. Being in an environment where that is the case matters a lot. It doesn’t have to be Silicon Valley, although that’s the most obvious. Risk for me, put simply, would be the probability of an irreversible negative outcome. There are some cases where that’s part of the calculus, but typically, I thought about making a journal. I seriously contemplated doing this because everyone’s making a journal now, but I went to the bookstore, I was like, “There are too many journals, I’m not going to do it.” But the journal was going to be called “worries that mostly didn’t happen.” It’s just like you just write down what you’re worried about and then you look back three months later, and again, none of that actually mattered. The cost of “failure” is very low for most things. You can also get a signal, positive or negative, go or no-go, pretty quickly if you’re methodical about it. I try to view, reframe failure, as scientific feedback. You have a hypothesis, you test it, it didn’t pan out, still valuable. If you’re optimizing for learning and relationships that transcend any given project, experiment, company, job, et cetera, those things snowball over time. If you’re keen on doing short-term experiments but long-term greedy, it’s very hard to lose, in my opinion. From what I’ve seen, and this is based on Silicon Valley, so it’s maybe anomalous, but it’s really hard to fail over the long term. REZA SATCHU: The amazing thing about this failure point is if you just think about two different career trajectories, one is a more traditional career trajectory. Let’s pick on consultants because, why not? There’s no real risk of failure. You’re going to get 95 things out of a hundred right on that path. On the Founder path, you are getting most things wrong. You’re asking people for money, they’re saying no. You’re asking customers to transact with you, they’re saying no. You’re trying to hire people, they’re saying no. You’ve got no resources. You’re constantly surrounded by a life of failure. You’ve just got to decide which life sounds better. What you suddenly realize is, wow, well, a life without failure, it’s hard to imagine having the impact that you all want to have, or having the return that you all want to have. I really think this point around risk really ties into failure, which is first of all, you need to reframe risk as a really great thing. Without risk, there’s no return. Risk is a good thing. It is not what you immediately think of, which is, “Oh, I want to stay away from it.” You need risk. Okay? What that doesn’t mean is that you’re jumping off a cliff. What it means is you understand how to operate in terms of risk. You need to incorporate some of the frameworks that you’ve talked about in class today to measure and calibrate it. But Tim’s not writing these books if he’s not willing to encounter risk. TIM FERRISS: Yeah, the 4-Hour Body, still recovering from some injuries from that one, 2010. Just had a surgery on this elbow as a result of that book. REZA SATCHU: Everyone must have thought that was a crazy idea. TIM FERRISS: It was crazy. But to use the 4-Hour Body as an example, the 4-Hour Work Week bought me permission to experiment outside of that lane, and so I did the 4-Hour Body in totally different category. Because the upside of that was so high if it opened the door to me writing books on any subject. The downside was that book doesn’t do well, and I go back to milking this 4-Hour, whatever the hell work week. The downside risk was very, very limited. I would also say that I think my experience with great schools, my experience with analytical people in general, is that they’re very good at thinking about all the possible downsides of doing the new thing or doing the “risky thing”. But they don’t spend as much time thinking about the cost of inaction or the status quo or taking the safe route. If you telescope out six months, a year, three years, five years, what are the emotional costs, financial, maybe relational, et cetera. It turns out when you start to look at these two options with equal weight, that the potentially safer route is just as fraught with all sort of problems as the supposedly risky route. Then, it’s like, “All right, I might as well do the weird thing first.” BRIAN KENNY: Did you ever worry about your brand though, the Tim Ferriss brand? If I do something that’s too contrarian, I may lose some of my brand cachet. TIM FERRISS: I don’t think about brand really at all, which isn’t to fault anyone who does, but I think brand is one of those words that can be a siren song for lots of decisions that compromise. I don’t want to say necessarily integrity and values, although it can be that, but you can be captured by, in my case, like an audience who rewards you for your most outlandish comments. If you follow that incentive structure on something like YouTube, you can wear a mask for so long that you become that mask. I’ve seen that happen to people, and you can’t hit control Z on that very easily, so I don’t think about brand. I pay a lot of attention to truly following my curiosity. When I do say a six, I do these two week experiments, but they’re generally within the context of a six to 12-month project. When I’m in that six to 12-month project, I am all in. I am completely saturated in it. I just find that there are a lot of ways to approach this. There’s no one way for everybody, but most of the hiccups along the way are just little toe stubs. But you have to get used to taking the hits. In other words, it’s like, if you were to go to a boxing class and you’ve never done boxing before and you get hit in the liver with a punch, it’s not even a hard punch. It’s going to be really shocking and unpleasant. If you do it for six months, you’ll be like, “Okay, yeah, I’m going to get 50 of these today. It’s fine.” You get over it, but you have to train your immune response, your stress response to this stuff. The only way to do that is by getting out there and trying stuff. REZA SATCHU: Brian, this is what’s so valuable to Founders, is exactly this, which is what they’re getting is hit all the time, but they’re learning that they can recover much faster through those hits. TIM FERRISS: Yeah. Could I add one more thing? REZA SATCHU: Yeah, of course. TIM FERRISS: I’ll give you an example. I remember the first time that I got, sadly, this is just a tax in the US, my first frivolous lawsuit, I got sued by somebody who was completely, it’s laughably ridiculous. I was so stressed out, I couldn’t sleep, and my publisher was involved, all this craziness. It was filed by the law firm that sued Subway for having 11 and a half inch foot long subs. So I’m dealing with all this and it’s tearing me up inside. Then, I was having a conversation with this friend of mine who’s been on multiple public boards. He’s in private equity for a super long time, very, very good investor. He’s like, “What?” He’s like, “This is the first time you’ve been sued.” He’s like, “I should sue you.” He’s like, “Welcome to the club.” He’s like, “What are you so upset about?” I was like, “What are you talking about?” I tried to justify it, and he’s like, “Ah. It’s fine.” I was like, “Oh, okay.” You just realize that a lot of the things you might contemplate now that you think are very big, huge problems, you can fix. A lot of it is just par for the course. REZA SATCHU: What do you think of this right to recover or what do you think human psychology is around recovery? Do people underestimate or overestimate their ability to recover? TIM FERRISS: I think it depends a lot on who you’re talking to, right? It’s like, if we’re talking to a bunch of refugees who had made hard choices. Then, I would say they probably accurately estimate their adaptiveness. REZA SATCHU: Ability. Yeah. TIM FERRISS: Their ability to adapt. I would say people who have, and this was me for a long time, executed to plan in a system where the rules are known, it’s more or less complete information, like higher education. It’s like, “Okay, great, you’re on the dean’s list, you’re summa cum laude, or whatever.” That those people underestimate their resilience, but I don’t actually think they’re wrong, because to develop the resilience you have to build some scar tissue. The only way you do that is by getting on the field. This sounds all abstract. It’s like, “No, okay, you want to change the world and build a billion-dollar company doing X?” It’s like, “All right, go talk to 10, go pitch 10 customers next week and ask them for money. As a dry run to get prepayment that will fund X, Y, or Z.” But don’t hide, and then I’m quoting Seth Godin, “But don’t hide behind the big.” Get out there and it’s going to be messy. BRIAN KENNY: Reza, I want to talk, so much of the case centers around optionality and all the options that Tim had in front of him, we talked about that a little bit upfront. I’m wondering, once you’ve achieved a certain level of success, a lot of opportunities open up. As a Founder, how do you sort through that? How do you think about what’s worth pursuing, what you shouldn’t pursue? What’s the thought process there? REZA SATCHU: Yeah, so it’s interesting. In my life, as someone who’s founded a few businesses, in some ways, the most recent businesses are harder, surprisingly. One would say, “Well, it’s easier because you’ve got more resources, more expertise, you have less hunger, and you have much more options. It’s not as critical that it has to succeed.” I teach and I found a business at the same time. That’s crazy. Most people would say that is not an optimal way to found a business. Whereas, my first couple of businesses, there’s no way I’d be teaching and founding a business. I’d be fully focused on founding. I think this idea that it gets easier, it might get easier from an expertise perspective, but suddenly you’ve got what I call the curse of optionality, which is you’ve got a number, and Tim, you’re facing some of this right now, frankly, this paradox of choice, which is precisely because of the success you’ve had you’ve got a whole bunch of choices. He mentioned Seth Godin, who’s a wonderful writer, who we interviewed for the case, and he said to Denise and me that we need to lock Tim in a room or in a cabin, and he needs to pick an option. Of course, what he was saying was that the world will be a much better place if Tim commits to something. As opposed to maximizing all of his options. I do think this curse, and for the students, people listening, I think that many of you will fall into this trap of preserving options for far too long and not knowing what you’re capable of when you commit. I’ve not had money and I’ve had money. Not having money is somewhat liberating because you just know what you need to do. When you have options, and those options could be a Harvard Business School degree, you suddenly start thinking, “Well, maybe I can preserve those options for a very long time.” I’m curious, Tim, I would ask you this question, which is you’ve got a whole bunch of options ahead of you. Here’s what I know to be true, is if you committed to one, I’m sure it will be far more impactful than if you preserve all of them. TIM FERRISS: Yeah, that’s true. I agree with that, but I would also say a few things. Number one is that you can validate or invalidate something really quickly. We were talking about this a bit earlier, but I was chatting with a student who was talking about maybe the safer route to finance and then less safe perhaps in entertainment, film potentially. I was saying, I’m saying, “All right, you know what’s going to really get attention, is if you’re an HBS grad who offers to shadow a show runner or a producer in pre-production on a movie, and you’re like, “Nothing is beneath me. Cleaning toilets, getting your coffee, I don’t care.'” It’s like, “All I want to do is observe some deal making and see what goes into making a film.” It’s like, “You can figure out if that is actually your dream or not very, very quickly. You might be completely allergic to it, but you can figure that out after a week of being in the pre-production office.” That’s number one. REZA SATCHU: But are you also suggesting that because that’s a differentiator, meaning, there’s something that it says about you, that you’re willing to do that? TIM FERRISS: Here’s my experience. Even though you might feel there’s very little time and a big rush, there’s not a big rush. You can take time to have these little detours and try things. The second is that even though I’m doing some different things, let’s just say angel investing newsletter foundation focused on mental health therapeutics, nonprofit, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. There’s actually a way in which they reinforce one another. I will use, say, the podcast to interview scientists based on science I’m interested in to determine if I think they’re a good candidate for the foundation, or potentially, it doesn’t have to be a scientist. If I find that their personality is compatible enough and their idea is compelling enough that I want to make an investment in their company. I can use that as a discovery mechanism then for sourcing. I would say, also it depends on how much… Preserving all of your options also is just an illusion. You can’t really do that. The nature of making a decision, it’s like incision, decision to cut away. You are by definition cutting off a lot of paths, which I do for six to 12 months at a time. But you can have a few things, in my case, running at the same time in parallel. I would say optionality might not be all you think it is. If I look at hundreds of people I’ve interviewed on the podcast who are by any measure top performers in their fields, one of the most common comments or concepts that comes up is the power of positive constraints. Positive constraints, commit. It doesn’t have to be commit forever. It shouldn’t probably be commit forever, unless you’re the person who knows at age five that you want to do X. If you’re that, I don’t know, maybe you wouldn’t be here. REZA SATCHU: Positive constraints means cutting off options, in some sense? TIM FERRISS: It means cutting off options, or it could be anything. If you’re writing, it could be a space or page constraint. It could be, I have to write this all in third person or first person. REZA SATCHU: Well, it’s also your comment around, if I’ve got a problem, I will only solve it by taking something away. TIM FERRISS: Right, so in the case of the podcast, I found myself starting to drag my feet because it’s a very saturated marketplace. One of my key advantages that I had early on, besides just starting pretty early in 2014, was my research and the ability that I had to dig and find things that were interesting. Now, you can go in ChatGPT and say, “Give me 10 questions in the style of Tim Ferriss or Lex Friedman or Joe Rogan interviewing this person.” Boom, you’ll get good answers. That advantage has effectively disappeared, and there are a lot of ways to potentially respond to that. But for me, number one, I’m generally not looking for the cutting edge. I’m looking for dull edge. I want to see some proof of concept before I do angel investing or before I do some hare-brained thing, like make a card game, which some of you may have or not. That’s sitting up at the top for anybody who wants a copy. I think that fundamentally a lot of it comes down to asking yourself, how do you maximize for… I know this is, again, it’s so simple, but if you maximize for learning and relationships that transcend whatever that single project or job is, this is particularly effective if you are in a place like San Francisco. I don’t want to sell San Francisco. It’s pretty dirty and filthy. But I think if you were going to choose projects and you decided as a thought exercise to rank order the parameters as who, like who am I directly observing and working with? Then, where, and then what/sector, that actually comes last, I think you could end up with some pretty interesting options on the menu. BRIAN KENNY: We haven’t talked about impact, but I know that’s an important part of the thing that you cover in Founder’s Mindset. Can you talk a little bit about the idea of thinking about impact at the outset and not at the end of the journey? REZA SATCHU: I think so many people fall into this trap. I think I fell into this trap early in my career, which is my life is going to be in these stages. The impact stage will be that last piece of my life when I’ve learned a lot, when I’ve had the benefit of resources, all these sorts of things. The problem is there’s two problems. One is you may or may not be around for that last piece. BRIAN KENNY: Never know. REZA SATCHU: But the second point is it turns out that actually having impact along the way, and I love the way you describe it, which is start with the small things. Start with the people in your life that you’re… We all have these, especially here, have these visions of grandeur around having massive impact. Well, I’d say the most important way to do that is to actually start living a life of impact right away and on the small things. I think that, Tim, when you talk about, so what I view learning, what I view learning as, because a lot of people talk about you want to maximize learning, which I completely agree, and I’d be curious how you define learning. Okay, so I’m going to propose what my definition of learning is, and you tell me whether this, because I think it’s an important concept because learning is… If you had to say, what is the thing that is going to most correlate with impact, it would be learning. He who learns, he or she who learns the most is going to attract the most credibility, resources such that they can have the impact that they most desperately want. I define learning in the age of AI as the spot where you’re making… it’s all about decision making. Meaning, the trait we are most trying to learn is judgment. Judgment occurs when you’re making consequential decisions that you’re accountable for. You must live a life where you’re pushing yourself to make decisions, some of which will be wrong, some of which will be right, in order to build the thing we most want, which is judgment. Okay, so I’m curious to know your thoughts about that. TIM FERRISS: Learning, there’s how to learn, and then there’s what to learn. If you’re looking at say, who to work with, and then the where, and then the what, right? There are certain skills that are not going to transfer. It’s like, okay, if you’re in the waste management business and you’re understanding the ins and outs of waste management, I’m just making that up because I like unsexy stuff, that may not transfer to your hot shot AI startup for whatever, customer service. But if you are observing, this is an old school example, like a Wayne Huizenga. REZA SATCHU: Yeah, Wayne Huizenga. They don’t know who Wayne Huizenga is. TIM FERRISS: I know. REZA SATCHU: You and I know who Wayne Huizenga is. TIM FERRISS: I know, waste management, then Blockbuster, which went extinct back in the Pleistocene era, but that guy was a master deal maker. If you’re able to watch someone acquiring dozens and dozens of companies, and how that entire dance is woven, that transfers. If you’re learning how to communicate, let’s just say, I’m making this up, you work for Cards Against Humanity. This is a very popular game as some of you may know, they were really, really good at PR stunts. If you work at that company when it is small and you’re involved with all of those PR stunts, which fundamentally are thinking about positioning and differentiation, that will apply to everything. It’s just asking yourself, where could this transfer? Where could this apply? Then, that’s the stuff that you focus on. For me, it’s in a sense meta skills, that if you were to copy and paste, you take somebody, look, it doesn’t matter. Well, I’ll give you actually maybe a more contemporary example, like Jeff Bezos. All right. What is Jeff Bezos’ superpower? I would say that it is having longer time horizons than almost everybody else, and defending and justifying and reiterating that in every shareholder letter. He trained Wall Street like a domesticated puppy, like a puppy. REZA SATCHU: From day one, yeah. TIM FERRISS: Talk about just incredible persuasion and the pro sleight of hand and also just business mastery. But the point is, if you have a longer time horizon than other people, that’s a huge competitive advantage also in and of itself. If you can be around someone who exemplifies that, because I can say that, and you’re like, “Okay, I got it.” But it’s like, do you really? You need to see how that is emphasized over and over again. Or, like a Herb Kelleher at Southwest. Would I have loved to have worked for that guy? Would I have quit my tech job to work for him? Absolutely, because such a maniacal focus on being the low cost airline. I remember he was interviewed at one point and he said to the journalists, because they were saying how hard it was, what he did, and he’s like, “No, you can do my job.” Then, he’s like, “All right, give me a situation.” They gave him a situation. He’s like, “All right, does that help us to be the low cost airline or not?” They’re like, “No.” He’s like, “Yeah, that’s a no.” He’s like, “Okay, next one.” He’s like, “Yeah.” If you have the focus, but you need to be around people who are doing that and living it so you can see it in different contexts. This is going to sound bizarre because I’m thinking about adopting another dog. But there’s an expression in dog training, which is basically if the dog hasn’t done it, say a behavior, shaping a behavior in 20 different locations, 20 different durations, they don’t have that behavior. It’s not durable. Humans are the same. It’s conditioning. Having the opportunity to work with someone where you see certain characteristics exemplified; certain behaviors, certain principles enacted that can be applied to different businesses, man, I think that’s an incredible shortcut. But you and I have different perspectives on this. I think working for a startup’s a fantastic way to learn on someone else’s dime with the understanding that- BRIAN KENNY: That’s our youngest audience member, by the way. TIM FERRISS: Yeah. Start them young. Start them young. REZA SATCHU: It’s true. What I’d say, I think just, look, I think the question is, in the age of AI, what are the traits that we can teach people? I think that the challenge is that things like memorization and observation are far less valuable. What is valuable is this elusive thing called judgment. The real question is, how do we get it? I think, yeah, you can get it by watching someone else, but how you really get it is by doing it yourself. Actually being in the arena, making those decisions. One of the things you said, Tim, which is very interesting to me, because I have a similar phrase, when you said you have a bias for action. I have a phrase which is, if in doubt, act, which immediately people say, “Well, wait, Reza, you don’t know what you’re doing, you’re going to act?” No, the reason I say that is because so many people are paralyzed by imperfect or uncertain information, and so they’re like deer in headlights. What I suggest is, even if you’re going to stay the course, train yourself to make a decision that you’re actually staying the course, which is a bias for action. I’m curious how you think about, bias for action is, it feels risky. I’m curious how you view that. TIM FERRISS: What I would say is I have a tendency… My mom literally got me a shirt that says, ”Wait a second, let me overthink this.” My tendency is to, I don’t want to say perseverate, but over consider the ramifications of a lot of decisions. It’s been a practice of conditioning myself to be like, all right, what if I tried what Reid Hoffman of LinkedIn and so on has done, where he wants to enable his chief of staff to act quickly enough that they roughly get things wrong 10% of the time. That’s literally a guideline that he uses with his chief of staff. He says 10% footfall, which is a little confusing because it’s a tennis reference. Anyway, but I think applying that to your own life where you’re like, all right, what can I put on automatic, just no decision autopilot default, number one, where can I just completely remove decisions? Sometimes that’s with diet, exercise. You don’t want to get up in the morning and decide which of 20 toothpaste tubes you’re going to use. You have your toothpaste and you just deal with your toothpaste. Similarly, you could extrapolate that and apply it to giving employees autonomous decision-making power and creating a culture where you actually reward screw-ups. I literally met with, I was having a blood draw this morning because I’m in Boston for proteomics assay. Anyway, it’s a long story. But they have a dedicated discord within the company for celebrating bleep-ups basically. That are not egregious. It’s also like, all right, how do we not do this again? But people get rewarded for ambition, mistakes of ambition, not mistakes of sloth, which is straight from Machiavelli, so I’m not sure how I feel about that. But in any case, I don’t know about also… I got stuck on the AI stuff again, because I don’t know, I wish I could give everybody and myself a strategy for making yourself AI proof. I don’t know what that looks like. I think though you can make a decision about, am I going to use these tools or am I going to stick my head in the sand and try to find a way around them? I think probably the way to go for it is spend your evenings for two weeks vibe coding and messing around with AI, so that you have some idea of how you might utilize it. Because within two or three years, we’re going to have multi-billion dollar companies or billion-dollar companies with one to three employees, I’m very confident in that. They’ll just use agents to fill a lot of roles, like CFO and so on. People are already doing this. I wouldn’t get too hung up on that. Although I would say, if I were to play the counterpoint, that the soft skills that I was mentioning earlier, negotiating, deal-making, this is a very intrinsically human interaction. REZA SATCHU: Human thing. TIM FERRISS: It’s very rare that you’re just going to be able to send pitch emails with the deal structure and you’re like, “Yes or no, thumbs up?” With this emoticon based on my AI chatbot, like, “Great. Let’s do a deal.” Typically, not how it works, especially as the stakes get bigger, which don’t mean they’re huge, that they’re just consequential for whoever you’re dealing with. That stuff I don’t see going away anytime soon. BRIAN KENNY: I want to give time. We’re coming close to the end of our time. I’ve got one more question for each of you, but before we do that, Tim, maybe you want to tell people about your latest venture? Because I think there are some takeaways, some giveaway items. TIM FERRISS: Yeah, if people want, so this is a very off menu thing. BRIAN KENNY: It’s just like the Oprah Show. You’re going to get something to take with you. TIM FERRISS: Yeah, exactly. It’s not a car, but it’s something else. I ended up collaborating with this guy, Elan Lee, who’s one of the world’s best game designers for the last two years to create a card game for off-screen social interaction. That’s my current project, is a card game of all things. I could explain why I chose that, but the biggest one was the who. This Elan Lee, where I was like, “I would pay to just hang out with this guy.” He’s such a soulful, deep thinker, who’s ethical and also happens to be a polymath, top 1% in multiple fields. I was like, “I just want to steep myself in whatever magic juju this guy has.” That’s how fundamentally I made the decision. Yeah, there are games up there, it’s called COYOTE. Then, beyond that, I do have an 800-page draft of a book. That’s not an overstatement. I’ll be whittling that down over the next six months probably. That’s been like eight years in the making. It’s been sitting back there for a long time. There’s other stuff going on. BRIAN KENNY: That’s awesome. Now, this has been a great conversation. I knew it would be. I was so excited to do this today. Before I let you go, I’ll ask the same question of each of you, and I’ll start with you, Tim, and I always give the professor the last word because it’s Harvard Business School, but it’s a pretty simple question. TIM FERRISS: Reza is pretty good at getting the last word anyway. BRIAN KENNY: I think that’s true. REZA SATCHU: That’s true. That is definitely BRIAN KENNY: If you just think about the case, you’ve lived it, what lessons do you think emerging founders should take from the case about navigating similar inflection points in their own journey? TIM FERRISS: Let’s see. I’m going to give credit to a mentor of mine named Ed Zschau. He was a professor of mine at Princeton, taught really the first entrepreneurship class that I’m aware of, “High-tech Entrepreneurship,” ELE 491. Still have all my notes from the class. He used to teach at HBS and then jump-started this entrepreneurship program at Princeton. He was congressman from Silicon Valley, former competitive figure skater, took a couple of companies public. Was one of the first, if not the first computer science teacher at Stanford, even though he had no computer science background. It was like somebody else dropped out and they’re like, “Can anybody else teach this class? He was like, “Oh, I’ll figure it out.” Back in the day. In his last class, I think I’m getting the name of this song right, but he actually gets up and he sings this song. I’m going to do it my way. The whole point is everybody’s making up everything by and large. There is no one right way to do it. I think that what I would hope people to take from my very bizarre case study, and I say that, I couldn’t have been prouder and happier with how everybody put it together, Denise and Reza and so on, is that you don’t have to follow the prescription, whatever the prescription is. You don’t have to meet the expectations, whatever the expectations are. You just don’t have to do it. There are a lot of ways to improvise and zig and zag. As long as you’re not too calcified around what you consider your identity. You just have to be really careful with painting yourself into a corner with that. That’s what I would hope people to take from it, is just there is a lot of room to improvise and maneuver. People ask me a lot, for instance, I’ve done these 800 plus interviews on the podcast, and they’re like, “What are the commonalities?” I’m like, “The greatest commonality is there are no commonalities.” It’s like for every incredible writer who gives me one set of advice, I sit in front of the screen, even if it’s blank for 10 hours a day, chained myself to the desk. To, B.J. Novak of The Office and movies and all sorts of stuff, he was like, “Yeah, I really need to get into the mood.” It’s like, “I’ll have my cappuccino, I’ll read the paper, I’ll do this thing. I really need to be in the right state to write.” They’re both doing amazing jobs, and they have diametrically opposing advice, which means you can figure out what rules and what stories work for you. I would just say mess around. You have your whole life to be safe and conservative and not politically. You get the idea. Like color within the lines. I guess you could have the rest of your life to be conservative too politically. But the point is, there will never, in my opinion, be a better time for you guys coming out of HBS to just embrace your weird self and try some of the stuff that is going to get harder to do later. REZA SATCHU: Look, I think that’s extremely well said. Tim, when we wrote this case study, in some ways it’s probably the longest case study because he’s got so many things going on. My students are probably like, “This is a 20-plus page story.” It’s everything from dancing, to an author, to podcasts, to all sorts of things. If I had to summarize it, I’d want two takeaways. One is, live a life full of curiosity and allow yourself to explore the things that you’re curious with. Whether that’s these experiments, small C commitments, just suspend disbelief and trust your judgment to actually explore things that you’re curious in. The upside is far greater than the downside. That’s the first point. The second point is, I really think Tim’s risk framework is very interesting. In some ways you hear a story and you immediately think, “Well, this guy is embracing risk at every turn.” It’s actually the opposite. He understands that he has to live a life with risk, but he’s actually thinking really hard about how to calibrate it. The way he does that is by actually understanding that his downside is nowhere near as bad as we all think it is. It’s defining his fears, which allows him to hopefully do something extraordinary because he’s shifting what the outcome could be. I think that is really, I would say those are, trust your curiosity and embrace risk, but calibrate it appropriately and understand that, especially coming out of a school like Harvard, your downside is nowhere near as bad as you think it is. TIM FERRISS: I’d love to add just a few things real quick. The risk mitigation stuff and thinking about that, if people are interested, I wrote these a long time ago, but it’s a two-part blog post series called How, I think it’s just “How I Created a Real World MBA.” Related to how I tiptoed my way into angel investing. REZA SATCHU: Well, this is your angel investing. TIM FERRISS: I think that’s worth, I think people in this room might find that an interesting read. The second is really study the outliers. Because if anyone has done it, there is the possibility that you could also do it or chart your own path. A book that you might not expect, it’s one called The Art of Possibility, I think the author’s last name, it’s by a husband and wife duo, Zander, Z-A-N-D-E-R. It’s very fast read, amazing book. There are a lot of book recommendations I could give, but that’s a fast one that I would encourage people to check out. Really study the outliers, like Yvon Chouinard, the early chapters, the early chapters, or if you think of someone who’s a risk-taker, like Richard Branson, read Losing My Virginity. It’s like at every turn that guy is hedging risk and minimizing and mitigating risk. It’s remarkable how good he is at capping downside. I would just say, study the outliers. There are a lot of ways to tiptoe into things to figure out a signal very, very quickly at low cost. BRIAN KENNY: I think that’s a good note to end on.

Title: Broadcom Stock Retreats After Soaring on OpenAI Deal—Monitor These Key Price Levels

Broadcom (AVGO) shares dropped Tuesday morning, giving back a portion of the big gains posted yesterday following news that the chip giant had forged a deal with ChatGPT maker OpenAI. The company said it would collaborate with OpenAI on the development of artificial intelligence accelerator and network systems for delivery from 2026 to 2029. The announcement comes just a week after rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) inked a deal with the San Francisco-based AI start-up. Broadcom shares were down nearly 4% at around $343 in recent trading, tracking a broader move lower for U.S. equities, after surging 10% on Monday. Investors have bid up the stock, which has risen about 50% since the start of the year, amid surging demand for custom AI chips as enterprises build out their AI capacity. Below, we take a closer look at Broadcom’s chart and use technical analysis to identify key price levels worth watching out for. After hitting their all-time high last month, Broadcom shares retraced toward the 50-day moving average (MA) before attracting buying interest near the respected indicator. Buying in the stock accelerated yesterday on the highest trading volume in over a month, a move that also coincided with the relative strength index (RSI) reclaiming the 50 threshold to signal a return of bullish price momentum. Let’s point out two key overhead areas to watch on Broadcom’s chart and also identify important support levels worth monitoring during profit-taking episodes. Buying from current levels could initially see a move up to around $374. Tactical traders who have bought the recent pullback may look to lock in profits in this location near the stock’s record high, especially if the RSI simultaneously moves into overbought territory. If the shares enter price discovery mode, investors can forecast a possible overhead target to watch by using bars pattern analysis, a technique that analyzes prior price action to project future directional movements. When applying the analysis to Broadcom’s chart, we take the uptrend from late August to early September and reposition it from last month’s low. This forecasts a bullish target of around $415, implying 16% upside from Monday’s closing price. We selected this prior move as it followed an earlier dip to the 50-day-MA in August, providing clues as to how a new trend higher from the indicator may take shape if price action rhymes. The first support level worth monitoring sits around $324. This area on the chart could attract buying interest near the September and October lows, which currently closely align with the rising 50-day MA. Finally, selling below this important level could spark a more significant drop to the $291 level. Investors could look to accumulate Broadcom shares in this region near a trendline that connects a range of corresponding trading activity on the chart between July and September.

Title: Stock market ‘concentration risk’ now higher than dot-com bubble period, IMF warns
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/10/14/stock-market-concentration-risk-now-higher-than-dot-com-bubble-period-imf-warns/
Time Published: 2025-10-14T14:15:00Z
Full Content:
Market valuations have “become stretched”, increasing the probably of a “disorderly correction”, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned. In its latest Global Financial Stability update, published alongside its half-year report on the global economy, the Washington-based fund highlights the concentration risk within the US’s S&P 500 index from the so-called magnificent seven stocks (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Tesla and Nvidia). It noted that the information technology sector accounted for a weight of 35 per cent of the total S&P 500, similar to during the dot-com bubble of the 1990s, but this time just seven stocks accounted for 33 per cent of the index. That meant the concentration risk “was now substantially higher than during the dot-com bubble”. Many analysts believe stock markets, particularly in the US, are on the brink of major negative correction following an investment glut in artificial intelligence (AI). AI-related companies have accounted for around 80 per cent of US stock market gains this year. [ Negative impact of tariffs starting to show, IMF warnsOpens in new window ] In its report, the IMF said the rebound in global equity prices since US president Donald Trump’s April tariff announcement had outpaced expected future earnings. Despite recent economic data trending negative, markets appear to be downplaying the potential effects of US tariffs on growth and inflation, it said. Global financial markets “have largely brushed off subsequent shocks and uncertainties,” it said, noting financial conditions across most regions have eased back to “accommodative levels”. But it warned “the apparent calm masks a degree of complacency.” “Despite trade tensions, geopolitical uncertainties, and rising concerns about sovereign indebtedness, asset prices have returned to stretched valuations and financial conditions have broadly eased,” it said. “Against substantial AI-related investments, the possibility of mega-cap stocks failing to generate expected returns to justify current lofty equity valuations could trigger deterioration in investor sentiment and make the stocks susceptible to sudden, sharp correction,” the IMF said. An analysis of sovereign bond markets also highlighted “growing pressure from widening fiscal deficits on the functioning of markets,” it said. [ Why is the US economy so much stronger than Europe’s?Opens in new window ] In advanced economies, sovereign bond markets are increasingly dependent on price-sensitive investors, it said. “Stress in core bond markets, although a tail risk, could have broad and disruptive ramifications for financial markets, given bonds’ role as key benchmarks and collateral,” it said. In its report, the IMF also highlighted the weakness of the US dollar “Overall, the dollar has depreciated by about 10 per cent so far this year against major currencies,” it said. “Analysts have put forth a number of possible drivers for dollar weakness, from a revaluation of dollar strength amid concerns over the US fiscal position to a shift in allocation away from US-dollar-denominated assets driven by concerns about US policy uncertainty,” it said.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. On Monday, October 13, stocks moved decisively higher, as seen in the S&P 500 rising 1.56%, the Dow 30 rising 1.29%, and the Nasdaq 100 rising 2.18%. Most stocks saw buying, though some stocks missed out. The following table shows the list of 10 stocks that generated the highest returns on the last trading day: On the other hand, the following table shows the list of 10 stocks that generated the lowest returns: Why does this matter? Significant stock moves - up or down - deserve your attention. Sharp declines in fundamentally strong names can offer smart buying opportunities. And when momentum aligns with solid fundamentals, riding the trend can be highly rewarding. In above, we find Humana (HUM) Attractive while Broadcom (AVGO) looks Attractive but Volatile. Single stock can be risky, but there is a huge value to a broader diversified approach we take with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. We go beyond just equities. Is a portfolio of 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto in addition to equities and bonds - likely to return more during the next 1-3 years, and protect you better if markets crash 20%? We have crunched the numbers. Analysing over the last one week (5 trading days), weakness was evident in the S&P 500 falling 1.27%, the Dow 30 falling 1.34%, and the Nasdaq 100 falling 0.91%. The pullback was broad, but select names remained resilient. The following table shows the list of 10 stocks that generated the highest returns over the last week: Similarly, the following table shows the 10 stocks that were at the bottom in terms of returns: On a slightly wider timeline over the last one month, stocks moved decisively higher, as seen in the S&P 500 rising 1.07%, the Dow 30 rising 0.51%, and the Nasdaq 100 rising 2.73%. Most stocks saw buying, though some stocks missed out. The following table shows the 10 stocks that generated the maximum returns over the last one month: In the same period, these 10 stocks were at the bottom in terms of returns: Picking winners on a consistent basis is not an easy task - especially given the volatility associated with a single stock. Instead, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming its benchmark that includes all 3 - the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Sell RKLB Stock At $65?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Rocket Lab’s (NASDAQ: RKLB) stock has garnered considerable investor interest in 2025, climbing over 150% year-to-date. Trading at about $65, this extraordinary surge reflects an increasing optimism surrounding the company’s Neutron rocket program and its growing involvement in the commercial space sector. Nevertheless, under this excitement lies a valuation dilemma: the company is trading at a price-to-sales ratio of 66.5x—more than twenty times the S&P 500’s 3.2x multiple. For investors contemplating entry at these levels, the pivotal question is whether this momentum is supported by fundamentals or primarily fueled by speculation regarding future prospects. Based on traditional valuation metrics, this premium seems challenging to rationalize. We’ll explore the company’s financials in the sections that follow. That said, if you are looking for an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like RKLB, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns greater than 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; they avoided the drastic fluctuations, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Separately, see – How BBAI Stock Rises To $20? The company’s financial profile exposes stark inconsistencies: Despite its unprofitability, Rocket Lab possesses a strong balance sheet that allows them to pursue growth investments: The stock has shown moderate resilience amid market volatility. While it dropped 82.8% during the 2022 inflation crisis (more severe than the S&P 500’s 25.4% decline), it rebounded to pre-crisis levels by November 2024 and has since continued to rise. See more – Buy or Sell RKLB Stock? Our evaluation focuses on past performance and current fundamentals, which suggest RKLB is overvalued. Nonetheless, we may be mistaken in this evaluation, and investors might be inclined to accept a higher valuation multiple for the stock’s future potential, especially concerning the Neutron rocket program. The Neutron rocket signifies a strategic advancement into the medium-lift launch market, potentially positioning the company to compete more effectively with SpaceX’s Falcon 9. If this program succeeds, it could significantly enlarge Rocket Lab’s addressable market and alter its financial dynamics. The company’s solid balance sheet offers the financial endurance to realize this vision without immediate pressure for profitability. That being said, investing in a single stock without thorough analysis can be perilous. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has surpassed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to deliver strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks has offered a responsive way to capitalize on favorable market conditions while minimizing losses during downturns, as explained in RV Portfolio performance metrics. Rocket Lab is deemed expensive when assessed against present operations—a company losing nearly 46 cents for every dollar of revenue while being valued at 66.5x sales. For investors concentrated on traditional value metrics, this introduces considerable downside risk. Nonetheless, for those who have faith in the company’s technological prowess and the transformative potential of its Neutron program, the existing valuation may signify fair compensation for engaging in the commercial space industry's growth trajectory. Ultimately, the investment decision rests on whether one is acquiring historical performance or prospective opportunities.

Title: How JOBY Stock Falls To $3?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/14/how-joby-stock-falls-to-3/
Time Published: 2025-10-14T13:33:45Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Joby Aviation stock (NYSE: JOBY) has captivated Wall Street with its vision of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft transforming urban transportation. The stock has experienced a remarkable rise, increasing by over 200% from under $6 a year ago to approximately $17 now. What’s driving the excitement? It’s a blend of future mobility enthusiasm and momentum. Firstly, there’s the overarching narrative of electric vehicles and sustainable transportation that has taken the markets by storm. Secondly, the concept of the “flying taxi” has investors envisioning a sci-fi future coming true. Thirdly, Joby has been making strategic advancements – forming partnerships with major entities like Delta Air Lines and Toyota, reaching certification milestones, and generating news that maintains the excitement. The firm has positioned itself as a leader in the burgeoning eVTOL market, announcing progress on FAA certification and expanding its manufacturing capabilities. However, here’s the sobering reality – while electric air taxis appear to be the future, that future is still years away from significant commercial operations and generating revenue. Joby continues to be a pre-revenue entity, depleting cash reserves as it strives for certification and commercialization. Naturally, it’s incurring losses – aerospace development is one of the most capital-intensive industries. For context, the company's operating cash flows were -448 million, with an operating loss of $638 million in the previous twelve-month period. That said, if you are looking for an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like JOBY, you might consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has yielded returns exceeding 105% since its inception. What’s the reason for this? As a collective group, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered better returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; a smoother ride, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Separately, see – How BBAI Stock Rises To $20? We agree that next-generation mobility stocks are focused on future growth, and the potential market for urban air mobility is vast. See our perspective on – Why Archer Aviation Is Positioned To Become The Uber of Air Travel. However, have you ever considered the downside risks? Think about it logically. There are numerous risks that could undermine Joby’s stock growth, and when things go awry, such speculative stocks don’t just dip – they plunge. This isn’t merely a theory. Let’s examine what occurred with JOBY during the inflation shock of 2022 when the Fed raised interest rates aggressively. The stock plummeted a staggering 79.7% from its peak of $15.70 in February 2021 to $3.18 by December 2022, while the S&P 500 fell only 25.4% from peak to trough. Consider that for a moment – JOBY dropped more than three times worse than the overall market. This highlights the distinction between speculative pre-revenue stocks and genuine businesses with real cash flows and profits. Yes, the stock regained its pre-crisis peak by July 2025 and even climbed to $20.39 in August, but that recovery took place during one of the most favorable environments for risk assets. What will occur when the cycle flips again? So what’s the actual downside risk for JOBY stock from its current price of $16.80? If history serves as a guide, it’s a possible decrease of approximately 80% or more, bringing the stock back to the $3-4 range. Are you ready for it? This isn’t fearmongering about JOBY – it's what transpired in 2022. The stock plummeted 80% from its peak to trough. And the fundamental risk profile hasn’t changed significantly. The company is still pre-revenue, still experiencing cash burn, now facing substantial dilution from the $500 million equity raise, still years away from significant commercialization, and primarily trading based on hope and future potential instead of current business fundamentals. The next time markets experience a risk-off scenario – be it due to inflation, recession, geopolitical crises, or any other shock – high-flying pre-revenue stocks often lead the decline. An 80% drop from current levels would bring JOBY to around $3.36, uncannily close to where it hit bottom in December 2022. If this level of risk makes you anxious, you might want to consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. What accounts for this? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks has provided an effective way to capitalize on favorable market conditions while limiting losses when markets decline, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics. The intent of this analysis is to inform investors of the actual downside risk associated with JOBY stock. It may or may not occur. However, the risk is undoubtedly substantial. The firm remains pre-revenue in one of the most capital-intensive and heavily regulated industries in the world. The recent $500 million equity raise – while prolonging the cash runway – significantly dilutes existing shareholders and emphasizes that commercialization and profitability are still aspirations. Understand that you are not investing in a profitable business; you are betting on eVTOL technology receiving certification, gaining public acceptance, achieving profitable operational scale, and Joby emerging victorious in a market characterized by fierce competition from well-capitalized rivals. Ultimately, it boils down to whether you can tolerate what the downside volatility might resemble if matters don’t unfold as anticipated with Joby. An 80% drawdown isn’t hypothetical – it has already occurred once. The question isn’t whether JOBY can decline that much again. The inquiry is: when the next market shock hits, are you ready to see your investment possibly drop by 80% or more?

Time Published: 2025-10-14T13:16:40Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. From quantitative point of view, The 68.7% change in Netflix (NFLX) stock from 10/13/2024 to 10/13/2025 was primarily driven by a 25.8% change in the company’s Net Income Margin (%). There is more to this story than just numbers, but first, let's break down the stock price movement into its contributing factors. That is one way to look at stocks. Trefis High Quality Portfolio evaluates much more, and is designed to reduce stock-specific risk while giving upside exposure. Coming back to the "change": The change in fundamental factors such as valuation, revenue and margins, has an underlying business and investor sentiment story behind it. Below, we have identified key developments that influenced stock price movement for NFLX stock. Before that, as a quick background: NFLX provides TV series, documentaries, films, and mobile games in multiple genres and languages to over 222 million paid members across 190 countries. Opinion: We currently find NFLX stock relatively expensive. Why so? Have a look at the full story. Read Buy or Sell NFLX Stock to see what drives our current opinion. Risk: That said, Netflix isn’t immune to big sell-offs. It plunged about 56% in the Global Financial Crisis and took a 44% hit in the 2018 correction. During the Covid pandemic, the drop was smaller but still notable at 23%. The worst was the inflation shock, where it fell close to 76%. So even with solid growth and a strong brand, NFLX can get hit hard when the market shakes. Quality cushions the fall but doesn’t fully prevent steep losses. Picking winners on a consistent basis is not an easy task - especially given the volatility associated with a single stock. Instead, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Stock futures and bitcoin are sliding this morning, while gold continues hitting new highs, as investors keep an eye on developments related to trade tensions with China and await a speech by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell; quarterly results from major U.S. banks are coming in better than analysts had anticipated; GM shares are down after the automaker revealed a $1.6 billion charge over weakness in its EV business; and shares of rare earth miners continue surging following China’s announcement of trade restrictions on the high-tech materials. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are pointing to a lower open after major indexes rebounded Monday from a steep downturn to close out last week, as concerns linger about trade tensions between the U.S. and China, the world's two largest economies. Investors this morning are digesting earnings reports from major banks and are awaiting remarks from Fed Chair Powell, who is due to speak this afternoon on the outlook for the economy and interest rates. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down 0.7% recently, while those linked to the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-focused Nasdaq dropped 0.9% and 1.2%, respectively. Bitcoin was also down sharply after yesterday's rally, sliding to $111,300 in recent trading from an overnight high of around $116,000. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which affects borrowing costs on an array of consumer loans, fell to 4.02%, its lowest level in a month. Precious metals continue rising as many investors turn to safe-haven assets amid increasing stock market volatility and economic uncertainty. Gold futures were up 0.4% at $4,150 an ounce in recent trading, after hitting a record high of just under $4,200 earlier in the session. (Read here about how the surge in gold prices—the price of the precious metal is up nearly 60% since the start of the year—is leading a growing number consumers to sell gold jewelry, coins and other items.) Silver futures were also trading at an all-time high this morning, rising slightly to around $50.50 an ounce. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) reported better-than-expected earnings as the banking giant led a string of reports from major financial institutions. JPMorgan shares were up slightly in premarket trading after the bank reported a 9% rise in revenue and a 12% jump in profits as increased stock trading helped boost the results. Wells Fargo (WFC) shares rose 3% ahead of the bell after the bank reported strong net interest income and raised its profitability target. Goldman Sachs (GS) also reported revenue and earnings that came in ahead of expectations, though its shares dropped about 2.5%. Citigroup (C) shares were up 1% after its results beat estimates. General Motors (GM) said that its quarterly earnings next week will include a $1.6 billion charge associated with its electric vehicle business. The move comes after the U.S. ended its $7,500 tax credit for EV purchases. “Following recent U.S. Government policy changes, including the termination of certain consumer tax incentives for EV purchases and the reduction in the stringency of emissions regulations, we expect the adoption rate of EVs to slow,” the automaker said in a filing. GM shares were down about 2% in premarket trading. Shares of U.S. rare earth mineral mining firms continued to gain in premarket trading after China threatened to restrict exports of the materials that are critical for high tech products. Shares of USA Rare Earth (USAR) were up 12% after gaining 19% yesterday. MP Materials (MP) shares were up 7% ahead of the bell, after soaring 21% in the prior session.

Title: From code to concrete: The new TCS playbook to build factories that power AI

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Mumbai/Bengaluru: There was no high-decibel government event, or even an investor roadshow. The message was tucked inside K. Krithivasan’s prepared remarks, in a recent media release. India’s largest IT services exporter, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), the company Krithivasan now heads, is preparing for the biggest gamble of its five-decade existence: a massive $6.5 billion investment over six years to forge one gigawatt (GW) of new data centre capacity. Consider the sheer scale of ambition for a moment: This planned capacity alone is enough to match India’s entire current data centre base within six years, and the capital expenditure eclipses the combined value of all TCS acquisitions over the last two decades. That ambition also underlies a tectonic shift within TCS. For decades, the company exported code and consultancy, intangible services that powered global enterprises but left few physical footprints at home. Now, it is choosing to pour billions into concrete, steel and copper. The country’s most profitable IT exporter is turning inward, betting that India’s artificial intelligence (AI) revolution would need not just algorithms, but infrastructure. That shift is particularly striking given the group’s own history. Back in 2016, another Tata company, Tata Communications, effectively jettisoned its data centre play, deeming it “non-core." The sister concern sold 74% stake in its data centre business to a Temasek Holdings unit for $634 million. Three of those data centres were in Singapore; the rest across India. By last year, Tata Communications had divested its remaining 26%. Under chairman Cyrus Mistry, it seemed the group had moved on from the brick-and-mortar complexities of digital infrastructure. Under N. Chandrasekaran—the man who once put TCS on a high growth orbit—the pendulum has violently swung back. So when Krithivasan—himself a quiet engineer who inherited the corner office after Rajesh Gopinathan’s abrupt exit in 2023—outlined this unprecedented investment, it was more than a capex announcement. It signalled a philosophical reversal within the Tata ecosystem, a return to building the physical foundations of digital India. “The Tata Group companies are in power, real estate, project management businesses…So, there is a different kind of synergy we can build in here," Krithivasan said, during a call with analysts on 9 October. The timing, though, came against an uneasy backdrop. Ahead of TCS’s latest earnings, on 9 October, its stock was languishing near a 52-week low. Growth was tapering. Analysts at Motilal Oswal and Nuvama projected a full-year revenue decline—the first since TCS’s 2004 listing. The mood across India’s $283-billion IT industry was sombre. Global clients were trimming technology budgets, US visa restrictions had upended the traditional onsite-offshore model, and TCS had just confirmed the layoff of over 6,000 employees in the September quarter. In this subdued climate, the $6.5 billion commitment stood out as an act of economic courage, an attempt to reimagine TCS’s future rather than merely defend its margins. TCS did not respond to Mint’s detailed questionnaire seeking comments. April at the TajThe idea took shape earlier this year. In April, Chandrasekaran, who has been steadily integrating the Tata empire into a digital-industrial group, asked senior TCS executives to explore the data centre opportunity. It was a directive rooted in strategic timing as much as necessity. The same month, at a high-profile event in Delhi’s Taj Mansingh Hotel, TCS unveiled its ‘sovereign cloud network’, a service designed to store and process data entirely within Indian borders in compliance with new data-localization rules. It was a logical extension of TCS’s IT services portfolio: the company already provided engineers, managed IT infrastructure, and offered private cloud services. What it lacked was real estate—the physical layer of computing power that anchored the digital world. View Full Image In April this year, TCS unveiled its sovereign cloud network. (iStockphoto) That gap is precisely what the new investment aims to close. Data centres are the factories of the AI age—vast, secure facilities that house the servers, networking equipment and cooling systems needed to process and store the petabytes of data generated every day. India’s regulatory mandates and digital explosion have created a perfect storm of demand. The Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, now requires payment data to be stored domestically; the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the markets regulator, has similar stipulations for market participants. As 5G networks roll out and connected devices multiply, the volume of data produced by consumers, vehicles, and industrial systems is surging. Add the rise of generative AI, and the need for high-speed computing infrastructure becomes existential. TCS believes it can monetize this infrastructure in two ways: leasing capacity to hyperscalers such as Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure, and using it for its own contracts with governments and enterprises. The company’s first 150 MW facility, to be built at a cost of $1 billion, is expected to go live within 18 months. Different from AccentureThe move also marks a clear break from how TCS’s global peers have evolved. Accenture, the $70-billion consulting giant, has doubled down on advisory-led AI and analytics rather than infrastructure. Its bet is that the profits lie in algorithms, not assets. Indian peers like Infosys and HCL Tech have largely taken the same path, positioning themselves as service orchestrators on top of third-party cloud platforms. On 13 October, HCL Tech announced that it had won $100 million in revenue from AI operations in the September quarter, making the Noida-based company the first among Big Five to quantify revenue from AI technologies. TCS, by contrast, is wading into the physical side of that digital stack. It is a high-stakes pivot that could recast its risk profile and profit structure. “The beauty of the data centre business is its recurring stability," said one executive familiar with the plan. “But it will test patience before delivering cash returns." The executive did not want to be identified. Dividend resetThe patience required may be considerable. Unlike software projects, data centres are capital-intensive, slow to scale and operationally demanding. TCS’s decision to build rather than rent puts it in competition with hyperscalers and domestic real-estate developers alike. The company is entering a field already crowded with global giants—Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon—as well as Indian powerhouses such as Reliance, AdaniConnex and Yotta. The irony is that, given its scale and client relationships, TCS should have been a natural candidate to own data centres years ago. Instead, it spent two decades returning wealth to shareholders— ₹3.66 trillion through dividends and buybacks since its listing. That generosity may now come at a cost. With the new investment cycle, margins could tighten, and dividend payouts to parent Tata Sons may moderate. Last year, TCS contributed 83% of Tata Sons’ income. Data centres can be bracketed into four types. First, there are the enterprise data centres, which are facilities owned and run by companies and houses their computing networks. A second category is hyperscale data centres, also known as Cloud data centres. Amazon and Microsoft own and manage these facilities. Edge data centres are the third category. Here, smaller facilities are set up closer to an organization, thereby improving speed, and are essential for real-time data processing tasks. Finally, there are the colocation data centres, a space TCS is venturing into. In this category, the data centre owner sets up the physical infrastructure, manages the facility, oversees the building, power, and cooling for the servers. The customer supplies and manages their equipment. View Full Image TCS is venturing into what is known as colocation data centres. McKinsey, a consulting firm, states that colocation data centres operate at lower profitability than cloud data centres. This is because the hyperscalers, who are the primary customers of colocation data centres, can negotiate better prices since they also set up and have their own facilities. The operating margins of Equinix and Sify, who run colocation data centres, are in the range of 22% and 19%, respectively. In comparison, the operating margins enjoyed by AWS and Azure are significantly higher, at 35-37%. Executives say TCS’s balance sheet can absorb the shock. The company generated ₹46,449 crore in free cash flow last year, more than enough to underwrite the initial phases. Yet investors accustomed to industry-leading operating margins (TCS ended with 24.3% in operating margin last year) may need to reset expectations. The stock’s 3.5% dip in three days following the announcement suggests the market is already doing so. “TCS management stated that each 150-megawatt build-out phase of the data centre will require $1 billion capex, for a $6.5 billion total investment. We think this direction could offer new potential revenue streams though could negatively impact margins," Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note dated 9 October. McKinsey states that colocation data centres operate at lower profitability than cloud data centres. This is because the hyperscalers, who are the primary customers of colocation data centres, can negotiate better prices. Returns are slow, and could take a decade. In addition, technology cycles move faster than depreciation schedules. “This is an asset-intensive industry where labour-arbitrage advantages don’t translate," said Peter Bendor-Samuel of Everest Group, a research firm. “Investors used to high-margin, low-capex returns will need to recalibrate." Analysts at JM Financial estimated revenue from 1MW of operational data centres in the first year to be about ₹22 crore. TCS’s target of having a 150 MW data centre operational by April 2027 implies an incremental business of ₹3,300 crore. A successful operational capacity of 1 GW in six years would translate to about ₹22,000 crore, similar to its India revenue of ₹21,958 crore last year. The 3% problemThe deeper question is why TCS waited until now. For years, Indian conglomerates like Reliance and Adani have been laying the groundwork for data centre dominance, tying these projects to their energy and telecom networks. The global hyperscalers, meanwhile, have been expanding capacity across India as part of their global grids. The Tatas, cautious and conservative, stayed on the sidelines. Part of that hesitation stemmed from perception. Data centres were once viewed less as cutting-edge technology and more as glorified real-estate plays—capital-heavy, regulatory-ridden, and operationally messy. They required land, reliable electricity, and long-term financing, all of which had tripped up the Tata Group before. For a company built on intellectual capital, the business felt foreign. What has changed is the scale of the opportunity. India today accounts for roughly 20% of global data generation but only about 3% of storage capacity. Its total installed capacity—around one GW—is precisely what TCS aims to build by 2030. Analysts at Cushman & Wakefield estimate that India’s data centre capacity will triple to 1,825 megawatt (MW) by 2027, driven by new data-localization rules and the country’s voracious digital appetite. States are competing fiercely for investment. Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Telangana are offering everything from electricity-duty waivers to land subsidies of up to 50%. Mumbai, with undersea cable landings and strong power grids, remains the favoured hub, but smaller cities are emerging as contenders. For TCS, whose domestic revenue still accounts for less than 10% of its total ($30.18 billion) but grew 62% last year—largely due to a ₹1.5-billion BSNL contract—the timing aligns with a broader strategic shift toward India-focused business. As global clients hesitate, India’s digital infrastructure push offers both stability and scale. The orchestraMeanwhile, the data centre gamble will not only test TCS’s financial muscle but execution capability as well. Building and operating data centres demands coordination across engineering, real estate, power management, and cybersecurity—far removed from writing code. Yet, this is where the Tata Group’s breadth could become a decisive advantage. TCS can draw on group companies such as Tata Power, Tata Communications, Nelco, and Tata Electronics for power supply, network connectivity, satellite links, and chip technology. That’s a web of synergies that rivals like Infosys or Wipro simply cannot replicate. “TCS has a unique opportunity to serve the broader Tata Group across businesses in telecom, networks, energy and cooling solutions," said Ramkumar Ramamoorthy, partner at Catalincs, a consulting firm. “It can cross leverage these capabilities across the conglomerate structure, something that other large IT companies don’t have." TCS can draw on group companies such as Tata Power, Tata Communications, Nelco, and Tata Electronics for power supply, network connectivity, satellite links, and chip technology. That’s a web of synergies. Still, competition will be fierce. To find its niche, TCS must differentiate not by sheer size but by integration—offering clients a seamless bridge between the data centre and the AI workloads that run on it. “TCS is not trying to compete with AWS or Azure on a raw scale," said Phil Fersht, chief executive of HFS Research, a consulting firm. “It’s trying to own the intersection of infrastructure and services—both the data centre and the AI models that sit on top. That’s where the value will lie." Such integration could also help TCS reposition itself in the eyes of investors. Global data centre operators like Equinix and Digital Realty command enterprise-value multiples of 20 to 22 times Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), higher than Indian IT firms’ price-earnings ratios. If TCS can credibly present itself as both a technology and infrastructure play, it could attract a new class of investors seeking exposure to digital infrastructure. Still, this is not a business for those seeking quick wins. Like we mentioned earlier, data centres are a low margin play. Yet for TCS, this may be less about margins than momentum. The IT industry is at an inflection point: AI threatens to commoditize traditional outsourcing even as clients demand end-to-end digital transformation. Owning infrastructure offers TCS a new strategic lever, a way to control the stack from physical data to cognitive intelligence. “TCS’ moat won’t be real estate—it will be orchestration," said Fersht. “By owning the infrastructure, it can combine data engineering and AI services under one roof." Krithivasan’s wager, then, is not for immediate approval but for long-term relevance. As India’s data centre capacity surges and its AI ambitions swell, the company is positioning itself at the intersection of both trends. If it captures even a modest slice of the coming capacity boom, TCS could evolve from an outsourcing icon into a domestic infrastructure powerhouse. For the Tata Group, too, this is a return to form. From steel and power to software and satellites, its empire has always thrived on long horizons. The data centre bet is merely the digital reincarnation of that legacy. For Krithivasan, the challenge is deeply personal. He took charge in a moment of flux—after a surprise leadership exit, in a slowing industry, with AI rewriting the rules of competition. Now he must steer a company known for intangible efficiency into a world of tangible assets and operational grit. If he succeeds, TCS will not just sell cloud services—it will own a piece of the cloud itself. Key Takeaways TCS will spend $6.5 billion over six years to develop 1GW of data centre capacity. This planned capacity alone is enough to match India’s entire current data centre base. The investment is driven by the explosion of demand for high-speed computing infrastructure due to AI, and India’s data-localization rules that require data to be stored within her borders. The move is enabled by the Tata conglomerate's breadth—TCS plans to leverage sister companies like Tata Power and Tata Communications for power supply and connectivity. This marks a fundamental reversal for TCS; it is shifting from being an asset-light exporter of intangible code and services to becoming a capital-intensive physical infrastructure player. But, data centres are a low-margin, capex-intensive business with slow returns. This risks diluting TCS’ margins, forcing investors accustomed to high dividend payouts to recalibrate expectations. The idea took shape earlier this year. In April, Chandrasekaran, who has been steadily integrating the Tata empire into a digital-industrial group, asked senior TCS executives to explore the data centre opportunity.

If he succeeds, TCS will not just sell cloud services—it will own a piece of the cloud itself. Key Takeaways TCS will spend $6.5 billion over six years to develop 1GW of data centre capacity. This planned capacity alone is enough to match India’s entire current data centre base. The investment is driven by the explosion of demand for high-speed computing infrastructure due to AI, and India’s data-localization rules that require data to be stored within her borders. The move is enabled by the Tata conglomerate's breadth—TCS plans to leverage sister companies like Tata Power and Tata Communications for power supply and connectivity. This marks a fundamental reversal for TCS; it is shifting from being an asset-light exporter of intangible code and services to becoming a capital-intensive physical infrastructure player. But, data centres are a low-margin, capex-intensive business with slow returns. This risks diluting TCS’ margins, forcing investors accustomed to high dividend payouts to recalibrate expectations. The move also marks a clear break from how TCS’s global peers have evolved. Accenture, the $70-billion consulting giant, has doubled down on advisory-led AI and analytics rather than infrastructure. Its bet is that the profits lie in algorithms, not assets. Indian peers like Infosys and HCL Tech have largely taken the same path, positioning themselves as service orchestrators on top of third-party cloud platforms. On 13 October, HCL Tech announced that it had won $100 million in revenue from AI operations in the September quarter, making the Noida-based company the first among Big Five to quantify revenue from AI technologies. TCS, by contrast, is wading into the physical side of that digital stack. It is a high-stakes pivot that could recast its risk profile and profit structure. “The beauty of the data centre business is its recurring stability," said one executive familiar with the plan. “But it will test patience before delivering cash returns." The executive did not want to be identified. Dividend resetThe patience required may be considerable. Unlike software projects, data centres are capital-intensive, slow to scale and operationally demanding. TCS’s decision to build rather than rent puts it in competition with hyperscalers and domestic real-estate developers alike. The company is entering a field already crowded with global giants—Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon—as well as Indian powerhouses such as Reliance, AdaniConnex and Yotta. The irony is that, given its scale and client relationships, TCS should have been a natural candidate to own data centres years ago. Instead, it spent two decades returning wealth to shareholders— ₹3.66 trillion through dividends and buybacks since its listing. That generosity may now come at a cost. With the new investment cycle, margins could tighten, and dividend payouts to parent Tata Sons may moderate. Last year, TCS contributed 83% of Tata Sons’ income. Data centres can be bracketed into four types. First, there are the enterprise data centres, which are facilities owned and run by companies and houses their computing networks. A second category is hyperscale data centres, also known as Cloud data centres. Amazon and Microsoft own and manage these facilities. Edge data centres are the third category. Here, smaller facilities are set up closer to an organization, thereby improving speed, and are essential for real-time data processing tasks. Finally, there are the colocation data centres, a space TCS is venturing into. In this category, the data centre owner sets up the physical infrastructure, manages the facility, oversees the building, power, and cooling for the servers. The customer supplies and manages their equipment. View Full Image TCS is venturing into what is known as colocation data centres. McKinsey, a consulting firm, states that colocation data centres operate at lower profitability than cloud data centres. This is because the hyperscalers, who are the primary customers of colocation data centres, can negotiate better prices since they also set up and have their own facilities. The operating margins of Equinix and Sify, who run colocation data centres, are in the range of 22% and 19%, respectively. In comparison, the operating margins enjoyed by AWS and Azure are significantly higher, at 35-37%. Executives say TCS’s balance sheet can absorb the shock. The company generated ₹46,449 crore in free cash flow last year, more than enough to underwrite the initial phases. Yet investors accustomed to industry-leading operating margins (TCS ended with 24.3% in operating margin last year) may need to reset expectations. The stock’s 3.5% dip in three days following the announcement suggests the market is already doing so. “TCS management stated that each 150-megawatt build-out phase of the data centre will require $1 billion capex, for a $6.5 billion total investment. We think this direction could offer new potential revenue streams though could negatively impact margins," Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note dated 9 October. McKinsey states that colocation data centres operate at lower profitability than cloud data centres. This is because the hyperscalers, who are the primary customers of colocation data centres, can negotiate better prices. Returns are slow, and could take a decade. In addition, technology cycles move faster than depreciation schedules. “This is an asset-intensive industry where labour-arbitrage advantages don’t translate," said Peter Bendor-Samuel of Everest Group, a research firm. “Investors used to high-margin, low-capex returns will need to recalibrate." Analysts at JM Financial estimated revenue from 1MW of operational data centres in the first year to be about ₹22 crore. TCS’s target of having a 150 MW data centre operational by April 2027 implies an incremental business of ₹3,300 crore. A successful operational capacity of 1 GW in six years would translate to about ₹22,000 crore, similar to its India revenue of ₹21,958 crore last year. The 3% problemThe deeper question is why TCS waited until now. For years, Indian conglomerates like Reliance and Adani have been laying the groundwork for data centre dominance, tying these projects to their energy and telecom networks. The global hyperscalers, meanwhile, have been expanding capacity across India as part of their global grids. The Tatas, cautious and conservative, stayed on the sidelines. Part of that hesitation stemmed from perception. Data centres were once viewed less as cutting-edge technology and more as glorified real-estate plays—capital-heavy, regulatory-ridden, and operationally messy. They required land, reliable electricity, and long-term financing, all of which had tripped up the Tata Group before. For a company built on intellectual capital, the business felt foreign. What has changed is the scale of the opportunity. India today accounts for roughly 20% of global data generation but only about 3% of storage capacity. Its total installed capacity—around one GW—is precisely what TCS aims to build by 2030. Analysts at Cushman & Wakefield estimate that India’s data centre capacity will triple to 1,825 megawatt (MW) by 2027, driven by new data-localization rules and the country’s voracious digital appetite. States are competing fiercely for investment. Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Telangana are offering everything from electricity-duty waivers to land subsidies of up to 50%. Mumbai, with undersea cable landings and strong power grids, remains the favoured hub, but smaller cities are emerging as contenders. For TCS, whose domestic revenue still accounts for less than 10% of its total ($30.18 billion) but grew 62% last year—largely due to a ₹1.5-billion BSNL contract—the timing aligns with a broader strategic shift toward India-focused business. As global clients hesitate, India’s digital infrastructure push offers both stability and scale. The orchestraMeanwhile, the data centre gamble will not only test TCS’s financial muscle but execution capability as well. Building and operating data centres demands coordination across engineering, real estate, power management, and cybersecurity—far removed from writing code. Yet, this is where the Tata Group’s breadth could become a decisive advantage. TCS can draw on group companies such as Tata Power, Tata Communications, Nelco, and Tata Electronics for power supply, network connectivity, satellite links, and chip technology. That’s a web of synergies that rivals like Infosys or Wipro simply cannot replicate. “TCS has a unique opportunity to serve the broader Tata Group across businesses in telecom, networks, energy and cooling solutions," said Ramkumar Ramamoorthy, partner at Catalincs, a consulting firm. “It can cross leverage these capabilities across the conglomerate structure, something that other large IT companies don’t have." TCS can draw on group companies such as Tata Power, Tata Communications, Nelco, and Tata Electronics for power supply, network connectivity, satellite links, and chip technology. That’s a web of synergies. Still, competition will be fierce. To find its niche, TCS must differentiate not by sheer size but by integration—offering clients a seamless bridge between the data centre and the AI workloads that run on it. “TCS is not trying to compete with AWS or Azure on a raw scale," said Phil Fersht, chief executive of HFS Research, a consulting firm. “It’s trying to own the intersection of infrastructure and services—both the data centre and the AI models that sit on top. That’s where the value will lie." Such integration could also help TCS reposition itself in the eyes of investors. Global data centre operators like Equinix and Digital Realty command enterprise-value multiples of 20 to 22 times Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), higher than Indian IT firms’ price-earnings ratios. If TCS can credibly present itself as both a technology and infrastructure play, it could attract a new class of investors seeking exposure to digital infrastructure. Still, this is not a business for those seeking quick wins. Like we mentioned earlier, data centres are a low margin play. Yet for TCS, this may be less about margins than momentum. The IT industry is at an inflection point: AI threatens to commoditize traditional outsourcing even as clients demand end-to-end digital transformation. Owning infrastructure offers TCS a new strategic lever, a way to control the stack from physical data to cognitive intelligence. “TCS’ moat won’t be real estate—it will be orchestration," said Fersht. “By owning the infrastructure, it can combine data engineering and AI services under one roof." Krithivasan’s wager, then, is not for immediate approval but for long-term relevance. As India’s data centre capacity surges and its AI ambitions swell, the company is positioning itself at the intersection of both trends. If it captures even a modest slice of the coming capacity boom, TCS could evolve from an outsourcing icon into a domestic infrastructure powerhouse. For the Tata Group, too, this is a return to form. From steel and power to software and satellites, its empire has always thrived on long horizons. The data centre bet is merely the digital reincarnation of that legacy.

Jim Edwards is the executive editor for global news at Fortune. He was previously the editor-in-chief of Business Insider's news division and the founding editor of Business Insider UK. His investigative journalism has changed the law in two U.S. federal districts and two states. The U.S. Supreme Court cited his work on the death penalty in the concurrence to Baze v. Rees, the ruling on whether lethal injection is cruel or unusual. He also won the Neal award for an investigation of bribes and kickbacks on Madison Avenue. A broad-based selloff swept global stock markets this morning after U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told the Financial Times that China “will be hurt the most” if it doesn’t submit to Washington’s trade demands. At the same time, China showed no signs of backing down from President Trump’s trade war: It imposed sanctions banning Chinese companies from doing business with the U.S. subsidiaries of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean. South Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.63% on the news. S&P 500 futures were down 0.87% this morning. The index opened the better part of 1% lower almost immediately. Markets in Asia and Europe were almost all down, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 off 2.58% and Europe’s Stoxx 600 down 0.49% by midmorning. Beijing’s new export controls on rare earth materials—which the U.S. is dependent on—are “a sign of how weak their economy is, and they want to pull everybody else down with them,” Bessent said. “Maybe there is some Leninist business model where hurting your customers is a good idea, but they are the largest supplier to the world,” he told the FT. “If they want to slow down the global economy, they will be hurt the most. “They are in the middle of a recession/depression,” he added, “and they are trying to export their way out of it. The problem is they’re exacerbating their standing in the world.” (China is, in fact, doing very well. Its exports rose 8.3% in September, and the World Bank expects China’s GDP to grow 4.8% this year. U.S. growth is forecast at 1.4%.) The mood among traders today is a stark reversal from yesterday, when the S&P 500 rose 1.56% after investors realized that Trump and China President Xi Jinping will likely meet at the upcoming APEC conference at the end of October—an opportunity for both men to reach one of Trump’s famous deals. Elsewhere, there wasn’t much to cheer up the markets. A third of bettors on Polymarket think the U.S. government shutdown will continue beyond Nov. 8. Pantheon Macroeconomics noted that consumer sentiment remains low: The University of Michigan’s consumer survey, which asks whether buyers feel now is a good time to make a major purchase, lately “points to year-over-year growth in this measure of core spending slowing to near-zero soon, a far cry from the 6% pace earlier this year,” according to Samuel Tombs and Oliver Allen. Goldman Sachs added to the gloom by publishing a note this morning titled “Jobless growth.” “The modest job growth alongside robust GDP growth seen recently is likely to be normal to some degree in the years ahead. We expect the great majority of U.S. potential GDP growth to come from solid productivity growth boosted by advances in artificial intelligence, with only a modest contribution from labor supply growth due to population aging and lower immigration,” authors Pierfrancesco Mei and David Mericle said. In the longer term, however, most analysts continue to see stocks going up, driven largely by the tech and AI sector. “Roughly half of this S&P 500 bull has been driven by just seven stocks: Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), Broadcom (AVGO), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia (NVDA),” Jeff Buchbinder and Adam Turnquist of LPL Financial told clients in a note. But “the Fed is in the middle of a rate-cutting cycle, and inflation appears to be under control despite increased tariffs, likely eliminating that as a potential bull market killer.” Here’s a snapshot of the markets this morning: © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Members Portal A pop quiz of trivia from the previous 19 years of Skeptoid shows! Can you beat the masters? Skeptoid Podcast #1010Filed under Feedback & Questions by Brian DunningOctober 14, 2025 Sponsor an episode! We've just celebrated the 19th birthday of Skeptoid — 19 straight years of weekly shows, and that's pretty cool. So experienced Skeptoid listeners know what that means for today's show: it's time for a pop quiz, with one question from each of the previous 19 years. And no, you don't have to have listened to every show for that long; you just need a good solid foundation of science literacy and critical thinking. Which obviously you have — or you wouldn't be a Skeptoid listener! Keep track of your score; we're going to give you a ranking at the end. So here we go. If you're listening with someone and find yourselves needing a moment to confer after any question, then you are encouraged to push the pause button and deliberate as long as necessary: Of the many pseudoscientific medical benefits professed by some sellers of wheatgrass juice is the false claim that drinking it can remove toxic heavy metals from your system. What medical procedure can actually do this? Reveal the answer The correct answer is A, chelation therapy. A chelating agent such as EDTA is administered intravenously and bonds to the heavy metal, which can then be excreted through the urine. American journalist Michael Drosnin shocked the world in 1994 with the publication of The Bible Code, in which he announced that he'd found many historic events foretold in the Bible using a previously undiscovered hidden code. What relatively simple encoding method did he claim was used? Reveal the answer The correct answer is C, Equidistant Letter Spacing. Pick a number, say 25, then take every 25th letter from a text. Those letters spell out your messages. Using computer programs, it's been found that virtually any short message you want can be found in virtually any long book-length text using this technique. Before this world's largest scientific instrument came online in 2010, crackpots everywhere were predicting that it would destroy the Earth, by either creating microscopic black holes, strangelets, or magnetic monopoles. It did not do any of those things — but it did help us discover the Higgs boson. Where is the collider located? Reveal the answer The correct answer is A, CERN, just outside of Geneva. Fears among the scientifically illiterate became so widespread that lawsuits seeking court orders to stop CERN were filed worldwide. All failed, as none of the plaintiffs were knowledgeable enough to demonstrate any credible threat. Everyone in the country hates changing our clocks twice a year. So what is, in fact, the real reason that we torment ourselves with Daylight Saving Time? Reveal the answer The correct answer is C, shopping. In much of the country, it's cold for half the year so nobody goes out shopping in the evening anyway; but they do in the summer. Giving them one extra hour before the retailers' closing times means more sales are made and more tax revenue generated. Half of you are going to argue with me on this and say it's one of the others, but the official reasons can be found in my references. In 1966, the Department of Transportation (which is in charge of this for some reason) created the Uniform Time Act of 1966 which stated this as "Convenience of commerce." This region of high radiation, where the inner Van Allen radiation belt dips closest to Earth, got some publicity in 2009 when some blamed its effects for causing the crash of Air France flight 447. Which of the following is true about the South Atlantic Anomaly? Reveal the answer The correct answer is C. The closest the Anomaly dips to the Earth is about 200 km, at which point it's very small; and the highest flying airliners might get as high as 15 km. About 19 years after the Bounty mutineers settled on Pitcairn Island, the island was visited by the crew of an American whaling ship. How many of the British sailors still survived? Reveal the answer The correct answer is C, one: John Adams. Of the nine British sailors, six Tahitian men, eleven Tahitian women, and one baby who had landed there, only Adams and nine of the women still remained (plus nineteen children) — the others having been killed in fierce infighting. In 2008, a large double-blinded study was done with 21 contestants from the Eighth International Violin Competition using nine top quality violins, ranging from brand new instruments to multimillion-dollar classics including two Strads and a Guarneri (another Italian classic, contemporary to the Strads). The musicians tested exhaustively according to strict protocols in which they could neither clearly see nor smell the instruments they played. Which was the most preferred instrument? Reveal the answer The correct answer is A, one of the new violins. The Stradivarius in the test that had the most illustrious history was the least preferred. For that most preferred new one, seven couldn't tell if it was old or new, seven wrongly guessed that it was old, and only three correctly guessed that it was new. Ganzfeld experiments are one type of test for psychic powers. How does this one work? Reveal the answer The correct answer is C, one person tries to visualize an object the other person is concentrating on. Proponents consistently claim a better-than-random-chance success rate; skeptics always find methodological errors like inadequate blinding and sensory leakage. When Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay summited Mt. Everest for the first time in 1953, it was to some controversy; as many have long maintained that two other British men had succeeded first in 1924, yet died on their return. Who were they? Reveal the answer The correct answer is A, George Mallory and Andrew Irvine. If you guessed Eric Shipton, you were close; Shipton was a last-minute cut from Hillary and Norgay's famous 1953 expedition, but he'd been on most of the expeditions since the 1930s. He's best known for being the guy who faked a famous photo of a "yeti footprint" next to an ice axe for scale, which he did in 1951. In 1854, Sir John Franklin embarked upon his fourth and final polar voyage. Unfortunately it ended in disaster: both ships sank, nobody survived, and evidence remained that a few of the survivors may have resorted to cannibalism. Much of this evidence was discovered on what island? Reveal the answer The correct answer is B, Beechey Island in the Canadian Arctic. This voyage was to find a fabled Northwest Passage, a way to sail between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans via an ice-free route through the Arctic Ocean across the top of North America, rather than having to go halfway round the world to traverse Cape Horn. So islands in the Canadian Arctic were the only possible correct answer. This small forested grove in Romania is only about 3 km². It was made famous to Americans in 2014 when a team of TV ghost hunters drove into it. One pretended to have an unprovoked panic attack. They brought along a commercially sold ghost hunting detector device, which detected nothing. They panicked and fled. While their contribution to the mythology was essentially meritless, they did bring up one case of a 5-year-old girl who went missing in the forest once. Which of the following is true? Reveal the answer The correct answer is C, the area of the park is so small that it would be virtually impossible for anyone to go missing within it. Consequently there are no records of it ever having happened. The first emperor of a unified China left a lot to remember him by, not just the original Great Wall of China, but also his vast mausoleum complex, home to the Terra Cotta warriors, a vast map of the world in miniature complete with liquid mercury representing its oceans, and a massive central pyramid. Which of these three pyramids is the largest, by volume? Reveal the answer The correct answer is B, Qin Shi Huang's pyramid was indeed the biggest of these three, by volume. At 3.1 million m³, it was about 20% bigger than the Great Pyramid of Khufu at 2.6 million m³. Although Monk's Mound has about the same footprint as the Great Pyramid, it's only about a quarter the volume. The world's biggest is the Great Pyramid of Cholula in Mexico, at 4.5 million m³. The so-called Baghdad Battery is a small terra cotta pot discovered in 1936, probably between 1300 and 2200 years old. Its designation as a battery (which is obviously false) has come from alternative historians and ancient advanced culture theorists. What is it really? Reveal the answer The correct answer is B. It's essentially identical to many other scroll containers, many of which have been found with their scrolls intact. The giveaway is the residue of asphalt around its lip, which was used to seal such containers and preserve the scrolls within. If you visit the Catherine Palace south of St. Petersburg, you can go and visit a faithful replica of the fabulous Amber Room, gifted to Peter the Great in 1716 by King Frederick William I. The original was initially lost in World War II, during the scuffle to hide artworks and other treasures from the invading Nazis in 1941. What was ultimately its fate? Reveal the answer The correct answer is A, it was destroyed when the advancing Red Army razed Königsberg Castle in Germany, burning it completely to the ground in 1944. The room had been on display there, and the German curators disassembled it and packed it into nondescript crates for evacuation — but it was too late. Unfortunately for the Soviets, the average infantryman knew or cared little about current developments in art history. It's reasonably well known that the Holy Grail became a part of Christian mythology after the Bible; it came from Arthurian lore. In what publication did the principal character Perceval make his first appearance, so far as we've been able to find? Reveal the answer The correct answer is C, The Story of the Grail from 1190. Following Geoffery of Monmouth's book, the 1100s were full of pulp fan fiction about King Arthur, and it does appear that this poem is where Perceval and the Grail both made their debuts. Interestingly, it is incomplete, as its author literally died mid-sentence. And OK, yeah, this was probably too hard of a question. In 1959, Canada's magnificent Avro F-105 Arrow was inexplicably canceled. Only a few having been built, then immediately destroyed, the Arrow was the world's best and most advanced interceptor: capable of taking off, pursuing and overtaking enemy bombers, and shooting them down. The reason was that, with the advent of ICBMs, interceptors were simply no longer relevant. The conspiracy theories melt away when you note that an American interceptor concept, largely identical to the Arrow, was canceled at about the same time. What was it? Reveal the answer The correct answer is A, the XF-108 Rapier, from North American. This is kind of an unfair question if you're not an aerospace nerd. The North American XB-70 Valkyrie was a bomber, not an interceptor; and the Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar was a proposed spaceplane, a followup to the record-setting X-15. Yes, it had a dumb name, because it sounded like "dinosaur", but it was Dyna (like dynamite) and Soar (like fly). JPL co-founder Jack Parsons is somewhat notorious for his lifestyle outside of work, in which he led a chapter of a mysticism order from his large house in which some of the members lived, called the Parsonage. What future cult leader lived at the Parsonage for a time? Reveal the answer The correct answer is A, L. Ron Hubbard, who went on to found the Church of Scientology. Hubbard and Parsons' girlfriend, Sara "Betty" Northrup, ran off together with $10,000 of Parsons' money. Nibiru is said to be the name of a rogue planet that could swing past Earth at some point and cause massive destruction. Other stories surround the so-called Planet X. Planet X and Nibiru are not the same thing; both have distinct backstories and predictions associated with them. They could be purely fictional, or they could be theoretical, based on actual astronomical observations. Which of the following is true? Reveal the answer The correct answer is A, Nibiru is fictional and Planet X is hypothetical. Nibiru was the brainchild of broad-spectrum wooist and alternative historian Zecharia Sitchin, who published it in a fact-free book series called The Earth Chronicles, which started with The 12th Planet in 1976. Planet X, on the other hand, was the name given by famed astronomer Percival Lowell to a hypothetical body that he (and others) believed would account for perturbations in the orbits of Uranus and Neptune. For quite some time after his death, the subsequent discovery of Pluto was believed to account for this. That was later disproven, but only when the Voyager 2 mission made better measurements of Neptune's mass, many decades later. "Excited delirium" is a cause of death sometimes attributed to people who died being arrested, usually young black men. It is not a real medical diagnosis and its origin has been traced to the manufacturer of what police equipment? Reveal the answer The correct answer is A, tasers. The condition was first described in a white paper published by the American College of Emergency Physicians, written by a task force, three of whose members were found to have been consultants paid by Taser International, since renamed Axon Enterprise. Some states are now banning "excited delirium" from being listed as a cause of death. OK, let's see how you did!

October 14, 2025 04:30 ET | Source: Forte Minerals Corp Forte Minerals Corp Vancouver BC, Canada Vancouver BC, Canada VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Oct. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Forte Minerals Corp. (“Forte” or the “Company”) (CSE: CUAU) (OTCQB: FOMNF) (Frankfurt: 2OA) is pleased to announce that the Board of Directors has appointed Patrick Evans as an Independent Director and Chairman of the Board. Mr. Evans brings over 25 years of senior mining executive leadership experience, specializing in mergers and acquisitions, capital markets, and the development of world-class assets across four continents. He currently serves as Chairman of Pan Global Resources Inc. Mr. Evans's career includes leading multiple public companies to successful exits and significant value creation. He previously served as CEO of Dominion Diamond Mines and Mountain Province Diamonds Inc. He led the sale of several companies, including Norsemont Mining Inc. (acquired by Hudbay Minerals), Weda Bay Minerals Inc. (acquired by Eramet S.A.), and Southern Platinum (acquired by Lonmin PLC). Mr. Evans holds degrees in arts and science from the University of Cape Town and previously served as South Africa’s Consul-General to Canada (1994–1998). His industry leadership has been recognized with both the Prospectors & Developers Association of Canada’s Viola R. MacMillan Award and the Association for Mineral Exploration’s Hugo Dummett Award. The Board is confident that Mr. Evans's proven track record in mergers, acquisitions, capital markets, and advancing complex multinational operations will directly support Forte as it develops its copper and gold projects in Peru. His appointment significantly enhances the Board's independence and corporate governance oversight. As the Independent Chairman, Mr. Evans will oversee Forte’s Board and ensure that management decisions align with the interests of shareholders and the Company’s long-term strategic objectives. Patrick Elliott, President and CEO of Forte, stated, “The appointment of Patrick Evans represents a transformational addition to Forte Minerals’ Board of Directors. As one of the most accomplished executives in the global mining industry, Mr. Evans brings a distinguished record of leading high-growth companies through major transactions, capital market success, and the development of tier-one mineral assets. His strategic insight and leadership will be instrumental as Forte advances its high-quality copper and gold portfolio in Peru and continues to unlock substantial long-term value for shareholders”. Mr. Evans added, “Forte Minerals has built an exceptional portfolio of exploration projects in one of the world’s premier mining jurisdictions. I am excited to collaborate with the Board and management team to unlock the full potential of these assets and drive meaningful growth and value creation for all stakeholders.” Forte Minerals would also like to extend its sincere gratitude to Mr. Doug Turnbull, P.Geo., who has resigned from the Board of Directors. Mr. Turnbull has served as an Independent Director and Chair of the Compensation Committee since 2010. Over his fourteen years of dedicated service, Mr. Turnbull has been an integral part of Forte’s growth and governance, bringing more than 30 years of global exploration experience and thoughtful leadership to the Board. His geological expertise and steady guidance have helped shape the Company’s strategic direction from its early stages to its current milestones. Mr. Turnbull is stepping down on excellent terms to pursue a new opportunity with VBKOM, an engineering company based in South Africa. The Board and management wish to thank him for his longstanding commitment, professionalism, and contribution to Forte’s success, and wish him continued achievement in his new role. Corporate Update: Option Grants In connection with his appointment to the Board of Directors and as Independent Chair of the Company, Mr. Patrick Evans was granted 500,000 stock options.

Full Content:
OpenAI has partnered with Broadcom to produce its first in-house artificial intelligence processors, the latest chip tie-up for the ChatGPT maker as it races to secure the computing power needed to meet surging demand for its services. Shares of Broadcom rose more than 10%. The companies said on Monday that OpenAI would design the chips, which Broadcom will develop and deploy starting in the second half of 2026. They will roll out 10 gigawatts worth of custom chips, whose power consumption is roughly equivalent to the needs of more than 8 million U.S. households or five times the electricity produced by the Hoover Dam. Most analysts do not expect the deal, the latest effort by a tech company to develop custom AI chips, to challenge Nvidia’s grip on the AI accelerator market, given the significant challenge of designing, scaling and manufacturing in-house chips from the ground up. The OpenAI-Broadcom deal is the latest in a string of massive chip investments that have highlighted the technology industry’s surging appetite for computing power as it races to build the most sophisticated AI systems. OpenAI last week unveiled a 6-gigawatt AI chip supply deal with AMD that includes an option to buy a stake in the chipmaker, days after disclosing that Nvidia plans to invest up to $100 billion in the startup and provide it with data-center systems with at least 10 gigawatts of capacity. “Partnering with Broadcom is a critical step in building the infrastructure needed to unlock AI’s potential,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement. Financial details of the agreement were not disclosed and it was not immediately clear how OpenAI would fund the deal. A one-gigawatt data center can cost between $50 billion and $60 billion, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in August, adding that Nvidia products, powering the data center, can represent more than half of those costs. The 2026 timeline set out by OpenAI for the build-out is aggressive, but the startup is also best positioned to raise the funds required for the project, given the heights of investor confidence, said Gadjo Sevilla, an analyst at eMarketer. “Financing such a large chip deal will likely require a combination of funding rounds, pre-orders, strategic investments, and support from Microsoft, as well as leveraging future revenue streams and potential credit facilities.” The tie-up with Broadcom, first reported by Reuters last year, places OpenAI among cloud-computing giants such as Alphabet-owned Google and Amazon.com that are developing custom chips to meet surging AI demand and reduce dependence on costly, supply-constrained Nvidia processors. However, similar efforts by Microsoft and Meta have failed to match the performance of Nvidia chips, according to media reports. Still, the rise in demand for custom chips has turned Broadcom into one of the biggest winners of the generative AI boom, with its stock price rising nearly six-fold since the end of 2022. Broadcom unveiled a $10 billion custom AI chip order in September from an unnamed new customer, which some analysts speculated was OpenAI. However, a company executive on Monday alluded that OpenAI was not that unnamed client. Broadcom and OpenAI said on Monday that the deployment of the new custom chips would be completed by the end of 2029, building on their existing co-development and supply agreements. The new systems will be scaled entirely using Broadcom’s Ethernet and other networking gear, challenging Nvidia’s InfiniBand networking solution. Congress released its second list of candidates for the Bihar Assembly elections, but the Mahagathbandhan is still working on a seat-sharing arrangement for the first phase of polling. The Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) will contest six seats on its own. The elections will be held in two phases on November 6 and 11, with results on November 14.

A subscription may be required for some services. Share The pace of AI innovation is accelerating, and with the launch of Red Hat AI 3, we're reminded that turning this potential into enterprise reality requires a robust, open ecosystem built on choice and collaboration. Our goal has always been to provide a consistent, powerful platform for AI that works with any model, on any accelerator, and across the hybrid cloud. Today, we're thrilled to highlight the momentum from our partners, who are working alongside us to build out the future of open, hybrid AI on Red Hat. The Red Hat partner ecosystem is the engine that will deliver the generative AI (gen AI) and agentic capabilities that customers need for broad market adoption. It’s about bringing together the best in hardware, software, and services to create a whole that is far greater than the sum of its parts. The launch of Red Hat AI 3 is centered on driving enterprise AI inference, expanding model choice and enabling open models for optimized cost and flexibility – so organizations can go from training to “doing.” And Red Hat partners play a critical role in making this happen. To deliver AI inference at scale using vLLM and Kubernetes, the llm-d open source project is now generally available as part of Red Hat OpenShift AI 3.0, powered by a coalition of leading gen AI model providers, AI accelerators and premier AI cloud platforms. Founding contributors include CoreWeave, Google Cloud, IBM Research, and NVIDIA, with additional support from partners like AMD, Cisco, Hugging Face, Intel, Lambda, and Mistral AI. Since the project’s introduction earlier this year, Microsoft, Oracle and WEKA have also become active contributing members. Nilesh Patel Chief Strategy Officer, WEKA As Large Language Models (LLMs) become the foundation for a wide range of gen AI applications, Red Hat is introducing the Partner Model Validation Guide to empower our partners and provide greater choice to customers. This guide outlines a standardized, step-by-step process for Red Hat partners to benchmark their LLMs for inclusion in the Red Hat OpenShift AI model catalog. Leveraging the Partner Model Validation Guide, model provider partners can generate the data needed for validation using a prescribed open source toolchain, including vLLM for serving, GuideLLM for performance benchmarking, and LM Evaluation Harness for accuracy evaluations. Once submitted and validated by our team, these partner models, complete with their performance and quality metrics, will be made visible and available to all Red Hat OpenShift AI customers. This initiative enriches our model catalog, offering customers more transparent insights and guidance at the model level, a broader selection of best-in-class open source models to build their AI applications, and market visibility for our model provider partners. Ultimately, the goal is to get AI applications into production where they can deliver business value. Red Hat AI, combined with our partner ecosystem, provides the essential capabilities for developing, deploying, and managing agentic AI. This is where our systems integrators and services partners play a crucial role. Red Hat is engaged with global leaders like Accenture, HCL, Kyndryl, IBM Consulting, Infosys and NTT DATA to support customers in scaling these applications and optimizing inference to run AI everywhere – from the datacenter to the edge. With a solid foundation and enabled infrastructure, the focus shifts to the tools and models that power intelligent applications. An AI strategy is only as good as the ecosystem of data platforms, vector databases, security tools, and developer utilities that support it. Red Hat’s partner landscape is rich and diverse, providing the essential components for building modern AI workflows. With the launch of Red Hat AI 3, we've curated a collection of MCP servers. This enables ISVs to connect their tools and services directly to Red Hat AI. Partners like CyberArk, Dynatrace, Elastic, EnterpriseDB, Palo Alto Networks, and others are working with Red Hat to showcase their MCP servers, helping customers build sophisticated agentic applications with trusted tools. Steve Kearns General Manager, Search Solutions, Elastic Wolfgang Heider Product Lead Software Delivery, Dynatrace Red Hat’s work with Meta’s open source Llama Stack is foundational to empowering developers with Red Hat AI 3. By actively contributing to this open source project, Red Hat and its partners are helping to enhance a complete set of standardized tools that revolutionize the gen AI application lifecycle. This helps ensure developers have a compelling, robust, and adaptable environment to accelerate the creation and deployment of innovative AI solutions, giving our partners and customers a clear path to production. By reducing the complexity of integrating various AI services and tools, Llama Stack enables developers to focus on innovation rather than infrastructure challenges. Options are important to cover the widest range of capabilities, which is why we've deepened our collaborations with accelerator partners like AMD, Google Cloud, and Intel. We’re working with NVIDIA to integrate NVIDIA’s performance-optimized AI computing, networking, and software with Red Hat AI, helping customers to build, deploy, and manage AI at scale and optimize infrastructure across diverse workloads. Red Hat and NVIDIA continue to drive the expansion of AI infrastructure with the support for NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 infrastructure, targeting high-end AI training and inference at scale. Furthermore, the NVIDIA RTX PRO(R) 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPUs support Red Hat AI, Red Hat OpenShift, and Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization, accelerating a range of enterprise workloads, including enterprise AI and VDI graphics, with air-cooled GPUs and servers. Our collaboration with AMD is powering more efficient gen AI by enabling AMD’s portfolio of x86-based processors and GPUs on Red Hat AI, driven by our activations in upstream communities like vLLM and llm-d to deliver enhanced performance and GPU support. In addition, Red Hat continues to build upon its longstanding collaboration with Intel to support Red Hat AI across its expanding hardware platform and accelerator portfolio, including Intel® Gaudi® AI accelerators. This commitment to choice extends across the hybrid cloud. In this area, we are actively working with Google Cloud to bolster TPU support on Red Hat AI, extending our shared vision for community-powered innovation through projects like llm-d and vLLM. But accelerators are just one piece of the puzzle. Customers need validated, integrated solutions. That's where our OEM server partners come in, transforming the theoretical potential of AI into tangible enterprise reality. While the foundation of AI lies in accelerators on the bottom and language models on the top, the practical deployment and management of AI at scale requires robust, integrated solutions. Red Hat is actively collaborating with industry leaders, including Cisco, Dell Technologies, HPE, and Lenovo, to simplify the deployment and management of AI across hybrid cloud environments. With Dell, we are working to help ensure that their powerful server and storage solutions are optimized for Red Hat AI, providing customers with reliable and scalable infrastructure for their AI workloads.

Title: Carbon credits are failing to help with climate change — here’s why

Achieving the global temperature targets set in the Paris climate agreement requires deep, rapid cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions, and therefore the swift phase-out of fossil fuels. Many factors stand in the way. One of the most pernicious is carbon offsets. Offsets are tradable credits from projects that claim to reduce emissions, either by avoiding them or by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Businesses and countries trade these credits — each representing the equivalent of one tonne of CO2 — to ‘neutralize’ their own emissions. Net zero needs AI — five actions to realize its promise Net zero needs AI — five actions to realize its promise Although conceptually appealing, this reliance on offsets has fatal flaws. In practice, it’s difficult to ensure that they represent real emissions reductions rather than ‘hot air’, with the claimed climate benefits existing only on paper. Equally challenging is ensuring that emission reductions are ‘additional’, meaning that they would not have occurred without the incentive provided by the sale of carbon credits. For projects credited for sequestering carbon, it is also crucial to ensure that the CO2 is locked away permanently and not released back into the atmosphere later. Most carbon-offset schemes fall foul of one or more of these requirements. Thus, offsets undermine decarbonization by enabling companies and countries to claim that emissions have been reduced when they have not. This results in more emissions, delays the phase-out of fossil fuels and diverts scarce resources to false solutions. Yet, climate-policy processes continue to rely on them. The operationalization of Article 6 of the Paris agreement and full implementation of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, both achieved in 2024, are set to turbocharge demand for carbon credits. In parallel, voluntary carbon markets are promising to raise standards as a way of further legitimizing and scaling up offsets. Of greatest concern is the expanding role of offsets in domestic carbon-pricing schemes, such as emissions trading and carbon taxes. Although the European Union’s Emissions Trading System phased out offsets in 2020, they still feature in most major carbon-pricing schemes outside Europe, including in China, Korea, Japan, Indonesia, Singapore, California, Canada and Australia. They are even permitted as a substitute for paying carbon taxes in countries such as South Africa, Mexico, Chile and Colombia. Such practices threaten to undermine global decarbonization efforts. Low-quality offsets artificially depress carbon prices, which dilutes the incentive for industries to cut their emissions and weakens the effectiveness of carbon-pricing schemes. Here, we outline the problems and call on decision makers to exclude offsets from carbon-pricing schemes. Carbon offsetting sounds simple on paper. In practice, it is anything but. It is extremely difficult to evaluate the emission reductions achieved by offset projects because calculations require comparing outcomes with ‘business-as-usual’ projections. For example, calculating the climate benefits from a project that avoids deforestation involves comparing a forest’s actual carbon stock to that in a counterfactual scenario in which the project did not happen. The hypothetical nature of such calculations invites manipulation and can tempt project developers to overestimate business-as-usual emissions to generate more credits. Heatwaves linked to carbon emissions from specific companies Heatwaves linked to carbon emissions from specific companies Fundamental imbalances in the information used in offset schemes leave them vulnerable to these outcomes. In most cases, only project leaders and developers know whether their projects are dependent on credit revenues and are therefore truly additional. This makes it difficult for administrators to screen out shoddy projects. Even where projects are additional, errors can arise from inaccurate measurement of emissions and carbon stocks. These risks are most acute when the sources and sinks are variable. For example, stocks of soil organic carbon vary naturally across landscapes and through time. This is a product of diversity in soil characteristics, topography and vegetation cover, as well as in seasonal, annual and decadal changes in temperatures and rainfall. The variability makes it difficult to accurately measure changes in the carbon stock and ensure that the credited carbon storage is fully attributable to the project1. It is also difficult to ensure that credited carbon removals remain sequestered. Many carbon sinks are susceptible to natural disturbances, such as droughts and wildfires, which can release carbon stored in trees and soils. Carbon stocks can also be lost through the clearing of vegetation and other changes in land-management practices. Despite these risks, most offset schemes mandate that credited sinks be maintained for only 40 years or even less. Given that CO2 emissions require thousands of years to be reabsorbed by Earth’s climate system2, credited removals need to lock away carbon for a similar period to genuinely neutralize the warming caused by the emissions that are claimed to be offset. In most markets, the risks associated with the supply of low-quality goods and services can be alleviated if consumers are able to judge quality and seek redress when standards are not met. With offsets, however, the complexity and a lack of transparency make it close to impossible for buyers to make informed decisions about the quality of most credits. Moreover, many buyers are not incentivized to care. Typically, their priority is to procure credits at the lowest possible cost, a fact evidenced by a 2024 study revealing that the largest corporate buyers consistently choose low-priced credits over higher-quality alternatives3. Why the green-technology race might not save the planet Why the green-technology race might not save the planet For these reasons, the integrity of offset schemes hinges on the skills and efforts of administrators, but they are often incentivized to prioritize supply over integrity. In voluntary offset markets, registries rely on project registrations and credit issuances for revenue, while competing with one another for market share. Tightening integrity standards can therefore reduce revenue and put this business model at risk. Government-regulated offset programmes linked to carbon-pricing schemes show a similar dynamic. The main reason that pricing schemes allow the use of offsets is to lower compliance costs for polluters, thereby reducing resistance to climate policies4. Yet the focus on cost reduction places pressure on regulators to ensure a plentiful supply of low-cost credits, frequently at the expense of environmental integrity. These interlinked issues make integrity failings inevitable. The science reflects this, with studies repeatedly showing that few of the major offset types in use today deliver real, additional or permanent abatement. A 2024 meta-analysis examining some 2,300 offset projects — amounting to around one-fifth of all issued credits — found that less than 16% achieved the emissions reductions claimed by developers5. In-depth evaluations of avoided deforestation6, renewable energy7 and clean cooking-stove projects8 have also exposed persistent problems with additionality, inaccurate measurement and impermanence. Recognizing these flaws, some stakeholders advocate a shift from projects that avoid emissions to those that remove carbon from the atmosphere. However, carbon-removal projects tend to have similar integrity problems. Engineering-based techniques are scarce, and so most removal projects currently involve less durable nature-based approaches, such as tree planting, improved soil management and production of biochar (plant-derived charcoal). And just as with emissions-avoidance projects, studies reveal persistent integrity failings, particularly regarding the crediting of non-existent and non-additional removals9,10. Bad offsets cheat the climate by failing to deliver their promised emission reductions. And they do further damage by distorting carbon-pricing schemes. Six roadblocks to net zero — and how to get around them Six roadblocks to net zero — and how to get around them In a well-functioning emissions trading scheme, the carbon price will reflect the marginal cost of reducing emissions, whether at a polluting facility or through an offset project. When offsets lack integrity, credit prices reflect the cost of supplying pretend, rather than real, emission reductions, which artificially lowers the carbon price. The same is true for carbon taxes: low-integrity credits reduce the carbon price faced by polluters by allowing them to surrender cheap credits in place of paying the tax. or
