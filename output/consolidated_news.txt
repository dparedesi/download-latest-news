Title: Mark Zuckerberg Drops To Sixth-Richest After Meta Stock Slides

ByTy Roush, Forbes Staff. Mark Zuckerberg’s net worth was reduced by nearly $5 billion as Meta shares declined on Thursday, dropping him among the ranks of the world’s wealthiest after Reuters reported Meta projected a chunk of revenue would come from running advertisements for scams. Shares of Meta dropped 2.3% to around $620.75 as of Thursday morning, adding to a roughly 17.5% slide for the stock over the last week, which includes a single-day drop of more than 11% after Meta posted third-quarter earnings. Zuckerberg, who was ranked the world’s third-richest person early last week behind Oracle’s Larry Ellison ($298.8 billion) and Tesla’s Elon Musk ($496.5 billion), respectively, now ranks behind No. 3 Jeff Bezos ($257 billion), No. 4 Larry Page ($235 billion) and No. 5 Sergey Brin ($217.9 billion). Zuckerberg, who holds roughly 13% equity in Meta, had his net worth reduced by $4.6 billion (2.1%) as Meta’s shares dropped. Reuters reported Thursday, citing internal company documents, that Meta projected 10% of overall revenue—estimated at $16 billion—would come from running advertisements for scams and banned goods. Meta spokesperson Andy Stone told Reuters the documents cited by the outlet “present a selective view that distorts Meta’s approach to fraud and scams,” noting the company’s internal estimates were lower and that the 10% estimate included “many” legitimate ads.” Stone declined to give an updated figure to Reuters (Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment to Forbes). Other documents indicated Meta was under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission for running ads for financial scams, Reuters reported. Regulators in the U.K. reported in 2023 that Meta’s products were involved in 54% of all payment-related scam losses that year, more than double all other social platforms combined. Meta’s stock has rebounded after falling to a low this year in April, though shares have steadily declined in recent days. A recent slip in share price followed the company’s third-quarter earnings, which featured earnings per share of $1.05, falling 84% below economists’ projections, according to FactSet. That dip was attributed to a one-time tax charge of $15.9 billion because of President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Meta said, adding earnings per share would have been $7.25 without the tax charge. Meta also raised its guidance for capital expenditures from between $66 billion and $72 billion to between $70 billion and $72 billion. Zuckerberg said this change was necessary as Meta was “aggressively” preparing for the arrival of superintelligence.

Title: For Gen Z, it’s ‘not enough to work hard’ if you want to succeed, says Jamie Dimon—specific skills are the way to get ahead

Eleanor Pringle is an award-winning senior reporter at Fortune covering news, the economy, and personal finance. Eleanor previously worked as a business correspondent and news editor in regional news in the U.K. She completed her journalism training with the Press Association after earning a degree from the University of East Anglia. For many years, the rule of thumb was that working hard will guarantee some level of success. But according to Wall Street veteran Jamie Dimon, for the generations now entering the workforce, hard work alone won’t cut it. In a world increasingly shaped by artificial intelligence, successful individuals will have to be armed with the tools needed in specific sectors. “When you graduate, whether it’s high school, or community college, or college, you need the skills to get the job,” Dimon said in a recent interview with CNN. “It’s not enough anymore to say, ‘I can work hard.’ In the old days, you could be in 10th grade, go get a factory [job] in Detroit, and eventually you could afford a family, a home, a car, and that may not be true anymore.” Dimon’s words will resonate with many. Even in the past few years, buying a home has become increasingly unaffordable for first-time buyers. Per data from the National Association of Realtors, in 2022 its housing affordability index stood at 108, with a value of 100 representing a family with the median income having exactly enough income to qualify for a mortgage on a median-priced home. By 2025, this had dropped to 97.4, meaning the average American family trying to buy their first home doesn’t have the income to qualify for a mortgage on a median-priced home. Likewise, childcare costs have skyrocketed compared with a few decades ago. Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis charting tuition, school fees, and childcare across an average of U.S. cities has increased from an index of 100 in 1983 to 897 by September 2025. In the face of an increased cost of living, younger workers now graduating and entering the workforce are more concerned than their older counterparts about the threat of artificial intelligence. Nearly one in five Gen Z workers reported being deeply worried that artificial intelligence will put them out of work within the next two years, according to a recent survey from Deutsche Bank Research. But their older peers are notably less alarmed: While nearly a quarter of young adults ages 18 to 34 gave high scores of concern on a 0 to 10 scale, only about one in 10 baby boomers and Gen Xers (ages 55 and above) expressed comparable anxiety. Dimon said that AI and coding are areas where “we know we need the skills,” adding that speedy industry training courses also present paths to secure employment: “And it works, those things work. We just have to get people to invest in them.” Many of the nation’s fastest-growing job markets are in highly specialized sectors—some of which require no degree but do require technical training. According to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projections for job growth in 2023–33, released last year, wind turbine service technicians came in first with a growth rate of 60% and median annual pay of just under $62,000. No degree is required. Second was solar photovoltaic installers with a growth rate of 48% and annual pay of a little under $49,000—again, no degree required. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has also urged job market entrants to explore skills-focused roles adjacent to the immediate technology sector. While the billions being invested into AI have pushed up valuations courtesy of promised efficiencies and streamlining, Huang points out that it will also have real-world impacts when it comes to building data centers and the wider infrastructure needed to support the shift. “If you’re an electrician, you’re a plumber, a carpenter—we’re going to need hundreds of thousands of them to build all of these factories,” Huang told Channel 4 News in the U.K. in September. “The skilled craft segment of every economy is going to see a boom. You’re going to have to be doubling and doubling and doubling every single year.” Huang isn’t alone. Earlier this year BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told an energy conference he has warned the White House about the shortage of workers needed to support the rollout: “I’ve even told members of the Trump team that we’re going to run out of electricians that we need to build out AI data centers. We just don’t have enough.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: PayPal Co-founder Peter Thiel Says Bitcoin Upside Is Limited Following BlackRock And Government Interest

PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel has issued a grim forecast for Bitcoin, predicting a volatile and bumpy ride for the leading cryptocurrency. Thiel noted that Bitcoin’s upside is limited, given the heavy institutional and government interest, underscored by the introduction of ETFs and strategic reserves. Amid the flurry of predictions for Bitcoin’s end-of-year price, PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel has dampened investors’ enthusiasm with a grim forecast. Thiel warned that Bitcoin does not have much upside left in terms of pricing after its last bull run, citing institutional interest in the leading cryptocurrency. Thiel shared his thoughts at a session at the Aspen Ideas Festival, urging investors to brace for a rocky patch with the leading cryptocurrency. The PayPal co-founder added that while a BTC rally is on the horizon, investors may not see the parabolic returns from the last bull run. “I’m not sure it’s going to go up dramatically from here,” said Thiel. “We got the ETF edition, and I don’t know who buys it quickly from here.” Despite not forecasting sizable returns, Thiel forecasted a volatile run for BTC, marked by steep corrections and price surges. During his sit-down at the Aspen Ideas Festival, the billionaire hinged his argument on the influx of institutional players via ETFs, name-checking Larry Fink’s BlackRock. Thiel highlighted an ideological shift in Bitcoin from its cypherpunk ideals, marked by privacy, decentralization, and stiff resistance to government control. However, a flurry of Bitcoin treasury companies, institutional asset managers, and governments launching strategic reserves with the asset have forced Thiel to lower his price target. The PayPal co-founder revealed that he still holds a small portion of BTC in his portfolio, reiterating his regrets for underinvesting in the asset. While Peter Schiff has issued a bleak forecast for BTC, several experts are bucking the trend with bullish projections. Strategy founder Michael Saylor is eyeing an end-of-year BTC price of $150,000 while making a strong case for a $1 million valuation before the end of the decade. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has also predicted a BTC price of $1 million, but did not disclose a timeline for the asset to reach seven figures. Meanwhile, Bitmex co-founder Arthur Hayes noted that Bitcoin’s four-year cycle is dead, noting that the sharp declines and parabolic rallies will be few and far between.

Title: Conway had 'head eaten off' by Schmidt over Munster move

Andrew Conway (r) signed for Munster in 2013 despite Joe Schmidt's attempts to keep him at Leinster Former Ireland and Munster back Andrew Conway had "hard conversations" with Joe Schmidt when making the switch from Leinster to Munster. The 34-year-old, whose career ended in 2023 because of a knee injury, had made 42 appearances for his home province at the time when offered a contract with fierce rivals Munster. Although he had been invited to the Munster Academy as a teenager when leaving Dublin's Blackrock College, Conway at that stage opted to stay at home. However, speaking to The Ireland Rugby Social podcast, he felt eventually making the switch to Thomond Park in 2013 was the "best decision" he made in his career despite how his then provincial coach Schmidt heard the news. "I trust my intuition and just felt it was the right thing to do, even though it was the hard thing to do," he said. "I signed the contract on the Thursday and Joe had rang me an hour after I had signed it, saying 'don't sign anything but come in and talk to me on Saturday'. I didn't have the forethought to say I'd signed so just said 'yeah, grand'. "On Friday, I went over to London to a football match with a couple of mates and came back the worse for wear on the Saturday. My agent had rang and said Gerry Thornley (of The Irish Times) knew about me signing and it was going into the paper, so Joe would have known. "I went in and got the head eaten off me, but a few hours later I find out why he was so annoyed - Johnny Sexton had signed for Racing and it was coming out, so my thing was small fish." This video can not be played Andrew Conway - the Dub who became a Munster Legend In the podcast, Conway talks about his 10 years at Munster where he made 150 appearances for his adopted province. Knee injuries would hamper his Ireland career as he missed out on two Grand Slams, a winning tour to New Zealand and the 2023 World Cup, something he described as "horrific", but Conway takes a philosophical view of his career. "I'd love a few more medals and caps, but have a mentality where I don't think about what I didn't achieve or don't have. "I'm more focused on the positives. Maybe it's a bit idealistic, but it's the truth."

Title: October Layoffs the Worst Since 2003

Layoffs in the US have reached recession-level numbers, reports the Washington Post, which cites new data from the private firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas to back that up: So far this year, employers have announced 1.1 million job cuts, a figure in line with the Great Recession of 2008-09, and the biggest number since the pandemic. Layoffs are up 65% over last year, per Reuters. October alone saw more than 153,000 cuts—a 183% jump from the previous month, per the Post—making it the worst October for layoffs since 2003. "We're entering new territory with these layoffs in October," says John Challenger, the firm's CEO. "We haven't seen mega-layoffs of the size that are being discussed now—48,000 from UPS, potentially 30,000 from Amazon—since 2020 and before that, since the recession of 2009." The hardest-hit sectors include technology, retail, warehousing, and service. Technology firms, in particular, have cited the disruptive impact of artificial intelligence as a factor, with tech layoffs up 17% from last year. Despite the spike in layoffs, the broader economy appears stable for now, per the Post. The most recent official data puts the unemployment rate at 4.3%, though economists warn that conditions could deteriorate quickly. In fact, the rate is expected to reach 4.5% in the coming months, per CBS News.

Title: 'Congrats!' Billionaire ridiculed for pandering to Mamdani — after $1.7M attack campaign
URL: https://www.rawstory.com/congrats-billionaire-ridiculed-for-pandering-to-mamdani-after-1-7m-campaign/
Time Published: 2025-11-06T15:09:22Z
Full Content:
After his resounding election victory on Tuesday night, New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s most prominent billionaire antagonist immediately pivoted to kiss the ring of the man he has spent the last more than half-year portraying as an existential threat to the city and the country. Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman poured over $1.75 million into the mayor’s race with a laser focus on stopping Mamdani, whom he often ambushed with several-thousand-word screeds on his X account, which boasts nearly 2 million followers. He accused Mamdani—a staunch critic of Israel—of “amplifying hate” against Jewish New Yorkers, while suggesting that his followers (which happened to include many Jewish New Yorkers) were “terror supporters.” Meanwhile, the billionaire suggested that the democratic socialist Mamdani’s “affordability” centered agenda, which includes increasing taxes on corporations and the city’s wealthiest residents to fund universal childcare, free buses, and a rent freeze for stabilized units, would make the city “much more dangerous and economically unviable,” in part by causing an exodus of billionaires like himself. In turn, Mamdani often invoked Ackman’s name on the campaign trail, using him as the poster boy for the cossetted New York elite that was almost uniformly arrayed against his candidacy. In one exchange, Mamdani joked that Ackman was “spending more money against me than I would even tax him.” After Mamdani’s convincing victory Tuesday night, fueled in large part by his dominant performance among the city’s working-class voters, Ackman surprisingly did not respond with “the longest tweet in the history of tweets” to lament the result as some predicted. Instead, he came to the mayor-elect hat in hand. “Congrats on the win,” he told Mamdani on X. “Now you have a big responsibility. If I can help NYC, just let me know what I can do.” Many were quick to point out Ackman’s near-immediate 180-degree turn from prophecizing doom to offering his help to the incoming mayor. “This guy went from acting like Mamdani was going to import ISIS to extending a friendly handshake… in like six hours,” noted one social media user. But Mamdani graciously accepted the billionaire’s congratulations when asked about them on Wednesday’s “Good Morning America.” “I appreciated his words,” Mamdani said. “I think what I find is that there is a needed commitment from leaders of the city to speak and work with anyone who is committed to lowering the cost of living in the city—and that’s something that I will fulfill.” As Bloomberg and Forbes noted, Ackman was just one of many on Wall Street and from the broader finance world who came to kiss the ring. Ralph Schlosstein, a co-founder of the investment fund BlackRock, Inc., pledged to work with Mamdani despite their different politics: “I do care deeply about the city, and I’m not going anywhere, whoever the mayor is. I’m going to do whatever I can to help him be successful,” he said. Another former BlackRock executive, Mark Kronfeld, said: “Is it a dystopian, post-apocalyptic environment because Mamdani has won? No.” Crypto billionaire Mike Novogratz even credited Mamdani with “tapping into a message that’s real: that we’ve got a tale of two cities in the Dickensian sense,” and asked if the incoming mayor could “address the affordability issue in creative ways without driving business out.” But while Mamdani has left the door open to business, he has made it clear that he will not allow them to commandeer his work at City Hall. After his victory, he called on his base of largely small-dollar donors to resume their financial support for him in order to fund “a transition that can meet the moment of preparing for January 1.” He announced that this historic all-female transition team will include at least one renowned titan of economic populism, the trust-busting former Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, as well as other progressive city administrators with backgrounds in expanding the social safety net and public housing. “I’m excited for the fact that it will be funded by the very people who brought us to this point,” Mamdani said, “the working people who have been lost behind by the politics of the city.” ALSO READ: Anger 'doom loop' feared as experts warn of Trump's 'brazen' prison pardons overhaul Copyright © 2025 Raw Story Media, Inc.

Layoffs in the U.S. rose sharply in October 2025 as companies tried to save money and adjust to new AI technology. Many big firms, including tech companies, reduced jobs. Experts say rising costs and slower spending are also reasons for the cuts, making it harder for people to find new work this year.

Title: Monthly job cuts surged to a 22-year high in October

Time Published: 2025-11-06T14:58:02Z

news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time U.S.-based companies announced more than 153,000 job cuts in October, the research firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported Thursday. “This is the highest total for October in over 20 years, and the highest total for a single month in the fourth quarter since 2008," the firm said in a news release. From January through the end of October, employers have announced the elimination of nearly 1.1 million jobs. It's the most Challenger has recorded since 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic shut down the global economy. “October’s pace of job cutting was much higher than average for the month," Andy Challenger, the firm's chief revenue officer, said in a statement. The last time there was a higher October monthly total was in 2003. “Some industries are correcting after the hiring boom of the pandemic, but this comes as AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending, and rising costs drive belt-tightening and hiring freezes,” he said. On Wednesday, the private payroll processor ADP released its own October jobs data, showing that employers added just 42,000 jobs in the month. The ADP report also flagged job losses in the leisure and hospitality sector as a potential sign of trouble ahead, given the industry’s acute sensitivity to consumer sentiment. ADP's chief economist called the losses in hospitality and leisure a "concerning trend." Both Challenger and ADP's reports landed as major companies such as Amazon, IBM, UPS, Target, Microsoft, Paramount and General Motors announced plans to eliminate tens of thousands of jobs. Despite the wave of downbeat economic news, the Trump administration continues to deliver an upbeat take on the current environment. “Jobs are booming” and “inflation is falling,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday. However, the most recent available data paints a different picture. Inflation has also been on the rise. Prices as measured by the Consumer Price Index overall have risen every month since April. A spokesperson for the Treasury Department did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the Challenger report. Challenger’s report does not typically carry the same weight with economists and investors as federal jobs data, owing to its methodology. To arrive at its figures, the firm compiles the number of job cuts companies have publicly announced. But employers may not ultimately carry out all the cuts they roll out. Moreover, some of the job cuts that multinational companies announce could affect workers outside of the United States. Other headcount reductions could be achieved through attrition, rather than layoffs. The report also may not capture smaller layoffs over the long run. But in the midst of a federal data blackout caused by the government shutdown, Challenger’s latest report is being read more closely than usual. The federal government's October jobs report that would traditionally be released Friday will not be published this week, due to the shutdown. Other key data about the U.S. economy like GDP and an inflation indicator called PCE, closely watched by the Federal Reserve, has also been delayed. Challenger equated the impact of AI on the current labor market to the rise of the internet in the early aughts. “Like in 2003, a disruptive technology is changing the landscape,” it said. "Technology continues to lead in private-sector job cuts as companies restructure amid AI integration, slower demand, and efficiency pressures," Challenger said. But even firms that are not actively cutting jobs have warned that they do not plan to add to their headcount in the near term, with several pointing directly to AI’s impact on their personnel needs. On Wednesday night, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told CNN that headcount at his company would likely remain steady as the nation's largest bank rolls out AI internally. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon also recently told his employees that the firm would "constrain headcount growth through the end of the year," as it takes advantage of AI efficiencies, Bloomberg reported.

Nov 6 (Reuters) - U.S.-based employers cut more than 150,000 jobs in October, marking the biggest reduction for the month in more than 20 years, a report by Challenger, Gray & Christmas said on Thursday as industries adopt AI-driven changes and intensify cost cuts. Tech firms led the job cuts in the private sector, followed by retailers and the services sector, the global outplacement company said. Cost-cutting was the top reason for the layoffs in October, followed by artificial intelligence, while “DOGE Impact” was the leading reason for job cuts in 2025. The layoffs in October surged 175% from a year ago to 153,074. From the start of the year to October end, employers have announced 1,099,500 job cuts, a 65% rise from 664,839 in the same time period last year. So far this year, job cuts are at the highest level since 2020 when 2,304,755 cuts were announced through October. “Some industries are correcting after the hiring boom of the pandemic, but this comes as AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending, and rising costs drive belt-tightening and hiring freezes,” said Andy Challenger, chief revenue officer for Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

Not only did individual companies announce large layoffs in October, but a higher number of companies announced job cut plans, Challenger said, tracking nearly 450 individual job cut plans in October compared to under 400 in September. Any economic data from private sources will be on investors’ radar as official data continues to be absent with the U.S. government now entering its longest-ever shutdown.

Δ That’s a 175% jump from October of 2024 and 183% higher than the 54,064 cuts announced in September of this year, per a Thursday (Nov. 6) report by outplacement and executive coaching company Challenger, Gray & Christmas. “October’s pace of job cutting was much higher than average for the month,” Andy Challenger, workplace expert and the company’s chief revenue officer, said in a news release. “Some industries are correcting after the hiring boom of the pandemic, but this comes as AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending, and rising costs drive belt-tightening and hiring freezes. Those laid off now are finding it harder to quickly secure new roles, which could further loosen the labor market.” The report also notes that October’s total is the highest for that month since October of 2023, which saw a surge of layoffs in the retail space because of acquisitions, and in telecommunications as cell phones became more popular. “Like in 2003, a disruptive technology is changing the landscape,” said Challenger. “Over the last decade, companies have shied away from announcing layoffs in the fourth quarter, so it’s surprising to see so many in October.” Advertisement: Scroll to Continue He added the onset of social media has allowed workers to share their negative work experience, meaning the trend of announcing layoffs before the holidays faded away, “a practice that seemed particularly cruel.” Among the companies cutting jobs last month was Amazon, which said it planned to eliminate up to 30,000 corporate roles. The report comes one day after the announcement of planned Senate legislation that would require major companies and federal agencies to report artificial intelligence-related layoffs, hires, job displacements, retraining and other impacts to the Labor Department. The bill would also require the DOL to compile data on AI-related job effects and publish a report to Congress and the public, according to a press release issued Wednesday (Nov. 5) by the bill’s sponsors, Sens. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., and Mark Warner, D-Va. Meanwhile, research from the PYMNTS Intelligence report “Generation AI: Why Gen Z Bets Big and Boomers Hold Back” found that among people who use generative AI, 33% are worried that the technology might threaten people’s jobs. That concern is most pronounced among Generation Z, with 38% of the gen AI users in that age bracket worried about the impact on employment. The report said Gen Z users tend to have — or are looking for — the types of entry-level jobs that the technology can most easily replace.

Title: AI fatigue detected: 4 recent developments show the stock market's driving engine is at a crossroads

Every time Joe publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Good morning and welcome to First Trade. The Supreme Court is skeptical about President Trump's tariffs. It's still early innings, but watch this space for what this means about the future of the market. Rundown But first, traders are getting tired. Love Business Insider? Log into Google and make us a preferred source. Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up now Market musings The old saying goes that something happening once is an accident, twice is a coincidence, and three times is a pattern. Given developments in the AI space in recent days, it looks like we have a full-fledged pattern of skepticism. It's created an inflection point of sorts for a trade that seemed unstoppable as recently as last Tuesday, the last time the S&P 500 closed at record highs. Yes, stocks are coming off a strong day, but it feels like something has shifted under the surface. While three makes a pattern, I'll do you one better. Detailed below are four examples of AI exhaustion, in reverse chronological order, dating back one week: 1. Michael Burry comes out of hibernation to short some giants If Burry is emerging from the woodwork, you know something is afoot. The legendary "Big Short" investor dusted off his X account this week to compare the AI boom to the dot-com bubble. He also disclosed short wagers against market darlings Nvidia and Palantir. While Burry has made a series of bearish bets in recent years that haven't come to fruition, he certainly knows his way around an unsustainable bubble, and his views are an important contribution to the broader groundswell. 2. Sky-high valuations suddenly matter When Wall Street CEOs gathered at an investment summit in Hong Kong this week, few expected the high-profile guests to take a two-by-four to bullish stock portfolios. But that's exactly what Morgan Stanley's Ted Pick and Goldman Sachs' David Solomon did. They warned of a 10-20% drawdown in equities, characterizing it as a necessary and normal consolidation. In a different environment, the comments might've passed without incident. But with investors starting to question AI valuations, it confirmed some latent worries. On this same subject… 3. Palantir sells off big after crushing every conceivable earnings metric A record quarter? Meh. An increased profit forecast? Yawn. All anyone seemed to care about after Palantir's third-quarter earnings was how absurd the company's valuation was, with the stock up 174% year to date. The actual results rendered were irrelevant, offering a clear sign of exhaustion, and a desire from investors to regroup and reassess. 4. Meta's AI-spending pledge sends its stock tanking Loyal readers of First Trade will recognize this as a familiar trope that's been mentioned a handful of times already. Well, it really is that big of a deal. You know the story by now: Meta — already spending tens of billions on AI — said it plans to spend even more in 2026. That might've excited investors a few months ago, but this time around the forecast landed with a thud, and the stock tumbled. The message from investors was clear: we want tangible results, not an opaque money pit. Not convinced? Allow me to offer a visual aid that's specific to OpenAI's role in the fervor. The headline takeaway from this chart is how much Oracle's stock has come back down after a 36% single-day spike on Sept. 10, which was driven by giant new AI-cloud deals and the future revenue they could bring. That day, Oracle announced almost half a trillion dollars in new cloud contracts. A big chunk of that was from an OpenAI deal to develop data-center capacity. OpenAI essentially played kingmaker, as it has so much lately. Since then, OpenAI has unveiled a string of other giant AI infrastructure agreements. With doubts creeping in about OpenAI's ability to pay for all this, investors are discounting these deals. Hence the drop in Oracle shares. This recurring section will highlight individuals who have dominated the week in markets. This week's First Trade MVP is Miriam Adelson, the widow of Sheldon Adelson, founder and chairman of the casino company Las Vegas Sands, of which she and her family own a half-stake. This week's entry would be more aptly titled "MVP of the past two weeks," because LVS has been on a 24% tear over that period, since earnings after the closing bell on Oct. 22. That includes a 5% increase this week. LVS beat revenue forecasts, and saw especially strong growth at its Marina Bay Sands resort, which contributed to a 56% year-over-year sales increase for Singapore operations. The move has lifted Adelson's net worth to $39.9 billion, making her (and her family) the 45th-richest person in the world, according to Forbes data. And did I mention that she's the majority owner of the Dallas Mavericks? No word on how she feels about trading Luka Dončić for pennies. Business Insider's Will Edwards highlights investing recommendations pegged to the biggest trends in markets. One of the biggest questions in the market right now is how effective AI will be in raising profit margins. Tech firms are dumping tens of billions of dollars a year into building out infrastructure to support the technology, helping to propel US economic growth and stock-market gains. But will it ever pay off? For one company, the answer is already yes. And its stock is already seeing the benefits in a big way. Shares of CH Robinson (CHRW), a freight logistics firm, are up 49% year-to-date. After the company's third-quarter earnings report last week, the stock jumped about 20% in a single day. The stock is moving so dramatically because the company has begun using generative AI, said Travis Prentice, the founder of the Informed Momentum Company. AI is able to provide price quotes, book appointments, respond to emails, and process orders for the firm, allowing its shipments per person per day to have increased by 40% since 2022. Meanwhile, CH Robinson has reduced its employee base by more than 10%, boosting margins amid a 12% decline in expenses. "Not the most sexy business in the world, but when everyone talks about AI and there's no ROI with AI, this is a massive exception to the rules," Prentice told BI. "It's driving productivity gains of like 40-50%." "That's a story that no one's really talking about — AI is actually improving business operations," he continued. "They're one of the outliers, but I'm sure there's gonna be a lot to follow when they see the gains that they're having." — Will Edwards Joe Ciolli, executive editor and anchor, in Chicago.

Title: Crypto Pundit Predicts Major Move For XRP This Week, Here’s What

Zach Rector, a well-known figure in the XRP community, has predicted that the altcoin will see a major surge in attention this week. His statement arrives at a time when Ripple and its ecosystem are at the center of market discussions following a series of impactful announcements, including new partnerships and product unveilings during the Ripple Swell 2025 conference in New York. Many traders and analysts are seeing the current week as significant for XRP, and the cryptocurrency could be on the brink of new momentum in both market performance and institutional adoption. Zach Rector is one of the most followed voices in the XRP community, and his comments often hint at broader market narratives rather than mere price speculation. Taking to the social media platform X, Rector noted in a tweet that XRP is going to go viral this week. Although he didn’t say much, his “going viral” statement can be interpreted as a signal that significant activity or announcements could push XRP into mainstream attention in the coming days. This comes as Ripple is positioning itself at the forefront of digital finance innovation, expanding its ecosystem beyond payments to include tokenization, stablecoins, and on-chain lending. The latest move in this vision is the recent confirmation by Ripple of its acquisition of Palisade, a wallet-as-a-service infrastructure provider, to bolster institutional custody solutions. This is an indication that the company is preparing for large-scale adoption across financial sectors. Rector’s comment arrived amidst the ongoing Ripple Swell 2025 conference that gathered hundreds of global institutions, government officials, and blockchain developers. Proposed attendees are from big names including BlackRock, Nasdaq, and the White House Office of Digital Assets. The event has already delivered headline-grabbing updates, including the introduction of an XRP Ledger-based lending protocol aimed at expanding enterprise-level decentralized finance. Ripple President Monica Long described the rollout as a key evolution in how businesses can access liquidity through blockchain technology. The company also announced a new partnership with Mastercard, WebBank, and Gemini to introduce RLUSD settlement on the XRP Ledger for fiat credit card payments. Rector’s post may ultimately prove prophetic. XRP is currently trading around $2.30 after a recent price crash at the beginning of this week. Recent 24 hours momentum, however, has seen rising buy-side transaction volumes consistent with renewed market interest. Ripple’s also recently completed a $500 million funding round led by Fortress Investment Group and Citadel Securities. This milestone adds to confidence that the company’s infrastructure is robust enough to support the next phase of growth. Several key factors are beginning to align, including talks of a potential XRP ETF in the US, and this period could be a turning point for Ripple and the price of XRP. At the time of writing, the altcoi is trading at $2.33, up by 3.8% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin has now reached a $1 billion market cap.

Title: AI open letter by Amazon workers
URL: https://www.amazonclimatejustice.org/open-letter
Time Published: 2025-11-06T12:49:42Z
Full Content:
Amazon coworkers: sign our open letter below to tell Amazon leadership that we need a more responsible rollout of AI. Every single signature makes our message stronger. In recent years, tech leaders have accelerated their race to build the most powerful AI first. “Sink or swim,” “AI is not going anywhere,” and “work with it or be replaced” have become mantras in workspaces at Amazon and beyond. We, the undersigned Amazon employees, have serious concerns about this aggressive rollout during the global rise of authoritarianism and our most important years to reverse the climate crisis. We believe that the all-costs-justified, warp-speed approach to AI development will do staggering damage to democracy, to our jobs, and to the earth. We’re the workers who develop, train, and use AI, so we have a responsibility to intervene. Here’s why we’re sounding the alarm: Amazon is casting aside its climate goals to build AI. We have just a few years to stop disastrous levels of warming. Yet despite committing to net zero carbon emissions by 2040, Amazon’s annual emissions have grown roughly 35% since 2019. The AI race is widening this gap. The company plans to spend $150 billion building new data centers for AI. Many of these will be in drought-stressed regions, where they will consume scarce water, or in locations where their energy demands will force utility companies to keep coal plants online or build new gas plants. Amazon even killed legislation that would have required its data centers to use clean energy. Meanwhile, AWS is helping oil companies drill for more oil and gas. Amazon is forcing us to use AI while investing in a future where it’s easier to discard us. Andy Jassy promised that soon Amazon will be full of AI tools and “agents,” and that he expects to employ fewer humans. He claims our (remaining) jobs will be “even more exciting and fun,” but here’s what we’re actually experiencing: higher expected output and shorter timelines, mandates to build AI tools for wasteful use cases, and massive investment in AI with little investment in career advancement. Our logistics coworkers have been especially impacted by work speedups, surveillance, injuries and burnout. All this, while Amazon is attempting to declare the National Labor Relations Board, which protects workers’ rights, unconstitutional. Amazon is helping build a more militarized surveillance state with fewer protections for ordinary people. Amazon, alongside Meta, Microsoft and Google lobbied to ban state regulation on AI for the next ten years; Trump financially disincentivized state regulatory action in his AI Action Plan. Trump demanded an end to “wokeness” in AI; Amazon has scaled back its commitments to DEI and offered the administration a 1 billion dollar coupon for AWS, with a DOGE staffer calling the deal “a foundational piece to help implement President Trump’s AI Action Plan.” The military wants AI technologies at top speed; Amazon has announced a collaboration with an autonomous weapons software company. Trump’s ICE Director wants to run mass deportation “like Prime, but with human beings”; Amazon, a major provider of cloud services to DHS and to Palantir, literally does power mass deportation. Amazon is expanding the surveillance state in other ways, too. It’s making Ring AI-first and re-introducing a tool for police to request footage; it’s using AI to surveil warehouse workers, and, of course, its own customers. Finally, Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post, and has begun asserting more control over that publication; the other major AI players control mass information ecosystems like Instagram and X. If these collaborations continue, we will be ceding an unbelievable amount of power into the hands of an increasingly authoritarian government and a few companies willing to abandon any principles they claim to have in the race for AI dominance. All of this is daunting, but none of it is inevitable. A better future is still very much within reach, but it requires us to get real about the costs of AI and the guardrails we need. We demand Amazon leadership commit to the following: No AI with dirty energy.No more vague promises that “AI will solve the climate crisis.” Amazon must implement a public plan that includes: 1) powering all data centers with 100% additional, local renewable energy, 24/7, 2) ending custom AI solutions for oil & gas companies to drill more oil faster, and 3) publishing a detailed, science-backed glidepath for how it will meet its climate commitments. No AI without employee voices.We want ethical AI working groups of non-managers across the company that will have significant ownership over org-level goals and how or if AI should be used in their orgs, how or if AI-related layoffs or headcount freezes are implemented, and how to mitigate or minimize the collateral effects of AI use, such as environmental impact. No AI for violence, surveillance, or mass deportation.Amazon sells a huge range of products and services — from physical goods to digital infrastructure to films to medical services. It should not need to be helping surveil civilians in Gaza, collaborating with AI companies that specialize in drone warfare, or supporting a mass deportation machine. The Amazon employees signing this letter believe in building a better world — not in building bunkers to fall back to. We want the promised gains from AI to give everyone more freedom to play and rest, to spend time with family and friends, to be moved by nature, to create, to feel safe being who we are. This is an incredibly consequential moment in history. It’s time for us to step up and spark a conversation about the real benefits and costs of AI. Workers have guided Amazon to a better path before, and we can do it again. The choices we make now, for the planet, for its people and animals, matter more than ever. Let’s make ones we can be proud of. Signed, The Amazon employees below I signed the letter, what else can I do to help? Fill out our Get Involved form! We have a lot of work ahead to hold leadership accountable and we need all the help we can get. If you don’t work at Amazon, click here tosign on to a solidarity statement. I'm not an Amazon employee! What can I do? Your support can still help to strengthen our message to Amazon leadership. Click here to sign on anonymously to our solidarity statement. I’m signing with my name and personal contact info -- can Amazon see my name? Who’s going to have access to my information? Your contact info is confidential: we will not share it with Amazon or anyone else. We are asking for it so we can contact you with updates and to verify you work at Amazon. When at least 1,000 employees have signed the letter, we will publish the roles and orgs of all signatories, not names. We will not publish any employee names. I’m scared to sign. What are the risks? We will never share your name with Amazon or with anyone else. We will only publish job roles and orgs after we collect at least 1,000 signatures. We understand why you’re scared because we are too. We have written and signed this letter not only because we are deeply worried about senior leadership driving us into a dark future but also because we see an opportunity for our actions to ripple beyond just our company. We ourselves have been looking for inspiration, trying to find everyday people fighting to resist authoritarianism and all its insidious arms, and we realized that we can’t just rely on others to inspire or save us. We have to do our part too. Signing is a decision only you can make. Thank you for deeply considering. Why should I sign? Why does this matter? We wrote this letter because we feel a deep pit in our stomachs working at this company, knowing that our leadership is actively supporting the Trump administration and exploiting workers and the planet along the way. The AI transition, the climate crisis, and descent into authoritarianism are happening right now; Jassy and Bezos have already made it clear what they’re doing about it. We have a narrow window to demand a different path before it’s too late, and those demands will only be heard if as many of us as possible sign on and speak up together. There is too much at stake. Will this letter be released publicly? Will my name be shared publicly? After we hit at least 1,000 signatures from Amazon employees, we will publicly list all the roles and orgs of everyone who signed. We will NOT publish names. This letter will be fully public once it's released Amazon is a big company with a lot of power! What do we think this letter will do and why? We want to catalyze change, and we think amassing a number of signatures to a well-researched and well-publicized letter will do that in a few ways. It will add a much-needed dose of reality to the larger Al conversation. Right now, it seems like everyone is talking about AI, but the points in this letter are not being talked about enough. We can change that. The tide is already turning, and we’re at an inflection point; the MIT study about 95% of corporate purchases of AI failing to increase profits, and the possible deflation or even bursting of the AI bubble. It’s the right moment to start a more serious, balanced conversation. If enough employees sign and this letter enters public awareness, that may force Amazon leadership to respond in some way to our demands. We want tech workers to know that they have a voice and a stake in how AI development plays out, and that their perspectives are crucial in the fight for the future. We think the letter will encourage more conversations among tech workers at Amazon and beyond. Isn’t AI inevitable? What are some examples of workers being able to push back? SEIU in Pennsylvania established a workers council on AI. AAUP in Miami established an AI Task Force and sent out a survey asking faculty members and librarians how AI affects teaching and research—showing that AI is an issue that affects their working conditions. National Nurses United created a bill of rights regarding the use of AI in healthcare, including rights to person-to-person care and for developers to demonstrate that AI tools are safe before being used to help with patient care. And NNU has had some early victories — at USC hospitals and Kaiser Permanente — they’ve won assurances that AI won’t replace human nurses and for workers to form an oversight committee on how AI is getting used in hospitals. Writers Guild of America and Screen Actors Guild, through sustained striking and contract negotiations, won new contracts that included some protections against GenAI being used without their consent or compensation, and more worker agency in determining how they use GenAI on the job.

Michael Glennon RTÉ Sport Journalist Shayne Bolton hopes he can put into action some of the tips he picked up hanging out with the seniors when Ireland XV take on Spain tomorrow. The Connacht winger, who was capped against Portugal during the summer when most of the frontliners were away on British and Irish Lions duty, was added as a "cover" player for the trip to Chicago for Ireland v New Zealand. "The coach has been giving me a few work-ons in my game," the 25-year-old said of Andy Farrell ahead of the 4pm Irish time kick-off against Spain in Leganes. "I got loads of information [on the US trip], just seeing how the boys look at the game, especially the back threes, how they look at the game, what they're looking at, and how we can take opportunities in the game, looking for where we can attack in the game. "I think it was a really big two weeks for me, just being in the camp with them and seeing how the preparations go before a big Test week and just getting that feeling and the buzz around the place. "I feel way more comfortable over the last couple of weeks. I know almost everyone now. [I was] very nervous the first time I came in, just trying to be quiet and kind of sneak under the radar. "But now I'm bringing out my personality a bit more and feeling way more comfortable." Asked what he believes he needs to do to push on, the 6ft 2in back (above) said: "I think the preparation is almost more important than the game itself. "Obviously, we've lots of new detail or moves and stuff in the week before the game. "So usually with the provinces, all your calls are kind of the same consistently throughout the year, whereas we just have a week now to get that detail, all the moves sorted, how you execute that on the pitch. "I think we have two training sessions before the game. Stewart to skipper experienced Ireland XV "So they want to see how fast you can learn your detail, and how good you can execute that out on the pitch." Bolton was born in South Africa and had spells with the Blue Bulls and Cheetahs early in his career. After finding his progress stalled, he moved to Connacht in the summer of 2021. He qualifies for Ireland via his Dublin-born grandmother, Noirín Stapleton, who hails from Blackrock. He explained: "I grew up in South Africa, in Pretoria. I was born there. In school I played for the Blue Bulls, and after school I went to the Cheetahs academy in Bloemfontein, and then when I was 21 I got the contract offer from Connacht. "I only had a two-year contract out of school at the Cheetahs. "They didn't offer me a contract extension. So for my third year, I was basically just playing college rugby and I wasn't getting many opportunities there, so I decided to take a chance and come into Ireland and it's paid off. "[My grandmother] lived close to my home in Pretoria. I've known her all my life. "She's still with us. I see her every time I go back to South Africa to visit my family. [She’s] very proud of me, sending me messages every game-week. "[I've] no regrets. It's worked out as I hoped and more. I never thought I'd be in this environment so very thankful." isten to the RTÉ Rugby podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts.

While other countries rapidly embrace blockchain-based market infrastructure, Australian institutions remain "too comfortable with the status quo,” Australian Securities and Investments Commission Chair Joe Longo said, while speaking at the National Press Club on Tuesday. Longo said that tokenization changes the “exclusivity” once limited to institutional players and high-net-worth investors, by allowing assets like private equity and fixed income to be “broken into smaller, more affordable units, and traded quickly and securely on a global scale.” "Australia faces a choice—to innovate or stagnate," Longo said. "Once, Australia was one of the early adopters of innovation in markets... Now, other countries are outpacing us." Speaking to Decrypt, Steve Vallas, CEO of Blockchain APAC, said Longo’s remarks “send a strong signal to traditional finance” to embrace tokenization, calling it a wake-up call for Australia and “the clearest message yet from our chief market regulator.” Vallas, who said he was in Washington “in rooms that included Mr Longo,” said seeing “the pace of change in these larger and faster markets” made the urgency clear, adding it was a reminder that “the world is moving and adapting and we need to do the same.” The ASIC chair noted that banking giant J.P. Morgan told him their money market funds will be entirely tokenized within the next two years, meaning "their investors will keep earning while value is moving instantly," compared to current technology where transactions take days to settle. Distributed ledger technology allows new players to “offer financial market services and challenge the status quo,” he added. Longo’s concerns come as industry leaders in the U.S, including former TD Ameritrade chair Joe Moglia, and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, predict a global shift toward tokenization, while EU markets chief Natasha Cazenave has cautioned that the transformation must be matched with strong investor safeguards. The ASIC chair said he met with U.S. SEC Chair Paul Atkins, where it became clear to him that Australia is vying for the same global capital as its peers, with only a short window to “seize a larger slice of this opportunity, and if the nation remains passive, it risks becoming “the land of missed opportunity.” The agency’s recent tokenization survey reportedly revealed troubling disengagement from the financial sector as around half of market participants declined to take part or even meet with regulators, with only one-third providing detailed feedback, according to Longo. Vallas argued that capital models aren’t the main barrier, noting that, “conviction comes first, capital treatment second,” and saying Longo’s signal helps boards move from hesitation to action rather than using regulation as an excuse to wait. Longo, who has previously called crypto “highly speculative” and Bitcoin’s rise “a classic case of the bigger fool theory,” said ASIC’s new digital-asset guidance is meant to give industry “regulatory certainty to innovate with confidence.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: More Than 1 Million Jobs Have Been Cut This Year, Report Says

ByMary Whitfill Roeloffs, Forbes Staff. American companies have cut more than 1 million jobs so far this year, a new report showed Thursday, ranking 2025 among the worst years for job losses in decades as companies embrace artificial intelligence, consumer spending softens and hiring freezes take effect. Private and public employers cut 153,074 jobs in October, according to a report from career services firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a 183% increase from the month before and a 175% spike over the same month last year. More than 1 million jobs have been cut so far this year, up 65% from the 664,839 announced in the first 10 months of 2024 and 44% more than cuts made in all of 2024. The government, responsible for more than 300,000 job losses, remains the sector with the most cuts this year, followed by the technology, warehousing, retail and service sectors. Job cuts have surpassed 1 million in a year only four other times in the last 32 years: 2001 (when the dot-com bubble burst), 2008 and 2009 (in the midst of the Great Recession) and 2020 (when the COVID pandemic struck). Andrew Challenger, chief revenue officer and labor expert for Challenger, Gray & Christmas, blamed the adoption of artificial intelligence, federal budget cuts, lower customer and corporate spending and rising costs for the job cuts announced in October. Last month brought the highest number of job cuts for any October since 2003, when large layoffs were announced in the telecommunications sector as cell phones gained wide adoption. "Like in 2003, a disruptive technology is changing the landscape," Challenger said.

Title: Federal Reserve allegedly pumped $29.4B into US banking system. That's not the actual total
URL: https://www.snopes.com//fact-check/federal-reserve-injecting-money-banking-system/
Time Published: 2025-11-06T12:00:00Z
Full Content:
About this rating The Federal Reserve actually injected banks with more than $50 billion in repo agreements on Oct. 31, 2025, which social media users correctly identified as an anomaly compared with the last five years. However, the Federal Reserve also sold about the same amount in reverse repo agreements that same day, meaning it also took about $50 billion from banks at the same time. These agreements are essentially overnight loans, and therefore get paid back with interest the following business day. In November 2025, some people on social media began posting screenshots of a chart from the Federal Reserve that they claimed was cause for alarm. The Fed, the posts claimed, pumped $29.4 billion into the U.S. banking system overnight on Oct. 31, 2025, a level the posts claimed surpassed the peak of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s. One X post (archived), which used a screenshot of the chart as evidence, was viewed millions of times in the next couple of days. Similar posts were widely seen and shared on Facebook (archived), Reddit (archived) and Threads (archived). While it is true that the Federal Reserve injected at least $29 billion into the U.S. banking system overnight on Oct. 31, that wasn't the total amount. The actual amount injected was $50 billion, through short-term transactions called repo agreements that are paid back the following business day. The same day, the Fed also took $50 billion out of the banking system in reverse transactions. For this reason, we've rated this claim a mixture of true and false information. The kinds of transactions highlighted in the posts are called repo agreements. As the Federal Reserve Bank of New York describes it, an overnight repo transaction is when the Fed purchases securities from another party with an agreement to resell those securities the next business day. Each repo transaction is economically similar to a loan collateralized by securities, according to the Fed. A reverse repo transaction does the opposite — the other party purchases securities from the Federal Reserve and the Fed buys those securities back the next business day. Repo agreements also can be made between private banks without the Fed's participation or assets and with different lengths of time before repayment. Because the Federal Reserve gives money to the bank when it buys its security in a repo agreement, it essentially infuses the bank with cash until the following business day, when the Fed sells back the security. When the Fed sells a security to the bank in a reverse repo agreement, it's taking cash from the bank for that business day in exchange for the interest the Fed pays the bank when it buys back the security. Therefore the Federal Reserve can use repo operations to ensure the smooth functioning of short-term funding markets by temporarily increasing available cash in the U.S. banking system through repo agreements or temporarily reducing cash in the system through reverse repo agreements, according to BlackRock Cash Management. The chart screenshotted in many of the posts was the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis' graph of Treasury securities purchased by the Federal Reserve in overnight repo agreements. If you hover over Oct. 31, 2025, on that graph, you can see that the Federal Reserve purchased $29.4 billion of these securities in overnight repo agreements that day. That number stands out as far higher than any other over the past five years, which is the timeframe the graph defaults to. If you expand it to 10 years, however, you'll see that the Federal Reserve made far more purchases of Treasury securities in overnight repo agreements in 2019, when a technical glitch disrupted the private repo market and spurred the Federal Reserve into action, and in 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic again upset the short-term funding market. But Treasury securities aren't the only securities the Federal Reserve buys and sells on the repo market. Its page for recent repo operations shows that the Fed also deals in agency securities and mortgage-backed securities. Between its two daily operations and three different securities, the Federal Reserve actually gave the banking system a temporary injection of $50.35 billion on Oct. 31. The Federal Reserve isn't just participating in the overnight repo market every day; it's also conducting overnight reverse repo operations each day. On Oct. 31, the Federal Reserve sold $51.80 billion in its operations that day. Therefore, between its repo agreements and reverse repo agreements, the Federal Reserve actually took $1.45 billion out of the short-term market that day. The data available from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis show that total securities purchased by the Fed through overnight repo agreements follow the same trends as Treasury security purchases: The operation was the biggest since 2020, but smaller than operations from 2019 and 2020. When traced back to 2000, this operation was larger than any other overnight repo operation outside of 2019 and 2020. Its reverse repo operation on Oct. 31 — which, again, took more money out of the system than that day's repo operation put into the system — was actually small compared to most of the reverse repo operations from the past five years. During a period between 2022 and 2023, the Federal Reserve regularly bought more than $2 trillion in securities through overnight reverse repo agreements, according to Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis data. Prior to 2021, that $51.80 billion was significant for a reverse repo operation. Although the Federal Reserve regularly passed that number in operations between 2013 and 2020, it wasn't until 2021 that these operations started to balloon into the trillions. In 2021, following the scares in 2019 and 2020, the Federal Reserve became more active in the short-term funding market. That year, it established the Standing Repurchase Agreement (repo) Facility to serve as a backstop in money markets and support smooth market functioning. It has seen little use since its creation — something Lorie Logan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, expressed disappointment over on Oct. 31, the same day as the major jump in repo agreements — making the $50.35 billion in repo agreements on Oct. 31 a record since the Fed established it. Meanwhile, in 2022 the Federal Reserve's balance sheet peaked at nearly $9 trillion in assets and the interest rates it paid on reverse repos became higher than the yields on the securities it held, according to a Congressional Research Service report. By letting its securities mature and roll off the balance sheet and these reverse repos, the Federal Reserve has gradually reduced its balance sheet to about $6.6 trillion in assets. In Logan's Oct. 31 speech at a banking conference, she said the Federal Reserve will stop trying to reduce its assets as of Dec. 1. The Federal Reserve injecting money into short-term markets through repo agreements isn't necessarily a sign of looming crisis. In fact, Logan encouraged banks to use the Standing Repurchase Agreement Facility and thus take these cash infusions through repo agreements more often.

Title: Welcome to tokenization, where everything under the sun (and the sun) has its digital price
URL: https://www.theblaze.com/return/welcome-to-tokenization-where-everything-under-the-sun-and-the-sun-has-its-digital-price
Time Published: 2025-11-06T12:00:00Z
Full Content:
Tech by Blaze Media Our elites' latest scheme is to put anything that exists up for sale. In a recent appearance with Glenn Beck, Whitney Webb lays out her case that the Great Reset did not end with the election of Donald Trump. Elites, ever given to schemes involving central control, reallocation, and number-go-up, are planning to tokenize everything they possibly can, including natural resources. Webb draws a connective line between BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, the World Economic Forum (not exactly a freedom-oriented outfit), digital ID, and this process of so-called tokenization. This term is new to many people. Essentially, tokenization refers to the process of placing a metric, a mark, an identifying code on an object. The identifying marker is then pumped into an aggregating and analytical machine. There is, no doubt, some obscurantism in the tech community, intentional or otherwise, as well as some heavy cognitive dissonance playing out for the rest of us as we watch the real, actual economy withering at our feet. How does giving (or selling) rights to natural resources like water help you and your neighbors pay bills, raise families, live in some semblance of accord with God? The coming system is intended to solve for the management of not just anything but everything. Neither Larry Fink nor the WEF are working on our behalf by digitizing water. Then what are they up to? Dropping in recently on CNBC, Fink said, “I do believe we’re just at the beginning of the tokenization of all assets, from real estate to equities to bonds, across the board.” Through the implementation of natural resource assets, the plan is to mark, meter, and digitize water, trees, air, and animals of every sort, then pin their existence, in the digital tokens' monetized form, to the shared economy. That unlocks foreign investment and, one imagines, perpetuates some modified version of the ever-unstable and unsatisfactory financial enclosure of benefits and retirement that has, so far, kept enough U.S. citizens satiated to keep it rolling. Any and every AI is designed or able to adapt to the tokenization process. It needs be automatic and fast enough to keep up-to-the-minute record of millions or billions of transactions, sales, shorts, liquidations, and so forth. Rather than a system of streams or channels, the need is for computing to move like water itself. For Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies hoping to participate in the tokenization bonanza, that means their encryption and storing of information (through so-called hashes and ledgers) needs to flow at the speed of the global digital economy. Indeed, we’ve seen for years that some lesser-known cryptocurrency companies, like Hashbar as one example, have been building their hash, as it were, to function within an AI-controlled global marketplace. These hash-products, not too dissimilar from Bitcoin in terms of their ledger-keeping properties, are meant, in a stupefying sense, to mark individual drops and tranches of liquid or digitally liquified assets. RELATED: Can anyone save America from European-style digital ID? Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images It's hard to visualize such unnatural and invisible arrangements, so here's a real-world example: Say you have 10,000 board feet of Douglas fir trees on a lot in Washington state. If the Fink version of tokenization goes forward, you’ll be able to “digitize” those useful board feet of wood and sell portions, as opposed to the whole lot. Now picture that process for, well, anything you can imagine and much that you can't. In simple terms, the likely outcome of all of this BlackRock-WEF-AI machination is immediate dissociation between the human and the trees, the fir needles, the smell of the soil. All of that, given enough backroom dealing, political sloth, and diabolical Wall Street ingenuity, will be erased. Are we talking about selling public lands? Theoretically, yes. Although major legal, regulatory, and political hurdles remain, the principle of leaving at least some portions of the created world exempt from actionable financial valuation is already eroding away. The accelerating logic of digital terraforming has no conceptual limit. Granting the premise that tokenization is good, not only should private property be tokenized, but all water, all minerals, and every possible other item with unexploited value rooted in human experience. The coming AI, digital ID, hash-rated system is intended to solve for the management of not just anything but everything. The disturbing undercurrent of plans, outcomes, and inertia around this improbable intersection of technologies gets more disturbing when you accept that it is, in fact, a long-term plan nearly realized. In her chat with Beck, Webb outlines another piece of the puzzle, termed “natural asset corporations.” This is pitched to the mainstream as a way to invest in conservation, ensure biodiversity, and so forth. But if we recall the century-long technocratic play, the current AI inertia, and the bipartisan support for anything to keep the fiat economy limping along, it’s easy to see how those natural assets under ownership might be subject to changes in any legal stipulation barring sales to other corporate or government entities. Those interlocking directorships have a knack for change. We haven’t even mentioned energy, but we must, because this scheme ultimately needs to take into account the sun itself! Who owns the sun? Well, BlackRock, of course. Or some quasi-tech giant/WEF version of BlackRock. Actually, no one owns the sun but God, and we have to remember this fact. By way of the wholly God-given system, we see that the sun feeds the grass, grass feeds the animals, we eat the animals. The technical details on the capture of energy are intense, involving data centers to run the AI, political control to rubber-stamp the terraforming for the electrical inputs, and, at some near point, the encrypting of energetic inputs into a digital (hashing) ledger to be monitored, metered, and controlled. You can probably see here how necessary the personal digital ID is to the entire panopticon. But if not, consider it unlikely that your or my interests are going to be taken into consideration by third-country customer service agents employed by the electrical company to manage our dissatisfaction in the event that a neighborhood brown-out is required while grid power is shunted over to the local data center.

November 06, 2025 04:05 ET | Source: DayTrading.com DayTrading.com LONDON, Nov. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Analysis from an investor with 60,000+ hours trading under his belt and a degree in Economics from Harvard examines the current valuation landscape of U.S. equities. DayTrading.com’s Dan Buckley started by looking at basic metrics, namely the forward Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio. This evaluates how much today’s investors are paying for each dollar of next year’s expected profit.The U.S. market is trading at roughly 23x forward earnings, which is far above the 15x times level seen in international markets. "This is an extreme gap, representing a roughly 51% void," Buckley says. "When valuations stretch this far, future returns are often modest at best and downright negative at worst." The last times the U.S. hit these sorts of valuations were: Buckley noted that since the 2021 peak, the U.S. stock market has delivered a compound annual return of around 9%, but before that, it went nearly a decade without making substantial, sustained gains. After the downturn in early 2022, U.S. equities took nearly two years just to get back to previous highs. A Market Bigger Than Its EconomyAnalysis from DayTrading.com reviewed several metrics highlighting a familiar pattern: global investors maintain a significant weighting in U.S. assets compared with the scale of the underlying economy. This imbalance reflects how influential U.S. markets have become within global portfolios and index benchmarks. U.S. Market ImbalanceThe research highlighted that the U.S. currently represents around 65% of the MSCI All Country World Index. This is a benchmark that guides billions in global investment flows. Yet by comparison, America produces only around 26% of the world’s economic output in nominal dollar terms, and it’s actually more like 15% when adjusted for the cost of living. Buckley noted that even investment vehicles labelled as "global" reflect this outsized concentration. For example, Vanguard’s Total World Stock ETF (VT), is often used as a diversified core holding by many institutions. That still invests around 66% of its assets in the U.S., with 4% just in Nvidia. "When one single chipmaker accounts for more in a portfolio than many entire countries, diversification is merely a slogan - not a reality," Buckley added. The Outsized Impact Of AIDayTrading.com's research took aim at AI, pointing out that roughly half of the S&P 500’s gains in 2025 stem from companies tied to artificial intelligence - semiconductor leaders, mega-cap platforms, and infrastructure providers. These include now household names like Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Palantir (PLTR). Buckley observed that AI has become a major focus for both markets and corporate strategy, but noted that the extent and pace of its long-term impact remain to be seen. "It’s true that AI will transform many businesses and their operations," he says. "But investors are pouring money in assuming every firm will be a winner, and better yet, all at the same time. But that’s rarely how innovation pays out – just look at the dot-com era, where many went under and only a few flourished." Market Perspective: A Measured ViewBuckley emphasized that his comments should not be interpreted as forecasting a market downturn. Rather, he offered a measured assessment of current U.S. equity conditions, noting potential areas of imbalance that may emerge when market expectations are elevated. While financial markets can often behave unpredictably, Buckley observed that not all sectors appear overextended. Certain segments—including financials, healthcare, select industrials, and international markets—continue to show valuations that align more closely with underlying fundamentals. “U.S. stocks don’t necessarily need a flood of negative news to experience adjustment,” Buckley noted. “Even subtle signs of strain can have an effect when perfection is already reflected in prices.”The full analysis is available here: U.S. Stocks: Great Expectations, Even Greater Valuations About DayTrading.comDayTrading.com is a platform that provides information and market analysis for individual investors.

DayTrading.com’s Dan Buckley started by looking at basic metrics, namely the forward Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio. This evaluates how much today’s investors are paying for each dollar of next year’s expected profit.The U.S. market is trading at roughly 23x forward earnings, which is far above the 15x times level seen in international markets. "This is an extreme gap, representing a roughly 51% void," Buckley says. "When valuations stretch this far, future returns are often modest at best and downright negative at worst." The last times the U.S. hit these sorts of valuations were: Buckley noted that since the 2021 peak, the U.S. stock market has delivered a compound annual return of around 9%, but before that, it went nearly a decade without making substantial, sustained gains. After the downturn in early 2022, U.S. equities took nearly two years just to get back to previous highs. A Market Bigger Than Its EconomyAnalysis from DayTrading.com reviewed several metrics highlighting a familiar pattern: global investors maintain a significant weighting in U.S. assets compared with the scale of the underlying economy. This imbalance reflects how influential U.S. markets have become within global portfolios and index benchmarks. U.S. Market ImbalanceThe research highlighted that the U.S. currently represents around 65% of the MSCI All Country World Index. This is a benchmark that guides billions in global investment flows. Yet by comparison, America produces only around 26% of the world’s economic output in nominal dollar terms, and it’s actually more like 15% when adjusted for the cost of living. Buckley noted that even investment vehicles labelled as "global" reflect this outsized concentration. For example, Vanguard’s Total World Stock ETF (VT), is often used as a diversified core holding by many institutions. That still invests around 66% of its assets in the U.S., with 4% just in Nvidia. "When one single chipmaker accounts for more in a portfolio than many entire countries, diversification is merely a slogan - not a reality," Buckley added. The Outsized Impact Of AIDayTrading.com's research took aim at AI, pointing out that roughly half of the S&P 500’s gains in 2025 stem from companies tied to artificial intelligence - semiconductor leaders, mega-cap platforms, and infrastructure providers. These include now household names like Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Palantir (PLTR). Buckley observed that AI has become a major focus for both markets and corporate strategy, but noted that the extent and pace of its long-term impact remain to be seen. "It’s true that AI will transform many businesses and their operations," he says. "But investors are pouring money in assuming every firm will be a winner, and better yet, all at the same time. But that’s rarely how innovation pays out – just look at the dot-com era, where many went under and only a few flourished." Market Perspective: A Measured ViewBuckley emphasized that his comments should not be interpreted as forecasting a market downturn. Rather, he offered a measured assessment of current U.S. equity conditions, noting potential areas of imbalance that may emerge when market expectations are elevated. While financial markets can often behave unpredictably, Buckley observed that not all sectors appear overextended. Certain segments—including financials, healthcare, select industrials, and international markets—continue to show valuations that align more closely with underlying fundamentals. “U.S. stocks don’t necessarily need a flood of negative news to experience adjustment,” Buckley noted. “Even subtle signs of strain can have an effect when perfection is already reflected in prices.”The full analysis is available here: U.S. Stocks: Great Expectations, Even Greater Valuations About DayTrading.comDayTrading.com is a platform that provides information and market analysis for individual investors.

Title: How HBCUs Plan to Spend MacKenzie Scott’s Money

The philanthropist dropped upward of $300 million on historically Black colleges and universities this fall. Campus leaders are overjoyed and spending in ways they never thought possible. By Sara Weissman You have /5 articles left.Sign up for a free account or log in. Historically Black colleges and universities are celebrating another round of donations from MacKenzie Scott. Photo illustration by Justin Morrison/Inside Higher Ed | Raymond Boyd and picture alliance/Getty Images | Katherine Frey and Michael A. McCoy/The Washington Post/Getty Images | sshepard/iStock/Getty Images Philanthropist MacKenzie Scott showered historically Black colleges and universities with hundreds of millions of dollars this fall in another one of her signature giving sprees. HBCU leaders say the unrestricted lump sums are a godsend after decades of chronic underfunding—and they’re putting them to good use, padding previously meager endowments and funding a wide variety of technology advances, research ventures and scholarships. Scott, the ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has repeatedly poured funds into often underresourced institutions, including HBCUs, as part of a 2019 pledge to give away half of her wealth in her lifetime. Her largess to colleges and nonprofits has come in waves since 2020. By 2023, her gifts to educational institutions and nonprofits exceeded $1 billion. At HBCUs, those funds led to new research centers, endowed chair positions and more aid for students, among other initiatives. Some institutions, like Bowie State University, saved and invested the money, benefiting them years down the line. Scott’s latest round of donations to HBCUs includes some whopping sums: $80 million to Howard University in Washington, D.C.; $38 million to the University of Maryland Eastern Shore; and $38 million each to Spelman College and Clark Atlanta University in Georgia. Scott gifted $50 million to Virginia State University, $42 million to Alcorn State University in Mississippi, $38 million to Alabama State University and $63 million to Morgan State University in Maryland, marking the largest individual gifts in their histories. The United Negro College Fund, an organization representing private HBCUs, also received $70 million from Scott toward its capital campaign to create a $370 million pooled endowment for 37 institutions. The sum, announced last month, will be distributed among HBCUs in the pool. Notoriously private, Scott has spoken little about why HBCUs have loomed so large in her philanthropic portfolio. But in a 2021 blog post, she called higher ed “a proven pathway to opportunity” and said she sought to bolster institutions “successfully educating students who come from communities that have been chronically underserved.” She also had close ties to Howard alumna and author Toni Morrison, who served as Scott’s thesis adviser at Princeton University. Scott cited everyday “acts of kindness” as her inspiration for her recent gifts in a post last month. “When my next cycle of gifts is posted to my database online, the dollar total will likely be reported in the news,” she wrote, upward of $300 million to HBCUs alone, “but any dollar amount is a vanishingly tiny fraction of the personal expressions of care being shared into the world this year.” HBCU leaders say that “tiny fraction” has gone far for their institutions. Scott “really understands the value that these institutions have historically made to the overall competitiveness of our country,” said David K. Wilson, president of Morgan State University. She’s “making transformational investments in these institutions that will enable them to continue to provide in perpetuity opportunities for students to taste the magic of a college degree that will enable them to live productive and prosperous lives.” Brent Swinton, vice president for philanthropic engagement at Bowie State University, which received a $25 million gift from Scott in fiscal year 2021, emphasized how rare unrestricted grants are for any institution, let alone HBCUs. “Unrestricted gifts are the unicorn, the white whale of the fundraising industry,” he said. Scott is “single-handedly saying to HBCUs, ‘Here is an investment for those who already are getting it right but just haven’t had the same opportunities to be in the conversation with philanthropists.’” With fresh funds in hand—and the freedom to use the dollars how they choose—HBCU leaders are dreaming up new plans. Morgan State University put $60 million into its unrestricted endowment. Wilson expects that investment will generate an extra $4 million to $5 million per year for the university and its students going forward. Wilson also set aside $1 million to immediately support its most cash-strapped students. The institution reached out to 2,100 students with “severe financial need,” and already, 600 students have requested the funding to help them finish out the semester. The university has plans to create a new brain science research center as well, adding to the research centers it established with help from the last grant from Scott in 2020. Morgan State used part of that $40 million grant to win state appropriations for its National Center for the Elimination of Educational Disparities and its Center on Urban Health Equity. The university is filling those centers with “faculty members who will be churning out original research that’s coming from the perspective of researchers who really understand what some of those challenges are within our communities that are preventing the students from achieving their full potential,” Wilson said. He partly credits Scott’s gifts for Morgan State hovering on the precipice of R-1 status, the Carnegie Foundation classification for universities with very high research activity. Howard University received $80 million from Scott. Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images Howard University became the only HBCU to attain R-1 status earlier this year. Now, about $17 million of Scott’s donation to Howard is earmarked for its College of Medicine, to expand it and establish a new academic medical center. Howard also plans to invest in capital construction and renovation projects, including new residence halls, and to create a reserve in response to the government shutdown. Interim Howard University president Wayne A. I. Frederick said students are affected by delays in federal food benefits and layoffs and furloughs of federal employees in their families. Federal appropriations to Howard have been waylaid, as well. “We want to give students some temporary relief,” Frederick said. Spelman College’s interim president, Rosalind Brewer, emphasized that these gifts come at a time of “quite a bit of uncertainty in higher ed” as federal policy changes roil institutions. She said the $38 million to Spelman offers her flexibility in how to respond. Unrestricted gifts are the unicorn, the white whale of the fundraising industry.” For example, Spelman plans to put some of the funding toward new scholarships, particularly for juniors and seniors who rely on Parent PLUS loans, which will be capped starting next year due to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The goal is to close financial gaps for juniors and seniors who may struggle to pay to finish their degrees. Spelman also spent a previous gift from Scott, $20 million given in 2020, on student scholarships, as well as its endowment. “Some days, we don’t know what we’re going to face the next day,” Brewer said. The donation “gives us the confidence that, come what may the next morning, we just may be a little bit more prepared.” The gift to Spelman will also support an effort to improve classroom technology, including new tools to teach artificial intelligence skills to students. The college came out with a technology road map last month that it’s eager to get started on with the new support. An unrestricted gift “allows us to look at our strategic plan and apply it to where we know the money will work best for us,” Brewer said. “That makes this donation, quite honestly, a lot more generous than most people would realize.” HBCUs that received funds from Scott in years past say the gifts are still paying dividends. Bowie State University invested $22.5 million of its $25 million gift into its endowment. At the time, the endowment stood around $8 million. Four years later, it’s surpassed $49 million, buttressed both by Scott’s giving and other philanthropic donations that followed her “vote of confidence,” Swinton said. He noted building up endowments has been a longtime goal for many HBCUs but hard to achieve. “Endowments are not sexy, but they are lifeblood and the nest egg for an institution,” he said. “If you took all 103 HBCU endowments and added them up today, they still wouldn’t come close to any of the top 10 endowments of [predominantly white institutions].” Bowie State took the $2.5 million left over and used it to apply for matching grants from other philanthropies that it wouldn’t have had the funds to qualify for in the past. One of those partnerships enabled Bowie State to create its first endowed chair position in cybersecurity and innovation. “We look to do more of that, to be able to establish positions that will build our infrastructure, that now have a source of permanent funding, instead of being completely reliant on whatever the state budget allows” as a public HBCU, Swinton said. Frederick, of Howard University, said he also feels a lasting impact from Scott’s past gifts in 2020 and 2023, $40 million and $12 million, respectively. Those funds enabled Howard to set up the Toni Morrison Endowed Chair in Arts and Humanities and to spread the wealth, creating a $500,000 scholarship for graduates of the University of District of Columbia, a local HBCU that didn’t get Scott funds, to attend Howard’s graduate and professional programs. Howard also increased its emergency aid funding for students. Scott is “doing things so differently,” Frederick said. “It provides us with a lot of freedom to do what we need to do.” (Article was corrected to reflect UNCF's plans for a $370 million pooled endowment.)

Title: Asian shares advance after solid earnings and economic reports updates lift Wall Street

Wall Street logged tiny gains before the bell with markets relying heavily on corporate earnings data for insight into how the U.S. economy is doing in the absence of government data due to the shutdown Wall Street logged tiny gains before the bell Thursday with markets relying heavily on corporate earnings data for insight into how the U.S. economy is doing in the absence of government data due to the shutdown. Futures for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were up 0.2% ahead of the market's open, while futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched up 0.1%. Shares of Lyft rose 6.2% after hours, even as the ride-hailing app badly missed Wall Street's sales and profit targets. However, Lyft did post some of its best-ever numbers across several categories and investors seemed optimistic about the company's multiple corporate partnerships, many related to autonomous vehicles. Food delivery app DoorDash tumbled 12% overnight after it warned investors that it will be spending significantly more on product development next year. DoorDash's third-quarter revenue beat Wall Street targets but its profit fell short. That, combined with research and development costs rising 23% to $355 million, sent investors for the exits. Elsewhere, in Europe at midday Britain's FTSE 100 ticked down a modest 0.1% after the Bank of England kept its main interest rate unchanged at 4% as expected. Germany's DAX lost 0.3% while the CAC 40 in Paris declined 0.6%. In Asia, shares bounced back from a retreat the day before. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 jumped 1.3% to 50,883.68. Shares in Nissan Motor Co. fell 1.7% after the company said it was selling its headquarters building in Yokohama to raise cash. After trading closed, Nissan reported a 221.9 billion yen ($1.4 billion) loss for April-September and said its revenue dropped 7% from a year earlier. In South Korea, the Kospi advanced 0.6% to 4,026.45. Taiwan's Taiex was up 0.7%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng jumped 2.1% to 26,485.90, while the Shanghai Composite index climbed 0.1% to 4,007.76. However, shares in autonomous driving companies Pony.ai and WeRide fell in their debut on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Pony.ai lost 9.3%, while WeRide's shares fell 10%. Shares in Cathay Pacific Airways gained 4% after it announced that Qatar Airways was selling its 9.57% stake in the Hong Kong-based carrier in a buyback worth $896 million. The deal is subject to shareholder approval. The latest round of earnings offers Wall Street a source of information on consumers, businesses and the economy that is otherwise lacking amid the government shutdown. Important monthly updates on inflation and employment have ceased, leaving investors, economists and the Federal Reserve without a fuller picture of the economy. There are still several informative private economic updates that Wall Street can review, including the monthly report from ADP showed that private payrolls rose more than expected in October. The report offers a partial glimpse into the job market, which has been generally weakening and raising broader concerns about economic growth. A weaker job market remains a big concern for the Fed. The central bank cut its benchmark rate for the second time this year at its most recent meeting, in part to help bolster the economy amid a weakening job market. Lower interest rates can make loans and credit less expensive, potentially promoting economic growth. But, lower rates can also add fuel to inflation, which tends to stunt economic growth. In energy trading, U.S. benchmark crude gained 50 cents to $60.10 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, advanced 44 cents to $63.96 per barrel. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: What the $400 million Snap-Perplexity deal means for users

Every time Aditi publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Snapchat users will soon be able to use the app as an AI search tool. On Wednesday, the social media platform announced a deal to integrate Perplexity AI into Snap's search engine. Perplexity is paying Snap $400 million in cash and equity over a year. "Perplexity's AI-powered answer engine will let Snapchatters ask questions and get clear, conversational answers drawn from verifiable sources, all within Snapchat," Snap said in the Wednesday press release. The companies plan to roll out the Perplexity search engine in early 2026, per the release. A Perplexity spokesperson told Business Insider that user data from Snapchat would not be used for training its AI. "Our goal is to make AI more personal, social, and fun — woven into the fabric of your friendships, Snaps, and conversations," Snap's CEO, Evan Spiegel, said in the release. On Wednesday, Snap reported third-quarter revenue of $1.51 billion, a 10% increase compared to the same period last year. Its monthly active users increased 7% year-over-year to 943 million. Snap's stock price surged more than 17% in after-hours trading on Wednesday. Shares are down more than 35% this year. The Perplexity-Snapchat tieup follows the lead of other social media platforms, such as Meta and X, that have integrated AI chatbots into their app interfaces. In April 2024, Meta introduced the Meta AI chatbot on its applications, including Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook. The chatbot received mixed reviews from users, some of whom complained about it being activated unnecessarily and hindering the app experience. In December, Elon Musk's X launched the Grok chatbot on its app for all free users, which he called a "politically incorrect" alternative to other chatbots. The Perplexity deal comes as Snap is seeing a change in how its users interact. Spiegel said on Wednesday's earnings call that there has been an "engagement shift from things like friend stories to content posted on Spotlight." Spotlight is Snapchat's public discover page, where users can view short, entertaining videos, similar to TikTok's "For You Page," or Instagram's Reels. The company plans to introduce features like games and conversation starters to reignite connections between users. Jump to

Title: WeRide’s CEO pitches robotaxis as a solution to aging populations and long commutes, as the firm raises more money for R&D with a HK IPO

Nicholas Gordon is an Asia editor based in Hong Kong, where he helps to drive Fortune’s coverage of Asian business and economics news. Shares of WeRide start trading on Hong Kong’s stock exchange today, just over a year after the robotaxi firm forayed into U.S. markets with a Nasdaq listing. For founder and CEO Tony Han, the offering is part of a global strategy to fund the expensive but necessary research behind the company’s autonomous-driving tech. WeRide’s shares are now listed on both the Nasdaq and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. WeRide elected for a dual primary listing, which will allow mainland Chinese investors to buy the stock through the city’s Southbound Stock Connect scheme. “We want to make our stock more accessible to investors all over the world,” Han told Fortune in late October, on the sidelines of the Fortune Global Forum. “China is a very important market, both for consumers and also for investors. A Hong Kong dual listing actually helps some potential investors who can only invest in the Hong Kong stock market to buy our stock.” Han says the funds raised through the Hong Kong listing will help the robotaxi firm continue to spend on R&D and deployment. “We will still need to raise more funds,” he said, “so this will put WeRide in a much better position to access more funds.” Fellow robotaxi firm Pony AI also starts trading in Hong Kong today after its own IPO on that exchange. Like WeRide, Pony AI listed on the Nasdaq late last year. Hong Kong’s IPO market is booming as Chinese firms hope to leverage the city’s access to both international and mainland Chinese capital. Firms listed in mainland China, including home appliance manufacturer Midea and battery-maker CATL, have launched secondary listings in Hong Kong in order to draw international investment. Yet several U.S.-listed Chinese companies are also considering primary listings in Hong Kong in order to access mainland Chinese investors. There’s also a geopolitical dimension: U.S.-listed Chinese firms may see Hong Kong as a backup in the event the Trump administration decides to delist them from U.S. exchanges, as part of a yearslong dispute between Washington and Beijing over auditing standards. The city’s Southbound Stock Connect scheme allows certified investors in mainland China to buy stocks listed in Hong Kong. Southbound flows hit a record $110 billion in the first seven months of the year, according to the South China Morning Post citing data from Wind, already greater than the entire total in 2024. Investors are flocking to AI firms and “new consumption”—think Pop Mart and Labubu. Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index is up around 32% for the year so far; by comparison, the Nasdaq Golden Dragon Index, which tracks U.S.-listed Chinese companies, is up 22%. WeRide raised $308 million in its Hong Kong IPO, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. Shares were priced at 27.10 Hong Kong dollars, a slight discount to the stock’s Nasdaq price at Monday’s close. WeRide HK-listed shares fell almost 12% on their first day of Hong Kong trading; the firm’s shares have lost over 40% of their value since the U.S. IPO. Pony AI’s HK shares fell around 14%. Tony Han, formerly chief scientist at Baidu’s autonomous vehicle unit, founded WeRide in 2017. Based in Guangzhou, the self-driving vehicle company operates in several major Chinese cities, as well as markets outside China. The company has deployments in Singapore, France, Spain, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, among others. WeRide is now testing or operating vehicles in 30 cities across 11 countries. WeRide is a member of this year’s Future 50, Fortune’s annual ranking of companies with the greatest potential for growth. The firm is also a member of this year’s Change the World list, which highlights companies that are doing social good through their business models. Han evangelizes the many ways that self-driving vehicles—and moving away from a car-centric culture—can improve society. He predicts that accident rates will be “drastically reduced” once cars are put in the hands of computers as opposed to humans. “Most accidents, we find, are due to human factors,” Han explained, citing the effects of drinking, drowsiness, and distraction on human drivers. “Machines won’t be drunk, won’t overdose. Machines are very reliable. Fatal accident rates for robotaxis are much lower than human drivers.” Less congestion could be another benefit of automated vehicles. “Robotaxis will never speed, will never just cut in line,” he said. “Traffic will just flow much more smoothly.” There’s a broader economic argument for self-driving cars in countries whose populations are rapidly aging as birth rates decline—a particularly thorny problem in China and elsewhere in Asia. “With such huge markets, we will need lots of labor in transport and mobility,” Han said. “If we are shorthanded, then we have to use AI to replace the shortage, to fill the gap between demand and requirements.” That extends to public transport and public services. WeRide runs robobuses, robosweepers, and other automated forms of public transit and city vehicles. “The cost of bus drivers in a developed economy is quite high,” Han explained. If these costs can be reduced through automation, he argued, then cities can expand their transit systems and “help build more eco-friendly transportation for the whole planet.” WeRide reported $27.9 million in revenue for the first six months of 2025, a 32% jump from the same period a year earlier. Still, the company reported a $110 million net loss for that same period, owing in large part to spending of $90 million on research and development, approaching the $107 million spent on R&D for all of 2024. Robotaxis remain an expensive and unprofitable proposition. An HSBC report in July pointed out that self-driving cars have a lot of hidden costs, including remote supervisors, charging and parking infrastructure, and tech support. The bank suggested that robotaxis might not break even until about eight years after launch. Yet HSBC also predicted that robotaxis will likely reach their commercial potential in China first, owing to greater adoption and acceptance of robotaxi technologies. Chinese companies are leading the global push for robotaxis. In addition to WeRide and Pony AI, Baidu is also expanding its robotaxi offerings through its Apollo Go vehicles. China also manufactures many of the components that go into self-driving cars. One key component producer is Hesai Technology, the world’s leading producer of automotive lidar sensors, which are used by robotaxis and other autonomous vehicles to recognize their environment and avoid obstacles. Global ride-share companies are taking notice. WeRide is offering its Middle Eastern robotaxis through a partnership with Uber. Singaporean ride-hailing firm Grab has also made a strategic equity investment in WeRide, and is working with the Chinese firm to offer its Robotaxi GXRs and robobuses in Singapore starting next year. Singaporean transit company ComfortDelGro, meanwhile, is working with Pony AI to explore offering robotaxis, while Lyft is collaborating with Baidu to test its Apollo Go self-driving cars in Europe. By comparison, U.S.-based robotaxi operations are proving to be a lot slower in global expansion. Waymo currently operates in Tokyo and London. Han isn’t surprised that global firms are now embracing Chinese robotaxis. After all, if China offers the best product, why wouldn’t foreign firms want to cooperate with it? “When I was a teenager, we bought electronics from Japan, tools from Germany, and computers from the U.S. It’s very normal. It’s very normal,” Han said. “If WeRide can supply good robotaxi technology and services to Uber, and in turn, Uber and WeRide together bring a very efficient and comfortable taxi service to ordinary people; why shouldn’t we do that?” Clarification, Nov. 6, 2025: This article has been updated to clarify that WeRide will offer both robotaxi and robobus services in Singapore, as well as to note the total number of markets the firm operates in.

Title: HYPE Price Bounces Back After $44M Whale Loss, Binance and Coinbase Support Boost

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. The HYPE price has rebounded sharply, recovering from recent volatility that saw a $44 million whale liquidation earlier this week, which rattled traders. After plunging to around $36, the HYPE price surged over 7% in the past 24 hours, now trading around $40 as bullish sentiment returns. The rally follows its landmark listings on Binance and Coinbase, a move that has sparked renewed confidence in the fast-rising DeFi Layer 1 network. According to on-chain data from Coinglass, funding rates have flipped positive while whale accumulation has increased. Analysts suggest the next HYPE price target could be the $51.15 resistance level if buying pressure continues, with RSI levels slowly trending toward neutrality after oversold readings. The comeback supports Hyperliquid’s resilience despite high-leverage trading risks exposed by the whale’s massive loss. The simultaneous listings of HYPE on Binance and Coinbase have been pivotal for the recovery. Both exchanges introduced major trading pairs like HYPE/USDT and HYPE/BTC, dramatically improving global liquidity and accessibility. This dual-listing marks Hyperliquid’s official transition from a niche derivatives protocol into a mainstream DeFi contender, attracting both institutional and retail traders. Institutional interest has also accelerated following reports that BlackRock and Fidelity are exploring integrations of Hyperliquid’s oracle feeds into upcoming ETF products. Although no official confirmation has been issued, analysts view this as strong validation of Hyperliquid’s underlying technology, which is known for its sub-millisecond transaction speeds and hybrid consensus that combines proof-of-stake with zero-knowledge proofs. Technically, the HYPE price structure is showing early signs of recovery after testing key support around the 200-day EMA, near $38. If momentum holds, analysts expect a push toward $51.15, where the next major resistance sits. Meanwhile, daily active addresses have doubled in the past week, and Hyperliquid’s total value locked (TVL) has climbed over 150% since late October, evidence of sustained ecosystem growth. With funding rates turning positive and exchange inflows rising, traders anticipate that HYPE may regain its prior highs sooner than expected. While the whale’s $44 million loss remains a cautionary tale of leverage gone wrong, the market’s swift rebound suggests confidence in a further HYPE price surge.

Title: Laptop Class on Notice

Amazon was busy this week, sending out pink slips. When it’s all said and done, this massive round of layoffs could hit up to 30,000 employees. This amounts to about 10 percent of the entire corporate workforce. The reduction in force (RIF) is expected to spread across several departments, including Human Resources, Cloud Computing (AWS), and Advertising. Moreover, this is Amazon’s largest RIF since 2022, which eliminated around 27,000 jobs. The massive layoffs have several aims. First, to address the remaining excess of the pandemic hiring spree, when online shopping boomed and Amazon doubled its warehouse network. Second, CEO Andy Jassy says he wants to use Artificial Intelligence to “do more with less.” In other words, these layoffs aren’t merely a reaction to typical economic headwinds – things like high prices or a slower market. Rather, they’re part of a structural shift for big corporations and will have permanent consequences for business, labor, and the economy. For example, massive layoffs like this at a company as enormous as Amazon are a signal that big businesses are tightening their belts. They’re looking for ways to cut expenses without hurting growth. At the same time, as tens of thousands of corporate jobs disappear, consumers will be compelled to reduce their spending. Amazon still has a market capitalization of over $2.3 trillion. These layoffs show that even the mega companies are working to conserve cash and increase efficiency by cutting jobs and replacing workers with AI. Specifically, the current strategy is to achieve growth without hiring. Amazon is not alone in this “do more with less” strategy. In fact, RTX Corporation, an aerospace and defense company, recently noted that its sales rose without adding employees. Goldman Sachs recently sent a memo to staff stating they would “constrain head count growth” to get more efficient with AI. Even Walmart, the nation’s largest private employer, plans to keep its head count flat for the next three years while growing sales. Same story with UPS. The package delivery company announced this week it’s slashing a massive 48,000 jobs – 34,000 from operations and 14,000 from management – in a major effort to cut costs. This huge workforce reduction, which helped UPS beat Q3 profit expectations, is part of a plan to save $3.5 billion in 2025. A big driver for the layoffs is a massive push towards automation and AI to make operations more efficient and less labor dependent. Here’s UPS Chief Financial Officer Brian Dykes on the features and benefits of AI and automation: “You need less variable capacity, fewer leased aircraft, fewer rented vehicles, fewer seasonal workers. That allows you to run a much more efficient network.” JPMorgan Chase’s CFO Jeremy Barnum recently told investors that the bank now has a “very strong bias against having the reflective response” to hire more people. The first thought is no longer ‘hire,’ but ‘automate.’ Earlier in October, white-collar workers from Rivian Automotive, Molson Coors, Booz Allen Hamilton and General Motors received pink slips, or learned that they would come soon. The latest wave of generative AI is proving it can efficiently handle tasks in coding, marketing, customer support, and more. Thus, companies are using AI to staff fewer jobs. While AI is augmenting some roles, its primary corporate function right now is a swift reduction in payroll… One of the key takeaways from Amazon’s layoffs is that the increased use of AI is not just for assisting, but for replacing. The layoffs are a direct result of Amazon’s massive investment in AI, which is now explicitly framed as a job eliminator. In this regard, Amazon CEO Jassy already told employees that the increased use of generative AI will “reduce our total corporate workforce” in the next few years, calling it a “once-in-a-lifetime technological change.” Jassy is putting his money where his mouth is. For the second quarter of 2025, Amazon reported $31.4 billion on capital expenditures, with most of that dedicated to AI and cloud-computing investments. Yesterday (October 30), following market close, Amazon released its third quarter 2025 earnings results. Of note, AWS segment sales increased 20 percent year-over-year to $33 billion. Amazon has also been automating its warehouses using Blue Jay, an impressive system of robotic arms combined with AI systems, which will significantly reduce the need for warehouse laborers. Per the announcement from Amazon: “Visually, Blue Jay operates like a juggler who never drops a ball—only here, the “balls” are tens of thousands of items moving at high speed. It’s also like a conductor leading an orchestra, with every motion in harmony.” Blue Jay also doesn’t call in sick, take lunch breaks and vacation days, or require the company to contribute to an employee 401(k) match. This is but one example of the endless types of automated, worker replacement, AI applications that are being rolled out. Blue collar and white-collar workers alike should be worried. AI is coming for their jobs. But what choice do companies have. Now that the AI cat is out of the bag, its implementation and use are required to compete. Amazon’s value is now fundamentally tied to its AI aptitude. After reporting slower cloud growth than competitors earlier this year, its shares fell 7 percent. But this proved to just be a slight setback. As part of yesterday’s Q3 report, Amazon “added 3.8 gigawatts of power capacity in the past 12 months – more than any other cloud provider.” This sent the after-hours share price skyrocketing by over 13 percent the last we saw. Simply put, AI has moved from a shiny new tool to a serious factor when executives are making headcount decisions. The future is looking lean, and it’s being powered by algorithms! Amazon CEO Jassy’s aggressive push into generative AI means a slimmer corporate workforce is on the horizon. This is an all-encompassing push to replace human tasks with tools like AI agents built on services such as Amazon Bedrock. The impact is already being felt across Amazon’s white-collar departments. In Tech and AWS, the goal is to massively speed up development. AI is being deployed to write code, summarize information, and tackle research. The Bedrock platform itself allows developers to create powerful AI agents that execute complex workflows, essentially automating traditional software roles. In the process, white-collar jobs are eliminated. Human Resources – everyone’s least favorite department – is also a prime target. Layoffs have already hit the department as Amazon seeks to automate administrative work. Generative AI is now handling automated resume screening and shortlisting. AI-powered assistants are taking over common employee queries and training support, cutting the need for human administrators. AI is also taking over Advertising and Content creation. It can instantly write new marketing copy, draft social media posts, and create realistic images for campaigns. This transition proves that AI is rapidly automating the “laptop class” jobs that were once considered safe. When the industrial revolution took root, workers moved from the farm to the factory. When factory jobs were offshored over the last 40 years, the next generation of workers moved to the office. Now, with the burgeoning AI revolution taking over both factory and office jobs, where will these workers go? Is there room for them all on the government dole? Can AI somehow turn unemployment into funemployment? Certainly, as AI automates routine work, it will also create an entirely new set of jobs. Prompt Engineers, for instance, are needed to effectively communicate with AI. There’s also the need for AI Trainers to perfect the models. Perhaps a whole suite of new jobs will soon appear to fulfill the promise of AI. Yet for workers who received pink slips this week, those jobs better come soon.

Title: Anxious about AI job cuts? How white-collar workers can protect themselves - starting now

Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google. What's been a hard 12 months for professionals just got tougher. Fears over the increased use of AI to complete white-collar roles have been compounded by news of layoffs. If you're a mid-level professional, it's tough not to feel anxious about the future of work. In a memo to staff last week, Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, said her company's decision to cut 14,000 corporate roles was aimed at "reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources." Also: AI struggles to cite results properly. Can Perplexity and Getty's new partnership fix that? The news from Amazon is the latest in a series of layoffs by big businesses. Experts believe one significant factor affecting the fast-changing job market is AI. Earlier this year, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warned that AI could be responsible for eliminating half of all entry-level white-collar jobs -- while spiking unemployment to 10-20% -- in the next one to five years. However, while AI is fundamentally altering the nature of white-collar work, professionals can take steps now to reduce their anxiety and prepare for the future. First, said Bev White, executive chair at technology and talent solutions provider Nash Squared, professionals must be honest. Examine your role and make a genuine assessment of how at risk it is from AI, now or in the future. "Think about what transferable skills you have, the core human skills that machines can't replace, and where they can be applied," she told ZDNET, suggesting professionals should research the market, network with contacts, and look for opportunities. "Work hard on how you present yourself and communicate your core strengths, to make yourself highly visible both within your own organization and to others." Also: A minority of businesses have won big with AI. What are they doing right? That approach resonates with James Carney, associate professor at the London Interdisciplinary School, who told ZDNET that we're entering an era where neither technical training nor AI competency will guarantee employability. "Instead, the differentiator will be how well people can use AI thoughtfully and how they apply their own judgment, creativity, and ethics alongside the technology," he said. Education will be a crucial component for professionals who want to future-proof their skills. To that end, Bola Rotibi, chief of enterprise research at CCS Insight, told ZDNET that professionals should retrain, reskill, and rescope their roles. "Think of AI like online banking when it arrived -- you learned the basics because it became the default," she said. "Do the same here by getting comfortable with writing clear prompts, checking outputs, and documenting what you did. That's the new baseline." Also: 4 ways to turn AI into your business advantage Rotibi also encouraged professionals to learn about data ground rules, such as where models fail, and guardrails, including the General Data Protection Regulation, audit trails, and sector policies. Finally, Rotibi suggested a principle for the digital age is that AI training should be a right, not a perk. If employers want to achieve generative AI assistant-level productivity, they should invest in access, time, and clear guardrails. "Workers should feel entitled to ask for and expect accredited courses, safe sandboxes, and clear policies, backed by government and education providers," she said. Amazon's job cuts could be indicative of several larger trends that professionals should be aware of. Rotibi said the cuts represent a shift in the work that the company considers important. AI is speeding things up, so Amazon wants fewer people coordinating and more people building technology, which explains why some office roles are affected. AI is both the tool that reduces some jobs and the magnet that pulls money and new roles into chips, power, and platforms. Also: Adobe might've just solved one of generative AI's biggest legal risks She also stressed that Amazon's cuts are part of a broader IT industry trend, with companies such as Microsoft, Google, IBM, and Salesforce reshaping teams, trimming middle layers, and redirecting spend toward AI platforms and data centers. Other professionals outside IT are also subject to cuts. In its analysis of Amazon's job cuts, "The Wall Street Journal" pointed to UPS reporting last week that it had reduced its management workforce by about 14,000 positions over the past 22 months, days after retailer Target said it would cut 1,800 corporate roles. "White-collar work is being reshaped, not erased," Rotibi noted. "The center of gravity is shifting from coordination to designing, integrating, and governing automated systems with fewer hand-offs and more ownership of outcomes." For professionals who will be anxious about these workplace changes, it's important to recognize that AI isn't the only explanation for the reshaping of white-collar work As Karim Morgan Nehdi, CEO at consulting and training specialist Herrmann International, suggested to ZDNET, the IT layoffs should be seen in the context of broader macroeconomic challenges. "They're about AI arriving at exactly the wrong economic moment," he said, with some of the challenges including over-hiring during the pandemic, weakening economies and tariffs, and continued geopolitical instability. "Companies facing higher costs and investor pressure needed a compelling efficiency narrative, and AI handed them one on a silver platter." However, and most crucially for professional staff, Nehdi also recognized that these layoffs feel different -- and that divergence, whatever the explanation, is due to the potential longer-term impact of AI on professionals. Research by Herrmann, in collaboration with MyPerfectResume, compared ChatGPT's cognitive profile with that of 2.5 million professionals across 800 jobs. The analysis found that ChatGPT's thinking style closely aligned with professions that rely on decision-making under pressure. Also: Is AI making it harder for new college grads to get hired in tech? Professions most cognitively similar to ChatGPT include colonels, cardiologists, and -- crucially for many readers of this article -- IT managers, with each profession sharing an alignment of over 93% with the AI's analytical thinking profile. "Our research shows that AI's cognitive overlap is highest with work we once thought was safe from automation: analytical, structured tasks that have defined many white-collar roles," he said. The conclusion, added Nehdi, is simple: "The 'safe' white-collar jobs just became a lot less safe." For anxious IT professionals concerned about the ongoing influence of AI, that warning sounds a bit like a death knell for white-collar work. However, various experts told ZDNET that it's important to put fears over AI-enabled job losses into context. Also: No ROI in AI yet? Try these six proven tactics for creating real business value First, said Nehdi, emerging technology has uneven superpowers. While AI can write code effectively, it struggles with interpersonal and visionary tasks, such as empathy, creative improvisation, and reading the room, which are capabilities that define human advantage. He said those flaws are good news for white-collar workers: "This means there's no clean 'AI replaces X profession' story. It's messier and more interesting than that. Second, and adding further complexity to the trend alluded to above, Richard Corbridge, CIO at property specialist Segro, told ZDNET that, while the march toward AI offering efficiency in some roles is valid, the pathway toward how this impact will play out is unclear. And while the recent job cuts will raise anxieties among white-collar workers, Corbridge said AI could have a positive impact on workplace roles in the longer term, as younger professionals adapt and adopt the capabilities that will define future success. Also: Are you part of 'the great stay'? Here's what experts say is behind this latest job trend For professionals, therefore, the key is to embrace change. As Nash Squared's White concluded, there is no doubt that AI will impact some white-collar jobs, but that doesn't mean there is nothing you can do about it. "Be a pathfinder, not a victim," she said. "It is on all of us to keep ourselves relevant and current. It's something I always advocate for. Set aside time to invest in yourself. Your future self will thank you for it."

November 05, 2025 20:30 ET | Source: WeRide Inc. WeRide Inc. HONG KONG, Nov. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WeRide (HKEX: 0800.HK, NASDAQ: WRD), a global leader in autonomous driving technology, today announced its successful listing on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (HKEX) under the stock code 0800.HK, becoming the world's first Robotaxi company to be publicly traded on both Hong Kong and US exchanges. With that, WeRide also becomes the world's first Robotaxi and autonomous driving technology company to achieve a dual primary listing on both HKEX and NASDAQ. Under its Hong Kong listing, WeRide issued a total of 88.25 million shares (pre-greenshoe), with 17.65 million shares offered publicly and 70.60 million shares for international placement. The offer price was set at HKD 27.1 per share, raising a total of approximately HKD 2.39 billion (pre-greenshoe). Dr. Tony Han, Founder and CEO of WeRide, had voluntarily committed to a three-year lock-up on October 28, 2025, pledging not to sell any of his shares for the next three years. This demonstrated the founder's and management team's confidence in WeRide's fundamentals and growth, as well as their full commitment to the company's long-term vision and global expansion. "We are deeply grateful to our partners, investors, customers, and every member of the WeRide team. Your trust and dedication have helped turn our vision of autonomous driving into reality. Over the past eight years, WeRide has evolved from technological innovation to commercial operation, becoming the only company worldwide with products holding autonomous driving permits in seven countries, and deployments in over 30 cities across 11 countries. We firmly believe that safe and reliable autonomous driving technology will deliver huge economic and social benefits. Our Hong Kong listing marks a new beginning, and we will continue to lead with technology, drive global commercial deployment, and deliver long-term, sustainable value for our shareholders and society," said Dr. Tony Han, Founder and CEO of WeRide, at the listing ceremony. Founded in 2017, WeRide was listed on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange on October 25, 2024, becoming the world's first publicly listed Robotaxi and universal autonomous driving technology company. The HKEX listing broadens its investor base and access to capital markets, enabling deeper investment in technology R&D and accelerating the global deployment of its autonomous vehicle fleet. Powered by its proprietary WeRide One universal autonomous driving technology platform, WeRide offers Level 2 to Level 4 (L4) products and services across smart mobility, smart logistics, and smart sanitation, including the Robotaxi, Robobus, Robosweeper, Robovan and ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems). With WeRide GENESIS, its self-developed, closed-loop simulation engine, WeRide has also significantly lowered road testing costs and safety risks, accelerating product iteration efficiency, market expansion speed, and commercial deployment scale. Currently, WeRide is the only technology company in the world with products holding autonomous driving permits in seven countries – China, the UAE, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, France, Belgium, and the US. The company operates a fleet of more than 1,500 L4 vehicles, including over 700 Robotaxis. Partnering with Uber in Abu Dhabi, WeRide operates the largest commercial Robotaxi fleet outside of China and the US. Looking ahead, WeRide plans to deploy tens of thousands of Robotaxis by 2030. On industry collaboration, WeRide continues to attract leading global investors and ecosystem partners, building a strategic network with companies such as NVIDIA, Bosch, Uber, Grab, and Renault-Nissan. It is also the only autonomous driving company to receive investment commitments from ride-hailing giants Uber and Grab, highlighting its strategic position and leading role in the industry. WeRide has achieved multiple key milestones in the global commercial deployment of L4 autonomous vehicles. In China, fully driverless WeRide Robotaxis are now commercially operating in Guangzhou and Beijing, with 24-hour autonomous services extended to major transport hubs such as airports and train stations. In core markets such as the Middle East and Singapore, WeRide maintains a first-mover advantage of at least 1.5 years over its competitors. In European countries such as France, Switzerland, and Belgium, WeRide is the only autonomous driving company to have commercially deployed an L4 vehicle fleet. In the ADAS sector, WeRide and Bosch’s jointly developed one-stage end-to-end assisted driving solution has successfully reached SOP and is set to enter mass production in 2025. These developments demonstrate the global adaptability and competitiveness of WeRide’s technology and business model across various regions. With strong technology competence and a global commercial footprint, WeRide has been recognized internationally, including twice on Fortune's Change the World list – the only autonomous driving company to date – and twice on Fortune's Global Future 50, ranking 16th this year, the highest among Chinese companies. Following its dual primary listing on HKEX and NASDAQ, WeRide remains committed to its mission of transforming urban living with autonomous driving. The company will continue to advance autonomous driving technology, expand global commercial operations, and work with partners worldwide to build a safer, more efficient, comfortable, and sustainable smart mobility ecosystem. About WeRideWeRide is a global leader and a first mover in the autonomous driving industry, as well as the first publicly traded Robotaxi company. Our autonomous vehicles have been tested or operated in over 30 cities across 11 countries. We are also the first and only technology company whose products have received autonomous driving permits in seven markets: China, the UAE, Singapore, France, Saudi Arabia, Belgium, and the US. Empowered by the smart, versatile, cost-effective, and highly adaptable WeRide One platform, WeRide provides autonomous driving products and services from L2 to L4, addressing transportation needs in the mobility, logistics, and sanitation industries.

Title: Letters to the Editor, November 6th: On housing, Ivan Yates, divisive politics, and wearing the poppy
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/letters/2025/11/06/letters-to-the-editor-november-6th-on-housing-ivan-yates-and-wearing-the-poppy/
Time Published: 2025-11-06T00:01:00Z
Full Content:
Sir, – The report published by the Department of Finance on the housing crisis estimates it will continue for 15 years (“Ireland’s housing crisis to last another 15 years, Department of Finance predicts”, Business, November 4th). This report is not an economic diagnosis. It is an electoral death certificate. My children are still in secondary school but if they read this report they should probably prepare to emigrate. I voted for this Government and I would vote for it again – it is full of talented people with a genuine passion for the welfare of this country. But it is throwing its hands up and acting at times like a bystander on the issue of housing. No prosperous developed country has had a 30-year housing “crisis” and the word is as weary as the apologies and the excuses. No one is saying the solutions are easy but 60 years ago Seán Lemass and Ken Whitaker faced far greater challenges and rose to the occasion with energy. I’m no economist but it seems the only way out of a supply-side housing crisis in a small open economy is to incentivise builders and developers to come into the Irish market from all directions as a matter of urgency. That means more generous tax breaks and plenty of them. The left will carp about the Galway tent but if the Department of Finance is correct in its projections we’re not even at the races. – Yours, etc, MICHAEL DEASY, Bandon, Co Cork. Sir, – The front page of The Irish Times reports the Department of Finance predicts the housing crisis in Ireland is likely to persist for at least another 15 years. Less a crisis so, and more an acknowledgment of the impotence of Government to address this country’s most pressing need. – Yours, etc, TOMAS MCBRIDE, Letterkenny, Donegal. Sir, – I write in relation to the controversy surrounding my former Newstalk colleague, Ivan Yates. As the person who hired him as breakfast presenter in 2010, I have a long-standing appreciation for his qualities as a broadcaster. It is being suggested that his work coaching Fianna Fáil politicians has compromised his ability to comment on politics. I would argue that this conflates two distinct roles. In my judgment, based on years of observing him, Ivan is more than capable of providing professional, paid coaching to a politician while simultaneously representing his own robust and well-known views on air about that same politician or their party. His personal political stance on many issues have never been a secret; it is the bedrock of his pugnacious broadcasting style. This is not to dismiss the core of the issue. The appearance of bias is real, and declaring this coaching arrangement would have been the correct and transparent course of action. He made a serious error in judgment on this point. However, the greater loss would be to our public discourse if we were to exclude a voice like his. He is a premier league polemicist. He provokes, challenges and irritates in equal measure, but he always engages. He forces listeners to think, often by stating his case in the most uncompromising terms. In an era of increasingly sanitised media, this quality is rare and valuable. The wrong he did by not declaring a conflict was a serious one. However, the loss of his insightful, if sometimes infuriating, commentary from the national conversation would be a far more significant deprivation. We should encourage transparency and declaration, not the silencing of challenging voices. The former corrects the mistake; the latter punishes the audience. – Yours, etc, FRANK CRONIN, Sandycove, Co Dublin. Sir, – Like your correspondent Mark Paul, I never wore a poppy here in the UK, and was questioned a lot as to why (“British media sees red over Irish poppy refuseniks”, UK, November 4th). It was on a visit home that I noticed a Princess Mary tin on the family hall table. These were given to soldiers in the first World War, and contained tobacco or chocolate. I then realised that a member of my family took part in that war. I checked online and discovered there is a green poppy lapel pin to commemorate Irish men who fought in that war. At this time of year, if I’m invited to a formal event here in the UK, I might wear that pin. The tables are turned as I’m asked what it stands for, and it is then that people realise Irish men also fought in the trenches. – Yours, etc, JOHN BERGIN, Oxton, Wirral, UK. Sir, – On the matter of the British media’s (now annual) reaction to some Irish footballer’s choice not to wear the poppy, the outrage in some media outlets is indeed tired and predictable. Your correspondent Mark Paul’s piece noted as such. However, I would also note that Irish media’s (now annual) reaction to the reaction is equally tired and predictable. (Paul’s piece being this year’s iteration for The Irish Times.) Every year the Brits are outraged by the lack of poppies, and the Irish are outraged by the outrage. Perhaps we could all just not? – Yours, etc, EVAN BYRNE, London, UK. Sir, – Ireland ranks high in the global wealth of nations, according to the OECD, but like many of these wealthy nations, it also ranks high in inequality. Recent data shows wealthy nations are responsible for more than 80 per cent of global emissions against less than 1 per cent of emissions attributed to the poorest nations. Yet it is these poorest of nations that increasingly bear the brunt of the impact of climate change. In these regions the severe impacts of climate change, such as drought, extreme weather events, and soil erosion, have led to conflict, famine and the breakdown of social cohesion. This will continue to be a key driver of mass migration unless there is a global pivot in economic orthodoxy. The recent comments by Simon Harris and other politicians on immigration, mirror those of centre right and right-wing politicians in many western nations, and smack of entitlement. They do nothing to reflect the impact of their policies in driving wealth inequality in their own nations and the erosion of social infrastructure necessary to provide a robust safety net for their own citizens, and also to deal with the inward migration from poorer regions of the world. It is understandable there is frustration and anger in neglected parts of this country while the Government pushes a policy of corporate welfare. These areas also appear to be taking a disproportionate load of caring for asylum seekers when compared with more affluent areas, and this adds to frustration. The blaming of immigrants is an easy yet cynical tool of political deflection from the fact that successive centre-right governments have failed in to provide adequate housing, health and public transport for a huge cohort of workers and communities in this country. That our politicians don’t have the integrity to accept that their acquiescence to market driven economics is a significant factor in driving this social inequality smacks of arrogance and ignorance. With Cop30 kicking off in Brazil we are reminded that this economic model is failing globally to address the existential threat to humanity. Climate change will continue to drive global migration and unless there is a pivot to an economic model that pushes sustainability with a greater social dividend, we risk the ongoing breakdown of social cohesion through the rise of divisive politics. – Yours, etc, BARRY WALSH, Blackrock, Cork. Sir, – I was disgusted when I heard on Monday that DJ Carey had been sentenced to only 5½ years in prison for his “reprehensible fraud” in the words of Judge Martin Nolan, who sentenced him. Fraud is fraud but to do it in the manner that DJ Carey carried it out by pretending he had cancer to dupe money out of friends and acquaintances is the lowest of the low. I am receiving treatment for prostate cancer so this deception has an extra resonance for me. He took advantage of people’s good nature for his own selfish motives. – Yours, etc, TOMMY RODDY, Ballybane, Co Galway. Sir, – Before the general election of late November 2024, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael changed tack and announced they backed the Occupied Territories Bill, which they had obstructed for years. Opinion polls have consistently shown impressive support for the Bill. However, it is almost 12 months since that election and the Occupied Territories Bill is still not enacted. Moreover, there is no obvious sense of urgency around it. In the context of developments regarding the West Bank – with Israeli parliamentarians advocating full annexation and illegal settlements expanding – this is a sanction that should have been implemented promptly. Is the Government serious about this measure? If so, when will it happen? – Yours, etc, FINTAN LANE, Lucan, Co Dublin. Sir, – Ireland’s focus on increasing housing supply risks overlooking an equally critical priority – long-term energy security. In a volatile Europe, our dependence on imported fuels leaves the country acutely vulnerable. A disruption in supply would quickly expose how fragile that dependence is; new homes are of little use without reliable power to heat or light them. To safeguard our future, we should accelerate investment in large-scale renewable generation and in additional pumped-storage hydroelectric plants, such as Turlough Hill, to store surplus wind energy. Ireland has both the natural resources and the engineering capability to achieve near energy self-sufficiency, yet progress remains slow and piecemeal. Energy underpins every aspect of modern life. Without a secure and sustainable supply, economic growth and social stability alike are at risk. – Yours, etc, KEVIN GIBBONS, Leixlip, Co Kildare. Sir, – I wonder if anyone, during all the hubbub of the presidential election over the past few weeks, spared a thought for the many children who missed a day of their education as their school was used as a polling station. As a retired primary schoolteacher, I always felt my profession was diminished by the closing of my school for this reason. What other profession would allow their place of work to be shut down for use as a polling station? Apart from missing a school day, many children in DEIS schools also missed out on breakfast and a hot lunch. Why can’t we have elections on Saturdays or Sundays, like the majority of EU member states? – Yours, etc, EVA O’CARROLL, Dublin 14. Sir, – The various political parties that supported Catherine Connolly’s campaign for the presidency can claim their share of the credit for its success. Sinn Féin, as the largest party, may even claim their support turned out to be the game-changer promised by their leader Mary Lou McDonald. It has to be said, however, that the unique selling point in this election was Ms Connolly herself. Many of the 15,000 volunteers who flocked to the Galway woman’s campaign, like myself, were not members of any political party. We were ordinary members of the public attracted by the values the candidate stood for. One unique aspect of the campaign was Ms Connolly’s insistence on giving parity to both Irish and English in all her election literature. This was never done by any political party or individual in the history of the State. Indeed the prominence given to Irish, and its resonance with young people, appears to have taken many commentators by surprise. The various political parties can claim whatever credit they like but the key to this successful campaign was Ms Connolly herself. You might be able to buy support from professional media advisers but you can’t buy the support of volunteers, who were attracted to the authenticity they saw in Ms Connolly. She went from rank outsider in July to being the pident elected with the greatest number and percentage of votes in the history of the State. Comhghairdeas léi. – Yours, etc, JOHN GLENNON, Hollywood, Co Wicklow. Sir, – When I was a child my dad would drive our family of five, packed into a Ford car, to a hotel in Bettystown, Co Meath, for a week’s holiday. Every evening the waiter would ask if we would like either chicken and ham (cold), salmon (cold) or a fry! Simple times, simple fare! – Yours, etc, LAURA O’MARA, Stillorgan, Co Dublin. Sir, – With regard to Irish being spoken in the Áras, I recently overheard two francophone kids on the bus in Brussels repeating Irish phrases from Duolingo. When asked why they were learning Irish, they replied: “We need a secret language so our teachers don’t understand us!” If Irish is alive in the polyglot heart of Europe, why not in the heart of Dublin? – Yours, etc, COLM CARROLL, Bruxelles, Belgium. Sir, – It sounds like the despairing guard in Rearcross, Co Tipperary writing of his woe in Beckettian style could have done with the presence of a colleague to ease his loneliness (“‘This is a godforsaken place’: A despairing letter from a garda stationed in Tipperary in 1940”, An Irishman’s Diary, November 4th). He was, in a sense, waiting for garda. – Yours, etc, BRIAN AHERN, Clonsilla, Dublin 15. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Pinterest stock plunged 20% after reporting weak Q3 2025 earnings and issuing a disappointing holiday outlook. The social media giant’s adjusted EPS missed estimates, while North American ad revenue slowed sharply, erasing its 2025 gains. Despite hitting a record 498 million monthly users, investor focus shifted to declining monetization and margins. Adding pressure, Meta’s $70–72 billion AI spending plan spooked markets over profitability risks. Pinterest closed below $31, its lowest level this year, as ad slowdown fears hit social media stocks broadly.

Social sentiment crashes while on-chain data stays strong. BTC’s Social Sentiment hit its third most bearish reading in six months, signaling rising fear despite steady fundamentals. Not necessarily. Experts say the 20% dip could be a buying opportunity. Bitcoin’s [BTC] mood turned darker than its data. Social Sentiment just hit its third most bearish reading in six months, at a moment when the fundamentals aren’t actually breaking. Instead, BTC remained near historic relative lows against Apple [AAPL] and NVIDIA [NVDA], and the on-chain base case still looks firm. It feels like sentiment pricing in stress that the network itself isn’t showing yet. Crypto Analyst Nic Puckrin, Co-Founder of The Coin Bureau, told AMBCrypto, “Bitcoin under $100,000 tends to fill crypto investors with an almost biblical level of dread. It’s worth remembering that despite the recent sell-off, BTC is currently only around 20% below its all-time high. This is crypto, not the bond market, so a 20% drop is often just a buying signal.” Source: Santiment Bitcoin’s drop coincided with one of the most bearish comment ratios in six months, yet crowd behavior revealed a twist. Santiment data showed the highest level of Negative Words in eight months, even as “buy” mentions stayed elevated. Similar setups, like in late October, preceded short-term recoveries. Source: Santiment The latest data showed extreme negativity paired with active buy mentions. BTC may be near another local sentiment-driven inflection point. Source: X The crypto market’s $1 trillion drawdown since January was a massive leverage reset. Open interest collapsed over 40% after peaking near record highs, as hundreds of thousands of traders were liquidated daily. But adoption never slowed. User counts jumped to 560 million, stablecoins now handle 30% of transactions, and institutional participation via ETFs and reserves keeps expanding. While prices fell from $3.66 trillion peak to $2.65 trillion, fundamentals strengthened. The market is rebuilding from forced liquidation. That disconnect between fear and fundamentals is also showing up beyond crypto charts, too. Source: X BTC/NVIDIA touched the bottom of its long-term channel, a level that has triggered reversals where Bitcoin went on to outperform NVIDIA’s stock. Similarly, BTC/APPLE stayed inside a clean multi-year structure, cooling off after its July 2025 peak. Source: X Together, this could mean a rotation of capital back into BTC as tech momentum cools. This is a setup that’s repeatedly meant the start of new strength cycles for Bitcoin. About BTC’s current state, Puckrin said, “While I don’t believe this sell-off marks the end of Bitcoin’s bull market, this point is drawing nearer, and that means the swings are getting wilder.” Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

The report offers a partial glimpse into the job market, which has been generally weakening and raising broader concerns about economic growth. The services sector, which is the largest part of the US economy, expanded in October more than Wall Street expected, according to the Institute for Supply Management. The report shows that while overall business activity grew, employment was still contracting.

Title: Why are U.S. layoffs rising even as corporate profits surge?
URL: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jobless-boom-ai-economy-labor-market-corporate-profits-layoffs/
Time Published: 2025-11-05T21:22:22Z

Watch CBS News Updated on: November 6, 2025 / 8:13 AM EST / CBS News As U.S. corporate profits rise and the stock market hits new highs, investors are reaping the rewards. Yet beneath the surge, companies have cut nearly 1 million jobs this year — the most since 2020, when the pandemic slammed the economy. The disconnect between soaring company earnings and mounting layoffs amounts to what Chen Zhao, chief global strategist at investment research firm Alpine Macro, calls a "jobless boom." Typically, layoffs accelerate when companies are struggling with declining profitability and need to pare costs. "This is something that is completely different from a historical playbook," Zhao told CBS News. "It's kind of odd to see Amazon laying off 30,000 people even though the profit is doing really, really well." At the heart of the issue, Zhao said, is the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence, which is boosting business productivity across multiple industries and the economy at large, while also suppressing demand for workers. Although that trend has initially taken root in the technology sector, it is spreading to other industries as businesses adopt AI as a way to boost productivity and lower costs, he noted. "You have a labor demand that basically has come down to probably 0% in terms of growth, maybe even a mild contraction, even though the economy is doing fine — profits are doing great," he said. "We've never seen anything like that." For much of 2025, the job market was described by economists as "no hire, no fire," meaning an environment where workers could count on job security even as hiring around the U.S. cooled. But conditions have changed, and the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate in both September and October, citing increasing risks to employment growth and with Fed Chair Jerome Powell noting that policymakers are closely watching layoff announcements by big employers. The Department of Labor's monthly employment report has been on hold since the government shutdown began on Oct. 1, which delayed September's labor market data and is likely to also postpone October's report. Still, economists are turning to other employment measures to assess the health of the labor market, such as data from payroll processor ADP. By those metrics, job growth looks muted. ADP, which only tracks private-sector hiring, said Wednesday that private employers added 42,000 workers in October, a modest rebound after two months of subpar hiring. "Employment is stagnating in the fall, according to data available during the shutdown," Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, said in an email. "While private employment grew in October, overall employment was likely about flat in the month after accounting for federal layoffs, which aren't measured by ADP." The nation's unemployment rate has remained relatively low despite the shifting tides of slower hiring and more layoffs, experts have noted. The jobless rate stood at 4.3% in August, according to the most recent data available. Unemployment has remained in check because the nation's labor pool is shrinking due to the retiring baby boom generation and lower immigration stemming from the Trump administration's tighter policies, Zhao said. "You basically have a labor demand that is going nowhere, and labor supply going nowhere, too," he said. "So that creates a very odd equilibrium." Not everyone thinks AI is driving the recent bout of layoffs. Instead, the job cuts are more likely due to businesses recalibrating their needs after the pandemic, when many employers expanded and may have overhired, said Art Papas, the CEO of Bullhorn, a software company that works with recruitment and temporary agencies. Companies feel more emboldened to cut workers now because it's easier to find new talent than during the pandemic, when the labor market was tighter, he said. Papas also believes businesses that point to AI as a reason for layoffs are using it more as a buzzword. "These companies announce layoffs and their stock goes up — it's a perverse incentive to announce layoffs," he noted. But the change in the labor market is very real, with companies cutting back on hiring for entry-level jobs, Papas said. "People point to AI, and say, 'That's because AI is replacing entry-level jobs,'" he said. "I say, 'No, that's a sign companies aren't hiring, because companies do most of the hiring at the entry level'." Edited by Alain Sherter © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Title: #2284 Why is Morning Brew’s founder selling “AI Transformation”?

Time Published: 2025-11-05T21:08:06Z

Coming into this interview I wasn’t even sure what “AI Transformation” was, let alone why so many companies pay for it. Here’s the deal: Tenex, the company founded by Alex Lieberman & Arman Hezarkhani, goes into companies hunting for ways to save or making them money using AI. Once they find that, it becomes a no brainer for companies to hire them to build it. But Tenex does more than AI Transformation. They also run a dev shop where their developers use AI to build super fast for clients. The podcast is in all major apps, just search for Mixergy.You can also use our RSS feed. Alex Lieberman and Arman Hezarkhani are the co-founders of Tenex, a company blending high-performance engineering with AI transformation consulting. Their model aligns incentives around output rather than time, helping enterprises and startups build software faster and integrate AI across people, processes, and tools. Together, they’re building what they call the “McKinsey for AI”—a hybrid of dev shop, consultancy, and innovation lab helping companies thrive in the post-AI era. Andrew Warner: Hey there, freedom Fighters. My name is Andrew Warner and this is a new series for me. It’s called The Next New Thing. Here’s what’s up in this interview, then an intro. Then we’ll get right to it. What is AI transformation? Alex: We don’t think most companies are going to Arman: cross the chasm from pre AI to post ai, and we believe we can be the household name to do that. Andrew Warner: Gimme an example of a project that you took on and what you were able to do that wasn’t possible. Before Arman: STEP exports, they were looking for a dev shop to build them a mobile app. Traditionally, you would need a full design team, product managers, engineers, and a ton of money using AI tools. When we hear, oh, I have a request for a feature, we go over there and we prototype it and we hand it over to the client. We say, is this how you want it to behave? Now we can go and we can build production grade code incredibly quickly. Andrew Warner: At some point you’ve run outta ways to save people money. This doesn’t seem like a sustainable business. Arman: Does a BizOps person ever run out of work to do in a company or does McKinsey ever run out of work to do with business? I’m a Andrew Warner: little skeptical. Alex Lieberman and Armand has ar Connie run 10 x, which does outsource dev work and helps companies use ai. Intro: The next new thing, Andrew Warner: so I got the two co-founders of 10 X here in front of me, and the thing that I wanna understand is what is AI transformation? Because I see so many agencies building up this AI transformation practice. And you both have been doing phenomenally with it. In fact, you actually are doing it as part of your business. Arman: So most of the revenue comes from engineering, but our fastest growing part of the business is AI transformation. It, it’s very easy to implement AI as a person. In your lead, you can basically tell somebody, Hey, Andrew, instead of using Google, start using this thing called chat, GBT. You use it once and then you’re like, holy crap, this is really great. And then you just very simply shift your behavior. It’s literally one step. But to do that on a business, we call that like multiplayer ai. That’s really, really tough. That takes studying, that takes change management, that takes tool building, that takes training. It takes the change of people, process and technology and McKinsey words. Um, and that’s where we come in. Alex: And one thing that you may find interesting is why we’re doing like engineering as a service as like a big part of our business, um, versus just AI transformation. Armand and I met. Five years ago, I had invested in his first business and we were catching up eight months ago at this point. And he basically had shared with me that he had to pivot his previous company and when he pivoted it, he had to lay off most of his engineering team and he just had himself and he had one product designer who studied Compsci in college but hadn’t had hands on keyboard in a long time. And yet their output of production ready software, five Xed. And when I asked why or how, he basically said how he didn’t have a choice but to basically re scaffold the entire product and engineering process from how PRDs are written to how code is structured. Everything was redone and. When I heard him say this, that for me, even though I’ve experienced like two or three acts, whatever the improvement is of cha bt, that was truly orders of magnitude more leverage that I had seen. And one of the things I’ve realized working around engineers now is engineers are living in the future. Like they are seeing the greatest leverage of AI relative to all areas of knowledge work. And so as we were building 10 x, you know, we had that in mind, which is like you can have this incredible leverage, uh, that engineers are experiencing. At the same time you have AI consultancies or like, you know, the mbbs of the world that are doing these gen AI projects. And there’s all these stats either about gen AI projects just like not working, right? There’s like the, the MIT study that came out around 95% of them don’t work. But also a lot of this work is project based. It’s one time revenue. And for us what was exciting was. How do we actually control the AI internally where we have engineers who are leveraging it to be far more productive than engineers at other companies? How do we use that to sign 12 month contracts? Right? That is highly retentive, highly recurring, and we use that as the Trojan Horse to do transformation work after having that line of business. Jesse Pujji: What’s a typical scope Arman: from the engineering perspective? It’s basically like, one of the core beliefs is that the demand for software engineering is infinite. Uh, it’s, it’s completely as price will go down, the, the, the demand will increase. And so the scope is pretty vast right now. Like we’re building one of our clients, we built them a mobile app that hit 20th in the app store for another one of our clients. We built a, um, an AI agent that helps the front desk at offices around the United States at, at, um. Healthcare offices, like doctor’s offices around the us Jesse Pujji: But is it fair to say right now, I guess it’s, it’s like a, there’s a lot of companies out there that will do engineering. Hey, you need an app built, you need a website, you know, whatever. We’ll do that for you. But you guys have now, are now using probably cursor plus your own agents that handle a lot of, you know, pieces of building those building blocks together. And I know Alex loves Legos. So you’ve got your own Legos that are proprietary to you guys. Legos that allow you to then produce bigger, faster, smarter, that same scope, Alex: the engineering as a service side of the business. Just think of it as like a high quality AI powered dev shop. Jesse Pujji: Mm-hmm. Alex: And I actually love the idea of that line of business because dev shops have such an unsexy perception. Mm-hmm. We don’t charge hourly. Like we have a fundamental belief that service businesses are gonna move away from hourly work. Yeah. And we think it’s starting with engineering. So our clients pay us based on output and our engineers are paid on output as well. And the reason that is so valuable. We can hire truly the best engineers I’ve ever worked with because, just as an example, like our best engineer will make a million bucks in cash next year. Jesse Pujji: Yep. Alex: And and and it’s not like stock in a startup, it’s cash, Jesse Pujji: cash money. Yeah, Alex: exactly. And Jesse Pujji: so, like Alex, you and I talked a lot about the Red Ventures business. They’re all about alignment. And Andrew came with me to see Rick, uh, the other day about a year ago. And one of his favorite quotes is, show me how someone gets paid and I’ll show you how they behave. And this feels like a really cool way to align the value based pricing orientation across, across the board. Alex: Exactly. And what that allows us to do that, as you were alluding to, like the big vision is it not only allows us to do great work on the service side of the business, whether that’s engineering or transformation work, but as we think about building IP internally, we truly have the best technical talent in the world to do it because like we, we are now as competitive in terms of pay and environment as a big tech company. Jesse Pujji: Got it. Yeah, that makes sense. Alright. What’s the big vision? Arman: Was looking, or we were looking at the, the big hyperscalers and seeing that they’re spending billions and billions and billions of dollars building data centers to build something that is being commoditized, um, where most of the values accruing to the application layer. And so if you look at OpenAI, if you look at anthropic, so many of their releases now that are getting eyeballs are apps that they released and application layer tools that they release. Jesse Pujji: Hmm. Arman: For the first time, like we were all really excited about GPT-3 0.5. And so when they released 4, 4 0 4 0.5, we were all, that was like an Apple release. Right? Right. But when five was released, no one like this was like a, an after crickets. Yeah. Alex: Absolute crickets. Arman: But what that does is it opens up an opportunity in the application layer where for zero cost, you can compete with these hyperscalers. All you need is brilliant people in a ring. Jesse Pujji: Hmm. Arman: And so. In, when I was in like 10th grade, I read this book by Walter Isaacson called The Innovators. Basically the story of like the people who like invented the first computer and the first programming language all the way to like modern internet ai, mobile devices. Basically, it, it, it, it becomes this, this study of how innovation happens, and it’s a very simple equation. You put very smart people in a room. You give them freedom, but you also put freedom in the form of like financial freedom or somehow mm-hmm. You give them fuel, but then you also give them a direction and you give them some form of commercial pressure, right? In the form of, um, whether that is investment, you have to get a return or I’m, I’m, I’m, uh, bell Telephone Company and, and Bell Labs is a research institution, but they have to output something for the company. Similarly, we think that if we can build a team of geniuses and we can give them freedom and direction, then we can compete with these hyperscalers. The question is how do you do that? How do you build a team of geniuses? This is how, um, we’re doing it starting with the world’s best dev shop, then the world’s best consultancy. And as we’re doing this, we’re building ip. And by the way, as we do that, we have a distribution advantage, not only from Alex, but also from the customers that we built trust with and we’re actually already working with. And we think that, that the tam for this business is basically the GDP of the entire world. Every single business need in the world sure needs it in those Alex: 1 1, 1 other way I would just frame it is what would it look like if McKinsey Bayner, BCG was created today? Jesse Pujji: Right? So, but is that, is that the end game? Do you wanna be, become the McKinsey of AI or the Accenture even? Alex: Our view is there’s this massive technology innovation that’s happening. We don’t think most companies are going to be resourced to cross the chasm from pre AI to post ai. And we believe we can be the household name to do that, either through services or through product. Andrew Warner: Here’s what I wanna understand. Let’s stick with the dev part for a bit and then we’ll come back to the AI transformation. Gimme an example of a project that you took on and what you were able to do and what your developers were able to do that wasn’t possible before. Okay. Arman: Yeah. So as an example, use step exports. Okay. They’re a social media company. Um, and the reason why I use them is because they were traditionally going with a, they were looking for a dev shop to build them a mobile app that is basically like their vision for it is like HQ trivia for sports fans. Okay. Traditionally, for a product like this, you would need a full design team, a full team of product managers, a team of engineers, um, and you would charge a ton of money and it would take, you would basically scope out the entire project and then six months later you’d come back with a product and then it would either work or wouldn’t. Um, the way that we work is. We hear, oh, I have a request for a feature. We go over there, we prototype it, and we hand it over to the client. We say, is this how we want it to behave? And then we have a brand book from them. And so we know what the UI generally should look like. We know what a button looks like, we know what an input looks like. And now that we know what the behavior looks like, because we’re able to, to iterate on it, um, in a vibe coding platform, now we can go and we can build production grade, uh, code incredibly quickly. The act of writing code is no longer the barrier. So no one on our team actually types letters into an id. If I walk through a WeWork and I see someone typing letters in IID they’re working in like 1990, right? Yeah. So we’re using, we’re pushing modern AI tools to the absolute limit so that we are scoping work down until the, the most atomic level, and then we’re getting it done and we’re architecting it such that we’re really treating these AI agents. What does Andrew Warner: it mean to scope, to scope down to the atomic level? Arman: So let’s say you wanna build Slack, right? Andrew Warner: Yep. Arman: It’s a gigantic platform. And typically what you would do is you would manage, you’d, you’d have a product manager who would break that down into, uh, sprints, and then they would break those down into tickets, right? Yep. And then at, at, to some extent, the engineer would have quite a bit of freedom around that ticket. The tickets are quite broad. We go, we drill, our engineers drill all the way down until they’re micro tasks. And this is really what, this is the difference between an AI engineer and a traditional software engineer. An AI engineer needs to think like an architect. They have to think as if they’re, uh, they’re delegating all of their work to other engineers. And when they’re delegating their work, how do they do that? Right? And not only are they delegating their work to engineers, they’re very special engineers. These AI agents, they’re incredibly high iq, but they make really stupid mistakes that as you work with them regularly, you can understand what they are. And when you work with these, you get really good at managing them and understanding them. Most of our engineers have multiple different terminals open each with a different coding agent, and they’re just, they’re trucking on all of them. So they’re really acting as managers Of these different agents, are Jesse Pujji: they, are they using voice or are they using, are they, are they typing? Arman: Frankly, I think that the voice thing’s overblown. I think that when you work in an office, it’s like unrealistic to talk out loud. I think that the voice thing is like useful if you’re an executive driving your Tesla to and from work and you wanna, and you wanna speak to, to an ai. Jesse Pujji: So you don’t think the whole world’s gonna start talking to their computers and, and voice pilled? Arman: I, I think they might, but like in our office, for example, it’s impractical and I don’t know how that works in, in a modern office setting. I Jesse Pujji: think I understand when you’re scoping this piece of work, you launch a mobile app for someone, you can be, I’m, I’m making this up, you can be cheaper to them than they would’ve paid otherwise because of all this stuff you guys have done and it’s probably higher margin business for you guys. Alex: Yeah. Uh, the way I basically think about it is it’s, it’s, um, Jesse Pujji: because you have like a 10% engineer, 11% engineering team, but it’s really only one human being and 10. Correct. 10 pieces of Alex: it’s, it’s basically if, if traditional dev orgs or dev shops are labor arbitrage, we’re intelligence arbitraging. Jesse Pujji: I mean, it’s interesting, the AI transformation aspect of that is that just sizzle really. And then the real thing is actually just go get media engineering projects and, and focus on those. Like for example, today, I would argue with you and Alex, this is, Alex is my friend, so we’re gonna keep this as informal as possible. Like I would tell you guys today, I obviously believe that AI transformation will be a hundreds of billions of dollars industry. But today Alex: Yep. Jesse Pujji: Engineering development is actually a multi-hundred billion and AI transformation is like a $10 billion industry. Alex: Yeah. Well, I mean, uh, candidly this is something we talk about all of the time, uh, is what should that balance look like? Because the engineering as a service business one, there are, there’s really no one else doing it in the way we’re doing it right now. And also it is such good revenue, like it is just so retentive, it’s latched onto the core technology of a company. Totally. Whereas to your point, like AI transformation oftentimes is project based. It’s harder to make recurring, Jesse Pujji: well, not to mention like problem versus solution, right? I mean, one thing you guys have to be careful of, there’s this, there’s this meme that was going around that was like, CEOs are like, we want ai. Yep. You must’ve shared it, Alex. Like, Alex: when, when do we want it? We want it now. Jesse Pujji: What, what do we want it for? We have no idea. Like, yeah. And that’s, there’s actually a lot of risk and wasted time and energy in terms of firm building. If you guys are building a firm off of this fickle revenue where nobody actually has a problem, they’re just looking for a solution and as opposed to finding problems, that’s a much, much more interesting place to be playing in and solving the problem better and cheaper and faster than anybody else can solve it. ’cause here’s, here’s another, I’ll throw crazy idea as you, uh, you, Alex, with your platform when Red Ventures bought bank rate. If it was a publicly traded company, they paid $1.3 billion for it. They paid 10 times ebitda, roughly, according to their math. Rick knew he had done the math, he had seen all the levers. He knew that within a year of closing it, I mean, his projections were that his effective EBITDA would’ve been five times EBITDA because he knew exactly how he was gonna double the EBITDA of the business. And he came in three months ahead of time. He got it done in nine months, right? Alex: Yep. Jesse Pujji: You guys, if, if what you’re saying is real and you get really good at it, you could go buy these dev shops and, and essentially you could increase, they already have books of business, by the way, which is, which is makes your life so much easier than Alex tweeting all the time. And you go buy a $10 million revenue business with all the clients and everything already, and you guys can effectively rip out 70% of their costs, it sounds like, and deliver a better product. And now that’s like the math there is actually more compelling. ’cause you could probably buy ’em at six times EBITDA effectively, but then you’re actually buying ’em at three. Like anytime you have a real capability, that thesis is like very, very powerful. Alex: Yeah. Yeah. You’re basically just, you’re buying distribution and you know, you can basically arb the product, like the, the customer experience, Jesse Pujji: not, not to mention, dude, you can finance the whole thing with debt. Like, if you buy something at six times, you can borrow half that cost. But if you’re effectively, because you know, you can double their ebitda, you effectively have no equity out. I mean, that’s how, like, there’s a company in St. Louis, I found the other day that I got all excited about, you’ve never heard of it? It’s called Proficient. Alex: No, Jesse Pujji: it just sold for $3 billion. I mean, it’s, it’s been around 20 years, but it’s literally like a rollup of one of these, like Salesforce, Microsoft Alex: implementation Jesse Pujji: companies, implementation companies. And it just, every year it would like pick a different part of the, the, you know, the, I think I call it the function vertical box, like HR for pharma, marketing for, and it just, but did a bunch of deals and like exited for $3 billion. Um, Arman: so Jesse, let me ask you this. We love all our children equally, whether you’re an engineering client or a transformation client, you’re, you’re a 10 x client, you’re part of the club, and let’s say we can drive some amount of efficiency for our clients, right? You’re talking about driving efficiency for a dev shop, but what if we can prove that we’re driving efficiency for our clients? Right. How do you think about deploying that company to AI transformation or like general efficiency, like a traditional PE clay or focusing on dev shop and going that direction? Jesse Pujji: Yeah, I, I mean, I would, I, I would chase the problems. I guess. Like, it, it kind of like, I mean, if you would’ve solved the same problem, let’s, it’s, you know, and this is what our RCTO tells me all the time, Adam. He’s like, look, you just think about the, how do you, how does anyone decide how to spend money on dev? They do impact, cost, and ease, right? Through the same analysis. How big could this be money-wise, saving us? How confident are we gonna work and how costly or expensive is it? And we, you know, at am push, we used to do that all the time and like, it was like, damn, should we build our own? The API pulls from data’s Facebook layer, or should we use a third party or, you know, should we not do it at all? And then everyone does the stack ranking and they go, well, we only have $2 million of engineering resources, or $3 million of engineering resources. So we should basically say no to everything below this hurdle. But now you guys know this, like AI allows us to go faster and way cheaper, but it’s like if everything gets cheaper and faster, then the amount of things people are gonna do is gonna go up dramatically. Andrew Warner: Yep. Jesse Pujji: So I guess my answer to that is like, what are the real problems they have that like the, those, those, and, and maybe some of your projects still are 90% non-AI, but you’re using all your AI tools to do it. ’cause as you guys wa I mean watch anyone coding with Cursor or any of these other tools and it’s fucking insane. Like Yeah, I, my my point is like the actual AI ness of it is not actually that important. If I’m you guys based on Arman: Yeah. Jesse Pujji: What, what Alex said about the, ’cause I’m, by the way, I’m a services business guy. Like annual contracts, aligned compensation models, margins improving like. Services business are hard to build for a reason because most people don’t have some of those things. And even like, I mean I always talk about this like publicly aush growth assistant very soon, like within months is gonna pass ambush as ebitda. Do you know why? Alex: The cost of labor? Jesse Pujji: Nope. Retention. Arman: Mm-hmm. Jesse Pujji: Aush would get big and then two of our biggest clients would churn because they’re, oh, we’re gonna take this in-house. People don’t take global talent in-house for the most part. Like some of our bigger clients have said, Hey, we have some, but like that isn’t, you’re making a thousand bucks a month off. I mean like we just, the retention in am in AM and growth systems is amazing. Alex: Yep. Jesse Pujji: Right. And so that’s, I would just like tell you guys, McKinsey, by the way, and some of these guys have massive retention. Alex: Are you saying basically just because of the partner’s relationship, they’re constantly selling in new work Jesse Pujji: constantly. And that doesn’t even, by the way, at their prices, just, and, and this is something we see with OX too. We see a lot of like, oh, it’s not, it’s not like SaaS retention, but it is like they keep coming back to us for more and more projects, of course. And we feel good that we can actually manage and project that. So, Alex: and, and to your question about is it sizzle? I think irrespective of what direction we choose, like what is the balance of engineering or transformation work, I do think positioning in a AI transformation way gets us more engineering clients than if we did not position in that way. Jesse Pujji: Yeah, fair enough. Alex: Half of our clients have come through these free AI diagnostics We do. And so we run these diagnostics. They take two weeks. Most of it’s been automated. The only thing that’s not automated is basically three hours of stakeholder interviews, but half of those have turned into our engineering clients. That’s smart. And so, yeah. Andrew Warner: So wait, let’s, let’s talk about the transformation part of the business. Gimme an example of what you’ve done for someone. What did they walk in with? How did you understand what they needed and then what did they buy? Arman: The first part, the understanding what they needed is, is actually the core. And the way we do that is, um, Alex is talking about what we call our diagnostic, and that’s the free version. And then we also have an audit, which is the, the paid version. It’s basically anywhere from like 10 to 20 interviews, data requests, a survey, a lot of deep research that we do on our own, like, um, and, but the output of either of these, obviously the diagnostic is lighter than the audit is a report. The report has our learnings. It’s aligned with the goals of the business. Whatever Andrew Warner: pick, pick one. Pick a specific customer. You don’t have to tell me their name. What did you do? What, uh, what did you, what did you talk to them about? What did you uncover and what, what did you do afterwards, after this transformation? Arman: So, basically, one of them is a, is a SaaS company that works in healthcare. We did an audit for them. Um, and there are two types of interviews that we do in the audit. Or actually, lemme start with the survey. So the survey, basically the way that we think about it is. It goes to everybody in the company, or if, if the audit is specifically part of the, of the go to market org, Andrew Warner: whatever. But again, gimme, gimme a specific company. I need to see the picture of what this is. So a billboard company finds you because of Alex’s tweets, I’m assuming? Yeah. Arman: Yeah. Okay. So Alex posts on LinkedIn. Uh, actually, uh, quick, quick, quick kind of note here. All of our businesses come through LinkedIn, not Twitter. So, wow. So, so basically there’s a, there’s a billboard company and there’s the, they do traditional billboard selling where like, you’ll, you’re a big business and you’ll call them up and you say, Hey, I want to be on a billboard. And they, they’ll put you there. But they also have like a, a platform that’s similar to Uber for billboards, where you can go on, you can upload a picture, you can say, I want it to go here. Click go. Okay, cool. They came to us saying, Hey, I want to use AI in the company. Uh, I want to work, I want AI to be in the engineering platform. I want AI to be in the product itself. We’re not sure where, but we know that there’s opportunities. Here are a few ideas, but we want you to greenfield. Go, go check it out. So we started with a survey. The goal of the survey sends to everyone in the company, and the goal is to understand, we basically think of that as building a map for us, right? It lays out the entirety of the company from an org chart perspective, but also it gives us an idea of where to look. Then, based on that, we set up interviews. So, so as an example, the survey really highlighted the product org. Okay? So we spoke to the product org. We had a couple of saw calls with sales. We had a couple of calls with other people just to kind of poke around different areas, but to really focus on product. Andrew Warner: Yeah, we Arman: spoke to the product manager, we spoke to engineers, we spoke to the CTO, all these different people on product. What we found is there were areas in of, of opportunity in their product, so we dug in deeper. We used the product, we checked it out in the flow. Similar to like if you’ve uploaded a a, a Facebook ad, you start with the Facebook ad, you set a goal. If you upload an image, you set a caption, whatever, and then you click go, I wanna run the Facebook ad. They have a similar flow for uploading a billboard. So you start with, I wanna run it on these billboards in this area. I have this goal and this budget. I wanna upload an image. And so on. We asked about drop off data, so where are people dropping off? And then we noticed that after this, we asked what happens after they click go? And there’s two levels of moderation that are done by humans. Okay. So even just in this flow, we notice that there’s drop off at either of those, uh, moderation levels. One of them is for like internal moderation, and then they send it to the billboard owner to moderate, and there’s drop off at each of those levels. Andrew Warner: And so you’re saying, look, we’re losing users. It’s human beings. Easy for us to use AI to replace humans. Give a response quickly. Got it. Arman: Exactly. Andrew Warner: Okay. Arman: Likewise, in the, in the, in the flow of uploading an image and, and uh, kind of building that campaign, we notice that people. People don’t know what a good ad is. Okay? And so they’re drop off of the creative step. And so we noticed that with the same algorithm that is helping do the moderation, we can also help give feedback on the creative that’s uploaded to the platform and even built in the platform using ai. Got it. So basically we made these recommendations. We said, Hey, we’re gonna build you an algorithm that’s going to be used in the creative step to give feedback. We’re also gonna use this to replace moderation. We’re also going to help you build AI powered, um, like an AI powered billboard generator and so on. We built a, we, we made a few of these recommendations, and for each one, there’s basically a lift versus reward. So how much is this gonna cost and how much are you gonna get out of this and that? What are you gonna get outta this is tied directly to the business’s goals, whether it be revenue, even, whatever. Andrew Warner: This doesn’t seem like a sustainable business. At some point you’ve run outta ways to save people money. So does that mean that all these AI transformation companies eventually have to turn into engineering businesses where they could get ongoing work? Or is there something that I’m missing in ongoing work in AI transformation? Arman: Does a BizOps person ever run out of work to do in a company or does McKinsey ever run out of work to do with a, with a business? I think that like there there are examples, an Andrew Warner: efficiency expert. Does they run outta work? Jesse Pujji: Sort of. I think there’s enough. I mean, uh, Andrew, I think, I think there’s a couple issues. You know, one is AI is changing at a rapid, rapid pace, right? Yeah. And when I built AM push every six months, Facebook would change the way it worked. And it was just to our benefit. Because every time AI changes, some new model’s gonna launch. And then the same people who you did work for a year ago are gonna like, oh shit, we need to do more work here. Right? So that’s one thing. But then the other thing is I think the point of. Consultancies exist and they ebb and flow. It’s not to, not to say there’s not cyclical market issues they have to deal with, but, but there’s always work for companies where they have problems and they have issues. Um, and, and you know, it’s pretty perpetual. Andrew Warner: I’m a little skeptical. I’ll be open with you because partially what I heard you all say, uh, both Armand and Alex say earlier is the reason the debt business is so exciting is there is ongoing work. Yeah. You get embedded, you keep building with them. So maybe, maybe there is some place where AI transformation just kind of, if not dies, it goes down dramatically and you have to keep getting new business. Alex: One question I would have for you is, so I think what you’re saying makes sense. Do you have an overall skepticism of management consulting firms? Andrew Warner: Interesting. I like the way you put that. I see You’re saying just like in management consulting firms, there’s always more management consulting, more ways to improve. Same thing here. Alex: Yeah. Jesse Pujji: Sorry, I’m, I’m asking Chad GPT right now. How big is the third party engineering business? Andrew Warner: Well, the, the engineering part I get it’s the AI transformation company. Do you, at some point you, but those are gonna just Jesse Pujji: blend, right Andrew? Yeah, Andrew Warner: that’s what I, that’s what it seems like. Makes sense. That at some point it does need to be ongoing engineering work. Otherwise you can’t keep finding these places to cut human beings out. It eventually you’ve cut out all the human beings from the process. Let’s Jesse Pujji: stop using the word ai. ’cause the, the word AI is stupid. The real word is I can, I can build technology for you cheaper and faster than I used to be able to AI Arman: and not just build it, but also Jesse Pujji: ai. But, but like, yeah, Arman: yeah, Jesse Pujji: exactly. No, but that, like, that’s what you’re actually, the whole reason this is an opportunity is ’cause there’s tools and like our ability, Andrew, to like figure out content on our, on my posts and whatever, or like any of these things. We just would not have said yes to them before. If we had gone to Adam three years ago and said, Hey, Jesse’s gonna talk on pod, on like podcasts. You need to figure out how to take what he’s saying and turn that into written content. He would’ve been like, what? I need an NLP this and I need a database thing, this, and I need, and it’s like, dude, it would’ve been, he would’ve been sure I can do it for $3 million and I need six months to do that. And now it’s something they can do in a week because of ai. Andrew Warner: I see. So the ongoing opportunities to do work will keep coming up. So even if it’s some point, you get rid of the efficiency. There are new things to be built. Alex, I’m watching you. You’re, it’s either my connection is really bad that’s making you anxious, or there’s something you want to say and I’m holding you back from saying it. What is it? Alex: Because I think your, your gut reaction is a very natural reaction. Like, I actually, I, I think I’ve thought about this like, uh, my, my kind of like, um, it’s like the Jesse Pujji: old Indian uncle reaction. Alex: I was gonna say my, I used Jesse Pujji: to tell people we buy ads, ads on Facebook for people. The old Indian uncles would like, why can’t they grow tons themselves? What, what do they need you for? Alex: Yeah, I was, I was gonna say like my, my, um. My, my Jewish oc OCD is acting up right now. And what I’m thinking to myself is like, yeah, I’ve had this thought before and the way that I kind of think about it is similar to what Jesse Pujji: this is. Like Alex’s cold sweat dreams. You’re saying them as a fellow member of the tribe and he’s like, oh shit. Yeah. Why do they need us, Andrew? Alex: Oh no. The one question he wasn’t supposed to ask. Um, no, but I think there’s a few things. One is, I ultimately, the, the way that I think about it is like, consulting firms really just like are an index or like they latch onto being a, a growth and strategic partner for a business. And, and kind of the anchor for that is the partner who has the relationship with the CEO. And so the CEO whenever the, the CEO has cold sweats at night, uh, the CEO e’s not texting his best friend. He is texting his partner at Bain or BCG, or McKinsey. The way I think about it is AI is this incredible. Wedge into being a company’s growth partner and strategic partner in 2025. And so even if you’re right, let’s just say our, my deepest fear and your deepest fear is right, which is you run out of things to do what I still think is there. Every business me need support, every business, some size needs support to grow and needs help to unstuck problems. And there are a lot of problems to unstuck. Even if the solution isn’t always ai. Jesse Pujji: Just think of, here’s a simple way to think. Well first of all, let’s actually play a game. I just Googled or chat GB td this. How big do you think the, I just said how big is third party engineering as an industry? Yep. And everyone think about your answers, prices, right? Rule applies. Alex: Okay. Jesse Pujji: Andrew, you go first, Mr. Skeptical? Andrew Warner: Uh, I would say quarter trillion dollars. Okay, Jesse Pujji: so that’s 250 billion? Andrew Warner: Yeah. Jesse Pujji: Okay, Alex, A Alex: year. Uh, 49 billion. Jesse Pujji: Okay. Armand, Alex: we all of third party engineering. So like dead shop external Arman: engineering. Alex: Yeah. Arman: Oh, over a trillion for sure. Jesse Pujji: All over the place. Okay. Well, the, the right guy was right. It’s, this has a reasonable ballpark is one two, 3 trillion annually. Woo. So, dude, it’s, it’s another way to think about it. Like, you think about these cloud services guys, Andrew, and like, they’re like, you, you, I think you’re getting so close to the problem. You’re forgetting the business need, which is like, why did someone need a Salesforce implementation shop? Well, the real reason is ’cause they needed A CRM. Well, why They needed A CRM because they needed to track their customers and manage their customers and follow up with their customers. Then they needed a software to do it, then they needed a service provider on top of the software to implement it. And so the point is, these things all have to start with business problems. And I think what Alex was saying before about McKinsey is, do you think businesses will stop having problems if your answer is no? Then they’ll continue to have a business in helping them solve their problems, which happens to be using that, the modality. Today’s ai, 20 years ago it was, it was cloud services, right? 20 years before that, it was like, we’ll put up your mainframe and your thing and we’ll do whatever you need there. And it’s gotten bigger as there’s been more and more stuff, and everyone’s using more of it. Andrew Warner: So are we all agreeing that AI transformation is the beginning of the relationship, but it’s not the long term business, and then at some point something needs to come up? You either become the person who, when the CEO is sweating in the middle of the night, they call you, as Alex said, or as Jesse said, you keep finding other things to do and either way, you’re the support system and you happen to be using software or whatever that Jesse Pujji: software is. Yeah. Or, or Alex, we’ve been spending a lot of time looking at the, like, as new tools and technologies pop up, there’s gonna need the equivalent of implementation businesses. And so someone’s gonna, some, some tool that we can’t even think of today is gonna launch on top of anthropic or whatever. Everyone’s gonna go, wow, that solves this one problem for me, that, you know, engages my employees. Now I need to eng engage, like I need someone to implement that for me, and so on and so forth. Sorry, Alex, Alex: what were you gonna say? I, I think mm-hmm. Andrew, to your question, I think AI is a tool in the toolkit that solves business problems. And ultimately, if you want to build a huge business, it, my view is, is it isn’t the only tool you’re gonna rely on. Andrew Warner: Armand told me early before Armand told me before we got started, there’s a lot of fomo. You hear that AI can transform, you call, uh, 10 x, you say, I heard it can transform. Go and look around my company and tell me what’s going on. And people will get a will, will then find ways to improve the business. That’s, that’s why this whole thing is so sexy in the beginning. Alright, I wanna do a few demos here. Can you both do a screen share and show me a few things here? Alex: Yeah, for sure. So first, um, what do you guys use to, do you guys use EOS? Jesse Pujji: We have, yeah, we use elements of it. Alex: Okay, cool. So something. That I always found, like I fe, so EOS, just as, just to give quick, uh, background, it’s like OKRs, it’s a business operating system. My whole thing is I don’t like thinking about the rhythm of running my business and the processes and I don’t wanna invent them from scratch. EOS is a system for running your business. Um, we at Morning Brew we self-implemented, meaning we read a book called Traction by Gino Wickman, and then we implemented what was talked about in the book. A lot of people hire actual implementers, um, who either run your offsites, help you with ES implementation and they charge a shit ton of money. Like, you know, they, they, it could be like $15,000 a day for being at your offsite or, uh, with implementation. So what I wanted to do was basically build an EOS implementer. ’cause I’m implementing EOS at 10 X right now. And so I’ll just take you guys through this quickly. So EOS facilitator basically built a custom GPT. And the way that I think about custom gpt is it’s, it’s basically just a, almost like a persistent chat GPT instance. So it’s the, you know, instead of me having a one-off conversation with chat GPT and then it falls into the abyss of all my conversations, if there’s a conversation that I’m going to want to revisit frequently. If it’s something, if it’s a tool that I’m gonna wanna share with other people in my business, and if I’m gonna want it to operate with context that like on an ongoing basis, then I think about building a custom GPT. So we look under the hood here in this E-O-S-G-P-T. Basically the way it’s configured is I have uploaded the actual book Traction by Gino Wickman. I found the PDF of the book uploaded that. I uploaded the VTO, like all of like the, the frameworks you fill out to, to implement traction. What I actually haven’t implo, uh, uh, uploaded here, but it’s something I’m gonna do is take our knowledge base for 10 x so our org chart information about our clients and upload it here. So then EOS has, or this implementer has full knowledge about our business. And then the instructions are basically the way in which this custom GPT is supposed to interface with me. And just for context, the way that I always approach creating these instructions is I just have chat GBT five PRO create a prompt. So I asked it to create a prompt that would act as kind of the instructions for my EOS implementer. And so just to give you an example of what this looks like in practice. Um, and, and, and also like in terms of the model, and this is something Arman and I talked about a, a bunch. I just used GPT five PRO on this. It’s like the most powerful model that GPT has. It takes longer, but it’s just very good at reasoning. So one thing that I was doing today with it is I wanted to create the accountability chart for 10 x. And so what I literally did is I just had a conversation with my implementer. So I said, can you help me create my accountability chart? Said yes. And then it took us through the di directions for creating the accountability chart. The accountability chart is like, what are the key functions in your business? It’s about, um, roles, not seats or people. And then it asks questions. And so what I like about this is it acts as like my facilitator. ’cause it’s just asking questions to gather information. Mm-hmm. To complete the accountability chart. So then I said, we’re 10 x, we have 12 team members. We have both visionary and integrator. Our core functions, our sales and marketing products and client success and ops. It fills those out. Then it says, do you have five key responsibilities per seat, which is what the accountability chart has. I had already created it, so I shared an image, and so then it just filled in what the roles per every seat were. And then it asked a few follow-up questions all and went through the full thing. We have a full accountability chart now, and then the next step is you look at everyone in your company and you look at are do they get it, want it, and have the capacity to do it? Like are they right for the roles you have in your company? And so then it created this whole table that now our leadership team at 10 X is gonna fill out to know of like everyone is right for their role at the company. So that’s just one example of how I basically turned traction the book and like all of the guidelines into my facilitator. Yeah, so this doesn’t have to be like a single player experience. And one thing I’ll say is I’ve found this very helpful because I am very much an external processor and so I find it way easier to have someone questioning me than me trying to, in my own head, self implement EOS. Andrew Warner: I’m like that too. I need that conversation and voice ideally. Alex: Yep. Andrew Warner: Okay. And I’m looking over on the left side of your screen, and I can see that you also have an AI coach, which I think is trained on another book, and Alex: Yep. This Andrew Warner: one was, you’ve done this for different aspects of your Alex: business. Yep. This one was, this one was trained on, um, Mabo, Charlie’s great. CEO within mm-hmm. And then also info about 10 x. So I, I actually use this all the time. Like we were just talking about, uh, Armand and I were talking about like, um, did we want to give a bonus to a certain employee? What should that bonus be and what are the trade-offs? We, I went through the conversation here and what it suggested is what we ended up going with, and it’s scripted what our conversation should be when we meet with that employee to share their bonus. That’s awesome. But set the right expectations. That’s, Andrew Warner: that’s fantastic. Yeah. Okay. Uh, Amron, you got a, you’ve got something you wanna show too, right? Arman: Alex mentioned, uh, developers are living in the future and the tool du like Jesse, earlier you mentioned Curs. Our engineers would call you a boomer for using cursor like that is like so yesterday. Um, and so love it. The tools that are like the big ones right now are Codex, CLI and Claude code CLI. Um, so to those who’ve never seen this interface or think this is scary, this is basically what’s called a command line interface. So if you’re on Mac and you open what’s called terminal, like you just go terminal, um, it’ll open. And then on Windows, I think it’s something similar, uh, term. If you search term, it’ll open. So if you, um, open up terminal and you download Claude then or Claude Code, which you could just do from the website, then when you type in Claude, it basically opens up this program, uh, called Claude Code. And so you could just talk to it. You could say, um, I am Arman, uh, or actually here, let me, who is Jesse Fuji? Did I spell that right? Andrew Warner: Mm-hmm. Okay. Arman: Uh, search. The web and give me a brief bio. So it basically goes and does some research and it says, okay, I wanna do web search. Jesse Fuge, bio entrepreneur. Yes. So this is like a very simple use case, but uh, we will get nuts in a minute. So, cool. Serial entrepreneur, blah, blah. Okay. Um, so let’s actually say, um, I want to build a competitor to am push. Alex: Oh shit. Arman: Um, please write me a business plan in a markdown document to do so. Start by doing research. Um, spin up at least three sub-agents running in parallel. One should study. And push and its competitors. Alex: Andrew Buckle. In Arman: another study, go to market Alex: business model to a third one Arman: and how we, uh, acquire customers. And the third should study business model. Use the internet to do that. Then come back and write the report. Cool. So first it’s like, let me understand what this guy wants, and then you’ll see in a moment it’ll spin up three. So this is one subagent research, aush and competitors. This is the second subagent research go to market and customer acquisition. And then this is the third subagent research business model options. And now each one is running. Each one is doing its own searches, as you can see. And I need to approve each of them. But you know what, I’m just gonna say yes. And don’t ask again for web search commands. Yes. And don’t ask again. Yes. And don’t ask again. Yes. And don’t ask again. Yes. And don’t ask again. I’m just gonna say yes ’cause it’s not listening again, Andrew Warner: because it wants to make sure that you, you’re comfortable with the number of tokens it’s using. Arman: Using, yeah. So you can change modes. So you can go to, I think it’s control shift or command shift or something. Shift, I dunno what it’s, but there’s some command where you can like change modes and you can go into planning mode where it won’t do anything. It’ll just write a plant. There is, uh, auto accept mode or like, we call it yellow mode where it just says, screw it. I’m just gonna, you, I’m not gonna ask you for permission, I’m just gonna do whatever. Alex: And, and just so you guys have context, like one thing I learned in just watching Armand and the different engineers work with Claude Code is the reason it was such a kind of like incredible, um. Like piece of software. And, and the reason also like was it sounded at 3.7 that was incredible is because of its ability to have tool use, like to basically access tools, external tools to do work. Arman: Yeah. Alex: And it was other models before this were not nearly as good as doing this. Arman: Yeah. Alex: Tools like what, Arman: like task like web search. Like it, so, so there is so much going be going on behind the scenes. There’s a lot of people who’ve like reverse engineered cloud code to understand how it works. There’s a lot of really cool techniques like injecting reminders to tell the agent, Hey, don’t forget this, whatever. It’s really, really involved, but it’s really good for, and that makes it really good for coding because it work, it, it basically forces the agent to stay on task, but that makes it useful for other things too. And that’s kind of one of my goals is to get people who aren’t engineers using this. So as this is going, I’m actually gonna show you another, another example. Okay. So this is still running over here in this window, but over here. I’m going to kill this. Clear it, and then I’m going to say Claude. Um, and I’m gonna say open up LinkedIn, uh, LinkedIn’s website or webpage. Open up LinkedIn. Why am I speaking? Why am I like being weird? Open up LinkedIn. Yes. I wanna proceed cools. Andrew Warner: So now open up, it opens up a tab in a new browser window. Arman: Yep. That opens up a tab in a new browser window. I’m gonna say search for Andrew Warner, founder of Mixergy. Okay. It’s taking a snapshot to make sure it did the right job, but as it’s doing that founder of Mixergy and send him a dm, tell him, oh wow, Alex: this was, Arman: um, or this was sent by Claude. So now. To, yeah, lemme try to manage these windows. So I’m gonna put them side by side here. Okay. So it’s asking, yes, I wanna proceed. So it’s gonna click on search Combox, but now that I resize that it needs to reorient itself and Alex: Armand’s using a tool called Playwright, which, which basically allows you to interface with web pages. Arman: Yeah. Which is actually, it’s, it’s an MCP. It’s super easy to install. Um, and it’s free. So anybody can do this. So now it’s going, it, it searched for Andrew. There Andrew Warner: he is. It found me right there. The one search result. Okay. Arman: Yep. That man is so handsome. Good looking guy. Jesse Pujji: The machines are alive. Andrew Warner: What Arman: Now? See, it’s saying message button for Andrew Warner. Andrew Warner: Because it identified the message about not its own. Arman: Yep, exactly. Andrew Warner: And knew that’s what it needed for the dm. Arman: And now it’s looking at it like it actually looks at the code. So now it just opened up the message window, see that? And now it just put, this was sent by Claude Code and to round out our magic trick, it’s gonna take a screenshot just so that it can wind up and it’s gonna send that, I’m really trying to buy time for quote code. Yeah. And now it’s gonna click the send button and it’s sent. So Andrew, if you can confirm, this is Andrew Warner: by cloud cloud code. It went through from Alex to me. Jesse Pujji: Where does all this go in, in your guys’ mind? Where does all this go? Like Armand, what’s the pace at which, I mean this stuff is obviously, it’s really cool, it’s a little slow if you’re trying to do something. It takes, it takes a long time. But what’s Jesse Pujji: gonna happen in like six months or a year in, in your opinion? Arman: So what’s interesting is that this example. Technologically speaking, this was possible over a year ago, right? Why is this not the norm? I would argue that it’s for the exact reason that like, for the exact problem that we’re solving, it’s hard to implement. Like this is a cool magic trick, but to understand how you implement this is actually difficult. So one of the things that, that Alex and I talk about a lot is when people argue, Hey, um, Claude Code or Cursor or whatever, AI is not as good as I am at writing code. That’s what a lot of engineers will say, but a lot of people outside of engineering will say similar things. They’ll say, ai, AI is not as good as as me at X, so I can’t use it to that. I say basically, if you have a free or near free junior employee and you can’t, and you have unlimited versions of this, you could spin up infinite. Numbers of these near free junior employees. If you can’t find a way to generate leverage from that, that’s a skill issue. Right? Jesse Pujji: Right. Arman: Now, if we take that curve and we take the cost of intelligence, I would argue that this is intelligence, right? If you take the cost of intelligence and you, and you ask them, tote that towards zero, what you see is people will 10 x or they will go towards zero. And it, and, and if you, if people have the ability to architect, right, whether it’s code and they wanna architect it, or in this case, if you are a really good recruiter and the only thing that was holding you back is your ability to message a ton of people or whatever it may be, if the only thing in the way of success was just time, you’re going to succeed. Jesse Pujji: But my, sorry, my question was a little different. Where do you see the technology going for like. Is this gonna happen in three, like in one second in the future now? Or like, is it gonna, I mean, that seems like to be the obvious thing, that it’s gonna go faster, better, smarter. Like how do you guys think about that? Alex: Yeah, I mean, if you read the, um, I’m forgetting his name now. Uh, we could LinkedIn in the show notes, but there was just a piece written by a guy who was a, is or was a researcher at one of the frontier labs. And he is like, everyone basically talks about how like the models are slowing down in their improvement chat. G PT wasn’t that good. And what he basically posits is like we as humans are just really good at getting used to things that felt like science fiction, feeling like nonfiction anymore. And the the, uh, the gold line just keeps moving in crazy ways, right? And you actually map out the, the, basically there’s these independent orgs that do a mapping of every new model basically. How long can the model run for? And still have a 50%, um, success rate of whatever the task was that it was doing. And when GBT three came out, I wanna say it was like, it was like three seconds or four seconds, Arman: right? Alex: And now it’s like, it’s at like an hour. And if you actually look at the charting of this, it is still exponential in how long that these tasks can run for. And the reason they look at that is it’s like entropy. The longer a task is, the more, uh, likely it is that a model will start, like spinning its wheels and all these things. And so if you just look at this like it is still exponential, and he would argue that basically you’re gonna be able to have a true digital employee, meaning it can do 24 hours a day of work without you checking on it by 2027. Arman: Yeah, I, I would be more bullish than that person. I would say that it’s actually much sooner. I think in terms of the, um. To nerd out on this for a moment. Uh, I think if the way, like if you think about this in terms of like using humans as an analogy, the base models are, are appearing to asymptote, right? They’re appearing to either asymptote or the growth of the speed of growth is slowing. Most of the growth now is coming at, whether it be the application layer or the fine tuning layer or whatever, or that type of like adding intelligence on top or adding ability on top of like core iq. And with the stuff that I just showed, like adding what I call arms and legs, right? And so like, if you want to use the human being as the parallel, the base model is basically a newborn baby. They’re born with a brain, but we need to spend a lifetime teaching that person how to be a human. They need to grow, they need to get coordinated, they need to be able to do shit right. And that’s what the models can’t do right now. That is make, that is happening much, much faster. I think that is the part that all the money and time and intelligence is going towards. So I think the next year raci a lot of, like when GPT-3 0.5 was first announced, they were advertising they could write a fucking haiku. Jesse Pujji: Right Arman: now we’re actually getting to the like, let’s actually do shit. Let’s get it to actually do work. And I think that that’s gonna accelerate over the next 12 months. Jesse Pujji: What’s your take on like human in the loop AI versus, I mean, again, there’s like this, some arguments like no, the humans are gonna be, you don’t need them. They’re versus human in the loop. Like how do you guys answer that or think about that? Arman: People think about AI as like something that’s out of our control. Like, oh, it’s inevitable that AI is going to take over because of course it’s going to, right? Like it’s the self-fulfilling prophecy. I think that what people forget is that it’s a statistical model that is in our control to make it better. Not only are we in control of making it better, but we’re in control of making it better in the ways that we want it to be better, right? And so if we as humans want it to be really, really good at something, it’s going to get good at that thing. By nature of free markets and intelligence and all these things, if we don’t want it to be good at something, it’s less likely to be good at that thing. And so I am not necessarily worried that humanity is going to replace ourselves because it’s in our control. I think I am concerned about different, like, like some people who run these giant companies, I don’t think care about the things that I’m describing here. I think they actually just wanna see how far AI can be pushed and how much humans can be replaced. But frankly, that’s part of why I was excited about like starting 10 x. That’s part of the initial essay that I wrote is to. Compete against that and to make sure that humans are in the loop, but in a way that we want to be in the loop. Can we think humans are put here Jesse Pujji: to create part Can, hold on. Mike, can you bring that down one level that the philosophical aspect of it makes sense to me? I’m curious, like there’s a version of this where, again, the future is so automated and blah, blah, blah. There’s another version where like, humans make the AI better through the things that make them human. And then AI makes humans better through like output and stuff. Like, do you believe that, how do you guys think about the, like, you know, again, there’s that AI won’t replace you. A human who uses AI will replace you. Like, do you believe that, and I mean that more, less from the, like your, your worldview and more from like a specific, the way work gets done with AI in the future now and in the future. Alex: Yeah. Well, I mean, my one thing I would say just specifically to the, the truism you just said is I really just think it is like bullshit and like basically every executive is like on one hand being like. How can I use AI in my company? On the other hand is saying, um, how do I make sure my people aren’t worried about it? And then behind closed doors is saying, this is a hundred percent gonna wipe out a ton of jobs in my company. Jesse Pujji: Right? Alex: Um, so look, I mean, Armand will have a smarter thought here, but my, my general view is like, if we view, like I view AI today as like this incredible junior employee that just like a great junior employee is high agency, high effort. You, uh, you delegate, uh, like you build up trust initially with like, really, uh, defining parameters. And as it earns trust, you allow it to do more without you checking in on it. As intelligence gets better and better, I do think you end up getting like employees, quote unquote employees that look more and more like senior employees, which just means like at the end of the day, what’s a job of an executive? It really becomes around like orchestration. And now where I’m not smart enough is. What is the point at which it becomes intelligent enough that it is good enough? It, it can orchestrate well as well. I don’t know, I don’t know the answer to that and I don’t know if anyone does. I don’t know if you have thoughts on it. Like if your question is like, are we out of jobs, uh, in the next five to 10 years? IWI would put it at a non-zero chance, but until that point, we’re enjoying working on this problem. Jesse Pujji: How are you guys thinking about the framework for your margins and your growth as a services business? Arman: What do you mean? Like frameworks? Like what is our goal or Jesse Pujji: it’s a really, really important thing. So, so here’s, here’s what typically happens with services, businesses and how they go south, right? One is pipeline, like the amount of work getting done versus clients that are coming in like you’re selling people, right? And I don’t mean that in a weird way, but that’s what you’re doing fundamentally. And typically what happens is service delivery and customer acquisition, they start to bleed in a bad way, which means. Oh, like you have this pipeline, then the pipeline gets too busy because you still need to be involved probably in certain ways. And like then that’s one way you start to get into this, like this sort of swinging. The other big way that’s related is then margins, creep. Margins go down, right? And margins typically go down because scope creeps up by the client. You’re not, people aren’t paying attention to it all. Like I see a lot of services businesses where they’re just not even paying attention to it. I talked to an agency couple weeks ago and I was like, what’s your pod level margin? They’re like, we have no idea. What are you talking about? And they weren’t directly, they could do the high level number. Yeah. They could say, here’s the total revenue, here’s my total headcount. And then some clients are 10% margin and others are 70%. Yeah. And, and so there’s a lot of frameworks. I think that, you know, it’s important for you guys to build to, to crush this, uh, to start to think about some of these questions more directly. And I, maybe you have, maybe you haven’t, but, but that’s sort of just what I meant by that. Arman: I mean, we have the margin down to the day, like, like we know our margin per employee because we’re, we generate, we charge on output and we pay on output and everyone’s aligned. And so we’re very, very strict with, um, thinking about that. And again, the goal is so that we can reinvest in the company and, and um, and build IP for the customers. And so it’s basically that flywheel. So what Jesse Pujji: drives your margins up versus down? Alex: One is that every additional time we do work, there’s less human. There’s actually less cost of labor that goes into that work. That’s cool. Yeah. One, one example for that would be like, um, and this goes into like how we ultimately wanna monetize the business different than typically service businesses. What does it look like if Andrew, let’s just use an example for, um, I’ll, I’ll just use an example for let’s, we were talking to a business there, sellers spend. More than 50% of their time not selling. We are talking about building basically just like an A sales co-pilot for them that does a lot of like SDR and sales ops work. While this business is like a healthcare business, 90% of the bones of this agent can be applied to every other business that has a sales function. What does it look like for us to basically, one, build this agent at cost as 10 x and then charge them based on usage of the agent, but then also every additional time we work with customers, then potentially need, right. A sales agent build, it’s effectively Lego blocks for doing that over and over. Right. Right. And so the margin increases every time we do that. Jesse Pujji: No, I love that. Well, but, so one of the issues with output based pricing, right, just to flag it for you guys, is Yeah. What happens when the client, like, what happens when the output isn’t good and you’ve committed to the output, so all of a sudden you, you, you know, let’s say your costs are 50 grand. You’re selling it for a hundred grand in this example, and they go, we don’t like this. And you’re like, fuck, I gotta put another month’s worth of work into it for whatever reason. Client’s unhappy, maybe they’re jackass and they didn’t listen when you were scoping it and vice versa, whatever. Alex: Yep. Jesse Pujji: Then what happens is you spend another month and now all of a sudden your margins went from 50 to 30%. Alex: It really is just a question of is it realistic to fully incentive align you with a customer? Because if you were to truly incentive align, I guess it would be like truly value-based where it’d be like, if this outcome happens in your business, we get paid. And I know like the big consultancies do this. Um, I mean, I guess my question for you is like, do you, do you just think that’s not realistic for service businesses to charge based on value or, or output? Jesse Pujji: No, not at all. I mean, that’s what we did at Ambush, right? I mean, we charged that way. It’s just you have to build the infrastructure. There’s a lot of pieces that are, that require like more thoughtfulness than you might think. For example, like. One of the, one of the quotes, like Rick would always say, and this is in a marketing context, right? ’cause we would take on people’s marketing and we’d promise them better results. Alex: Yep. Jesse Pujji: Right? And it’s like, well, at first you’re like, wow, these guys will take a risk. And they’ll, and it’s well, but what’s really happening is like, we’re like an investor, we’re underwriting the opportunity. Alex: Yep. Jesse Pujji: So, and, and the line was like, never, you know, be like, Floyd Mayweather, never take on a fight. You can’t win. Alex: Totally. Yeah. You just back the duck. Jesse Pujji: Yeah. Well, specifically though, in your, in our case, it was like we already knew the levers we would pull to be able to reduce their CPAs or grow their volume by a certain amount. And we didn’t always work, but we were very confident. More often than not, it would work. And so for you guys, when you think about costing based on outputs, what you’re gonna find pretty soon is you’re gonna want to narrow the things at, you start to focus on, like your example of the SDR thing. Because then, you know, you can keep delivering it, delivering it, it delivering it. And you’re gonna have a built in margin model versus the more wide, like Alex: Yep. Jesse Pujji: You know, wide, industry wide problem set. That, that, that runs into that problem, which is like you, if you can’t start to predict it, it starts to really take a big hit on your Alex: margins. Jesse Pujji: Yeah, Alex: I think that, I think that makes total sense. One last thought, ’cause I know you, like, you basically talked about acquisition costs, um, and like delivery, moving the wrong direction. You know, one of the things that I’ve wanted to do since leaving Morning Brew is effectively build morning Brew on top of a better business model. And, um, and so ultimately the goal is to build kind of 10 X media on top of 10 x, where there’s only one place that executives go to to make AI more actionable. And that’s like the hook again. And over time, it can develop into not solely around ai. Um, and so that’s the idea is a combination of brand and personality driven franchises that make AI actionable for kind of the next generation of leaders that are trying to transform their businesses. Andrew Warner: Come on guys. Now tell the audience your revenue. Can we say more than 10 million? Alex: Sorry. Uh, Andrew, you’re cutting out. Yeah, Andrew Warner: it must be your connect. Cool. End it here. Gentlemen. Congratulations on the success. Thanks so much for doing this, Armand. I’m seeing you wince like you’re regretting the friendship we even had. Just because I’ve pushed it too far. I’ll win you back later. I’ve Jesse Pujji: got an awkward question for Armand. Why is this business not on your LinkedIn? It’s, uh, it’s going on there. Okay.

Title: Carl Icahn’s net worth plummets by billions — nearly 75% — after battle with short seller

Carl Icahn’s fortune has plummeted from a recent peak of about $17.5 billion to roughly $4.8 billion — the biggest drop of his storied career — after a bruising battle with short-seller Hindenburg Research, according to Forbes. The nearly 75% drop in Icahn’s net worth from 2023 to this year came as Hindenburg accused his firm of inflated valuations and unsustainable dividends — allegations Icahn strongly rejected. The 89-year-old activist investor — once considered one of Wall Street’s fiercest corporate raiders — insisted in a recent series of interviews with The Wall Street Journal that he’s still a fighter. He also reportedly enjoys betting on NFL games every week, winning about $80,000 through bets on the San Francisco 49ers and the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday. Friends of Icahn told The Journal that he spends more time reading and reviewing investments than socializing, though he remains on civil terms with his ex-wife, Gail. His health, while fragile after recent surgeries, has reportedly stabilized. Recent years have seen Ichan battle a series of challenges including an operation on his ankle that left him unable to walk comfortably for months and forced him to give up daily tennis. Soon after, he was treated for an enlarged spleen, with medication initially causing fatigue and shortness of breath — though he says he never missed a day of work because of the procedure. “I keep going,” he recently told The Journal. “I enjoy the game.” But the game has changed. Icahn Enterprises — once a symbol of his ruthless success — has lost about 80% of its market value since the May 2023 short-selling attack by Hindenburg Research. The short seller likened Icahn’s business model to a “Ponzi-like” structure. Icahn dismissed the allegations as lies, but the fallout erased billions from his fortune and sent his company’s stock to its lowest level in decades. The decline was amplified by Icahn’s own use of leverage. He pledged more than half his holdings in Icahn Enterprises as collateral for personal margin loans. When the stock price collapsed, lenders forced him to renegotiate to avoid a margin call. Icahn fought back in familiar fashion, denouncing short sellers and defending his accounting practices. “They took part of my army away, like Alexander the Great,” Icahn told The Journal when asked about the fallout of the Hindenburg attack. “He has to change his battle plans, but it’s not that bad,” he added. Inside Icahn Enterprises, succession planning has grown uncertain, according to The Journal. The founder’s son Brett Icahn rejoined the firm in 2020 under a seven-year contract, but recent bets have stumbled. A major position in Bausch Health lost more than $700 million, and key lieutenants have departed. One, Steven Miller, left after clashing with Brett Icahn; another, Andrew Teno, is now chief executive and considered the most likely operational successor. Carl Icahn himself still lives and works in near isolation at his waterfront home on Miami’s Indian Creek Island, known as “Billionaire Bunker,” The Journal reported. Icahn insisted to the publication that the tide is turning. He pointed to a rebound in third-quarter earnings — among the company’s best ever — and says new investments in EchoStar and Monro, an auto-service chain, signal fresh momentum. Icahn Enterprises reported $287 million in net income last quarter — up sharply from a year earlier — buoyed by gains in CVR Energy, the refiner it controls. Stay up on the very latest with Evening Update. Please provide a valid email. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Never miss a story. Yet Icahn’s focus has shifted beyond balance sheets. He has launched a campaign against what he calls the “cartel” of BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, arguing that their dominance of index-fund voting power has neutered shareholder activism. He’s drafting a white paper urging Congress and President Trump to restrict their influence, convinced that activists like himself are vital to corporate accountability, The Journal reported. He says his greatest investment remains the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, which he endowed with $200 million in 2012. He also funds animal charities and still believes his activism makes capitalism stronger. Still, Icahn admitted to being too proud in the past. “It was hubris,” he told Puck News last year. “I thought I could figure out what the market was going to do. That’s the dumbest thing you can do.” Advertisement

Add PCMag as a preferred source on Google. How many jobs are being lost to AI? A new bipartisan bill would require US companies to report AI-related job losses to the federal government to track the technology’s impact on employment. On Wednesday, Senators Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) announced the AI-Related Job Impacts Clarity Act, which "will finally give us a clear picture of AI’s impact on the workforce—what jobs are being eliminated, which workers are being retrained, and where new opportunities are emerging," Sen. Warner said in a statement. "Armed with this information, we can make sure AI drives opportunity instead of leaving workers behind." Although researchers have already floated estimates about jobs lost to AI adoption, the senators say it's vital to start tracking the issue with concrete data. The bill proposes requiring both public and private companies in the US, as well as government agencies, to report AI-related job losses on a quarterly basis to the Department of Labor. This would cover jobs lost to automation and the use of artificial intelligence to replace human labor. Companies and agencies would also have to report any human hiring or human job training that was tied to the incorporation of AI. The Department of Labor would then use the data to publish a report each quarter “analyzing the net impact,” which would be available online through the department’s website. Axios reports the bill demonstrates that both political parties are concerned about AI taking jobs away from Americans, noting that Hawley and Warner were alarmed after the CEO of Anthropic warned that AI "could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs." "The American people need to have an accurate understanding of how AI is affecting our workforce, so we can ensure that AI works for the people, not the other way around,” Sen. Hawley says. For now, the US government remains shut down over a funding dispute in Congress. Amazon recently cut 14,000 jobs, which could rise to 30,000 next year. CEO Andy Jassy said the move was due to a culture shift, not AI. However, Beth Galetti, head of HR at Amazon, called out a desire to keep up with fast-moving AI technologies. "This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones)," she wrote in a memo to employees. Last month, Meta cut 600 roles within its AI division after spending millions to poach people from rivals.

Title: Bitcoin ETF Fever Spreads: BlackRock Targets Australian Market Next

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. BlackRock will list an iShares Bitcoin ETF on the Australian Securities Exchange in mid-November 2025, according to public filings and market reports. The product will be a local wrapper around BlackRock’s US iShares Bitcoin Trust — a vehicle that launched in January 2024 and now manages about $85 billion. Based on reports, the new ASX ticker will charge a management fee of 0.39% per year. The move aims to give Australian investors an easier way to gain exposure to bitcoin through a familiar exchange-listed product. Reports have disclosed that investors who buy the ASX ETF will not hold bitcoin in a private wallet; they will have exposure through the ETF’s structure. That means price swings in bitcoin still apply. It also means custody and technical handling are managed by the fund rather than each investor. The fee of 0.39% is competitive when compared with many retail crypto services, but traders and long-term holders will want to check how closely the ETF tracks bitcoin’s price and what trading spreads look like on the ASX. According to filings, the ASX listing will use the US trust as the underlying asset, which raises questions about cross-market flows and the mechanics of how units are created and cancelled. Liquidity on the local exchange, and how market makers support the product, will shape how cheaply investors can enter and exit positions. BlackRock’s entry could prompt other asset managers to list similar products in Australia. Based on reports, the launch follows a wave of spot bitcoin ETF approvals and listings in other markets since early 2024. For retail investors who avoided direct crypto custody, an ETF on the ASX removes some of the operational hurdles. But it does not remove market risk: bitcoin’s price can move sharply. Regulators in Australia have already been refining rules around crypto products, and the presence of a major global manager will put those rules under closer scrutiny. Smaller providers offering bitcoin exposure through different structures may face tougher competition on fees and access. Reports have also highlighted potential downsides: an ETF wrapper can add a layer of cost and complexity, and investors may misunderstand the difference between owning the underlying asset and owning ETF units. Custody arrangements, insurance, and how the trust sources and stores bitcoin are items that advisers and sophisticated buyers will examine. According to market watchers, the timing — mid-November 2025 — matters. Investor appetite, bitcoin’s price action and broader market sentiment around that time will affect how much money flows into the new ETF. For many Australians, this will be a new, regulated route into bitcoin exposure. For the market, it is another step toward mainstream channels where big asset managers compete for crypto assets on familiar ground.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Bank of America prioritizes bigger AI initiatives, as annual spending on new tech increased by 44% over the past decade

John Kell is a contributing writer for Fortune and author of Fortune’s CIO Intelligence newsletter. Bank of America’s annual spending on new, strategic technology initiatives, which includes investments in artificial intelligence, has increased by 44% over the past decade to reach $4 billion in 2025. The executive that’s steering those investments is Hari Gopalkrishnan, a 14-year veteran who was promoted to serve as the chief technology and information officer in late July. Today at Bank of America’s investor day event, Gopalkrishnan will outline the vision for these strategic tech bets and discuss how they tie into the broader $118 billion in tech investments that the company has made over the past decade. It is the first time leadership has held this event in 15 years and Gopalkrishnan, CEO Brian Moynihan, and other C-suite leaders will face investors as Bank of America’s stock has lagged the five other large U.S. banks for the past five years. “We have steadily increased our spend in technology, now up to $13 billion a year, of which $4 billion goes into strategic growth,” Gopalkrishnan tells Fortune ahead of his one-hour investor day panel discussion with two other Bank of America technologists. “We leverage across the enterprise, so every dollar you spend gets the maximum bang for the buck, as opposed to sort of being siloed by line of business.” That means that when Gopalkrishnan deploys new AI tools and functionality, he will prioritize applications that can scale across all eight lines of business, which includes global capital markets, consumer lending, and retail banking. One example of this in action is Erica, an AI virtual assistant that’s surpassed three billion client interactions since the tool launched in 2018. It now averages more than 58 million interactions per month, facilitating chatbot conversations with clients, proactively altering them on changes to their past spending patterns or flagging when they may have been double-charged by a merchant, and answering banking questions. The tool is currently available on Bank of America’s mobile app, but will expand next year to the desktop. In 2020, Bank of America launched Erica for Employees, an internal version of the tool that more than 90% of the company’s global workforce of 213,000 now uses regularly. Erica has helped reduce the number of calls into the company’s IT service desk by 50%. The banking sector has embraced generative AI capabilities at a faster pace than most sectors, with investments focused on AI-enabled chatbots, virtual assistants that can summarize financial documents, fraud monitoring, and assisting employees as they navigate complex international regulatory changes. Generative, predictive, and other forms of AI collectively are projected to generate as much as $340 billion annually in value creation for the global banking sector, consulting giant McKinsey has estimated. Financial giants, including Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, have also been steadily rolling out new generative AI tools to more employees throughout 2025. At Bank of America, Gopalkrishnan says he’s less incentivized to focus his investments on AI tools that can save a couple minutes on simplistic workplace tasks. “When you look at the end-to-end client journey, they involve like 40-plus processes and thousands of employees,” says Gopalkrishnan. “You start to pick apart that process and reimagine it. That’s when you get ROI.” Bank of America has explored more than 45 different “proof of concept” use cases for generative AI , with 15 of them commercially live today. Some of the priority use cases that Gopalkrishnan is deploying include tools that can summarize or offer search functionality for capital markets and investment banking employees, making it easier to pull real-time market commentary. An in-house built “AskGPS” tool, which was trained on over 3,200 internal documents and presentations, allows employees to ask complex questions on behalf of clients and receive responses within seconds. Bank of America has also invested $1.5 billion into the company’s data capabilities over the past five years, which Gopalkrishnan says was critical to create a foundation that allowed for more AI adoption. Within the technology department, Gopalkrishnan has deployed AI coding assistants that are used by 18,000 developers. There has already been a 20% productivity lift to select parts of the development life cycle that Bank of America has focused its efforts on. Gopalkrishnan says he’s mostly leaning on one unnamed vendor to support AI-enabled code assistance, but is continuing to explore other tools on a smaller scale. His intent is to standardize the application of these AI coding tools over time to as few vendors as possible. More than 130,000 Bank of America employees are currently authorized to use the enterprise productivity tools and by the end of the year, everyone will have access to them. Bank of America has sought to motivate its workforce by offering AI learning programs that begin by teaching the basics of AI, but also more advanced prompt engineering training. “It’s really a combination of training, education, giving them exposure to the tools, and then ongoing commitment to reskill, as the work changes,” says Gopalkrishnan. John Kell Send thoughts or suggestions to CIO Intelligence here. Tech earnings highlight cracks in AI’s valuation halo. Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon have all spent billions to support their AI initiatives—and all four told investors last week that they will increase spending even more in 2026. Investors have consistently supported the AI boom over the past few years, though that enthusiasm showed some notable cracks in the latest earnings season, as Microsoft and Meta Platforms both saw their stocks fall amid concerns for the lofty levels of spending needed to support their AI ambitions. What’s vexing investors is: AI is generating billions of dollars in revenue and bottom-line efficiencies, but exactly how much, at what pace, and at what price? That investment thesis still needs time to marinate as these tech giants have added debt to support their AI spending. OpenAI strikes a big compute deal with Amazon; projects massive revenue growth. On Monday, OpenAI inked a deal to buy $38 billion worth of compute from Amazon and will immediately start to access Nvidia’s graphics processing units. The partnership is notable as it is one of OpenAI’s first big moves away from Microsoft, who the AI startup had an exclusive cloud agreement with up until this year. Separately, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman indicated more bullish expectations for revenue growth, sharing that annual revenue is “well more” than reports of $13 billion a year. When asked by the Bg2 Pod about revenue estimates exceeding $100 billion a year by 2028 or 2029, Altman responded: “How about ‘27?” Nvidia makes history as the first-ever company worth $5 trillion. Last week, AI chipmaker Nvidia officially became the world’s first company to achieve a market capitalization north of $5 trillion, pulling ahead of tech rivals like Microsoft and Apple, who are each worth close to $4 trillion. The latest stock market gains came after Nvidia’s GTC developer conference, where CEO Jensen Huang disclosed that the company had secured more than $500 billion in orders for its AI chips through the end of next year. Major new deals that have been unveiled the past several days have included partnerships with Eli Lilly, Uber Technologies, and Johnson & Johnson. Bloomberg reports that Nvidia is now larger than six of the 11 sectors in the S&P 500 index and the entire value of equity markets of most countries. Hiring spree: AI companies are seeking more “forward-deployed engineers.” This year, job advertisements have been soaring for a new specialist software developer who can write code, but also is adept at talking to customers. By hiring more forward-deployed engineers, AI hyperscalers like Anthropic, OpenAI, and Cohere would aim to make their AI models more specialized and useful for companies, thus generating bigger contracts and more revenue. The Financial Times reports that job advertisements for these roles have increased more than 800% between January and September of 2025, citing data from the jobs platform Indeed. Firms that prioritize AI governance are also generating stronger returns from their investments. A recent EY survey of 975 C-suite leaders across 21 countries found that while nearly every company had already suffered financial losses from AI-related incidents—with average damages “conservatively” exceeding $4.4 million—the enterprises that had stronger governance measures like real-time monitoring and oversight committees were seeing far fewer damages. And notably, those organizations are also seeing stronger returns from their AI investments: 34% more likely to see improvements in revenue growth and 65% more likely to produce cost savings. “When I look at that data, what it tells me is that those companies are taking AI more seriously,” says Joe Depa, EY’s global chief innovation officer. “That means they’re likely training and talking about how to leverage AI, both ethically, but also from a productivity standpoint.” The survey also found that members of the C-suite may still be struggling to keep up with the rapid pace of change as AI technologies advance. On average, when asked to identify the appropriate controls against five AI-related risks, including hallucinations and bias, only 12% of the C-suite respondents answered correctly. CTOs and CIOs did the best (26% and 24%, respectively), while chief operating officers (6%) and chief marketing officers (3%) were at the bottom of the list.

Title: Here's What Wall Street Analysts Are Saying About AMD's Earnings

Advanced Micro Devices investors have become harder to impress. The chipmaker yesterday posted record quarterly results and an upbeat outlook on surging demand for its data center chips—and its stock has hardly budged. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares were up about 2%, near $255, in recent trading as the broader tech sector looked to rebound from yesterday's sell-off. Here's a roundup of what Wall Street analysts said about AMD after last night's results. This year's big stock gains for chipmakers like AMD have given rise to worries about an AI bubble. The weak reaction to AMD's strong results could underscore growing uncertainty around the sector—or, at least, the rich valuations carried by stocks in it. Analysts at Oppenheimer, who maintained a neutral rating, voiced some concerns about AMD's reputation as a "second horse supplier" to AI chip leader Nvidia (NVDA), preferring to stay on the sidelines while waiting to see more from AMD's ability to compete with its AI strategy. Most Wall Street analysts, however, remain bullish on the chipmaker's stock amid expectations of growing market share for AMD. Jefferies and HSBC analysts, who have "buy" or equivalent ratings for the stock and $300 price targets, said they came away from Tuesday's results convinced of AMD's potential for more AI-driven growth. HSBC called AMD's recent deal with OpenAI a "game changing" development. Wedbush, which boosted its target to $290 from $270, said it is looking forward to an Analyst Day event next Tuesday for more color on its roadmap. While Wall Street's targets and ratings may be in flux, the mean price target on AMD's shares is around $275 based on Visible Alpha data and Investopedia calculations. About twice as many analysts have "buy" ratings as have "holds," with no bearish ratings currently tracked by the service. Shares of AMD have more than doubled in 2025 so far, with much of its recent gains coming in the wake of the OpenAI deal announced last month.

Title: 4 signs that investors are rethinking the red-hot AI trade

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Investors hit the brakes on the AI trade this week. The market doesn't seem as confident about AI as it once was, evidenced by the sell-off that tore through the sector on Tuesday. Top leaders in the AI sector — including Nvidia, Meta, and Palantir — all tumbled, thanks largely to concerns that tech stocks have gone too far, too fast after years of stellar returns. The hype, in other words, doesn't seem as limitless as it did just a few weeks ago. Here were the warning signs the AI trade got from investors this week: Michael Burry broke a long period of silence to deliver a warning. After a two-year hiatus from social media, the famed "Big Short" investor made a cryptic post on X, where he occasionally issues warnings about the market and the economy to his followers. "Sometimes, we see bubbles," Burry wrote this week. "Sometimes, there is something to do about it. Sometimes, the only winning move is not to play." Burry's firm, Scion Asset Management, also placed bets against AI titans Palantir and Nvidia in the last quarter, according to a regulatory filing on Monday. "Investors are sitting on huge stock market gains, and some might have taken profits today, especially in AI-related stocks, in response to Burry's filing news," Ed Yardeni, the president of Yardeni Research, wrote in a note. Burry, who was one of the investors to call the housing bust ahead of the 2008 crisis, has a reputation for his persistently bearish takes on markets. In recent years, he's sounded the alarm about a potential stock crash and a recession, battling against consensus forecasts of continued strength and more gains ahead for stocks. Investors have begun paying attention to the elephant in the room: tech stocks have risent to meteoric valuations. That's been a concern in the market for years, but the discussion around whether some firms in the AI space are overvalued seemed to be front and center this week as investors surveyed the market after a breathless three-year rally since the debut of ChatGPT. Here were some of the biggest declines in the tech sector since the closing bell on Friday: Nvidia: -1.08% Palantir: -8.35% AMD: -2.42% Broadcom: -1.85% Meta: -1.89% Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon fanned valuation concerns when he speculated that the market could be heading toward a correction this week. "It's likely there'll be a 10 to 20% drawdown in equity markets sometime in the next 12 to 24 months," he said, speaking at the Financial Leaders' Investment Summit in Hong Kong. "We should also welcome the possibility that there would be drawdowns, 10 to 15% drawdowns that are not driven by some sort of macro cliff effect," Ted Pick, the CEO of Morgan Stanley, also said at the event. The decline in Palantir stock on Tuesday marked a significant moment in the debate over valuations. The firm beat on earnings and revenue in the third quarter, reporting $1.18 billion in revenue for the last three-month period, ahead of the expected $1.09 billion. Despite the upbeat results and confident guidance, the stock tanked 8% after the report, as investors decided that after a blistering rally in 2025, the stock looked too rich. "All of a sudden, we are starting to see some Tech heavyweights fail to live up to investor expectations," David Rosenberg, the president of Rosenberg Research, wrote in a client note. "Even a company like Palantir has seen its share price hammered, even though its results did top expectations — nosebleed valuations got in the way." Meta stock has declined after the tech giant reported earnings and said it would double down on capex spending. Last week, the Facebook parent said it could spend $70 billion to $72 billion this year on AI capex, up from its prior guidance of $66 billion to $72 billion. It also said capex was expected to increase in 2026. Shares of Meta dropped as much as 14% on Thursday in a sign that investors are growing skeptical over the huge amounts of cash being thrown on AI. Its stock has continued to decline, trading 1.2% lower from Friday's close. Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Apple are on track to spend around $349 billion on capex this year, according to Business Insider's latest analysis of company statements. "It's a yellow flag," Peter Berezin, the chief market strategist at BCA Research, told BI of the sell-off in Meta. "If you don't get that best-case scenario, you're going to have pretty significant write-offs. Jump to

Stocks rose on Wall Street Wednesday as more U.S. companies turn in their latest quarterly reports and several economic updates shed some light on the U.S. economy. The S&P 500 rose 0.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 62 points, or 0.1%, as of 11:35 a.m. Eastern time. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.8%. The gains mark a reversal from the prior day’s dip as big technology stocks once again lead the broader market. Nvidia rose 1.6% and Google’s parent, Alphabet, jumped 2.4%. Their huge values give them outsized influence over the market. Several big industrial companies also helped lift the market. Companies from a broad spectrum of industries reported their latest financial results and gave updated forecasts. McDonald’s rose 2% after reporting that its sales benefited from the return of its popular Snack Wraps in the third quarter. International Flavors & Fragrances jumped 4.7% after beating Wall Street’s latest quarterly profit forecasts. On the losing side, Taser maker Axon Enterprise slumped 11.9% after forecasting weaker profits than analysts were expecting. Live Nation Entertainment fell 7.8% after its latest results fell short of analysts’ forecasts. The latest round of earnings offers Wall Street a source of information on consumers, businesses and the economy that is otherwise lacking amid the government shutdown. Important monthly updates on inflation and employment have ceased, leaving investors, economists and the Federal Reserve without a fuller picture of the economy. There are still several informative private economic updates that Wall Street can review. A monthly report from ADP showed that private payrolls rose more than expected in October. The report offers a partial glimpse into the job market, which has been generally weakening and raising broader concerns about economic growth. The services sector, which is the largest part of the U.S. economy, expanded in October more than Wall Street expected, according to the Institute for Supply Management. The report shows that while overall business activity grew, employment was still contracting. “The survey provides a reassuring sign that economic growth persisted in October despite the government shutdown,” Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, wrote in a note to investors. A weaker job market remains a big concern for the Fed. The central bank cut its benchmark rate for the second time this year at its most recent meeting, in part to help bolster the economy amid a weakening job market. Fed Chair Jerome Powell and several other Fed officials have expressed concerns about more rate cuts, as inflation remains stubbornly high and could be fueled by lowering rates. The mix of a weaker job market and hot inflation leaves the Fed in a tough position. “For Fed watchers, this ADP report should make it clear that a December rate cut is now in play,” said Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group, in a note to investors. “We are nearing stall speed in the labor market, and that will get the Fed’s attention.” Wall Street has tempered its expectations for another interest rate cut in December. Investors are now forecasting a 65% chance that the Fed will cut interest rates, according to CME FedWatch. That’s down from a 90% chance just prior to the previous rate cut. Treasury yields rose in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.15% from 4.09% late Tuesday. The yield on the two-year Treasury rose to 3.62% from 3.58% late Tuesday. European markets gained ground and Asian markets closed mostly lower. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Happy Holidays: IBM Announces Layoffs Affecting Thousands of Employees Before Year's End

IBM is set to cut thousands of jobs in November and December as part of a workforce rebalancing strategy aimed at repositioning the company in the era of AI. The cuts come just months after the company claimed it is “focused on American jobs” with plans to invest in manufacturing. The Wall Street Journal reports that IBM has announced that it will lay off a small percentage of its global workforce before the end of the year. The tech giant, which employed around 270,000 people worldwide at the end of 2024, did not provide an exact figure for the number of employees affected by the cuts. Even a one percent reduction in staff would impact almost 3,000 white-collar professionals. An IBM spokesman stated, “IBM’s workforce strategy is driven by having the right people with the right skills to do the work our clients need. We routinely review our workforce through this lens and at times rebalance accordingly.” IBM joins a growing list of companies, including Amazon, UPS, and Target, that have recently announced significant layoffs. These cuts are largely driven by a shift in corporate strategy towards embracing AI tools and emphasizing efficiency among employees. As AI continues to advance, many companies are investing heavily in building out the necessary infrastructure, such as data centers, to support these technologies. The layoffs at IBM come at a time when the company is striving to establish itself as a leader in the development of quantum computing. In competition with tech giants like Google and Microsoft, as well as numerous startups, IBM is working on larger clusters of quantum chips that it believes will enable large-scale computing within the next five years. Breitbart News previously reported that IBM claimed to be “focused on American jobs and manufacturing” when it announced a $150 billion investment over the next five years: IBM revealed in a Monday press release that it “plans to invest $150 billion in America over the next five years to fuel the economy and to accelerate its role as the global leader in computing.” “This includes an investment of more than $30 billion in research and development to advance and continue IBM’s American manufacturing of mainframe and quantum computers,” the company said. IBM CEO and Chairman Arvind Krishna added, “Technology doesn’t just build the future — it defines it.” IBM CEO Arvind Krishna recently shared that the company has already used AI agents to replace the work of several hundred human resources employees. This move has allowed the company to redirect resources towards hiring more programmers and salespeople, highlighting the potential of AI to streamline certain business processes and enable strategic workforce allocation.

U.S.-listed shares of Novo Nordisk (NVO) fell after the drugmaker scaled back its outlook, citing disappointing demand for its GLP-1 weight loss and diabetes drugs as competition in the sector increases. Novo Nordisk, the company behind Wegovy and Ozempic, posted third-quarter adjusted earnings per share of DK4.50 ($0.69), DK20 ($0.03) below the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha. Revenue was up 5.1% to DK74.98 billion ($11.53 billion), also short of forecasts. Novo Nordisk’s weaker results indicate mounting pressure in the weight-loss drug market that it once dominated. The maker of Ozempic and Wegovy is facing tougher competition, slower demand, and pricing pressures—and has now cut its full-year outlook for the fourth time in 2025. Wegovy sales rose 18% to DK20.35 billion ($3.13 billion), below expectations. Ozempic sales added 3% to DK30.74 billion ($4.73 billion), better than anticipated. The company now sees full-year operating profit growth of 4% to 7%, and sales of 8% to 11%. The previous outlook was for operating profit to gain 4% to 20% and sales to advance 8% to 14%. It said the change “reflects lowered growth expectations for Novo Nordisk's GLP-1 treatments within diabetes and obesity.” It's the fourth time the company narrowed its guidance this year. U.S.-listed shares of Novo Nordisk have lost about 46% of their value this year. The shares were recently off about 4%. Read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here.

Preston Fore is a reporter on Fortune's Success team. Layoffs are sweeping the corporate world as companies restructure around AI and automation. From Amazon to Target, major employers are slashing thousands of jobs as they race to restructure around automation and efficiency. On Tuesday, IBM became the latest company to announce it would cut thousands of workers by the end of the year as it shifts focus to high-growth software and AI areas. And for Gen Z the news might hit especially hard. Just last week, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna had positioned himself as a rare optimist amid widespread job cuts, pledging that his company would increase hiring among recent college graduates. “People are talking about either layoffs or freezing hiring, but I actually want to say that we are the opposite,” Krishna told CNN last week. “I expect we are probably going to hire more people out of college over the next 12 months than we have in the past few years, so you’re going to see that.” Krishna acknowledged that automation would inevitably lead to some reductions but maintained that “on the net mix, it’s a plus for us.” An IBM spokesperson told Fortune that the latest round of layoffs would impact a “low single-digit percentage” of the company’s global workforce. And, when combined with new hiring, it would leave the company’s U.S. headcount roughly flat. IBM did not specify how many workers would be affected or which departments would be hit. The company employed about 270,000 people at the end of 2024, meaning even a 1% cut in the workforce could affect some 2,700 workers. “IBM’s workforce strategy is driven by having the right people with the right skills to do the work our clients need,” the spokesperson added. “We routinely review our workforce through this lens and at times rebalance accordingly.” Although it’s unclear which teams—or generations—will feel the blunt effects of the cuts, entry-level roles have borne some of the biggest impact from AI so far. Researchers at Harvard University found that junior employment has declined sharply at firms adopting AI. For professionals—whether they’re trying to break into the job market or rebound from a layoff—finding a job can feel like an uphill battle. After all, job postings have been on a gradual decline since their peak in March 2022, according to data from the Federal Reserve. Krishna’s advice? Focus on developing the right skills for the AI age. “Skills of people are really important,” he told CNN. “We need skills in AI. We need skills in quantum. We need skills that our clients feel really good about technology being deployed in their environment.” Hiring experts echo that view, saying that firms across industries are looking for candidates with AI experience—especially those familiar with the tools already in use internally. “Companies would rather hire a candidate who has hands-on experience with a particular tool they are implementing if they have the ability and interest to train up on other skills,” Alyssa Cook, a senior managing consultant at hiring and staffing firm Beacon Hill, previously told Fortune. A report released by Microsoft and LinkedIn last year found that 71% of leaders are more likely to hire a less experienced candidate with AI skills, as compared to a more experienced one without them.

Title: Samsung is restocking Galaxy XR controllers, but you'll have to act fast

Restock emails showing up for folks in the U.S. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Enjoy our content? Make sure to set Android Central as a preferred source in Google Search, and find out why you should so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more. The Galaxy XR headset launched just a few weeks ago in the US and South Korea with a $1,800 price tag. Samsung also launched a pair of controllers for its XR headset for an additional $250 or $175. However, shortly after the headset went live, these controllers were sold out due to high demand in the U.S. The good news is that the Korean OEM has been busy restocking the controllers for the past few days. Considering people who've added the item to their wishlist or clicked on the "Notify me" button on Samsung's website are receiving emails stating that the" Galaxy XR controllers are back in stock." The email further stated that "We have good news. An item you asked us to track is back in stock. Act fast, supplies are still limited." Samsung appears to be working on bringing back these popular controllers, but it seems like only select individuals in the U.S. have so far received restock notifications, while Samsung's official website still says these controllers are currently out of stock, with a "It’s not you. It’s us. We can’t make them fast enough." While Samsung has been clear that the Galaxy XR headset's sole purpose isn't just gaming, like the Meta Quest series. However, without these controllers, it would be tough to dive into more immersive VR games or PC-VR content, as these games simply won't work without them. The controllers are supposedly very ergonomic and are equipped with 6 DoF tracking technology and analog sticks, which deliver precise interactions in the 3D space for enhanced experiences. The Galaxy XR headset could be used for other things like mixed-reality experiences, productivity tools, or even entertainment. This is definitely a setback as users won't be able to experience the headset's other core functionality. For now, gaming enthusiasts have to wait it out and make do by operating the Galaxy XR with a mix of hand gestures, eye-tracking, and voice commands powered by Samsung and Google’s collaborative software, as the company plays catch up.

Lower courts have sided against the president, and the nation's highest court will decide the legality of these import taxes, enacted under emergency powers. A decision is expected by July.

Title: Wall Street holds steady as earnings reports flow in

By DAMIAN J. TROISE, AP Business Writer NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks gained ground on Wall Street Wednesday following several upbeat economic updates and a steady flow of quarterly reports from U.S. companies. The gains were broad and marked a reversal from the prior day’s dip. Much of the market’s push and pull came from the technology sector, where several companies with huge values have an outsized influence over the market. Google’s parent, Alphabet, jumped 2.4%, Broadcom rose 2%, and Facebook parent Meta Platforms rose 1.4%. They helped lead the way higher for the broader market. Their gains also helped counter losses from a few technology behemoths, including Nvidia and Microsoft. Overall The S&P 500 rose 24.74 points, or 0.4% to 6,796.29. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 225.76 points, or 0.5%, to 47,311. The Nasdaq composite rose 151.16 points, or 0.6%, to 23,499.80. Company earnings and forecasts were once again a big focus for Wall Street, with results coming from a broad spectrum of industries. McDonald’s rose 2.2% after reporting that its sales benefited from the return of its popular Snack Wraps in the third quarter. International Flavors & Fragrances jumped 4.1% after beating Wall Street’s latest quarterly profit forecasts. On the losing side, Taser maker Axon Enterprise slumped 9.4% after forecasting weaker profits than analysts were expecting. Live Nation Entertainment fell 10.6% after its latest results fell short of analysts’ forecasts. The latest round of earnings offers Wall Street a source of information on consumers, businesses and the economy that is otherwise lacking amid the government shutdown. Important monthly updates on inflation and employment have ceased, leaving investors, economists and the Federal Reserve without a fuller picture of the economy. There are still several informative private economic updates that Wall Street can review. A monthly report from ADP showed that private payrolls rose more than expected in October. The report offers a partial glimpse into the job market, which has been generally weakening and raising broader concerns about economic growth. The services sector, which is the largest part of the U.S. economy, expanded in October more than Wall Street expected, according to the Institute for Supply Management. The report shows that while overall business activity grew, employment was still contracting. “The survey provides a reassuring sign that economic growth persisted in October despite the government shutdown,” Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, wrote in a note to investors. A weaker job market remains a big concern for the Fed. The central bank cut its benchmark rate for the second time this year at its most recent meeting, in part to help bolster the economy amid a weakening job market. Lower interest rates can make a wide range of loans and credit less expensive, potentially promoting economic growth. But, lower rates can also add fuel to inflation, which could stunt economic growth. Fed Chair Jerome Powell and several other Fed officials have expressed concerns about more rate cuts, as inflation remains stubbornly above the central bank’s target of 2%. Consumer prices rose 3% in September. The mix of a weaker job market and hot inflation leaves the Fed in a tough position. “For Fed watchers, this ADP report should make it clear that a December rate cut is now in play,” said Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group, in a note to investors. “We are nearing stall speed in the labor market, and that will get the Fed’s attention.” Wall Street has tempered its expectations for another interest rate cut in December. Investors are now forecasting a 63% chance that the Fed will cut interest rates, according to CME FedWatch. That’s down from a 90% chance just prior to the previous rate cut. The threat of tariffs also continues to hang over consumers and businesses. President Donald Trump’s trade war with China, Canada and many other nations has been unpredictable. The full impact of higher prices is difficult to forecast because of constant shifts in policy. The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday about the legality of the sweeping tariffs. Treasury yields rose in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.16% from 4.09% late Tuesday. The yield on the two-year Treasury rose to 3.63% from 3.58% late Tuesday. European markets gained ground and Asian markets closed mostly lower.

Title: Billionaire Winners And Losers In Tuesday’s Elections

BySara Dorn, Forbes Staff. Democrats swept the major elections Tuesday, delivering a blow to billionaires who mostly funded Republican campaigns—particularly in New York City, where more than 26 billionaires donated to campaigns against Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani. In addition to Mamdani, a democratic socialist and New York Assembly member, Democratic former Rep. Abigail Spanberger beat Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears to win the Virginia gubernatorial race, Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill defeated Republican Jack Ciattarelli in the New Jersey gubernatorial race, and California voters approved a new congressional map drawn by Democrats that will add five Democratic-leaning seats. At least 26 billionaires spent at least $27 million between March and Oct. 22 on groups campaigning against Mamdani, Forbes reported previously: At least several billionaires donated in support of Earle-Sears: In New Jersey, Reebok CEO Paul Fireman donated in support of Ciattarelli. Billionaire Charles Munger Jr. donated $30 million to defeat the California ballot initiative. Some business leaders suggested they were open to working with Mamdani, who has said billionaires should not exist and campaigned against wealth inequality. Ackman, who has repeatedly criticized Mamdani throughout his campaign, congratulated him in a post on X late Tuesday and said in a subsequent post Wednesday, “while I did not support Mamdani for mayor and have concerns about the unintended and negative consequences of his policies, I want to do everything I can to help NYC regardless of who are mayor is.” BlackRock cofounder Ralph Schlosstein told Bloomberg “I’m certainly not a socialist . . . I’m not going anywhere, whoever the mayor is. I’m going to do whatever I can to help him be successful.” Citigroup Inc. CEO Jane Fraser told Bloomberg “we hope to work with the Mayor-elect on making the city an even better place for our people and clients to live and work.” Billionaire developer Stephen Ross told The New York Times “I think a lot of business leaders are going to ask themselves where they can be successful considering new laws and policies they may come up against,” suggesting they could move out of New York City. Mamdani won the race when it was called by the Associated Press with 50.5% of votes, ahead of independent candidate, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo (41.4%) and Republican Curtis Sliwa (7.3%). In Virginia, Spanberger won 55% of the vote and Earle-Sears polled at 45% when the race was called. Sherrill won 57% of the vote, ahead of Ciatterelli with 43%. Democrats’ sweep is widely viewed as a rebuke on President Donald Trump’s aggressive second-term agenda and could help re-energize Democrats ahead of next year’s midterm elections.

Title: Michael Burry is back with two bets against Nvidia and Palantir

Time Published: 2025-11-05T14:38:27Z

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Michael Burry, the famed investor behind “The Big Short,” is betting artificial intelligence is more of a bubble than a revolution. Burry’s fund, Scion Asset Management, disclosed on Monday that it bought puts — bets that share prices will fall — on two stars of the AI wave: Nvidia (NVDA) and Palantir (PLTR). Scion bought roughly $187.6 million in puts on Nvidia and $912 million in puts on Palantir, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Burry is known for his prophetic call that the US housing market would collapse in 2008. He was profiled in the 2010 book “The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine,” by Michael Lewis, and portrayed by Christian Bale in the 2015 film adaptation. Most companies aren’t seeing a return on AI investments. This tech CEO wants to change that Now Burry is betting against the hottest AI stocks on the market at a time when concerns are mounting about a bubble. Tech and AI stocks have carried the market in recent months. The S&P 500, which is increasingly concentrated in tech companies, is trading at historically expensive levels. Meanwhile, the circular financing of AI deals has raised eyebrows on Wall Street, with many tech companies entwined in a massive web of deals with each other. Some investors are also skeptical whether future profit growth will continue to justify the enormous amounts of spending taking place. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite tumbled 2.04% on Tuesday, posting its worst day since August. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 fell 1.17%. Burry made a splash among investors on Thursday, when he posted on X for the first time since 2023. In his post, he shared a photo of Bale portraying him in “The Big Short” and wrote: “Sometimes, we see bubbles. Sometimes, there is something to do about it. Sometimes, the only winning move is not to play.” Four days later, Burry’s fund disclosed its bearish positions in Nvidia and Palantir. The SEC filings are for the third quarter of this year. Scion Asset Management did not respond to a request for comment. Angelo Zino, a tech analyst at CFRA Research, said a pullback in tech stocks was overdue, given how far they have rallied in recent months. He said Burry’s comments likely exacerbated concerns. Burry has made public calls about the market in the years since “The Big Short.” He has not always been correct. The hedge fund manager in January 2023 infamously posted on X, “Sell,” before posting two months later, “I was wrong to say sell.” Nonetheless, his words carry weight on Wall Street. Sometimes, we see bubbles.Sometimes, there is something to do about it.Sometimes, the only winning move is not to play. pic.twitter.com/xNBSvjGgvs Burry’s return to social media comes at a time when investors have voiced concerns about expensive valuations, a market concentrated on a handful of large companies and rising investor expectations. For example, Palantir beat Wall Street forecasts in earnings reported Monday. Yet it wasn’t enough to impress traders after a series of strong earnings results. On Tuesday, its shares tumbled 7.95% — their worst day since August. Palantir was the top performing stock in the S&P 500 in 2024 and is in the top five performing stocks this year. Its shares are still up 152% this year. The company’s earnings results on Monday were “stellar,” according to CFRA Research’s Zino, but the company’s valuation — a measure of how pricey it is — “is a bit extreme.” Why the Goldman Sachs CEO isn’t buying the AI jobs freakout “Despite the great results, when you coincide that with the comments that Michael Burry made and everybody already talking about concerns about an AI bubble, I think the combination of those factors really helped drive a pullback in the shares, the broader tech index and as a result the broader markets,” Zino said. “We’re not overly concerned about the pullback, but I would say it’s one of those situations where you’ve got to keep an eye on it.” Meanwhile, Nvidia shares fell 3.96% on Tuesday. Shares are still up 48% this year. Alex Karp, CEO at Palantir, told CNBC on Tuesday that people betting against the company — including Burry — are “crazy.” “When I hear short sellers attacking what I believe is clearly the most important software company in America, therefore in the world, in terms of our impact, … it just is super triggering,” Karp said. “It’s crazy motivating,” Karp said. “Every time they short us, we are just like tripling down on getting the better numbers, in part honestly, to make them poorer.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 The futures are trading modestly higher as we reach the midpoint of the trading week, following a risk-off day on Tuesday that saw all major indices decline. The NASDAQ led the sell-off, closing over 2% lower, sparked by a dramatic drop in Palantir, despite the company posting results and guidance that beat expectations. When the closing bell finally rang, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average had clawed back some of their losses, closing at 6771 and 47,085, respectively, while the NASDAQ closed at 23,348. Big Short author Michael Burry tossed some gas on the Tuesday dumpster fire by announcing that he was long puts on Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA). Market pundits cited continued concerns about AI valuation as the reason for the selling. Still, after multiple top Wall Street bankers, such as David Solomon and Jamie Dimon, have warned, the market is likely ahead of itself following a three-year rally. The “Buy the Dip” crowd tried to boost the market early in the day, but was met with even more selling by the close. As would be expected, yields across the Treasury curve plunged as investors and traders rushed to the safe-haven security of U.S. government debt. The benchmark 10-year bond closed the day at 4.0% while the 30-year long bond was last seen at 4.67%. One thing is for sure: with job openings shrinking to the lowest level since 2021, expectations for a December rate cut may grab a tailwind this week. Numerous Fed Governors have maintained that the current rate is too restrictive, and the job data, combined with other economic news, may soon prove them correct. Brent Crude and West Texas Intermediate both finished the day lower, as the ripple effect from the equity market sell-off, along with some chatter that the Russian sanctions may not be as severe as initially thought by traders, contributed to the decline. The big winner again was the Natural Gas complex, where spot prices finished the day up 1.15% at $4.31. We have maintained for some time at 24/7 Wall St. that the energy trade for the rest of 2025 and 2026 may very well be in the Natural Gas complex, as power demands for Data Centers driving AI cloud computing may fall into the laps of the top companies in that sector. Spot gold was another victim of the sell-off. While bullion is regarded as one of the ultimate safe havens, the massive rally over the last couple of years has likely prompted many hedge funds to take profits, especially as we are less than two months from the end of the trading year. The final print for Gold on Tuesday came in at $3930, down 1.76%. It’s worth noting that Gold was trading at $4375 just two weeks ago. Silver followed suit, closing down over 2% at $47.04. The heavy selling of the cryptocurrency leaders remains one of the big stories across Wall Street, as Bitcoin fell 5% to trade below the $100,000 level for the first time since June. The spot price, reported late Tuesday, was $99,584. Ethereum suffered a similar fate, finishing the day down almost 13%, and was seen late Tuesday at $ 3,137. Wall Street analysts cited the broad “risk-off” sentiment among investors driven by macroeconomic concerns, lowered expectations for a December Federal Reserve interest rate cut, and massive selling pressure from large long-term holders. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports daily to identify new investment ideas for both investors and traders. Some of these daily analyst calls cover stocks to buy. Other calls cover stocks to sell or avoid. Remember that no single analyst call should ever be used as a basis to buy or sell a stock.

Title: Wall Street execs say the AI stocks dominating the market will soon be split into winners and losers

Brands had a great day on Tuesday as the rest of the market tumbled, soaring 7% after saying it might offload Pizza Hut. Addition by subtraction! Rundown But first, it's time to separate the haves from have-nots. Love Business Insider? Log into Google and make us a preferred source. Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up now Market musings Stock valuations — seen by many as flying too close to the sun — took a hit on Tuesday after a chorus of bank execs spoke up to throw their weight behind that view. Chief among them were Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick and Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon. Major indexes ended the day firmly in the red, led lower by the same AI-affiliated tech names largely responsible for recent records. While jarring, this commentary was hardly surprising. The execs were simply pointing out an age-old market truism: sometimes stocks have to go down and reset before continuing their ascent. Instead, the most interesting takeaway came from what Pick said about 2026, namely that there will be more dispersion. In simpler terms, the Morgan Stanley chief is saying investors will eventually start separating the wheat from the chaff. Higher-quality companies with strong balance sheets and superior financials will reign supreme, leaving the have-nots in the dust. A sign of how this could play out in AI happened last week, when Meta's stock price took it on the chin after the company pledged to boost capex spending beyond already-lofty levels in 2026. Compare that to the relatively mild reaction in Microsoft shares, despite them saying basically the same thing. Amazon is still pouring money into AI as well, and its stock was up double digits on earnings. A main reason? Meta is far less diversified than its AI-focused peers. It doesn't have a legacy cash-cow business like software or cloud computing to insulate it from the twists and turns of the AI trade. Simply put, the companies with the most air-tight financial situations outperform when things get chaotic. Look at the dot-com bubble for a more extreme example. Countless companies went belly-up, unable to deliver on the market's valuation hype. But an elite group of high-quality companies stayed the course and emerged from the wreckage: Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Cisco, and Intel, just to name a handful. That's dispersion in action. So how can you play the theme in your own portfolio? Lisa Shalett, CIO of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, recently made some recommendations for quality-seeking investors wary of market bifurcation: Speculative booms are all fun and games until they're suddenly not. Making these shifts can help you proactively play defense against a valuation-driven reckoning. Bitcoin has tumbled from all-time highs reached in early October, falling as much as 20% from its peak to below $100,000 on Tuesday. It was the first time since June that the formerly red-hot crypto fell beneath the six-figure threshold. The drop can be attributed to two main things. First, there was a historic unwinding of bitcoin long positions on Oct. 10 that saw investors liquidate $19 billion across exchanges in less than 24 hours. That was an inflection point of sorts. Second, it's suffered from an overall risk-off move that was also seen in stocks on Tuesday. Bitcoin has traded as a risk asset for months, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell's non-committal approach to a December rate cut has spooked investors. This chart puts the valuation worries outlined above in context. As megacap stocks have made up a growing percentage of the S&P 500, their sales have not kept pace. In the name of preparing for increased market dispersion, it might be a good idea for investors to identify which companies have actually seen revenue keep rising alongside their share prices. This is exactly the type of high-quality attribute Morgan Stanley has recommended traders rotate into. Culture confidential Business Insider's Will Edwards spotlights a hot trend dominating Wall Street and the finance industry. If there's one piece of clothing that's become synonymous with the finance industry, it's the vest. Stroll around Manhattan at lunchtime on any given weekday, and you'll see swarms of sleeveless coats in all their glory. Their ubiquity earned a nickname years ago: the Midtown uniform. It's become an internet meme, the first item in a finance bro starter pack, and eyeroll fodder for hipsters who dislike all things basic. So, with the vest way past the peak of its hype cycle, why are they still such a staple on Wall Street? I hit the streets to find out. One common reason I heard is that bankers simply like to flex — not necessarily their visible arms, but where they work — as many firms give out branded vests. "It's an earned status thing. You put in a lot of work to get to equity research for your team, to get to the PM role for a team, to be able to get to that said firm," one analyst told me. "That's why you wear it." There's also an element of fitting in. Wearing a vest is a shorthand signal that you're part of the club. That's why people even wear them in the office, out of the elements, said Jonathan Grossman, who is two years into working at UBS. "They want to look cool," he said. "They want to look part of the act." Those in finance-adjacent industries like commercial real estate have also started wearing vests. Despite its casual nature, a vest lends you a degree of credibility with financial industry clients, said Laz Rabanales, who works at Okada & Company. "I'm not a banker, I'm a commercial real-estate agent, and I kind of want to appeal to that industry," Rabanales said. "When you're dressed as that person, then they'll most likely want to talk with you and work with you." But there's not always a deeper meaning. As one banker succinctly explained: "It's cold out." — Will Edwards Joe Ciolli, executive editor and anchor, in Chicago. Akin Oyedele, deputy editor, in New York.

Title: What Amazon’s Corporate Layoffs Signal for IT Leaders
URL: https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/feature/What-Amazons-Corporate-Layoffs-Signal-for-IT-Leaders
Time Published: 2025-11-05T11:06:00Z

Getty Images/iStockphoto On October 28, 2025, Amazon announced 14,000 corporate job cuts marking the company's largest single-announcement layoff at the time. Unlike previous cuts framed around economic uncertainty, this corporate workforce restructuring was largely tied to AI-related transformation. The October Amazon layoffs span business units including AWS, Devices, Prime Video, advertising, logistics and HR. This follows broader tech industry AI focused restructuring, as companies like Salesforce and Microsoft are also among the big names reducing headcount in 2025. For IT leaders, the layoffs are a cause for concern as the impact of AI begins to manifest on the future of work and what it all means for digital transformation strategy. Amazon framed the layoffs around reducing bureaucracy, flattening organizational layers and shifting resources to AI infrastructure investments. Amazon senior vice president Beth Galetti wrote in a statement that this generation of AI is "the most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet" and emphasized that the company needs to be organized more leanly with fewer layers. CEO Andy Jassy warned employees in a June 2025 memo that the company would need fewer people doing some jobs as AI capabilities expanded. The connection between AI productivity and these job cuts is tenuous at best according to analysts. Amazon's job cuts are absolutely not a leading indicator and any C-suite that treats it as one is making a serious strategic misreading, according to Nate Suda, senior director analyst at Gartner. "Amazon’s actions are not representative of a widespread AI-driven productivity gain," Suda said. "The data is unequivocal: nearly four in five layoffs in the first half of 2025 were entirely unrelated to AI, and less than 1% were a direct result of AI productivity." Amazon's move is what Gartner calls a strategic "talent remix." The company is repositioning full-time employees, not eliminating them because AI made their roles obsolete. "These layoffs are a strategic reallocation of human capital to cut costs in some areas to fund high-priority, capital-intensive AI and cloud-computing investments," Suda said. The goal is to free up resources to build and sell AI services, he explained. Dave Nicholson, chief advisor at Futurum, agreed with this interpretation. "Very few of these job cuts can be attributed directly to efficiencies gained by the use of artificial intelligence," Nicholson said. "This is a preemptive effort to reorganize in support of their efforts to deliver AI services to industry." Chris Campbell, CIO at DeVry University, has watched budgets move from generalist corporate roles toward data, automation and platform engineering. However, CIOs should interpret Amazon's corporate layoffs as a signal to recompose rather than one to cut. "The future IT organization will be smaller, sharper and more specialized, with teams that know how to work alongside AI rather than compete with it, " Campbell said. There are numerous implications that Amazon's corporate layoffs have for organizations' design, governance and risk. Governance implications. Removing management layers eliminates more than bureaucracy. When organizations flatten management layers in pursuit of organizational agility, they often focus on speed and efficiency while systematically underestimating governance and risk implications. AI changes no aspects of flattening organizations in a meaningful way when it comes to fundamental governance risks, according to Nicholson. When organizations demand more productivity from an individual, regardless of the tools that individual uses, they are at risk for over-subscription.Risk of over-lean structures. According to Suda, the single greatest AI-driven automation risk is what he calls "experience starvation." AI assistants empower senior staff to accomplish more tasks independently without needing junior staff, he said. While AI can augment this work, it cannot create the expertise of discernment that comes with experience. In effect, companies are automating the future leadership of their own organizations out of existence. Change management risk. The biggest mistake organizations risk making is cutting the experts who make automation work, according to Campbell. "When organizations lose subject-matter specialists who understand exceptions and edge cases, they end up automating broken processes," he said. Regulatory and compliance implications. For regulated industries, the implications are even more critical. Financial services, healthcare and other sectors with audit, security, privacy or oversight requirements cannot simply flatten structures without ensuring that accountability mechanisms remain intact. The question is not whether a leaner design is more efficient in theory, but whether it can maintain the institutional controls the risk profile demands Many organizations approach workforce planning in the AI era by asking which roles can be automated, which in turn can lead to workforce reductions. While intuitive, this question fundamentally oversimplifies the challenge. "The binary of automation versus people is a misframed trap that leads to failed initiatives," according to Suda. The strategic analysis must be at the process level, not the individual level. Task-level assessment methodologyIT leaders should focus on task automation rather than role automation, according to Mark Moccia, vice-president and research director at Forrester. He offered a practical framework for workforce assessment: Inventory tasks by automation suitability: First focus on tasks that are repeatable with low variability. Ones that require more human judgement and have more possible outcomes should be targeted last. Apply weighted criteria: Rank tasks by highest business benefit, lowest error risk and custom organizational priorities. Determine role implications: Only consider broad role changes after task-level analysis. Futurum's Nicholson offers a practical decision framework: "Would I bet my job on the output from this AI tool?" If the answer is no, the task still requires human judgment, oversight or validation. This simple test exposes the gap between AI capability and AI reliability. Many tools can produce outputs that look plausible but contain subtle errors, omissions or hallucinations. Deploying these tools without human oversight creates risk. Maintaining oversight requires retaining human expertise. Identifying AI roles for workforce planning Gartner's Suda has a sophisticated framework for workforce planning based on three distinct patterns organizations create with AI: Experience starvation: AI empowers senior experts to work independently, reducing mentorship opportunities. The strategy here is more on hiring avoidance rather than headcount reduction. Experience compression: AI upskills junior staff in low-to-mid complexity roles. This is the only pattern that can lead to the "reduce headcount" strategy. But this is proving highly elusive as Gartner sees it successfully done in fewer than 1% of cases. Experience redistribution: Pivoting to AI-centric business models, as Amazon demonstrates. The strategy here is to capture new markets rather than improving productivity. Reskilling and redeployment strategy For organizations pursuing workforce changes, reskilling becomes critical, according to Campbell. Organizations should emphasize internal mobility, retraining and retention of institutional memory. "Fix the process before you automate it," he said. "Keep the human expertise that helps automation learn and adapt. And use part of the savings to build capability: data quality, training, governance, so the gains actually stick." Reskilling efforts are lagging, Nicholson said. "The go-to answer seems to be to cut staff, see what happens, then patch the holes where necessary with AI-skilled labor," he said. "This reactive approach creates precisely the disruption and knowledge loss organizations can least afford." Budgeting for upskilling Investment in people skills must parallel investment in AI technology, according to Campbell. Roughly a third of an organization's AI program budget should go to people through upskilling, reskilling, change management and new hybrid roles like automation engineers and data translators. "When that share falls too low, adoption and governance tend to suffer," he said. Amazon's workforce restructuring is occurring alongside massive capital investments in computing infrastructure, data centers and AI capabilities. This apparent contradiction -- cutting corporate headcount while increasing technology spending -- reveals the fundamental economics of AI transformation. CapEx and OpEx trade-offs The shift from operational expenditure on people to capital expenditure on infrastructure changes cost structures fundamentally. Building computing, storage and network capabilities for enterprise AI requires substantial upfront investment. Traditional IT cost optimization assumes quick labor savings, but AI transformation may take years to materialize, if it materializes at all The key question is whether the organizations can quantitatively tie investments to business value achieved, Moccia said. "Is that the right use case that will bring the most value?" he said. "If not, focus investments elsewhere." Legacy architecture and modernization Organizations with decades of accumulated systems face stark choices. They can continue supporting legacy infrastructure with existing headcount, invest in modernization to enable AI and automation or attempt a hybrid approach that creates complexity and integration challenges. The Amazon corporate layoffs context suggests the company is betting on modern, AI-centric architecture over maintaining legacy systems. For most enterprises, the calculation differs. Legacy systems often contain decades of business logic that would be expensive and risky to rebuild. Operational risk and resilience Infrastructure must scale in tandem with organizational capability to manage it. When infrastructure scales faster than headcount, operational risk increases. CIOs must model scenarios where infrastructure demands grow faster than automation delivers labor savings. The gap creates pressure on remaining staff, which can lead to burnout, knowledge loss through attrition and reduced capacity to handle exceptions. Monitoring and observability become more critical as organizations become leaner. Automated systems must provide visibility into operations that previously relied on human monitoring. When issues arise, remaining staff need sophisticated tools to diagnose and remediate quickly. Budget planning: From staffing to infrastructure The strategic framework should start with business value and work backward to resource allocation. Starting with headcount reduction targets and hoping value follows inverts the logic. Amazon's infrastructure investments make strategic sense because the company builds products to sell. For most enterprises, the calculus differs. Infrastructure must enable better business outcomes, not simply replicate existing outcomes with different cost structures. "Fix the process before you automate it," Campbell said. "Keep the human expertise that helps automation learn and adapt. And use part of the savings to build capability—data quality, training, governance—so the gains actually stick." Sean Michael Kerner is an IT consultant, technology enthusiast and tinkerer.

PHOTO: ST FILE Navene Elangovan Published Nov 05, 2025, 06:50 PM Updated Nov 05, 2025, 09:15 PM SINGAPORE – Local shares ended lower on Nov 5, on the back of a sharp sell-off overnight of tech and artificial intelligence (AI) stocks on Wall Street. Ms Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo, said that AI valuations are under scrutiny, with investors questioning whether their growth can justify their lofty valuations. She added that markets could be entering a phase of valuation correction, rather than further multiple expansion. Key indexes in the region also closed lower. South Korea’s Kospi fell 2.9 per cent and Japan’s Nikkei slipped 2.5 per cent. Australia’s ASX 200 declined 0.1 per cent, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.1 per cent. In Singapore, the benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) fell 0.1 per cent or 5.6 points to close at 4,417.12. Meanwhile, the iEdge Singapore Next 50 Index lost 1.2 per cent or 16.92 points to 1,443.28. Yangzijiang Shipbuilding was the biggest decliner on the STI, falling 2.9 per cent or 10 cents to $3.33 after BlackRock sold 37.8 million shares. Local telco Singtel was the top blue-chip gainer, rising 0.7 per cent or three cents to $4.27. The three local banks ended mixed. OCBC Bank was up 0.2 per cent or three cents at $17.06, but UOB fell 0.1 per cent or five cents to $34.87. DBS Bank ended flat at $53.50. CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust remained the most actively traded counter on the STI by volume, with 50.2 million units worth $115.6 million traded. The counter fell 0.9 per cent or two cents to $2.31. Across the broader market, decliners outnumbered advancers 326 to 236, after 1.5 billion securities worth $2.1 billion changed hands. Ms Chanana from Saxo said that several scenarios could play out, depending on market conditions. For instance, if there are no major macroeconomic shocks, and the US Federal Reserve continues to hint at easing its monetary policy, the market could pull back modestly. However, rising yields or slowdown in AI spending could lead to a deeper decline in markets. “Investors may wish to balance opportunities with caution, recognising both potential upside and downside risks,” she said.

Title: He spent 31 years at Microsoft. Then he was laid off — and had to relearn how to job hunt.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Mike Kostersitz spent 31 years building a career at Microsoft. Then, at age 60, he had to do something he hadn't done in decades: Find a job. In May, Kostersitz, a principal product manager lead working on Azure, said his team had a meeting with a senior leader that seemed to go well. But the following morning, he noticed a high-priority meeting had been added to his calendar — and it didn't bring good news. "Me and 120 other anonymous faces got told our jobs had been eliminated," said Kostersitz, who lives in Washington state. His manager and two of his direct reports were also affected, along with about 6,000 others. Kostersitz said the layoff came as a total surprise, so he took the rest of the week to process it before beginning his job search. Over the last five months, he's landed interviews with a handful of companies, including Nvidia and Nike. He said there's one opportunity he's optimistic about, but that he still hasn't secured a job. Kostersitz is among thousands of Microsoft workers who've been laid off over the past year. A company spokesperson previously told Business Insider the company was focused on reducing management layers and streamlining processes. Microsoft isn't the only large tech company laying off workers. Amazon, Meta, and Google have also cut jobs. While overall layoffs remain low by historical standards, tech workers have been disproportionately affected, and a hiring slowdown across the industry has made it more challenging for many to secure new roles. In a challenging environment, some workers are considering options outside Big Tech — whether taking a role at a smaller company, starting a business, or retiring early. Kostersitz shared how he approached his first job search in decades. Business Insider has heard from dozens of tech workers about how corporate strategy shifts, layoffs, and hiring slowdowns have affected their careers.

Read more on the topic: In the days after his layoff, Kostersitz said his initial instinct wasn't to be angry with Microsoft. He'd spent more than half his life at the company and had built many connections there. However, he wished the news had been delivered more personally. "After 31 years, you would expect at least your manager or your VP or somebody to come to you and say, 'Hey Mike, this is going to happen and here is why.'" Still, Kostersitz said he was grateful for Microsoft's "55 and 15" policy, which allows long-tenured employees who are at least 55 years old and have spent at least 15 consecutive years at the company to have their stock grants continue vesting even after their employment ends. His Microsoft stock and savings gave him time to look for a new role, but he knew that cushion wouldn't last forever. Kostersitz said he and his wife can get by financially for about two years without tapping into their retirement accounts — thanks to savings, severance pay, and Microsoft stock. As he struggled to find work, Kostersitz said he began thinking about whether an early retirement could be an option. Now 60, he'd tentatively planned to retire around 67, though he was open to working longer. However, he concluded that retiring now would be financially challenging for him and his wife. "Technically, we could retire," he said. "Would it be a huge change of lifestyle? Absolutely." Given that he'd spent the prior three decades at Microsoft, Kostersitz initially felt like a fish out of water in the job market. Over the past two decades, he'd built teams — reviewing résumés, interviewing candidates, and making hiring decisions. But being on the other side of the table was unfamiliar. So his first step was to hire a career coach to help him build a résumé, update his LinkedIn, draft cover letters, and optimize his materials for applicant tracking systems. In addition to hiring a private coach, Kostersitz said Microsoft provided a career advisor as part of its layoff package. Kostersitz said the advisor recommended he "de-age" his résumé by removing roles from the 1980s and '90s. His LinkedIn profile now begins with work experience dating back to 2003. Kostersitz began applying for jobs, targeting director-level roles in product or program management. He applied to tech companies like Google and Apple, as well as to tech roles at non-tech firms like Nordstrom. He said he tried to secure referrals at some companies — and got one from a Nvidia employee that helped him land an interview — but said he struggled to get traction. Kostersitz said one challenge during interviews is figuring out which parts of his career to highlight. He said he frequently gets "tell me about a time when" questions, and while he has decades of experience, it's difficult to know which examples will resonate. "It's like, I have 30 years of stories for you. Which one do you want to hear?" he said. Despite these obstacles, Kostersitz hasn't given up. He said the Microsoft-provided advisor encouraged him to stick with his current strategy — and emphasized that job hunting in today's market is, in some ways, a test of endurance. "They said it's a game of chicken right now. The person who has the longer breath and can stick it out longer will get the job." Jump to

Title: Job hunting's newest rules — and whether they actually work

Karishma Mandal wanted to land an AI role at a big-name company, so she designed a job search strategy she hoped would help her stand out. Throughout her search, she'd grown confident in the merits of two tactics: being among the first to apply for roles and submitting applications directly through company websites, not job boards. "You have to be early, you have to go through the direct website, and you have to get a referral if you can," said the 29-year-old. Mandal's strategies seemed to pay off. She landed interviews with Uber, Meta, and Amazon — and an offer from Salesforce, where she started full-time in January as an AI-focused product manager in San Francisco. Mandal is among the job seekers who've embraced a growing number of job search hacks that have gained traction. Over the past year, Business Insider has spoken with dozens of job seekers who've relied not only on conventional approaches, such as crafting strong résumés and securing referrals, but also on less-proven tactics. In a competitive hiring landscape, applicants are willing to try just about anything. While layoffs across the US economy remain low by historical standards, companies are now hiring at one of the slowest rates since 2013, largely due to tariff uncertainty and the early effects of AI adoption. In this environment, job seekers are throwing strategies at the wall and hoping they stick. Job applicants rarely know exactly why they were passed over for one role or landed an interview for another. As a result, it's just as hard to debunk some job search strategies as it is to prove they can actually work. Business Insider asked career experts from LinkedIn and Indeed to weigh in on the effectiveness of some of the most commonly cited strategies — and whether they're worth your time. Business Insider has heard from hundreds of job seekers over the past year. Share your story, whether you found a job or are still looking, by filling out a form, contacting this reporter via email at jzinkula@businessinsider.com, or via Signal at jzinkula.29. Use a personal email address, a nonwork WiFi network, and a nonwork device; here's our guide to sharing information securely. Read more on the topic: Mandal thinks it's crucial to be among the first 20 or 30 applicants for a role to ensure hiring managers see her application. Priya Rathod, workplace trends editor at Indeed, said it's common for employers to review applications in the order they're submitted, and that some may stop reviewing candidates or close a posting after reaching a certain number of applicants. "I definitely think applying early can increase your visibility," she said. Catherine Fisher, a career expert at LinkedIn, said that applying to a job within 10 minutes of receiving a LinkedIn alert — notifications users can set up for specific types of roles — can increase a person's chances of hearing back by up to four times. She said some recruiters may be working under tight timelines and begin contacting qualified applicants as soon as they find them. Despite the benefits of applying early, both experts emphasized the importance of submitting a quality application — not just a quick one. After earning her master's degree and struggling to land a job, Preeti Ladwa applied to roles between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. every weekday. Her rationale: Recruiters would review recent applications first when they logged on in the morning. Ladwa believes this strategy helped her land a job as a technical projects manager. "I didn't want my résumé to get buried under hundreds of others," she said. Rathod said she's not aware of any data supporting the value of early-morning applications, but believes it's smart to apply during business hours. Some recruiters receive alerts when new applications arrive, she said, and if those come in during the workday — while they're actively reviewing candidates — they may be more likely to give them a closer look. By contrast, applications submitted after hours might get lost in a larger batch of overnight submissions. However, Fisher said she's skeptical that applying at a specific time of day makes much of a difference. She believes it's more important for job seekers to pick a consistent time to submit applications — one that helps them establish a routine and stay committed to the process. "I don't think there's a magic hour to apply," she said. When Ryan Hemenway began looking for a new field scientist job in 2023, he struggled to gain traction, so he decided to shift his approach. While he continued browsing job postings on ZipRecruiter and Indeed, he stopped applying through those platforms and instead submitted applications directly through company websites. He'd heard this might boost his chances of getting noticed, so he decided to give it a shot, in addition to his other search strategies. A few months later, he landed a new role. Rathod said she believes it's a common misconception that job seekers gain an edge by applying directly on a company's website. She said it's likely based on the belief that applications submitted through job platforms like LinkedIn or Indeed are placed in a separate "bucket" from those submitted directly — and that applications in this bucket are less likely to be prioritized. In reality, she said, many employers have integrated their hiring systems with job platforms, so applications typically end up in the same pipeline. "There's not going to be a distinction to the recruiter on whether you applied on the website or on a job platform," she said. She added that as long as a job seeker is applying through a reputable platform, the method of submission is unlikely to affect their chances. Mike Kostersitz, 60, has been job hunting since being laid off by Microsoft in May. In an effort to gain traction, he's worked with a career advisor that Microsoft provided as part of his layoff package. Kostersitz said the advisor recommended he "de-age" his résumé by removing roles from the 1980s and '90s. His LinkedIn profile now begins with work experience dating back to 2003. Fisher said she generally doesn't think having extensive experience is a drawback for employers. However, she recommends focusing the bulk of an application on recent, relevant experience — and keeping descriptions of older roles brief, or potentially leaving them out if they don't directly strengthen the application. "It doesn't mean cutting off half of your career," she said. "I just think it means looking back at when your experience stops adding value." One of the most common strategies cited by job seekers is meticulously aligning their résumés and cover letters with keywords from the job description — often with the help of AI tools — in the hope of impressing applicant tracking systems (ATS), which are often the first to review applications. Both experts agreed this is a strategy worth investing in. "Matching your keywords to your résumé is really important," Rathod said. "An ATS is going to scan for those keywords, and if it sees them, you're more likely to move forward in the process." Fisher wouldn't advise applicants to embellish their résumés just to align with job postings, but she recommends taking the time to ensure they include all of their experiences that match the role. She said that some applicants may check more boxes than they initially realize. When they do check those boxes, she said, it's worth using the precise language from the job description to better align with what ATS are scanning for. "It's not about beating the system," she said. "You're just making sure that your skills and experience align with what the company is looking for." While many of the strategies discussed above may be worth investing in, Rathod said one of her top pieces of advice is not to overlook the importance of interview preparation. "People are probably putting a lot of effort into tailoring their résumés and getting those interviews, but the interview is when you really get to shine," she said. "Job seekers need to approach interviews with that same sense of preparation." Jump to

Title: 'Musk Will Get Richer, Millions To Lose Jobs': Nobel Laureate Warns Against AI Risks

Geoffrey Hinton, a Nobel Prize-winning computer scientist, has reiterated his concerns about the risks of massive job loss amid the rising adoption of artificial intelligence (AI). He also cautioned against the growth of AI companies and tech billionaires at the cost of millions of workers. Hinton, known as the “godfather of AI”, remarked that although some economists argue past technological shifts both eliminated and created employment, AI-driven technology may not follow the same path. He expressed his doubts over job creation while highlighting the potential risks of massive unemployment. “I think the big companies are betting on it causing massive job replacement by AI, because that’s where the big money is going to be,” he warned during an interview with Bloomberg TV's Wall Street Week. “The reason it's bad is because of the way society's organised. So that Musk will get richer and a lot of people get unemployed and Musk won't care. I'm using Musk as a sort of stand-in. That's not on AI, that's on how we organise society,” he added. According to Bloomberg, the four major AI hyperscalers— Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet and Amazon— are projected to raise their capital spending from $360 billion this year to $420 billion in the next fiscal year. “I believe that to make money you're going to have to replace human labour,” Hinton said. “My worry is that the obvious way to make money out of it, apart from charging fees to use the chatbots, is by replacing jobs. The way you make a company more profitable is to replace the workers with something cheaper. And I think that’s a big part of what’s driving it.” “Some economists say these big changes always create new jobs. It’s not clear to me that this will,” he added. AI can do “tremendous good” in healthcare and education, Hinton said. On being questioned if he would rather have the development of AI halted altogether, he was noncommittal. “It's not like nuclear weapons, which are only good for bad things. It’s a difficult decision, because it can do tremendous good in health care and education." Hinton’s observations come amid widespread job reductions in the tech sector, with Amazon recently revealing plans to cut at least 14,000 corporate positions. While many leading tech firms have refrained from explicitly attributing layoffs to AI, industry experts and executives are increasingly raising concerns over hiring freezes and workforce downsizing due to the adoption of AI-driven technology.

Title: Carbon Offsetting is Not Going to Save the Planet

Time Published: 2025-11-05T09:59:14Z

There is not enough planet Earth to first turn it inside out and then turn it outside in again. Available resources do not allow for removal of the total aggregate of CO2 from the fossil fuels in stock. Instead, removal should, for all the reasons we examined in the appendix of caveats, be conceived as a restricted practice, hemmed in on all sides by limitations—of energy, of land, of subsurface storage sites, of everything needed to get underway—more in the nature of advanced surgery than basic hygiene. A question then arises: what are we going to use it for? To what end should the precious removal capacity be deployed? If negative emissions technologies can indeed attain consequential scale, should they be pressed into the service of life extension for fossil capital? Although they may serve that purpose already, even before they have entered the material world, the imminent risk is that, upon actual entry, they will be corralled into business-as-usual, as in DAC plants for enhanced oil recovery. Removal will then be negated into its opposite. This would be in accordance with the universal law of capital devouring everything potentially good and excreting it as something actually bad. Here the most egregious instance might be the use of removal to re-animate fossil fuel companies in general and enhanced oil recovery in particular, but there is something broader at work, which we might call late value form. In the overshoot conjuncture, capital seeks to press negative emissions technologies into the production of exchange-value. Against it stands any interest in deploying them for the use-value of reversal. Here, then, is a second axis of contestation around negative emissions technologies: intersecting with late technopower is late value form. A concrete example would be communities protesting against projects for enhanced oil recovery. In Texas, Elida Castillo, a Latino environmental justice activist and community organizer, voiced dismay over the arrival of a DAC plant in her neighborhood: she and other residents were “worried about the dangers of storing CO2 where they live, the risk of new pipelines being built, and whether DAC is a good use of money in the first place. And there’s reason for distrust. After all, the DAC plant belongs to Occidental”: “ “You’re pretty much entrusting the bank robbers to guard the safe,” Castillo said.” Popular opposition focused on those projects both endangering their resources and enriching the very companies that fan the flames of heating. But the state apparatus was of a different mind. Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm praised Oxy for “exactly the kind of bold thinking we need more of.” Her own thinking and that of Hollub—the secretary, the CEO— were in convergence. Months after the former took up her position under Biden, she asserted that “traditional fossil energy is going to remain important, even as we work to reduce carbon emissions”; echoing Nordhaus, “we’re also putting our brain power at the Department of Energy and our financial resources to work” on “approaches like direct air capture.” (“We need to extend the life of oil production,” maintained Hollub, because it “makes the world a better place.”) For its boldness, Oxy was awarded one of two major government grants for developing a “DAC hub,” in Texan oil country (the other went to Climeworks and Heirloom). The cheque was for $500 million. The state also offered companies a tax credit, known as 45Q, for every ton of CO2 they grabbed hold of. For every ton, that is, they could apply for relief from tax payment, a form of indirect reward to (supposedly) green activities much favored by the American state. Under the first edition of Trump, companies would receive $50 per ton captured through DAC, even when it was utilized for enhanced oil recovery. Biden then raised this handout to $130. The “Office of Fossil Energy” under Granholm’s department was renamed the “Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management,” its mission redefined as “research, development, demonstration, and deployment to minimize the environmental and climate impacts of fossil fuel and industrial processes”—sewage as state ideology. This office celebrated an annual “Carbon Management Day,” as if to give the highest imprimatur to the ideas of a Lackner or a Keith. Support for late value form became a pillar of the climate politics of the Biden administration. Meanwhile, the US “produces more crude oil than any country, ever,” the same state apparatus proudly announced, the curve steadily rising under Biden, new records forecast—for oil and gas—in 2024 and 2025, no end in sight. With the various boons, his administration might have also created the condition for a boom in enhanced oil recovery, similar to the earlier one in fracking. Possibly of even greater moment, it locked the development of DAC technology into late value form. “These hubs are going to help us prove out the potential of this game-changing technology so that others can follow in their footsteps,” exulted Granholm; they would “position the United States as the location to demonstrate the commercial viability of direct-air capture,” concurred Hollub. The program, was explicitly conceived to help midwife DAC in the US and the rest of the world. If successful, this productive force— supposed to be restorative, in at least some visions—would grow up in symbiosis with primitive fossil capital. Client states of the hegemon, such as the UAE and Saudi Arabia, readied themselves to assist in the upbringing. Approaching 1.5°C could seem like a moment without precedent. But the world had ended up there by passing through an unbroken series of decisions not to cut emissions and to do something else instead; and this practice had become so habitual and systemic as to threaten to determine the next phase too. How would this nestling fare under the second Trump? In early 2025, no one could say with any certainty; consistency and predictability were not among the primary qualities of this president. Employees at the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management responsible for removal were laid off and payments to DAC hubs frozen—not necessarily because of any Trumpian antagonism towards these technologies as such, but because of the way he and Musk set their wrecking balls working on the state apparatus. This could hollow out support mechanisms. But Hollub, for one, was not losing any sleep over it. If DAC could provide the lubricant to keep the country’s oil wells productive a good while longer, then even the 2025 version of Trump should love it—indeed all the more so. It would help him get that liquid gold from under his feet. “President Trump knows the business case for this. I’ve had several conversations with him,” Hollub assured a group of slightly jittery investors. In fact, “I think the election of Donald Trump to become our next president is going to be very positive for our industry, especially for our direct air capture.” Perhaps it would do some good for BECCS too. Trump’s secretary of the interior was Doug Burgum, previously the governor of North Dakota. He was “obsessive about carbon capture” and “the technology’s chief evangelist” in that state. Burgum was a staunch advocate of the Midwest Carbon Express, the misunderstood CO2 pipeline. He thought it offered beguiling economic opportunities, not least because the substance it carried could bring new life to North Dakota’s aging fields of shale oil. Nothing could be more indicative of the nature and power of late value form than the prospect that even the most unashamedly denialist administration might jump onto its bandwagon. But late value form extended far beyond such cartoonishly ghoulish companies as Oxy and Exxon and Aramco. No less prominent was the later crop of digital enterprises with an enlightened mien: Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Meta, Shopify. How did they inject removal into their veins? Through offsetting, of course. This practice had its own history, another tributary to the overshoot conjuncture that weighed heavily on its future course. Indeed, the currents and sheer force running through this stream might well sweep up the technologies launched in the 2020s, because it had already done so several times before. Approaching 1.5°C could seem like a moment without precedent. But the world had ended up there by passing through an unbroken series of decisions not to cut emissions and to do something else instead; and this practice had become so habitual and systemic as to threaten to determine the next phase too. A short story starring Microsoft By the early 2020s, the removal business was structured by the logic of offsetting through and through. In the Cambrian explosion of technologies, the startups taking them to the market competed for survival by selling credits. Fledgling entrepreneurs fell over each other to position themselves as the vendors of the newest, hottest, most effective, most trustworthy certificates of removed CO2. Insofar as these were purchased by consumers with an interest in glossing over an actual release of that gas, no net removal would happen: through the transaction, the –A would simply be matched with +A, in a zero-sum game that could not possibly power reversal. It would at best be running to stand still. This lapse into the default of offsetting was not the result of evil design, nor was it a cover-up of the sort pathological sex addicts might engage in. It was the result of a structural imperative, namely the commonplace market imperative: a producer of removal had to sell their product on the market or else go under. Buyers would, by definition, be the source of demand. Only one other scenario could be dimly made out in the distance: governments stepping in and funding removal out of collectively pooled resources, for its own sake. Until that day, the business would have to be mediated through the market and run the risk of descent into late value form. Consumers entering this marketplace could pick up the catalogue and browse: fancy some credits from Living Carbon and its genetically modified poplars? Or perhaps feces from Vaulted Deep, seaweed from Running Tide, rocky dust from Lithos, or the latest squishy white balls from Spiritus? Here the most enthusiastic customers often came not from primitive fossil capital but from fossil capital in general—companies not producing but consuming fossil fuels in the process of money-making and wishing, for whatever reason, to even them out with credits. One customer was in a league of its own: Microsoft. By the early 2020s, the market had been conceptually divided between “durable” removals—the high-end niche, the hard diamonds of the bazaar: CO2 supposedly stowed away permanently through DAC, BECCS, enhanced weathering, biochar—and those with a reputation for ephemerality, notably trees: the variety store. The market for durables appeared to be booming, from close to zero in 2020 to 134 companies peddling their goods in 2024. On the side of the buyers, as of that year, the market was Microsoft: it alone bagged almost two thirds of all credits sold. The proclivities of this company might have stemmed from its founder Bill Gates, long worried about the state of the world, an early benefactor of the startups—including Carbon Engineering— author of How to Avoid a Climate Disaster: The Solutions We Have and the Breakthroughs We Need; to sum up his CV, the late human face of capitalism. He personified all the usual characteristics of overshoot ideology: the transition is bound to be gradual, and it can only ever be incomplete. “There are no realistic paths to zero that involve abandoning these [fossil] fuels completely,” and so instead, the future we face is one in which “we will still be producing some emissions, but we’ll have some ways to remove the carbon they emit.” Under his spiritual leadership, Microsoft went on a shopping spree. One mega-purchase followed another. In May 2024, Microsoft publicized the single largest transaction on this market, until that point: a deal with Stockholm Exergi for the delivery of credits from its future BECCS plant. The tech giant would thereby “obtain legal title to those removals,” in its own words (ecocapitalist outlet GreenBiz filed the news under the category “Practical Magic”). This followed a mega-purchase from Danish energy company Ørsted, which also promised to operate a BECCS plant in the near future and have the CO2 shipped to the Northern Lights. Then came a deal with 1PointFive to buy credits from Stratos—the largest sale of DAC credits thus far. Unlike Oxy’s other plans for that plant, the CO2 removed under Microsoft’s patronage would be “securely stored through subsurface saline sequestration and will not be used to produce oil and gas.” Microsoft was a believer. “We believe that the time for responsibly scaling BECCS is here and look forward to the coming wave of project developments.” “DAC plays an important role in Microsoft’s carbon removal portfolio.” But Microsoft was a promiscuous shopper; it also bought credits from Lithos and, not as durable, forests in countries like India, Brazil, Peru. What for? In January 2020, on the crest of the wave of popular mobilizations for the climate, Microsoft made a sensational announcement: it would become “carbon negative” by 2030. After that date, it would remove more CO2 from the atmosphere than it emitted, to the point—scheduled for 2050—when there would no longer be any molecules attributable to it. All the company had emitted since Gates founded it in 1975 would be gone, the full footprint washed away. The communiqué earned a tremendous amount of positive press. Stories included lines such as the following. “The thing about Microsoft’s work that I love, love, love is the investment in climate equity and environmental justice. This has been missing from the corporate dialogue. More companies should take this kind of intersectional lens.” Microsoft claimed to have been “carbon neutral” since 2012, thanks to its spendthrift purchasing of offsets; now it would raise the bar and go flat-out negative. This was indeed something new under the bourgeois sun. Never before had a company—and not any company: one of the largest capitalist corporations on Earth; by some counts, the largest—pledged to undo the totality of the harm it had inflicted on the climate system. It would do so of its own volition, no government interference needed. It was about to set an example for the rest of humanity to follow—maybe all the way back to a pre-capitalist climate. About midway into the decade that would turn Microsoft negative, a bit of a hiccup was reported. By its own admission, the company’s emissions were 29 per cent higher four years into the decade than at its start—up nearly by a whopping third, that is. This was not quite the example for humanity, nor the route that led to negativity. Nothing indicated that the removal credits Microsoft was snapping up were enough to cancel out these emissions, let alone surmount them. At the very best, it was now operating within the fourth configuration of continue and ameliorate—at most the credits offset a fraction of the gush. One driver was all the energy and steel needed for the ever-growing data centers, courtesy, in part, of the AI boom. That boom looked like it would largely be powered by newly constructed gas plants. But the problem went beyond the fossil fuels Microsoft burned within its own process of producing profit, and indeed those consumed by individuals using its software. Few clients of this company were as weighty as the fossil fuel companies themselves. Microsoft was plainly not about to wash away its own or anyone else’s footprint. Indeed, emissions from the fossil fuels it helped bring to the surface were not even counted among those it wished to neutralize and remove. The overshoot conjuncture coincided with a major thrust towards digitalization, computerization, automation of oil and gas extraction: and Microsoft was the supplier second to none. In 2020, Barclays published a report lauding the advances of cloud services, AI, machine learning, remote sensing, edge computing and related technologies into the oil and gas fields of the world, speeding up discoveries, optimizing the location of wells, maximizing recovery rates, improving throughput in pipelines and so on and so forth: through the digital nostrils, yet another breath of life into primitive fossil capital. It would cut costs and increase production and, summum bonum, raise profits. “Big Tech has made a big push into the Oil & Gas sector,” noted Barclays, and “Microsoft has been the most aggressive, saying that Oil & Gas is the #1 growth market for its cloud services”; and true to form, “Microsoft has become the cloud server of choice for the industry.” A particularly rewarding product was the cloud computing platform Azure. Just as Microsoft prepared to go negative, it entered a series of highly durable deals with ExxonMobil, Chevron, Equinor, Halliburton, Schlumberger, Petrofac and other heavyweights for integrating Azure into their operations. Microsoft went to the Gulf, to an exhibition hosted by ADNOC, and gave its pavilion the theme “Empowering Oil & Gas with AI.” In the very week when the company made the “moonshot” announcement about going negative, it took center stage at an expo on a similar theme hosted by Aramco. Had it changed its mind? Two years after the announcement, Microsoft confirmed that it would continue to sell its commodities “for subsurface exploration and extraction of fossil fuels.” In 2023, the chief technical architect at its center in Houston posted a gushing accolade to the industry—always “at the forefront of innovation, constantly pushing the boundaries of what’s possible”—and now, thanks to his own company, once more “unlocking previously inaccessible reserves.” “With Azure, the future of oil and gas exploration and production is brighter than ever.” By this point, some employees were so disgusted by the hypocrisy that they quit their jobs. Microsoft was plainly not about to wash away its own or anyone else’s footprint. Indeed, emissions from the fossil fuels it helped bring to the surface were not even counted among those it wished to neutralize and remove. In the material world, this company reinforced the wall blocking every path to climate stabilization. By selling means of production to primitive fossil capital, Microsoft profited from the tendency of fixed capital to rise in extraction and built up more assets that must not be stranded: for every mega-purchase of Azure sunk into a field, the incentive grew to keep the oil gushing. No BECCS from Stockholm or DAC from Texas could come close to offsetting this propagation of business-as-usual. But Microsoft might indeed have set the standards for what other tech companies were expected to do, even if they lagged behind. Shopify stood behind the united Frontier. Like most others, it nominally stuck to the principle of first reducing emissions and then adding removal to go the extra mile. Like Microsoft, it was, in fact, rapidly increasing emissions, mainly by encouraging its employees to fly between offices. But Shopify claimed that its bag of removal credits offset all the emissions from delivering commodities on Black Friday. Google was another regular in the malls of removal. It was a heavy consumer of Indian biochar, Brazilian rock dust, bio-oil charms and DAC credits from a new startup called Holocene (time machine as trademark). But it too was riding an AI wave that caused its emissions to curve steeply, by almost 50 per cent since 2019—in the direction opposite, of course, from reduction. It was happily publishing greenwashing ads by oil and gas companies on its various platforms. Among its prominent cloud computing customers was Saudi Aramco. Alongside Google, there was JPMorgan, which invested in Frontier, and in Climeworks, and in forests; and, in every year after the Paris Agreement save one, it was the bank that poured the most money into fossil fuel projects. Even the emissions intensity of its investments was headed upwards. (“We are thinking about commercial value, it’s not for philanthropic purposes only that we buy carbon removal. From a reputation perspective, it brings value to our brand. Our customers expect us to do it,” explained the head of “carbon management” at JPMorgan.) Another proud backer of Frontier was number one consulting firm McKinsey; and it continued to work tightly with clients like ExxonMobil and Aramco and allied with Sultan Al Jaber to temper ambitions at COP28. The same BlackRock that lifted Stratos off the ground was perfectly clear about its intention not to stop investing in fossil fuels, now or in the future. Then there was Elon Musk, who, with his XPrize Carbon Removal, preened in more stardom and pioneership than most. His uncompromising commitment to removal was plastered in large, capital letters on the website of the Prize: “We want teams to build real systems that can make measurable impact at a gigaton level. Whatever it takes. Time is of the essence.” In an interview carried out around the time the Prize was announced, he professed his concern that “there is some risk of non-linear climate change” and it would be “not wise to take” that risk. But as part of his rightward drift, he also told a festival organized by the far-right Brothers of Italy that “climate change is exaggerated in the short term” and “we should not demonize oil and gas in the medium term.” In 2024, he shoveled a few hundred million dollars into denialist-in-chief Donald Trump’s second run for president. In a candid chat between the two billionaires—described as “the dumbest climate conversation of all time”—Musk shared with Trump his views on the climate crisis. Now time was no longer of the essence. “We don’t need to rush and we don’t need to like, you know, stop farmers from farming or, you know, prevent people from having steaks or basic stuff like that.” More concerned about peak oil than an overheating planet, Musk went on to explain that CO2 concentrations would only become a concern around 1,000 ppm, when “it actually simply gets uncomfortable to breathe” and “you start getting headaches and nausea.” The bromance continued inside the White House, where Musk and Trump together rolled back whatever little progress the Biden administration had made on climate and then rolled some more. Tangled and twined though it might seem, there was a thread running through this performance. For all his apparent schizophrenia, Musk embodied a key feature of overshoot ideology: there was no inherent contradiction between denying the depth of the climate problem and posing as the über-patron of innovations for removal. The two themes could play a perfect symphony. All one had to do would be to rethink what removals are for (or shake off any post-substitutionist illusions about it). As part of Musk’s rightward drift, he also a festival organized by the far-right Brothers of Italy that “climate change is exaggerated in the short term” and “we should not demonize oil and gas in the medium term.” The black hole of fossil fuels was not, in other words, only expanded by the likes of Oxy. Everything else was affected by its gravitational pull and drawn into the work of dilating it further—even the firms rumored to be at the farthest remove from the crudity, even negative emissions technologies and the market on which their credits circulated. The ecumenical engagement with removal merely confirmed the integration between primitive fossil capital and every other circuit of accumulation. Vicky Hollub and Bill Gates were bedfellows (as evidenced by their shared interest in Carbon Engineering). From their respective sides, they pulled removal into late value form—which, it is important to repeat, functioned through ideology as much as through processes of production. Gates did not get any directly enhanced oil, like Hollub. But he and Microsoft earned a first-class reputation. Everything is unavoidable In these days of net zero, there was an added rationale for removal: some emissions were “unavoidable.” Or, they were “residual” or “hard to abate”—however one chose to put it, impossible to do without. To get to zero, they would have to be effaced by negative emissions of the same magnitude. This line of reasoning had the formal seal of approval from the IPCC; indeed, it was one justification for removal in the IAMs. But what, really, was unavoidable? IPCC models typically left a rump of 20 per cent of current emissions in this category, after the rest had been mitigated—one fifth, that is, would have to remain in effect and balanced out by removal (over and above any return assignment). Countries were betting on roughly the same amount in the plans they submitted to the UN; but their assumptions and definitions and interpretations of “residual” were all over the place. The International Energy Agency turned out to be less resigned to the things that exist and capped this class of emissions at 5 per cent. Companies themselves worked with everything from 0 to 80 per cent; Microsoft’s hypothetical decarbonization pathway appeared to count on close to 50. The extent of the unavoidable seemed to be in the eye of the beholder. In a world overstocked with assets at risk of being stranded, the temptation to classify emissions as “unable to be prevented or stayed away from”—the meaning of “unavoidable,” according to the Cambridge Dictionary—seemed plain as a pikestaff. There was something arbitrary about the way this term and its synonyms were bandied about. Unless the category could be brought under control, the excess threatened to self-propagate. The more removals used for offsetting, the less available for reversal. Late value form becomes the underwriting of luxury. One solution was to reserve the category for a select few sectors: agriculture (think methane from cows or rice paddies), aviation, shipping, cement, petrochemicals—all difficult to disconnect from emissions, on the common view. (We discussed several of these in Overshoot.) However great the difficulties, they did not shrink with the common assumption that said sectors would continue to grow. This led to the slightly absurd belief that the cumbersome category of unavoidability was itself inexorably growing: not only could the world not help emitting a great deal, it also could not help doing it ever more. Many things were here naturalized at once. Take aviation, for instance. It was the prototypical member of the residual club: people want to fly; planes run on jet fuels; there are no substitutes at hand; hence these emissions must be accepted—their growth to boot—and treated by means of removal. But consider again Bill Gates. He was a very frequent flyer. He owned a private jet, a Bombardier BD-700 Global Express, complete with a salon of discreetly beige seats. In 2017, he took sixty flights and left a plume of more than 1,600 tons of CO2 in his wake. This gave Gates, from the use of his private jet alone, the same carbon footprint as a small town in Burundi. He did not think this was a problem, because Bill Gates was an avid investor in removal and devotedly offset his sins with credits. He bought them from Climeworks— indeed, he boasted of being its largest individual customer. On the generally accepted logic of unavoidability, Gates’s flying emissions would fall in this inviolable category. This one billionaire would thereby be entitled to a disproportionate share of—remember, by nature limited—removals, simply by virtue of his ability to pay handsomely for them. No impoverished peasant or worker in, say, Benin or Belgium could do such a thing: these folks did not fly very frequently, if at all; hence they produced no unavoidable emissions; hence negative emissions technologies need not be hitched to their lifestyle. If it were up to the market to allocate unavoidability and the removal conjugated to it, such technologies would by definition flow towards actors with money— aka the heaviest polluters. What removal society could afford would be set apart to compensate for the emissions from the Bill Gateses of this world, while “displacing needs from sectors with high public value but limited private ability to pay (for example, farming, remote hospitals)”—or, what rice farmer in Bangladesh can buy credits from Climeworks? Insofar as it is left to the invisible hand to arrange these matters, this scenario seems truly unavoidable. A billionaire has greater purchasing power than a Bangladeshi laborer and will be able to claim more removal capacity—so much capacity not used for subsistence or survival, including return from overshoot. The more removals used for offsetting, the less available for reversal. Late value form becomes the underwriting of luxury. _________________________________________ From The Long Heat: Climate Politics When It’s Too Late by Wim Carton and Andreas Malm.

Title: MARA Reaches Record-High Q3 Revenue as Bitcoin Hyper Becomes One of the Best Altcoins on the Market
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-miner-mara-revenue-bitcoin-hyper-best-altcoins/
Time Published: 2025-11-05T09:30:53Z

Quick Facts: Bitcoin mining company MARA has just announced record-high revenues for the past quarter, at $252.4M. This represents a 92% increase compared to 2024’s Q3, when the company bagged $131.6M. MARA owes this growth rate to its expanding Bitcoin mining system, which generated 98% more $BTC over a one-year span. The company mined 2,144 $BTC during this Q3 or almost 53,000 between 2024 and 2025. Fred Thiel, MARA’s CEO, explained this mass expansion in the context of adopting open-source AI tech to replace the standard GPUs: We are already seeing the alternatives to GPUs enter the market, and open source AI is making it far easier and much less expensive for companies to deploy advanced AI systems directly in their own private cloud environments. —Frederick Thiel, MARA Holdings Q3 Earnings Call As Salman Khan, MARA’s CFO, explains in the same announcement, the company’s hash rate grew by roughly 20%, while the daily cost per peta hash dropped 15% over the last year. This allowed MARA to almost double its performance in just 12 months. As Bitcoin’s Layer 2 solution, Bitcoin Hyper’s ($HYPER), could have an even bigger impact in 2026, promising faster and cheaper Bitcoin transactions for a more scalable, performant network. As Fred Thiel himself noticed, Bitcoin has ‘entered its institutional phase’, with names like City Corp, BlackRock, and JP Morgan ‘integrating Bitcoin into traditional frameworks’. Then we have governments and public and private companies hoarding $BTC at an unprecedented rate. As Bitcoin Treasuries data shows, 353 entities hold over 4.05M $BTC and their accumulation rate went up 4.12% over the last 30 days. This ever-expanding ecosystem offers unlimited opportunities, and Thiel’s MARA is all for it. As the CEO explained, the company plans to expand on the marriage between Bitcoin and AI tech: Bitcoin mining monetizes underutilized energy and stabilizes grids, while AI inference transforms that same energy into intelligence and productivity. By bringing Bitcoin and AI together, we seek to maximize the value of every megawatt-hour we manage. —Fred Thiel, MARA Holdings Q3 Earnings Call To that end, MARA has already secured a partnership with MPLX with the goal of expanding its operations into West Texas. MPLX will offer ‘long-term access to low-cost natural gas at scale’, which will complement MARA’s computing infrastructure for higher throughput. The projected initial capacity is around 400 megawatts with the option to expand to up to 1.5 gigawatts across three planned sites. These developments position MARA as a leader in Bitcoin mining, which can only work in Bitcoin’s favor. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), on the other hand, also propels $BTC forward, promising to build a faster and cheaper Bitcoin network than ever before. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) promises a faster, more performant, and more cost-effective Bitcoin network, leveraging tools such as the SVM and the Canonical Bridge. The Canonical Bridge addresses Bitcoin’s most pressing issue: its performance limitations. As such, smaller transactions can sometimes experience confirmation times of hours, which explains the network’s unsuitability for most DeFi applications. The Canonical Bridge fixes this issue by minting the users’ bitcoins into the Hyper layer as soon as the Bitcoin Relay Program confirms the transaction details. The entire process lasts seconds, vastly improving Bitcoin’s confirmation times and removing the 7-TPS cap. Meanwhile, the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) enables the ultra-fast execution of smart contracts and DeFi apps. This will increase Bitcoin’s ranking on the list of the fastest blockchains today and make the network more feasible for institutional investors. The presale is at over $25.9M so far and growing at a steady pace, despite the October 10 meltdown, which sent the market into a downward spiral. The project’s resilience already ranks it among the best presales of 2025. This makes $HYPER one of the best altcoins to buy this coming Q4. If you want in on it, visit the presale page and snag your $HYPER today. This isn’t financial advice. Do your own research (DYOR) before investing.

A joint report published on Wednesday from the Central Bank of Ireland and the Climate Change Advisory Council (CCAC), warns that focus “must also be applied to addressing the impacts of climate change that are already emerging by enabling investment in climate adaptation projects at both national and local levels”. Kevin O’Sullivan has the details Irish tourism, transport, and leisure businesses reported an eighth successive monthly decline in activity levels in October despite an easing of the cost inflation that has dogged the sector this year. AIB’s latest purchasing managers’ index (PMI) for the wide-ranging services sector indicates what the bank described as “a marked pickup” in growth among services firms. Ian Curran reports. Leading European law firm Fieldfisher has acquired Cork-based legal practice Regan Wall for an undisclosed sum. The company said the deal would increase its Irish revenue by more than 20 per cent while doubling the size of its corporate practice. It will also give the firm a second Irish location, writes Eoin Burke-Kennedy. The loss to An Post of contracts to deliver parcels for online retailers ASOS and Sports Direct seems to have been one nail – if not the final one -in the coffin of Fastway Couriers which collapsed last week leaving staff, contract drivers and customers stranded. Regardless of whether or not this is the case, it has revived the issue over whether An Post is using its state owned and subsidised mail delivery network to undercut commercial courier companies when bidding for delivery contracts from big online retailers So you’re quitting your job?

Title: Revealed: How much RTÉ wants in sponsorship for David McCullagh’s radio show as it launches next week

Package is similar to what was charged when Claire Byrne anchored the show David McCullagh cuts a good-luck cake he received from newsroom colleagues. Photo: David McCullagh/Instagram Presenter David McCullagh takes over the mid-morning show on RTÉ Radio 1 next week RTÉ is seeking sponsorship of €350,000 for David McCullagh’s new mid-morning radio show. As proof of its confidence in the former Six One news anchor (57), it is believed to be the same figure charged for when Claire Byrne anchored the show. Similar to the deal with the show’s previous sponsors, the package is for six sponsor-credited “stings” lasting 10 seconds, airing daily. The deal, which offers 30 stings a week, includes cross-station promos across Radio 1’s schedule including Liveline under new host Kieran Cuddihy. The sponsorship deal is for one year and will start from January 2026. The RTÉ sales team said Today with David McCullagh will be the place for “sharp and accessible coverage of all the day’s main news stories, biggest talking points and engaging human-interest stories”. “David will guide listeners through the major news events of the day, offering in-depth analysis, live reports and thought-provoking conversations with key figures from politics, culture, business and beyond – all underpinned by his trademark curiosity and clarity,” it added. McCullagh signed off from Six One last Friday, ahead of starting his new mid-morning slot next Monday, November 10, airing from 9-11am. David McCullagh cuts a good-luck cake he received from newsroom colleagues. Photo: David McCullagh/Instagram Today's News in 90 Seconds - Wednesday, November 5 Posting pictures of his final day with the news team, a smiling McCullagh posed in front of a cake saying “Good luck”. He accompanied his Instagram post with Born to Run by his favourite artist Bruce Springsteen, who he said he has seen over 40 times so far. The presenter donned a white T-shirt for the occasion, bearing the logo: “I can do light”. This was taken as a light-hearted reference to his September interview with RTÉ’s Oliver Callan, shortly after his appointment was made. Asked by Callan if he was comfortable tackling the lighter items on the Today slot, he reckons he will be “comfortable enough”. “I am interested in history, I am interested in politics but I’m also interested in pets. I think they’re hugely important for families around the country. I am interested in eating, in going to the theatre and going to gigs,” he said. He also revealed that his new package will give him earnings of just under €240,000, meaning he will most likely feature on RTÉ’s annual “best paid” list. The historian and author, who has just published his latest book From Crown to Harp, joined RTÉ in 1993. A native of Blackrock, Dublin, he previously worked with the Evening Press. He spent 12 years as a political correspondent in Leinster House and five years fronting the Six One news. He was offered the new gig at the end of July and he said it didn’t take much time to accept it, describing it as “one of the best gigs in Irish media”. Signing off from the Today show last Friday, ahead of her new gig on Newstalk, Claire Byrne told listeners McCullagh is going to do “an exceptional job”. “David is one of Ireland’s finest journalists, and he’s a fierce nice fella to boot. I know he’s going to take great care of you all in the years ahead,” she said.

WFTV Now NEW YORK — Stocks gained ground on Wall Street Wednesday following several upbeat economic updates and a steady flow of quarterly reports from U.S. companies. The gains were broad and marked a reversal from the prior day's dip. Much of the market's push and pull came from the technology sector, where several companies with huge values have an outsized influence over the market. Google’s parent, Alphabet, jumped 2.4%, Broadcom rose 2%, and Facebook parent Meta Platforms rose 1.4%. They helped lead the way higher for the broader market. Their gains also helped counter losses from a few technology behemoths, including Nvidia and Microsoft. Overall The S&P 500 rose 24.74 points, or 0.4% to 6,796.29. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 225.76 points, or 0.5%, to 47,311. The Nasdaq composite rose 151.16 points, or 0.6%, to 23,499.80. Company earnings and forecasts were once again a big focus for Wall Street, with results coming from a broad spectrum of industries. McDonald's rose 2.2% after reporting that its sales benefited from the return of its popular Snack Wraps in the third quarter. International Flavors & Fragrances jumped 4.1% after beating Wall Street's latest quarterly profit forecasts. On the losing side, Taser maker Axon Enterprise slumped 9.4% after forecasting weaker profits than analysts were expecting. Live Nation Entertainment fell 10.6% after its latest results fell short of analysts' forecasts. The latest round of earnings offers Wall Street a source of information on consumers, businesses and the economy that is otherwise lacking amid the government shutdown. Important monthly updates on inflation and employment have ceased, leaving investors, economists and the Federal Reserve without a fuller picture of the economy. There are still several informative private economic updates that Wall Street can review. A monthly report from ADP showed that private payrolls rose more than expected in October. The report offers a partial glimpse into the job market, which has been generally weakening and raising broader concerns about economic growth. The services sector, which is the largest part of the U.S. economy, expanded in October more than Wall Street expected, according to the Institute for Supply Management. The report shows that while overall business activity grew, employment was still contracting. “The survey provides a reassuring sign that economic growth persisted in October despite the government shutdown,” Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, wrote in a note to investors. A weaker job market remains a big concern for the Fed. The central bank cut its benchmark rate for the second time this year at its most recent meeting, in part to help bolster the economy amid a weakening job market. Lower interest rates can make a wide range of loans and credit less expensive, potentially promoting economic growth. But, lower rates can also add fuel to inflation, which could stunt economic growth. Fed Chair Jerome Powell and several other Fed officials have expressed concerns about more rate cuts, as inflation remains stubbornly above the central bank's target of 2%. Consumer prices rose 3% in September. The mix of a weaker job market and hot inflation leaves the Fed in a tough position. “For Fed watchers, this ADP report should make it clear that a December rate cut is now in play,” said Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group, in a note to investors. “We are nearing stall speed in the labor market, and that will get the Fed’s attention.” Wall Street has tempered its expectations for another interest rate cut in December. Investors are now forecasting a 63% chance that the Fed will cut interest rates, according to CME FedWatch. That's down from a 90% chance just prior to the previous rate cut. The threat of tariffs also continues to hang over consumers and businesses. President Donald Trump's trade war with China, Canada and many other nations has been unpredictable. The full impact of higher prices is difficult to forecast because of constant shifts in policy. The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday about the legality of the sweeping tariffs. Treasury yields rose in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.16% from 4.09% late Tuesday. The yield on the two-year Treasury rose to 3.63% from 3.58% late Tuesday. European markets gained ground and Asian markets closed mostly lower. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Title: Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin ‘bows head in shame’ after admitting to 50x scaling bottleneck
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/ethereums-vitalik-buterin-bows-head-in-shame-after-admitting-to-50x-scaling-bottleneck/
Time Published: 2025-11-05T03:00:14Z

Well, it would seem that the network can’t catch a break! Modexp inefficiency and $135.7M ETF outflows mean Ethereum is getting hit from both sides. If demand doesn’t return fast, $3.3K-$3.35K will become a realistic downside target. Ethereum [ETH] is facing a double hit this week, and the timing could not be worse! Co-founder Vitalik Buterin admitted in an X post that the current modexp precompile is hurting ZK-proof efficiency. He added that it’s slowing down a feature that is meant to drive ETH’s next big scaling upgrade. Source: X At the same time, institutions are quietly walking out the door – ETH ETFs saw $135.7M in net outflows, with BlackRock alone unloading $81.7M. If both the tech layer and the capital layer turn against ETH in the same week, is the floor about to give way? According to Buterin, modexp can be “50x worse than average blocks” for ZK-EVM proving. This is confirmation that the inefficiency is now too big to ignore. In his own words, he even said he “bows his head in shame” for inventing it. Source: X The community response was simple – This is a waste of engineering time, and fixing modexp matters more than squeezing tiny efficiency gains elsewhere. As one user put it, “Makes sense. The opportunity cost of optimizing obscure opcodes is huge compared to improving core scalability layers.” This matters because if ZK-proving stays slow, ETH scaling stalls. And, that risk is suddenly front and center. Yesterday alone, ETH ETFs saw $135.7 million in outflows, with BlackRock dumping $81.7 million on its own. That’s institutional capital actively reducing exposure. Source: X And, the scale matters here – This is one of ETH’s sharpest single-day outflow clusters since launch. If big allocators continue to pull liquidity at this pace, Ethereum will struggle to find a floor. This turns the modexp debate into a capital flight problem. At press time, Ethereum’s price was trading near $3,480 after a heavy two-day sell-off candle cluster that erased most of last week’s bounce. The RSI suggested that momentum has been weak, but not yet fully oversold. The OBV continued to slide lower too. So, volume has been flowing out, not in. Source: TradingView Structurally, this means ETH has failed to defend its short-term support. Unless demand returns quickly, there’s a clear risk of a deeper fall (potentially toward the $3.3K-$3.35K pocket), before any real upside attempt could form.

Title: IBM to layoff thousands of employees before end of year
URL: https://www.newsweek.com/ibm-layoff-thousands-employees-before-end-year-10992649
Time Published: 2025-11-05T01:08:33Z
Full Content:
Published Nov 04, 2025 at 05:41 PM EST Reporter, Consumer & Social Trends IBM announced Tuesday it would be laying off thousands of employees before the end of the year. The job losses will amount to a “low single-digit percentage” of the global workforce. For a 1 percent cut, that would mean the loss of 2,700 jobs. Many companies have implemented layoffs as a way to boost profits and increase efficiency as they head into new financial quarters. Meta, for instance, announced it plans to cut roughly 600 roles from its AI team as business priorities shift. While IBM had 270,000 global workers at the end of 2025, a single-digit percentage layoff would mean thousands of employees would no longer have jobs at the end of the year. “In the fourth quarter, we are executing an action that will impact a low single-digit percentage of our global workforce,” a company spokesperson told CNBC. “While this may impact some U.S.-based roles, we anticipate that our U.S. employment will remain flat year over year.” Many tech companies have reduced their employee headcounts, focusing on artificial intelligence tools to boost productivity even with fewer workers. In October, Amazon announced layoffs for 14,000 corporate employees, and Meta will be letting 600 workers in its AI unit go. IBM previously reported a 10 percent jump in revenue from software last month, but the larger sector is facing uncertainty from several directions, experts say. “The current environment is filled with uncertainty, and many companies may feel like this is the perfect opportunity to get rid of what some believe to be pandemic bloat,” Kevin Thompson, the CEO of 9i Capital Group and the host of the 9innings podcast, told Newsweek. “Many companies were forced to keep staff for longer than they had hoped and perhaps this would allow them to thin their workforce.” Newsweek reached out to IBM for comment via email. Matt Bruno, chief revenue officer at Laivly, told Newsweek: “For the past few years, the industry’s been focused on building large, experimental AI teams. Now the emphasis is shifting to precision and measurable impact. We’ve seen that same evolution on the business side, especially in contact centers, where companies are moving from pilots to embedding AI directly into workflows that help agents make better decisions and improve performance. It’s fascinating to see that same focus on outcomes now extending to the model makers themselves.” Alex Beene, a financial literacy instructor for the University of Tennessee at Martin, told Newsweek: “While some will lay the blame on AI for these cuts, it’s difficult to say based on the initial announcement if that’s in fact the case. The workforce in the United States for IBM actually remains flat year-over-year despite the cuts. Still, this is the latest in a series of major corporate job reductions that will further stoke fears of how technological advancements are going to lead to more job losses.” Kevin Thompson, the CEO of 9i Capital Group and the host of the 9innings podcast, told Newsweek: “The tech industry is accelerating toward AI adoption, and with that comes a belief in new efficiencies that allow companies to do more with less. Some divisions are being downsized because they rely on older, outdated technologies that no longer fit the direction the industry is heading. Others are being restructured or folded into different parts of the company.” Business experts say workers should expect a continuing spree of layoff announcements as we near the end of the year. “As we move toward the end of the year, expect more layoff announcements,” Thompson said. “Year-end is traditionally when companies evaluate performance, tighten operations, and adjust forecasts for the year ahead.” © 2025 Newsweek Digital LLC

Title: The People Who Will Determine Whether Musk Becomes a Trillionaire
URL: https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/2025/11/elon-musk-trillionaire-tesla/684822/
Time Published: 2025-11-05T00:56:00Z
Full Content:
This week’s Tesla shareholder vote could give the world’s richest man more money and more control. Listen to more stories on the Noa app. This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here. Elon Musk wants to be anointed the world’s first trillionaire—but he swears it’s not about the money. Over the past few weeks, the Tesla CEO has been demanding greater power over the electric-vehicle manufacturer that he has led for almost two decades. Specifically, he is asking for another 12 percent of the company—a stake currently worth roughly $190 billion. If shareholders vote for it, and if Musk meets the board’s goals for drastically increasing the company’s value, the total value of his personal stake will shoot up to $1 trillion. At Tesla’s annual meeting on Thursday, shareholders will finish voting on whether to give him both more money and more control over the company’s governance—or to give him neither. The compensation package is partly a reflection of Tesla’s changing priorities. The company’s “Master Plan IV,” released in September, “makes no mention of any new electric cars in the works,” Patrick George recently wrote in The Atlantic. “It is instead a technocratic fever dream, predicting a future in which humanoid robots made by Tesla free us from mundane tasks and create a utopia of ‘sustainable abundance.’” Tesla’s board has said that the compensation package will help motivate Musk to pursue these innovations; in the company’s third-quarter earnings call last month, robots—not money—were at the heart of Musk’s argument for more shares. “If I go ahead and build this enormous robot army, can I just be ousted at some point in the future?” he asked. As the world’s richest man and the CEO of several companies, Musk exerts an enormous amount of influence over many people’s lives, but Tesla’s structure does include some checks on that power. Tesla is, on paper, overseen by those who actually own the company—which isn’t always the case at other public companies. Mark Zuckerberg, for example, owns about 13 percent of Meta, but as of last year, he controls 61 percent of the total voting power, thanks to a special class of stock that grants him outsize sway over corporate governance. This system is not a democratic representation of all shareholders’ views, but it is nevertheless popular among today’s tech companies. Snap Inc. (the parent company of Snapchat) is perhaps the most extreme example; its two co-founders control more than 99 percent of the vote. The fact that a vote against Tesla’s pay package is even technically possible is a reflection of a not-so-monopolized voting structure. Companies often have valid reasons for deciding to centralize so much control in the hands of a few individuals (dissenters can make it hard for boardrooms to move quickly on decisions, and outside interests can dilute a founder’s vision, to name two). But that centralization can also lead to something of a shareholder monarchy. Although Tesla is already consolidated around Musk, he still doesn’t own a majority of the company. If shareholders were to reject his pay package, they’d be reminding the board that, for now, they still have ultimate say over how the company is run. Analysts generally believe that the compensation package will be accepted, because top Tesla shareholders have been content to follow Musk’s lead in the past. The company’s structure should ideally enable a multiplicity of dissenting voices—but more often, shareholders are simply willing to go with the board’s recommendations. This time, however, there has been early and forceful pushback. Some shareholders, including Norges Bank Investment Management, the bank behind the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, have come out against the plan on the grounds that $1 trillion is simply too much money for a single CEO. Prominent public figures have weighed in too: “We’re in big trouble,” Pope Leo XIV said of Musk’s possibly becoming a trillionaire. But in the world of corporate governance, there are forces far more influential than the pope. Among them are the proxy advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis, which do market research and advise fund providers such as BlackRock and Vanguard on how to vote their shares. The people invested in BlackRock’s and Vanguard’s funds aren’t all corporate bigwigs; some of them are ordinary people, with pensions and IRA accounts. Most of them won’t vote at Tesla’s shareholder meeting, but BlackRock and Vanguard certainly will. ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended voting against Musk’s pay package, as they’ve done repeatedly in recent years—Musk responded by calling the companies “corporate terrorists” during last month’s earnings call—although what BlackRock and Vanguard will decide is still unclear. Tesla leadership has been mounting a steady campaign to undermine any dissent; a slick website, VoteTesla.com, lays out why voters should approve the pay package. But now the board appears to be scrambling. The chair, Robyn Denholm, who usually eschews public appearances, has been on something of a media tour over the past few weeks, defending the plan. For the board, this vote is existential. As early as last year, Musk was heavily implying that he would leave the company if he couldn’t have that 25 percent stake. If he exits, Tesla’s stock will almost certainly tank. Tesla’s board of nine, which includes Musk’s brother, seems to trust him completely. (After rejecting a previously proposed pay package, a Delaware court said that certain board members were not independent, citing concerns about undisclosed “connections between the members of the Compensation Committee and Musk”; Tesla is appealing the decision.) Whether shareholders outside Musk’s inner circle still maintain that trust is a question that will be answered later this week. Musk said in the earnings call that he wants just enough voting control to retain a “strong influence.” The conflict over his pay package is a reminder that influence shouldn’t be taken for granted.

AMD stock crashed 3.7% to $250.05 despite posting record Q3 2025 earnings. The chipmaker reported $9.25 billion in revenue, up 36% year-over-year, and $1.20 EPS, beating forecasts. Strong AI chip demand and new deals with OpenAI and Oracle pushed data center revenue to $4.3 billion. Yet, investors booked profits after massive gains this year. AMD’s $406 billion market cap and high 150.63 P/E ratio reflect steep valuation worries. Analysts still see rack-scale AI systems as AMD’s 2026 growth catalyst.

Title: Optimizing nested JSON array processing using AWS Step Functions Distributed Map
URL: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/optimizing-nested-json-array-processing-using-aws-step-functions-distributed-map/
Time Published: 2025-11-04T23:12:17Z

AWS Blogs When you’re working with large datasets, you’ve likely encountered the challenge of processing complex JSON structures in your automated workflows. You need to preprocess arrays within nested JSON objects before you can run parallel processing on them. Extracting data used to require custom code and extra processing steps, delaying you from building your core application logic. With AWS Step Functions Distributed Map, you can process large datasets with concurrent iterations of workflow steps across data entries. Using the enhanced ItemsPointer feature of Distributed Maps, you can extract array data directly from JSON objects stored in Amazon S3. Alternatively, for JSON object as state input, you can use Items (JSONata) or ItemsPath (JSONPath). With this enhancement you can point directly to arrays nested within JSON structures, eliminating the need for custom preprocessing of your data. With ItemsPointer, Items, and ItemsPath you can select the nested array data and simplify your workflows. In this post, we explore how to optimize processing array data embedded within complex JSON structures using AWS Step Functions Distributed Map. You’ll learn how to use ItemsPointer to reduce the complexity of your state machine definitions, create more flexible workflow designs, and streamline your data processing pipelines—all without writing additional transformation code or AWS Lambda functions. In this e-commerce use case example, you’ll build a sample application that demonstrates processing of product inventory data for an e-commerce application using AWS Step Functions Distributed Map. The application receives a JSON file from an upstream application containing an array of product information. The Step Functions workflow reads the JSON file containing product data from an S3 bucket and iterates over the array to enrich each product data in the array. The following diagram presents the AWS Step Functions state machine. JSON array processing workflow The JSON array is processed using the following workflow: MaxConcurrency can be configured to specify the number of child workflow executions in a Distributed Map that can run in parallel. If not specified, then Step Functions doesn’t limit concurrency and runs 10,000 parallel child workflow executions. You can read a JSON file from a S3 bucket using ItemReader and its sub-fields. If the JSON file, from the S3 bucket, contains a nested object structure, you can select the specific node with your data set with an ItemsPointer. For example, the following input JSON file: The following JSONata-based workflow configuration extracts a nested list of products from productUpdates/items: For JSONPath-based workflow note that Arguments is replaced with Parameters: The ItemReader field is not needed when your dataset is JSON data from a previous step. ItemsPointer is only applicable when the input JSON objects read from an S3 bucket. If you are using JSON as state input to a Distributed Map, then you can use the ItemsPath (for JSONPath) or Items (for JSONata) field to specify a location in the input that points to JSON array or object used for iterations. To use Step Functions Distributed Map, verify you have: Run the following steps to deploy the Step Functions state machine. Enter the following details: The outputs from the sam deploy will be used in the subsequent steps. The state machine reads the input product-updates.json file and invokes a Lambda function to update the database for every product in the array after adding price and stock information. The execution metadata is also uploaded into the results bucket. Run the following steps to monitor and verify the test results. Wait until the status shows SUCCEEDED. To avoid costs, remove all resources you’ve created while following along with this post. Run the following command after replacing the <placeholder> variable to delete the resources you deployed for this post’s solution: In this post, you learned how to use Step Functions Distributed Map for extracting array data natively from JSON objects stored in a S3 bucket. By removing custom data extraction code, you can simplify the processing of your large-scale parallel workloads. With ItemsPointer you can extract array data within JSON files stored in a S3 bucket , and with Items(JSONata) or ItemsPath (JSONPath), you can extract arrays from complex JSON state input, adding flexibility to your workflow designs. New input sources for Distributed Map are available in all commercial AWS Regions where AWS Step Functions is available. For a complete list of AWS Regions where Step Functions is available, see the AWS Region Table. To get started, you can use the Distributed Map mode today in the AWS Step Functions console.

PHOTO: REUTERS Published Nov 05, 2025, 07:00 AM Updated Nov 05, 2025, 08:31 AM BENGALURU - IBM will cut roles this quarter, the company said on Nov 4, potentially impacting thousands of employees while it shifts focus towards its high-margin software segment, as Wall Street hones in on the company’s ability to benefit from artificial intelligence-linked cloud demand. “We routinely review our workforce… and at times rebalance accordingly,” the company said in a statement. “In the fourth quarter, we are executing an action that will impact a low single-digit percentage of our global workforce.” A massive supplier of technology to businesses, IBM joins other companies including Amazon, Meta and Google that have made recent staffing cuts as they race to invest more in the AI boom. Many executives have predicted more efficiency gains as the technology assists workers with coding and other tasks. Under chief executive Arvind Krishna, IBM has doubled down on software as it looks to tap increased spending on cloud services through its “Red Hat” division, as businesses integrate AI technology. However, IBM in October recorded a slowdown in growth in the key cloud software segment, raising alarm bells among investors betting heavily on Big Blue’s ability to benefit more from booming cloud services demand. Its shares, which have risen over 35 per cent in 2025, were down close to 2 per cent on Nov 4. IBM employed about 270,000 workers as at the end of 2024. Some US workers may be affected by the job reductions, but employment in the country is anticipated to remain roughly the same year over year, IBM said.

Title: JPMorgan Tokenizes PE Fund on In-house Blockchain

The move comes before the bank’s full rollout of its tokenization platform next year. Griffin Kelly griffin@thedailyupside.com Let’s get digital, digital. JPMorgan took another step toward decentralized finance last week when it tokenized and conducted a transaction of a private equity fund on its blockchain platform. The move is setting the table for the bank’s Kinexy’s Fund Flow, a tokenization platform it plans to roll out in full next year. JPMorgan expects to tokenize other alts, including private credit, real estate, and hedge funds, in the future, The Wall Street Journal reported. It’s also exploring the possibility of allowing clients to use fund tokens as collateral for borrowing or constructing a portfolio of tokenized assets. “Enabling real-time tri-party settlement between fund managers, transfer agents and distributors will ultimately unlock new sources of liquidity and more flexible portfolio construction,” said Anton Pil, head of JPMorgan’s global alternative investment solutions. The firm did not comment on the specific PE fund that was tokenized. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon once described crypto as a “pet rock” (ouch). But while the bank and many other traditional lenders are warming to digital currencies, they’ve always seen more opportunity in blockchain technology that can tokenize any asset, financial or real, for faster, cheaper and easier trading: Across the Pond. While the GENIUS Act has established a regulatory framework for US dollar-backed stablecoins and is fueling innovation in the token economy, Europe seems to be ahead of the curve in some regards. Last month, France’s Lise Exchange became the first European platform authorized to trade and settle listed shares entirely on blockchain. And just this week, Switzerland’s BX Digital partnered with the New York-based Ondo Finance to launch tokenized versions of stocks and ETFs on BX’s platform that can be traded 24/7. We’ve got a couple of leftover skee ball tokens from Palace Amusements. Are those worth anything? The investment bank has acquired EquityZen, giving Morgan Stanley clients greater access to private company investments. That works out to an additional $56 per retirement payment, bringing the average monthly benefit to more than $2,000. As mega RIAs get bigger, some advisors are saying that the independent channel is beginning to look a lot like Wall Street. Florida-based Hinck Private Wealth Management is the latest formerly Commonwealth team to join Osaic’s growing network of RIAs. SIFMA called the current regulations burdensome, costly and unnecessary. Sub-acquisitions made up 31% of all RIA M&A activity in 2025 amid rampant private equity investment in the industry. Pretty much all of Wall Street reported another quarter of stellar earnings this week. As others have sought 3x leveraged ETFs, VolatilityShares is going further, raising the question of what the SEC’s leverage limit could be. Shah will remain with the company until the end of the year in an advisory capacity. Company CEO Yoav Zurel criticised the firm for blocking customers from accessing their 401(k)s. The acquisition is the latest, and largest,example of mega-firms making moves to buy out competitors in a rapidly consolidating industry. The complete blockchain overhaul of financial markets could happen in the next two decades, according to experts. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/04/2025 3:02:33 PM PST by SunkenCiv What's really happening with AI and Amazon's layoffs? The common story is that automation killed 30,000 jobs -- but the reality is more complicated. In this video, I share the inside scoop on what's actually driving these cuts and what it reveals about the AI economy: Why Amazon's profits depend on AWS, not retail operations How surging GPU demand is reshaping corporate AI strategy What Wall Street misunderstands about "AI automation" narratives Where media coverage keeps missing the real AI growth signal For operators and teams, the takeaway is clear: AI isn't replacing labor yet -- it's reallocating capital, and understanding that shift will define who wins the next decade.

Title: Burry’s New ‘Big Short’ on AI
URL: https://dailyreckoning.com/burrys-new-big-short-on-ai/
Time Published: 2025-11-04T23:00:30Z
Full Content:
By Adam Sharp PostedNovember 4, 2025 The Big Short is one of my favorite movies (and books). It’s a powerful story of investors who bet against the housing bubble, persevered through adversity, and won big. The story focuses on Michael J. Burry, a small but successful hedge fund manager in California. In the movie, Burry is played by actor Christian Bale. There are others featured in The Big Short who bet against the housing market, but today we’re going to focus on Burry and his new AI short. First, however, some background is in order. Back around 2004-2005, Burry discovered that lenders were giving huge loans to borrowers with bad credit, and as a topper, many of these mortgages were teasers with adjustable rates. The first few years were artificially cheap, then payments would balloon. Burry dissected the data, and discovered a great way to bet against housing using credit default swaps (CDS) on mortgage bonds. Many of Burry’s hedge fund clients thought he was insane. Betting so much of the fund’s capital against housing seemed ludicrous. Burry was forced to restrict fund redemptions, so his investors had no choice but to ride along with him. When the bubble finally burst, Burry’s fund made a killing. After fees, his big short returned almost 500% to investors. Burry had beat the big banks at their own game. But be warned. This story has inspired countless traders to attempt their own big shorts, with mixed results. At best… Michael J. Burry is a reclusive fellow. He keeps a low profile, but occasionally resurfaces on X (Twitter). On X, Burry goes by the handle “Cassandra”. Cassandra was an ancient Trojan priestess dedicated to the god Apollo. She was cursed with the ability to predict the future, but never be believed. The last time Burry reappeared was in January of 2023, when he posted a simple message: Sell. Via ZeroHedge Since then, the market has soared 69% higher. Burry got burnt on that big short. Shortly after, Burry deleted all his X posts and deactivated his account. But now Cassandra has finally returned to X. Just as 13F SEC filings disclosed his hedge fund, Scion Capital, took big short positions on Palantir (PLTR) and NVIDIA (NVDA). As of September 30th (these filings have a delay), Burry’s hedge fund held puts worth $912 million in Palantir and $186 million in NVIDIA (notional). Burry has seemingly initiated a new ‘Big Short’ on AI. It isn’t surprising to me that Burry is betting big against Palantir. It might be the most overvalued large-cap stock I’ve ever seen. The chart shows just how unusual Palantir’s valuation is. To be clear, Palantir is growing fast and appears to have tech which nobody else does. But it still looks way overpriced. Its current price-to-sales ratio is an incredible 126x. The company is valued at $491 billion and only produced $3.9 billion of revenue over the past year. Even during the dotcom bubble, no large company ever reached such lofty heights. Burry followed up his big AI short disclosure with some charts showing how AI bubble spending is similar to the dotcom era: We should remember that these filings have a delay, so these were Scion’s positions as of September 30th. Since then both NVDA and PLTR have risen, which means that thus far, Burry’s bet is down. He could have sold out of these positions, or added to them. We don’t know. Attempting to nail the top on red-hot stocks like these is extremely difficult. Even when he made the housing bubble bet, Burry had to wait years for it to pay off. In the meantime, he had to pay significant premiums on the CDS (his short instrument). For a while, it looked like his housing bet might fail. But eventually the housing bubble did pop, and Burry came out way ahead. We’ll have to wait and see whether he’ll be proven correct with this latest AI short. It’s easy to see that certain AI stocks are overvalued. Timing the short, however, is the tricky part. Today Palantir is down almost 7% today after reporting earnings yesterday. Palantir CEO and co-founder Alex Karp isn’t happy about Burry’s short position, calling it “market manipulation”. He told CNBC the following this morning: “The two companies he’s shorting are the ones making all the money, which is super weird. The idea that chips and ontology is what you want to short is bats**t crazy. … I do think this behavior is egregious and I’m going to be dancing around when it’s proven wrong.” Is this the beginning of the crash? Or just a correction after a parabolic move, and there’s more upside ahead? I’m not taking a bet either way, for now. My advice: don’t bet the house on an AI collapse. As Keynes famously said, the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. We’ll be keeping a close eye on this story.

Title: Don’t Panic, But AI Stocks Are Suddenly Lurching Downward

By Victor Tangermann Published Nov 4, 2025 4:50 PM EST Investors are increasingly becoming concerned that AI companies may be grossly overvalued — and could struggle to justify their enormous hype by successfully ratcheting up profits. So it’s naturally alarming that shares of AI industry stalwarts, including Oracle, Nvidia, AMD, and Amazon, fell sharply on Tuesday, following concerns over enormous valuations that have propped up the entire US economy for months now. AI chipmaker Nvidia’s shares dipped just shy of four percent, while competitor AMD’s slid just under three percent today. Software giant Palantir was hit hardest, dropping over nine percent, despite beating Wall Street expectations with its Q3 earnings. What all of these companies have in common is an enormous price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), CNBC reports, which measures a firm’s share price relative to its earnings per share. It’s often used to determine whether a company is over- or undervalued. In the case of Palantir, the company’s valuation is upwards of 200 times its forward earnings, suggesting investors could be starting to ask difficult questions about the firm’s ability to sufficiently boost its revenues. The sudden dip comes after months of investor euphoria. The S&P 500 index has risen over 20 percent over the last six months alone, only to decline just under two percent over the last five days, indicating growing concerns over AI hype that grew too much, too fast. Companies have been pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into major AI infrastructure buildouts, despite revenues lagging far behind. “We haven’t really seen any major corrections or any real pressure on stocks since April,” Ameriprise chief market strategist Anthony Saglimbene told CNBC. “Profits are good, but I think investors are starting to ask themselves, based on the pace of [capital expenditure] investments from some of these key Big Tech companies, ‘Are you going to see the profit growth over the next year to justify the levels of capex?'” Saglimbene argued that he “would fully expect that you’re going to see a little bit of some periods of pullback.” Goldman Sachs’ David Solomon also raised alarms, predicting a “ten to 20 percent drawdown in equity markets sometime in the next 12 to 24 months.” Just last week, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that the firm would increase its already enormous AI spending significantly this year — news that was met with investor skepticism. The company’s shares slid by more than 11 percent on Thursday and are down over 16 percent over the last five days. It’s a precarious moment, with experts warning that the AI boom cycle is propping up a weakening economy. The consequences of a sudden collapse could be enormous. Meanwhile, some are cashing in on the dipping shares. Most notably, investor Michael Burry of “The Big Short” fame disclosed he had placed bets against Palantir and Nvidia this week. Burry famously predicted the US housing market bubble and the following crash in 2008. Whether he’s right about an impending correction remains to be seen. Palantir CEO Alex Karp, for one, is unsurprisingly skeptical of Burry’s bets. “The two companies he’s shorting are the ones making all the money, which is super weird,” he told CNBC today. “The idea that chips and ontology is what you want to short is bats*** crazy.” More on the AI market: Meta Stock Plummets as Investors Horrified at How Much Zuckerberg Is Spending on Misfired AI I’m a senior editor at Futurism, where I edit and write about NASA and the private space sector, as well as topics ranging from SETI and artificial intelligence to tech and medical policy.

As launch costs plummet, a record wave of issuers — independent traders, hedge-fund holdouts, mutual-fund refugees — is testing whether conviction and capital are enough to crack BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street's dominance. November 4, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- Sofia Massie left her job at Jane Street in January with one thing: an idea for an ETF that would mirror the US stock market but quietly hold onto dividends, wringing out a tax advantage many investors never see. She didn’t have a team. Or a brand. Or the institutional heft that usually comes with a Wall Street-backed launch. What she did have was about $300,000 — and a white-label firm to handle the mechanics. Eight months later, the LionShares US Equity Total Return ETF (TOT) went live. Massie’s fund is one of dozens now reshaping the $13 trillion ETF industry. As launch costs plummet, a record wave of issuers — independent traders, hedge-fund holdouts, mutual-fund refugees — is testing whether conviction and capital are enough. The dominance of the industry’s big three players is starting to crack: BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group and State Street Investment Management drew just 57% of investor flows this year, their lowest share on record. But as the flood of new funds accelerates, so does the race for shelf space, relevance — and survival. “Launching an ETF is very easy for anyone who has the money to do it,” Massie, 25, said. “The main challenge I had was keeping the cost low and starting the fund as a one-woman team.” Related:AUM Thresholds, Limited Track Records Dampen B/D Appetites for New ETFs The past two years — during which ETFs attracted more than $2 trillion in investor cash — have seen 60 new issuers enter the ETF market, the most on record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. More firms have launched ETFs since 2020 than in the entire period dating back to the debut of the first exchange-traded fund in 1993. And it’s not just emerging players that are being drawn to the field. Big-name hedge funds like Man Group Plc, storied European asset managers like Pictet Group and old-school mutual fund managers like Baron Capital are diving in. All are racing to capture a share of the trillions of dollars that have poured into the market in recent years. Industry watchers say the list of firms yet to jump in is set to grow thanks to fresh regulatory breakthroughs, including the potential approval of ETFs as share classes of mutual funds, and expedited listings for commodity-based products, including crypto-linked ETFs. “The ETF footprint is only set to keep expanding,” said Athanasios Psarofagis, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “It’s increasingly self-evident that the ETF is a better wrapper. Asset managers that fail to embrace it risk being left behind as the industry evolves.” Demand for easy-to-trade vehicles keeps climbing. ETFs now make up 36% of all US fund assets, double their share from a decade ago, BI data show. Still, just one in three of the more than 600 US asset managers BI tracks offer them, meaning that plenty could still enter the arena. Related:Schwab: Majority of Retail Investors Plan to Up ETF Allocations For many, working with a white-label issuer streamlines the process. The firms can take care of various back-end work, including filing for funds and working out sales and distribution plans. “The barriers to entry in the ETF space have come down dramatically — what used to take years and millions of dollars can now be done in months for a fraction of that cost,” Gavin Filmore, chief revenue officer at Tidal Financial Group, said. “The real challenge today is differentiation and distribution.” Tidal, a full-stack white-label ETF platform, now oversees more than $50 billion in assets, having rolled out some 138 funds this year — a 52% jump from 2024 and more than twice as many as two years ago. ETF launch costs vary by complexity, strategy and structure, but Filmore estimates around $65,000 is needed to set up a fund and about $225,000 in annual operating expenses. That’s down approximately 20% from a decade ago. As competition has heated up — ETF launches have tripled since 2021 — closures have also surged. This year, roughly one ETF has shut down for every five that have debuted, data compiled by Bloomberg show. With more than 4,500 funds now in existence, keeping an ETF alive has become tougher, as oversaturation makes it harder to attract and retain enough assets to remain cost-efficient and liquid.Two months after launch, Massie’s handed off the day-to-day mechanics — fund accounting and custody — to a network of specialist service providers.

Title: Elon Musk’s future at Tesla in balance as shareholders consider $1 trillion pay package

Elon Musk’s future at Tesla could hang in the balance on Thursday when shareholders vote on whether to approve his record-shattering $1 trillion pay package. The controversial proposal, which is scheduled to be considered at Tesla’s annual meeting in Texas, would hand Musk an unprecedented payout tied to a series of performance benchmarks. Critics – including key proxy advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis and even Pope Leo XIV – argue the proposed salary is excessive. Meanwhile, Tesla chairwoman Robyn Denholm and Musk himself have warned that he could leave the company entirely if shareholders reject the proposal. “Tesla may lose his time, talent and vision, which have been essential to delivering extraordinary shareholder returns,” Denholm said in a recent letter posted on X. Musk has framed the vote in near-apocalyptic terms – declaring in an Oct. 29 X post that “control of Tesla could affect the future of civilization.” The billionaire has argued that he needs greater voting control offered by the stock grants in order to effectively guide Tesla’s future plans for artificial intelligence, which include the robots and full self-driving technology. Musk would control nearly 29% of voting shares if he hits all targets. The jaw-dropping pay package, unveiled in a September proxy filing, was crafted by Tesla’s board after a Delaware judge struck down a previous $56 billion compensation plan for Musk. The judge ruled that the previous package, which was approved in 2018, was excessive and riddled with conflicts of interest. Under the latest proposal, one tranche of Musk’s pay would be awarded if Tesla hits a $2 trillion valuation and delivers 20 million vehicles. Another would kick in if Tesla is valued at $3 trillion and delivers 1 million of its “Optimus” humanoid robots. The new pay package drew a major rebuke this week from Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, which became the largest Tesla stakeholder to say it opposed the plan. “While we appreciate the significant value created under Mr. Musk’s visionary role, we are concerned about the total size of the award, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk,” stated Norges Bank Investment Management, which oversees the sovereign wealth fund. Tesla shares were down nearly 5% in Tuesday’s trading. Pope Leo XIV previously cited Musk’s pay package as an example of the loss of “the value of human life, of the family, of the value of society.” “Yesterday, the news [arrived] that Elon Musk is going to be the first trillionaire in the world,” Leo told Catholic news outlet Crux in an interview published in September. “What does that mean, and what’s that about?” the pontiff continued. “If that is the only thing that has any value any more, then we are in big trouble.” ISS and Glass Lewis have also recommended that shareholders say no, asserting that the pay is excessive and could dilute the holdings of other investors. Tesla’s largest individual investors, including BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard, have yet to reveal how they plan to vote. Despite the lingering uncertainty, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said he expects shareholders to give a “bright green light” to the plan. “With the AI Revolution this is a crucial time for Tesla ahead with autonomous and robotics front and center,” Ives said in a note to clients on Monday. “We expect shareholders to show overwhelming support for Musk and the xAI stake further turning Tesla into an AI juggernaut with the autonomous and robotics future on the horizon.” With Post wires Advertisement

Title: Altcoin giant Animoca Brands aims to go public next year, listing will test investor appetite for exotic crypto assets

Another crypto company is headed to Wall Street. Animoca Brands, a Hong Kong-based blockchain developer and investor, plans to list on the Nasdaq via a reverse merger with Currenc, which is a Singapore-based fintech company. The planned public listing is notable because Animoca stands out from other recent crypto offerings, including Circle and Gemini, because its business does not revolve around exchanges or stablecoins. Instead, the firm’s focus is in altcoins, or cryptocurrencies other than mainstays like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Animoca has invested in over 600 blockchain companies, according to a statement released on Monday. Some of its most notable past investments include stakes in the failed metaverse platform Sandbox. “The proposed merger of Animoca Brands and Currenc will result in the world’s first publicly-listed, diversified digital assets conglomerate,” said Yat Siu, co-founder of Animoca Brands. The deal is set to be finalized in 2026. Animoca’s shareholders will own 95% of the company and current shareholders of Currenc will own the other 5%, according to the statement. Reverse mergers and SPACs, or special purpose acquisition companies, like the one Animoca is pursuing, have become one of the preferred ways for crypto companies to launch on the stock market. In late 2022, the stablecoin issuer Circle prepared to merge with a SPAC, only to see that plan fall through. And Securitize, the tokenization firm with ties to BlackRock, announced last week that it would go public via a SPAC of its own. And in May, American Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency mining and holding company backed by Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., announced it was going public through a reverse merger with the company Gryphon Digital Mining. This is not Animoca’s first experience with public markets. It was previously listed on the Australian Securities Exchanges before being delisted in 2020 because of concerns about compliance with listing rules. The Animoca reverse merger coincides with a rough moment for altcoins, as the market has fallen $800 billion short of what past cycles would suggest. Retail investors in South Korea have flocked to crypto-linked equities instead, and last month’s flash crash put a dent in non-Bitcoin tokens. Despite altcoins’ shortcomings, investors have flocked to certain tokens, which have experienced an unprecedented surge under Donald Trump’s administration. Solana and Binance Coin both have notched all-time highs in the past year. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: 5 clear signals that will prove if the Bitcoin bull run is still alive

If everyone is buying Bitcoin why is it falling? $715M says they are not. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Crypto Twitter is filled with claims that “everyone is buying Bitcoin”, from Michael Saylor and BlackRock to entire countries and even banks. Yet despite the accumulation narratives, Bitcoin’s price has slipped sharply, breaking below key levels as ETF flows turned negative. The contradiction between bullish headlines and falling prices emphasizes a crucial point: in markets driven by liquidity and marginal flow, who’s actually buying, and when, matters far more than who says they are. Bitcoin fell through $106,400 as spot ETF flows turned negative over four consecutive sessions. The shift came as BlackRock’s IBIT logged redemptions over the last four days, totaling $714.8 million, removing a significant source of daily demand right as a widely watched cycle pivot gave way. According to Farside Investors, the outflows of $88.1 million, $290.9 million, $149.3 million, and then $186.5 million coincided with the breakdown. They forced selling by authorized participants who redeemed shares for underlying Bitcoin and offloaded them into the market. Thus, the net flow flipped. When creations slow and redemptions rise across the U.S. spot ETF complex, the daily bid that helped absorb volatility turns into a source of supply. Mid-October saw stretches of net outflows across digital asset funds as Bitcoin battled to stay above $106,400. While there were brief inflow days late in the month, the most recent run tilted back into the red, a pattern that aligns with the IBIT prints captured above. The mechanical impact matters because ETF flow translates into spot buys or sells, and the timing overlaps with a break of a level that many traders use to distinguish a late-cycle pullback from a trend resumption. The CME three-month futures premium has cooled to roughly 4 to 5 percent annualized over the back half of the year, curbing carry-trade incentives that pull institutional basis demand into rallies. At the same time, funding on perpetual swaps turned softer or negative at points, a setup that accelerates down moves when longs de-risk and liquidations cluster. In these conditions, slow, scheduled spot accumulation from corporates or sovereign entities does not offset forced unwinds on leverage or redemptions on regulated products that translate directly to spot sells. Macro has not eased the path. The U.S. Dollar Index rebounded toward the 98-100 area in November after a weak first half, while the U.S. 10-year yield, near 4.1 percent, keeps real rates restrictive. A firmer dollar and tight real yields tend to compress global liquidity and weigh on long-duration risk, and bitcoin continues to respond to those impulses at tactical horizons. When flows are roughly flat, the dollar often decides whether a bounce holds or fades. Supply narratives also persist. The Mt. Gox rehabilitation timeline was extended again to October 31, 2026, following partial distributions earlier this year, which keeps a recurring overhang in focus, even if actual sales are staggered. Periodic trustee updates and wallet movements have repeatedly tightened risk tolerance on rebounds. Miners remain another valve. Post-halving economics has also left hashprice near cycle lows relative to the spring spike. That backdrop creates ongoing incentives for treasury monetization on stress days, which can align with soft funding to add procyclical pressure. I recently called $126,000 as the cycle high and $106,400 as the bull-bear pivot. The price just lost that pivot as the ETF bid turned into net selling, while basis stayed subdued and funding cooled. Interestingly, common on-chain and cycle monitors, such as the 2-Year MA Multiplier, Pi Cycle Top, and RHODL, have failed to reach euphoria this cycle, even near the highs. Metrics are already slipping toward distribution and mean reversion as flow support has faded. This could mean the bull run will be extended this cycle, or it could represent diminishing returns when compared to prior cycle transitions. These tools are not standalone timing devices. Still, when they align with daily flow inflection and macro stiffness, traders tend to withdraw liquidity, which amplifies the impact of incremental sells. Nation-state purchases are episodic and small compared to daily turnover, and corporate treasuries operate on idiosyncratic schedules. Banks often facilitate client activity rather than deploying balance-sheet risk daily. None of those actors offset a week where issuers that normally create shares instead redeem, funding drifts toward or below zero, and the dollar firms. The marginal seller rules the tape in that mix. The near-term path depends on whether spot creations reappear and the basis expands. A continued run of net outflow days from the largest U.S. spot ETFs, especially IBIT and FBTC, with CME basis pinned near or below 5 percent annualized and funding flat to negative, would keep the market in a distribution phase. Under that setup, failing to reclaim $106,400 leaves $100,000 as the battleground and opens the mid to high $90,000s on further red sessions, particularly if the macro stays tight. A more neutral outcome, with oscillating but smaller flows, a basis stabilizing in the 5-7 percent zone, and a range-bound dollar around 97-100, argues for digestion between $100,000 and $106,000 while liquidity rebuilds. The upside case requires a return of multi-day net creations in the $300 to $800 million range across the complex, based on pushing above 8 to 10 percent, and a softer dollar. That mix would allow a retest of $110,000 to $115,000 and reopen the debate around the cycle top if flows persist. One way to track the state of play is to focus on daily issuer-level flows, then layer in derivatives and macroeconomic factors. The last four trading days flipped the spot-ETF bid into a sustained net seller, exactly as Bitcoin lost its pivot. With CME basis subdued and funding soft, the marginal price was driven by de-risking rather than dip-buying. A firmer USD and sticky real yields rounded out a flow-led break, not a referendum on long-term adoption. Until daily creations return and $ 106,400 is reclaimed, this remains a distribution-and-digest phase within the broader cycle. Lastly, unless the historic Bitcoin cycle pattern has been disrupted by the influx of corporate treasuries and ETF flows, then Father Time has already spoken. If Bitcoin were to reach a new all-time high by the end of the year or in 2026, it would mark the latest cycle high ever.

Title: Rise of the AI Job-Killing Machines

Amazon, Paramount Skydance and others have made mass layoffs. Is artificial intelligence the culprit? By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Will AI lead to major job cuts in corporate America? Here’s what OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot says: “The short answer is: AI will almost certainly cause some layoffs, but it’s unlikely to eliminate most jobs outright. Instead, it’s more likely to transform the nature of many roles and reshape the workforce over time.” A nuanced take, perhaps. But there’s evidence that a long-speculated seismic shake-up of the U.S. labor force driven by AI is starting to happen. Related Stories Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo Do Barbra Streisand and Judy Garland Proud With 'Happy' Duet on 'Wicked' TV Special: The History Behind the Mellifluous Mashup Cynthia Erivo Heads to Court in ‘Prima Facie’ First Look as Movie Adaptation of Award-Winning Play Unveils Supporting Cast (EXCLUSIVE) Amazon last week announced the elimination of 14,000 corporate jobs, representing about 4% of its total white-collar workforce. A company HR exec cited rapid developments coming in AI, saying “this generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the internet.” In the next few years, the e-commerce giant forecasts a net reduction in its total corporate headcount “as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company,” CEO Andy Jassy wrote in a companywide memo in June. Popular on Variety On Oct. 30, Jassy downplayed the AI job-destruction narrative. He told analysts on Amazon’s Q3 earnings call the cuts are “not even really AI-driven. Not right now at least.” What they are about, he said, is “culture,” saying Amazon’s fast growth has produced “more layers” of job functions that can be streamlined. Certainly, Amazon isn’t handing out pink slips because of dire financial stress: It reported total quarterly revenue of $180.2 billion (up 13%) and net income of $21.2 billion (up 38%). Paramount Skydance also initiated layoffs last week, targeting about 2,000 job eliminations (10% of its total workforce) after the closure of Skydance Media’s $8 billion takeover of Paramount Global less than three months ago. In a memo to staff about the cuts, chief David Ellison didn’t specifically mention AI; he said the reductions aimed to phase out “roles that are no longer aligned with our evolving priorities.” But Ellison — son of Oracle multibillionaire Larry Ellison — has routinely espoused taking a tech-forward Silicon Valley approach to managing a major media company, by using big data and automation. Ellison has on multiple occasions said that he wants to “embrace AI.” In a press briefing shortly after he clinched the Paramount pact in July 2024, Ellison said: “We view this time period as being pretty similar to some of the transitions that some of the traditional tech companies went through, such as Microsoft and Oracle, where they disrupted their own businesses to have all-time [stock] highs.” Meanwhile, Google’s YouTube is anticipating AI-induced workforce reductions. AI is “the next frontier” for YouTube and “has the potential to transform every part of the platform,” CEO Neal Mohan wrote in a memo last week to staffers, announcing a major reorg of its product team geared around an AI-centric future. “We need to set ourselves up to make the most of this opportunity,” Mohan said — and as part of the shift to AI, YouTube is introducing a “voluntary exit program” for employees. A spokesperson confirmed that YouTube is offering a buyout option with severance for U.S.-based workers but said no role eliminations or layoffs are part of the reorg. AI superpowers are pumping billions of dollars into building data-processing factories. In reporting Q3 results, Meta, Google, Microsoft and Amazon each raised annual capex guidance to boost AI capacity, and they plan to continue spending heavily. Nvidia, the leading chipmaker for powering AI applications, last week became the first company to hit a $5 trillion market cap. The dramatic impact of AI on employment is undeniable. The World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 found that 40% of employers expect to reduce their workforce where AI can automate tasks. “Innovation” related to artificial intelligence could “displace” 6%-7% of the U.S. workforce in the coming years if AI is widely adopted, according to a research report from Goldman Sachs published in August 2025. However, the impact is likely to be “transitory as new job opportunities created by the technology ultimately put people to work in other capacities,” according to the report. Most jobs at risk are entry-level, white-collar roles that can be performed more easily by computers, a World Economic Forum analysis found. The org cited research estimating that AI could replace 53% of the work done by market analysts and 67% of the tasks handled by sales reps. But the robots are coming for many other lines of work. AI was a hot-button issue during the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes, as the unions feared studios would increasingly use the tech to eliminate jobs for flesh-and-blood humans. The unions ultimately won AI-related concessions from the studios in new contracts, including mandating explicit consent from actors for the use of “digital replicas.” “AI can create a convincing simulation of a human actor, and the tech is improving at an alarming rate,”actor and filmmaker Justine Bateman, an adviser to SAG-AFTRA, told Variety at the time — two years before the hyperrealistic AI “actress” Tilly Norwood ignited an uproar after its U.K. creator said Norwood had secured talent-agency representation. Of course, workers’ fears about machines making them obsolete date to the dawn of the Industrial Revolution. Techno-utopians point out that, historically, advancements have led to the explosion of huge new business sectors and jobs. Just one example: Google, which didn’t exist three decades ago, employed 190,167 people as of the end of September. Some Hollywood leaders, including Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos, have pushed the idea that AI is a net positive for creatives. “AI isn’t replacing storytellers — it’s creating tools that empower them to tell stories they never could before,” he said last month on an episode of the “Aspire With Emma Grede” podcast. In the same breath, however, Sarandos wondered whether making a “$300 million or $400 million movie” makes sense if the “monetization model” doesn’t justify the math. Generative AI tools, the exec said, “can do a very similar thing for a more controllable price.” You can forgive workers in the moviemaking trenches for hearing that as code for job cuts.

Title: Uber Shares Fall 9% Despite Reporting Strong Q3 Earnings

Time Published: 2025-11-04T15:48:18Z
Full Content:
Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 Uber Technologies (NYSE: UBER) delivered a massive earnings beat this morning, but the stock is selling off in premarket trading anyway. That’s the tension worth watching right now. Uber reported Q3 earnings this morning with EPS of $1.20, crushing the $0.70 consensus estimate. Revenue came in at $13.47 billion, missing expectations of $13.54 billion by $70 million. The stock declined 9% in premarket trading to $92.25, suggesting investors are focusing more on the revenue shortfall and guidance implications than the headline EPS surprise. Trips and Bookings Drive the Momentum The real story here is operational velocity. Gross bookings reached $49.74 billion, up 21% year over year. Trips increased 22% YoY, marking what CEO Dara Khosrowshahi called “one of the largest trip-volume increases in the company’s history.” Monthly active platform consumers grew 17% YoY, indicating consistent user expansion across the platform. Both segments showed strength. Mobility revenue hit $7.68 billion, up 20%, while Delivery revenue jumped to $4.48 billion, up 29%. Adjusted EBITDA expanded 33% YoY to $2.26 billion. Free cash flow reached $2.23 billion, a signal that profitability is translating into real cash generation, not just accounting improvements. The $70 million revenue miss is modest in absolute terms but meaningful in context. With gross bookings accelerating and trips surging, you’d expect revenue to track higher. The gap suggests either mix headwinds (lower-margin business growing faster) or pricing pressure in core markets. I’d keep an eye on this during the earnings call. What’s not in doubt is margin expansion. Operating income hit $1.11 billion, and net income reached $6.63 billion. That includes a $4.9 billion tax valuation release benefit, so strip that out and the underlying profitability picture is still strong. EPS: $1.20 (vs. $0.70 expected)Revenue: $13.47B (vs. $13.54B expected); miss by $70MGross Bookings: $49.74B (vs. implied ~$48.7B); up 21% YoYAdjusted EBITDA: $2.26B (up 33% YoY)Free Cash Flow: $2.23BTrips: Up 22% YoYMonthly Active Platform Consumers: Up 17% YoY The adjusted EBITDA growth outpacing revenue growth shows operational leverage kicking in. That’s the metric that justifies the current valuation multiple. For Q4 2025, management guided for gross bookings of $52.25 billion to $53.75 billion, representing 17% to 21% YoY growth on constant currency. Adjusted EBITDA guidance of $2.41 billion to $2.51 billion implies 31% to 36% YoY growth. The company also noted a 1 percentage point currency tailwind expected to boost Q4 growth. The guidance range suggests confidence, though the revenue miss today tempers enthusiasm slightly. Khosrowshahi’s commentary leaned bullish, emphasizing investments in “lifelong customer relationships,” local commerce expansion, and AI and autonomous vehicle potential. The tone was optimistic but not reckless. You’ll want to listen for clarity on the revenue miss. Was it mix shift, pricing pressure, or timing? Also watch for any commentary on competitive dynamics in core markets and how the company plans to sustain delivery growth, which is now outpacing mobility on a percentage basis. The path to $108.88 (current analyst price target) depends on whether margin expansion continues without sacrificing volume.

Title: Denny's to go private in $620 million deal for the 72-year-old breakfast chain

Watch CBS News Updated on: November 4, 2025 / 10:59 AM EST / CBS/AP Denny's, the breakfast chain known for classic diner food and its Grand Slam Breakfast, is going private in a $620 million deal orchestrated by a group of investors. The deal, announced Monday, values the chain at $620 million, including debt. The investors purchasing the company are private equity investment company TriArtisan Capital Advisors, investment firm Treville Capital and Denny's franchisee Yadav Enterprises. Under the agreement, Denny's shareholders will receive $6.25 per share in cash for each share of Denny's common stock they own, or a total of $322 million. That represents a 52% premium to Denny's closing stock price on Monday. Denny's shares jumped $2.05, or 50%, to $6.17 in early Tuesday trading. Founded in 1953 as Danny's Donuts, the company changed its name to Denny's in 1959 to avoid confusion with another chain, and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange a decade later. During the past two years, Denny's has struggled to boost sales as consumers shifted toward a reliance on delivery through apps like Uber Eats, while newer rivals such as First Watch offered healthier breakfast menus. Private equity firm TriArtisan owns restaurant chains P.F. Chang's and TGI Friday's, while Yadav Enterprises owns more than 310 franchise restaurants, including Denny's, TGI Friday's and Jack in the Box. Treville Capital is an investment firm whose chairman is Michael Ovitz, the co-founder of Creative Artists Agency and former president of the Walt Disney Co. Denny's reached out to more than 40 potential buyers and received multiple offers, Denny's CEO Kelli Valade said in a statement. Valade said Denny's board believed the deal announced Monday was in the best interest of shareholders and the best path forward for the company. "Denny's is an iconic piece of the American dream, with a renowned brand, a strong franchise base and loyal customers," said Rohit Manocha, co-founder at TriArtisan, in the statement. Last fall, Denny's said it planned to close 150 of its lowest-performing locations. At the end of the second quarter, Denny's had 1,558 restaurants worldwide, including 1,422 Denny's restaurants and 74 Keke's restaurants. Denny's acquired the Keke's brand in 2022. If approved by Denny's shareholders, the deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 After testing all-time highs, the major indices are in the red this morning. Dow futures are down 301 points. Nasdaq futures are down 344, as the S&P 500 sinks about 70 points. All thanks to a decline in Palantir’s overvalued shares, despite the company beating earnings estimates and offering solid guidance. There are also concerns about the stretched valuations of other key AI stocks and their ability to boost profits to justify numbers. Still, analysts are out with new upgrades. Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO): Analysts at Jefferies reiterated a buy rating on AVGO and named it as a top pick. The firm also raised its price target to $480 from $415. As noted by the analysts, “While NVDA remains the leader and we still see upside there, AVGO has a greater magnitude of estimate upside as Google, Meta, and OAI ASICs ramp,” as quoted by CNBC. “Google has long been the main ASIC customer for AVGO, but those volumes should become much more meaningful in C26/27.” Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA): Loop Capital reiterated its buy rating on the tech giant and hiked its price target to $350 from $250. The firm believes NVDA can double its GPU shipments over the next year to 15 months to 2.1 million by the January 2026 quarter. Goldman Sachs reiterated its buy rating on NVDA with a price target of $240 from $210 ahead of earnings, as well. The firm believes investor expectations have increased heading into NVDA earnings, thanks to multiple AI infrastructure announcements. The firm also believes NVDA will provide a beat and raise quarter. Helping, Nvidia is up on news that Microsoft secured export licenses from the Trump Administration to ship NVDA chips to the United Arab Emirates. CoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV): Analysts at Citi reiterated a buy rating on CRWV ahead of earnings, with a price target of $192 from $164. The firm pointed to rising AI demand as a CRWV tailwind. “In the near term, we see CRWV as one of the larger AI beneficiaries across our coverage. With recent deals signed with NVDA, META, and an OpenAI expansion, we estimate ~85% QoQ backlog growth,” they said, as quoted by CNBC. “As Blackwell + customer ramps come online in 4Q, we expect a revenue reacceleration into year-end and outsized (~$100M+) revenue beats.” The image featured for this article is © LALAKA / Shutterstock.com Latest Podcast Episode OpenAI Signs Two Massive Deals and Two New Portfolio Buys 51 min See us invest in our favorite AI stock ideas for free Live Nov 4, 2025 Live Oct 30, 2025 The broad markets are mixed to kick off trading today.

November 04, 2025 09:31 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 4 November 2025 – On 30 October 2025, Novo Nordisk announced the submission of an unsolicited proposal to acquire Metsera, Inc. (Metsera)1. Today, Novo Nordisk confirms that it has submitted an updated, unsolicited proposal to acquire Metsera. The updated proposal has been declared superior by Metsera’s board of directors. The acquisition of Metsera, including its early and development-stage incretin and non-incretin analogue peptide programmes, would provide Novo Nordisk the opportunity to maximise the potential of Metsera’s complementary portfolio and capabilities. An acquisition would be in line with Novo Nordisk’s long-term strategy of developing innovative and differentiated medicines and treating millions more people living with obesity and diabetes and their associated comorbidities. About the updated proposal Under the terms of the proposal, Novo Nordisk would acquire all outstanding shares of Metsera’s common stock at a price of 62.20 USD per share in cash (equal to an approximate aggregated equity value of 7.2 billion USD or approximate enterprise value of 6.7 billion USD) and contingent value rights (CVRs) for up to 24.00 USD per share in cash (or an approximate aggregated value of up to 2.8 billion USD) based on the achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones. The cash consideration will be paid at signing in exchange for non-voting preferred stock representing 50% of Metsera’s share capital and the CVRs will be issued upon the closing of the acquisition in exchange for the remaining shares.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The AI trade is taking a hit on Tuesday. The sell-off in high-growth tech stocks accelerated late in the session, dragging major indexes lower on fears about valuations touching unsustainable levels. Concerns about equity valuations intensified on Tuesday after Palantir stock tumbled following its third-quarter earnings report, despite solid results and upbeat guidance. The AI software giant beat estimates for the last three-month period, pulling $1.18 billion in revenue, ahead of the expected $1.09 billion. But shares were down as much as 9%. Other leaders in the AI trade sold off in tandem, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 was down nearly 2%. The 10-year Treasury yield was down two basis points to trade around 4.08%. Here's where major indexes stood around 3:00 p.m. ET on Tuesday: S&P 500: 6,771.90, down 1.17% Dow Jones Industrial Average: 47,029.06, down 0.65% (-307.62 points) Nasdaq Composite: 23,379.36, down 1.91% Other big tech stocks selling off on Tuesday include: Doubts are swirling around whether some companies have seen valuations go too far too fast, and whether firms will be able to deliver on their AI ambitions after spending billions on the technology. Palantir's forward price-to-earnings ratio hovered around 240x Tuesday morning. That compares to Nvidia, which has a forward price-to-earnings ratio of around 29. Also weighing on sentiment on Tuesday were comments from top banking executives, who said that the risk of a market correction is rising. Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick and Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon both pointed to risks that the market could see a correction of up to 20%. Pick, however, added that he didn't see this as a negative event necessarily. "We should also welcome the possibility that there would be drawdowns, 10 to 15% drawdowns that are not driven by some sort of macro cliff effect," he said at the Global Financial Leaders Investment Summit in Hong Kong. Markets have also been uneasy about the return on investment on AI so far, JPMorgan's Market Intelligence desk wrote in a note on Tuesday. Analyst said that clients have been concerned about narrow market breadth, adding that "there is a global risk off tone." The endless hype around the technology itself might also be starting to wane. "Some are doubting whether AI can possibly live up to the hype in terms of future returns," David Morrison, a senior market analyst at Trade Nation, wrote in a note about Tuesday's sell-off. The AI trade has flashed other warning signs in recent weeks. Shares of Meta and Microsoft tumbled after the firms said they would boost capex spending plans, a sign investors are growing skeptical over the buckets of cash being poured into AI. Meanwhile, "The Big Short" investor Michael Burry recently revealed a bet against Palantir and Nvidia on Monday, adding to the selling pressure in the tech sector. It isn't the first round of volatility for Palantir, which plummeted around 40% from its early-year peak through April amid the broader market selloff. Shares declined another 18% from mid-August through their low in September after the short-seller Andrew Left said he was taking a bet against the company. This all comes at a time when the market is also waking up to the reality that more rate cuts might not be a sure thing. Jerome Powell said exactly that at the Fed's October meeting last week, and the outlook has grown muddled, especially as the government shutdown forces markets to operate in a data blackout. Jump to

Title: Wall Street's Biggest IREN Bull Hiked Price Target to $142 After $9.7B Microsoft AI Deal

Wall Street continues to try and stay ahead of the hot-handed IREN (IREN) after yesterday's $9.7 billion agreement with Microsoft (MSFT) to supply 200 megawatts (MW) of AI data center capacity. The company's biggest sell-side fan is Cantor Fitzgerald's Brett Knoblauch. Bullish on the stock this past summer when it was trading for $10 and continually hiking his price target since, Knoblauch yesterday raised again, this time to $142 from $100. That implies more than a 100% upside from yesterday's close of $67.75. Bernstein's Gautam Chhugani, meanwhile, said the deal with MSFT cements IREN's position as one of the few infrastructure players owning its own power assets. He hiked his IREN price target to $125 from $75 and reiterated its outperform rating. The pact could generate $2 billion in annual recurring AI cloud revenue for IREN by 2027, on top of roughly $500 million from existing operations, Chhugani said. Unlike competitors such as CoreWeave (CRWV) and Nebius (NBIS), IREN’s 2.9 gigawatt (GW) portfolio allows it to expand in line with demand without relying on co-location partners, a structure which will boost profitability, Chhugani continued. Chhugani now forecasts $2.5 billion in AI cloud revenue by 2027, up from $1.1 billion previously, and values IREN’s Sweetwater site at $5 million per megawatt, based on recent M&A multiples. Further, the Microsoft deal taps only about 10% of IREN’s total power capacity across British Columbia and Texas, leaving scope to scale further with Microsoft or other hyperscalers. Roth Capital has also lifted its price target to $94 from $82. Shares are lower by nearly 5% early Tuesday alongside a general swoon in markets, with Nasdaq futures down 1.5% and bitcoin threatening to tumble below $100,000 level.

Title: OpenAI’s $1T IPO: a Split from Nvidia’s Costly AI Dominance?

Key Takeaways OpenAI is reportedly preparing for a landmark initial public offering (IPO) that could value the company at up to $1 trillion, making it one of the largest IPOs in history. The filing could come as early as the second half of 2026, with a potential listing by 2027, as OpenAI looks to expand beyond its private funding base and tap public markets for growth capital. The move follows a corporate restructuring that established the nonprofit OpenAI Foundation and reduced Microsoft’s ownership to around 27%, giving Sam Altman’s company greater strategic and operational independence. This IPO represents more than just a record-breaking valuation; it marks the beginning of OpenAI’s next phase of industrial growth. With rising compute demands and a heavy reliance on Nvidia’s hardware, the company is seeking record amounts of new capital to build its own energy-efficient infrastructure and diversify its chip supply chain. As OpenAI prepares for its public listing, the company is also redefining its financial and business structure to support the next phase of growth. Its restructuring and forthcoming IPO represent the foundation of a long-term strategy: to create the resources, autonomy, and scale needed to lead the next era of intelligent computing in a way that makes sense for investors. In essence, OpenAI’s potential $1 trillion IPO isn’t just about valuation: it’s about taking the steps to make it more market-friendly, enabling the kind of financial scaling that makes sense for a new entrant to the Mag 7, one who wants to dictate the future of artificial intelligence. In recent weeks, OpenAI completed a sweeping corporate restructuring that established the OpenAI Foundation, a nonprofit entity designed to anchor the company’s mission around the safe and ethical development of artificial general intelligence (AGI). The Foundation now holds a 26% equity stake in the for-profit OpenAI Group PBC, a public benefit corporation structured to balance two often competing forces, namely mission oversight and capital flexibility. At the same time, Microsoft’s ownership has been reduced to around 27%, signaling OpenAI’s clear intent to lessen its dependence on a single strategic partner and broaden its governance base. This new hybrid corporate structure provides OpenAI with the flexibility to raise capital from public markets while maintaining its nonprofit influence at the board level. This change invites a key question: how will OpenAI reconcile the commercial pressures of a trillion-dollar enterprise with its foundational commitment to developing AGI safely and responsibly? CEO Sam Altman’s vision for OpenAI will require massive investment, potentially hundreds of billions of dollars, to expand compute capacity and secure reliable renewable energy sources. Looking ahead, OpenAI may also develop its own custom AI chips to reduce dependence on suppliers like Nvidia and strengthen control over its hardware stack. It’s an ambitious step, but one that could be essential to sustaining the race toward AGI. An IPO would provide OpenAI with the capital it needs to accelerate its long-term vision, while also rewarding major early backers, including SoftBank, Thrive Capital, and Abu Dhabi’s MGX. With revenues projected to reach $20 billion but losses climbing due to the soaring cost of Nvidia hardware, going public is both a strategic necessity and a natural next step. Ultimately, OpenAI aims to build a vertically integrated AI economy—one that unites chips, compute, and energy into a self-sustaining industrial ecosystem capable of powering the next era of intelligent technology. As the IPO comes into view, one of the clearest signals from OpenAI’s next phase is a push to escape the cost and energy bottlenecks tied to its current hardware platform. The strategy centers on both reducing dependency on Nvidia’s GPU monopoly (and its rising costs), as well as improving efficiency in infrastructure built for AGI-scale demands. Nvidia’s GPUs remain the backbone of most AI training operations, including those of OpenAI. However, these GPUs come with steep costs and fast-growing energy demands. Supply-chain tightness and per-unit price increases have amplified these operating expenses, while US power grids strain under the scale of these large AI training clusters. Chinese competitors, such as DeepSeek, appear to be outpacing Nvidia’s GPUs in terms of energy efficiency. This highlights a strategic gap, and if OpenAI wants to scale successfully, it needs to address this gap. In fact, there are reports that the company is already buying up all the RAM it can, some saying it accounts for 40% of the global DRAM demand. Since supply can’t possibly keep up, this has had an unfortunate effect of pushing prices to historical highs: anyone looking to buy RAM right now will have to reckon with a 171% year-on-year increase in the price tag. This October, OpenAI entered into a multi-gigawatt deal with AMD (Instinct MI450 and future generations), on track for a 1 GW deployment in the second half of 2026, and up to 6 GW over time. At the same time, the company is exploring Google’s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and other accelerator platforms to further diversify its compute stack – and, ideally, optimize its energy costs. The shift toward a more varied compute ecosystem could increase OpenAI’s GFLOPS per watt, while reducing its cost per watt and mitigating its supplier risk. Overall, it could position OpenAI as a more resilient infrastructure player, not just an LLM model operator. OpenAI’s IPO may be the culmination of one wave – and the spark of the next. As infrastructure, software, and energy converge, companies moving into publicly traded markets could redefine how investors access the growing AI narrative. AI stocks are surging – and have been for much of the last two years. Nvidia recently reached a whopping $5T market capitalization: a historic milestone not just in the tech sector, but for any company. And it doesn’t look like the growth’s going to stop there. CEO Jen-Hsun Huang claimed the company is looking at a $500B worth of AI chip orders in 2026, which sparked number of analysts to claim that this kind revenue would mean the stock still has a lot of upside to it. CoreWeave, an AI-infrastructure provider, has seen its share prices rise rapidly since its IPO in March, currently trading at $126 – over three times its price at launch. If OpenAI’s IPO unfolds smoothly, it could ignite the next wave of AI investment, positioning the company as the software counterpart to Nvidia’s hardware dominance. Together, they would represent a kind of “completion” of the AI ecosystem that investors have long been anticipating. OpenAI’s public debut would likely act as a catalyst for competition among chipmakers, cloud providers, and energy firms, all racing to deliver the lowest cost per watt for AGI-scale compute. This global reshuffling echoes broader geopolitical dynamics, as nations like Saudi Arabia pursue ambitious AI strategies positioned between U.S. and Chinese interests, leveraging their energy resources to become major players in the next era of artificial intelligence. The core of the AI space may see a shift away from Nvidia – today’s GPU supply’s dominant force – and toward vertically integrated ecosystem players with hardware, compute, and energy in-house. At the very least, that’s what OpenAI envisions. OpenAI’s potential $1 trillion IPO could mark a defining moment in its evolution, from a research pioneer to one of the most successful SaaS, and finally a full-scale industrial powerhouse. Yet the move raises a critical question: can a publicly traded company truly uphold its mission of “safe AGI” when market expectations demand relentless growth? The debate over ethical AI is intensifying across industries, from corporations pursuing AGI to governments deploying AI for surveillance, as seen in ICE’s use of AI to monitor social media activity. As OpenAI channels public capital into more efficient hardware and energy systems, it faces the complex challenge of balancing innovation with ethical responsibility. If successful, the company could not only lessen its dependence on Nvidia but also redefine what true AI leadership means, measured not just by model intelligence but by efficiency, autonomy, and the ability to balance moral restraint with profit.

Title: Tylenol to join Kleenex, Huggies and Listerine in $48.7 billion takeover deal between Kimberly-Clark and Kenvue
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/11/04/tylenol-takeover-kimberly-clark-kenvue-48-7-billion/
Time Published: 2025-11-04T11:47:11Z
Full Content:
Kimberly-Clark is buying Tylenol maker Kenvue in a cash and stock deal worth about $48.7 billion, creating a massive consumer health goods company. Shareholders of Kimberly-Clark will own about 54% of the combined company. Kenvue shareholders will own about 46% in what is one of the largest corporate takeovers this year. The deal must still be approved by the shareholders of both companies. The combined company will have a huge stable of household brands under one roof, putting Kenvue’s Listerine mouthwash and Band-Aid side-by-side with Kimberly-Clark’s Cottonelle toilet paper, Huggies and Kleenex tissues. It will also generate about $32 billion in annual revenue. Kenvue has spent a relatively brief period as an independent company, having been spun off by Johnson & Johnson two years ago. J&J first announced in late 2021 that it was splitting its slow-growth consumer health division from the pharmaceutical and medical device divisions. Kenvue has since been targeted by activist investors unhappy about the trajectory of the company and Wall Street appeared to anticipate some heavy lifting ahead for Kimberly-Clark. Kenvue’s stock jumped 12% Monday afternoon, while shares of Kimberly-Clark, based outside of Dallas, slumped by nearly 15%. Kenvue shares have shed nearly 50% of their value since approaching $28 in the spring of 2023. Morningstar analyst Keonhee Kim said Kenvue’s volatile journey as a public company may have been driven in part by poor execution and a lack of experience operating as a stand-alone business. He said the leadership of a more-established consumer products company like Kimberly-Clark could help unlock some of Kenvue’s value. He also noted that Kenvue brands include Neutrogena, Benadryl and other names that have been in store consumer health aisles for decades. Kim said he thinks Kimberly-Clark may have seen upside in adding those products. “I think that may have made the deal a lot more attractive … especially after the past couple of months of Kenvue’s stock price decline,” he said. Kenvue and Tylenol have been thrust into the national spotlight this year as President Donald Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promoted unproven and in some cases discredited ties between Tylenol, vaccines and the complex brain disorder autism. Trump then urged pregnant women against using the medicine. That went beyond Food and Drug Administration advice that doctors “should consider minimizing” the painkiller acetaminophen’s use in pregnancy — amid inconclusive evidence about whether too much could be linked to autism. Kennedy reiterated the FDA guidance during a press conference last week. He said that there isn’t sufficient evidence to link the drug to autism. “We have asked physicians to minimize the use to when it’s absolutely necessary,” he said. Kenvue has continued to push back on the Trump administration’s public statements about Tylenol and acetaminophen, the active ingredient it contains. “We strongly disagree with allegations that it does and are deeply concerned about the health risks and confusion this poses for expecting mothers and parents,” Kenvue said in a statement on its website. The merger could face other hurdles. Citi Investment Research analyst Filippo Falorni said he is concerned about the deal’s size given the recent history in the sector, particularly given the challenges faced by Kenvue. In July, Kenvue announced that CEO Thibaut Mongon was leaving in the midst of a strategic review, with the company under mounting pressure from activist investors unhappy about growth. Critics say Kenvue has relied too much on its legacy brands and failed to innovate. Industry analysts also point out the poor track record for mergers involving consumer packaged goods companies. In September, Kraft Heinz said it would break up its decade-old merger. Its net revenue has fallen every year since 2020. Kimberly-Clark and Kenvue, like Kraft Heinz, are facing increasing competition from cheaper store brands. In 2024, 51% of toilet paper and other household paper products sold in the U.S were store brands, according to Circana, a market research company, while store brands held a 24% share of sales of health products, including medications and vitamins. On Monday, a bottle of 100 extra-strength Tylenol caplets cost $10.97 on Walmart’s website. A bottle of 100 extra-strength acetaminophen caplets from Walmart’s Equate brand cost $1.98. Inflation drove some of that buyer behavior, Circana said. Shoppers are also shifting their purchases to stores with more private-label brands, like Aldi and Costco. And stores are improving their offerings and adding more of them; last year, Walmart and Target both launched new store brands to complement their existing ones. Still, both Kimberly-Clark and Kenvue make name-brand products in segments where consumers are less likely to shift to store brands, including hair care, skin care, feminine products and mouth care, according to Circana. Kenvue owns brands like Aveeno and Neutrogena, for example, while Kimberly-Clark makes Kotex and Depend. Kimberly-Clark Chairman and CEO Mike Hsu will be chairman and CEO of the combined company. Three members of the Kenvue’s board will join Kimberly-Clark’s board at closing. The combined company will keep Kimberly-Clark’s headquarters in Irving, Texas, but there will be significant operations around Kenvue facilities and locations as well. The deal is expected to close in the second half of next year. It still needs approval from shareholders of both both companies. Kenvue shareholders will receive $3.50 per share in cash and 0.14625 Kimberly-Clark shares for each Kenvue share held at closing. That amounts to $21.01 per share, based on the closing price of Kimberly-Clark shares on Friday. Kimberly-Clark and Kenvue said that they identified about $1.9 billion in cost savings that are expected in the first three years after the transaction’s closing. ___ AP Health Writer Tom Murphy contributed to this report. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: BofA boss Brian Moynihan forced by board, restless shareholders to hold first investor day in 14 years: sources
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/11/04/business/bank-of-america-ceo-brian-moynihan-to-hold-his-first-investor-day-since-2011/
Time Published: 2025-11-04T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
It took him long enough. This week, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan will hold his first “investor day” since 2011 – breaking 14 years of silence that nicely highlights the positively awful job he has done communicating with investors. Insiders say that 66-year-old Moynihan, who only recently laid out a succession plan, was likely prodded to call the Wednesday powwow by his board, which is fielding shareholder demands for a clear plan to boost the bank’s stock price – and a strategy to compete against its archrival, Jamie Dimon’s JPMorgan Chase. BofA is the US’s second-largest bank by assets, right behind JPM. But by many other metrics, it’s an also-ran. Its stock perennially lags JPM’s – and all the other big banks, for that matter. It fails to win big banking assignments that go to JPM and Goldman Sachs. Nor does it capitalize on trading volatility because it’s been so risk averse. Insiders blame Moynihan, a lawyer by training who cut his managerial teeth as general counsel of Fleet Boston, which was among the multitude of acquisitions that led to the creation of the modern BofA. He took over as CEO in 2010, in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis that nearly caused BofA to collapse. Moynihan won praise for his early caution, but according to critics inside and out of the bank, he’s been running the place the same way ever since by scaling back on risk and merely managing the bank’s balance sheet. It’s the reason why the stock has lagged JPMorgan and all of the Big 6 banks. Critics say part of Moynihan’s problem is that he never left Boston. He still manages BofA’s sprawling operations there with a few confidantes, even though its main headquarters is in New York (with a huge hub in Charlotte where it was once domiciled before its massive expansion). The investor day is being held not in NYC but in Boston. Another problem is BofA’s board. It’s considered among the most CEO-friendly in finance, which is why Moynihan didn’t set a succession timetable until recently (he wants to stay in job for the next five years). “The board and those that he surrounds himself with have allowed him to operate this way for some time,” said one BofA insider. “At some point, it becomes overly obvious how much of an outlier you are to your peers.” A BofA spokesman said it’s “completely untrue” that the board prodded him to hold the annual meeting or announce his succession plans. “The day gives us a chance to tell the comprehensive story of our franchise, how we are growing each of our businesses, and the opportunities for growth in the future,” the spokesman said, adding that analysts are starting to buy into Moynihan’s future growth plans. As many as 25 analysts now have buy recommendations on BofA stock. Whether it’s because of pressure from the board, his employees, investors or all three, Moynihan has been more visible lately. In addition to creating a succession plan and elevating a trio of executives to pole positions to succeed him, Moynihan has been doing media as he attempts to explain BofA’s new strategy. His new soundbite is “responsible growth”. Company insiders say Moynihan is still a firm believer in avoiding balance sheet risk, so don’t expect big trading profits when the markets get crazy like you see from Goldman Sachs. BofA also doesn’t post surprise trading losses. One metric Moynihan’s flacks keep touting: The bank recorded more than a dozen years of consistent growth in its sales and trading division. Which means when you cut through the spin, his strategy is more of the same. It’s important to note Moynihan’s caution has cost his shareholders money. In 2021, his team misread interest rates and dived headfirst into super safe treasuries that got crushed when inflation spiked and the Fed raised interest rates. A key reason that BofA — despite its massive balance sheet — remains an also-ran is that he hasn’t allowed traders to use that balance sheet even to support client deals, thus it doesn’t get the best client assignments, insiders say.

On Wednesday, Moynihan won’t be the only one doing the talking; more than a dozen BofA executives are expected to speak including the three men poised to take his job: Dean Athanasia, head of regional banking, chief financial officer Alastair Borthwick and Jim DeMare, head of global markets. DeMare is seen to have the inside track on the inside track because of the bank’s new found love of taking capital markets risk, albeit in a responsible manner – whatever that means. Advertisement

Title: Bitcoin’s Last Support Before $100K Breaks as 'Mag 7' Skew Flips, Oracle CDS Surges

Bitcoin BTC$101,389.92 has fallen below a key support level that had been holding back a slide toward $100,000, amid weakening momentum in tech stocks. The leading cryptocurrency fell below $106,000 during Asian trading hours, penetrating the level that had offered support multiple times in recent weeks, according to CoinDesk data. Major altcoins such as ether ETH$3,320.00, XRP$2.2350 and solana SOL$157.70, with SOL sliding to $157, the lowest since Aug. 3. Ether also fell to its lowest since August, with a bear cross of key moving averages pointing to strengthening of downside momentum and XRP hit a three-week low. BTC's breakdown shifts focus to the $100,000-$101,000 area, according to Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research. A violation there could open the door to a deeper test near $94,000, or even a full retracement toward $85,000, the maximum pain zone that also aligns with strong on-chain support, Thielen said in a note to clients. "While such a move would be extreme, downside risk remains contained as long as bitcoin holds above its prevailing downtrend line," he added. BTC's dour price action follows dwindling odds of rapid Fed rate cuts and signs of bullish turnaround in the dollar index, which tracks the greenback's value against major currencies. Furthermore, there are signs of overexuberance in the so-called “Magnificent 7” stocks — Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta, and Tesla — which is typically seen at major market tops. "The put-call skew in the Mag7 complex inverted for the first time since December of last year (i.e. implied volatility of calls traded over puts). This phenomenon has only happened a handful of times. The move implies investors are overwhelmingly positioned for continued upside," analyst Neil Sethi said on X, quoting Goldman Sachs. "Historically, such low skew readings have tended to coincide with short-term consolidation or reversals as optimism peaks," Sethi added. At the same time, the credit default swap (CDS) tied to Oracle, which measures the cost of insuring against a potential default, has surged following the company’s massive third-quarter AI investment disclosures – reaching levels not seen outside periods of significant macro stress. This, according to some analysts, represents investor anxiety regarding the booming AI spending. AI optimism has been one of the major drivers of the bull market in both stocks and wider risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, since 2023. All things considered, bulls might be better off being cautious rather than overly exuberant.

Title: The $30 billionÂ bet: Meta’s debt-fueled AI gamble

Meta borrowed $30 billion in debt, signaling that even cash-rich tech giants can no longer fund the astronomical costs of the AI race from revenue alone, marking a pivotal moment for the industry. While Meta's stock price fell due to shareholder anxiety over spending, the bond offering was met with overwhelming demand, indicating debt investors' strong confidence in the company's robust financial health and ability to repay. The primary driver for this debt is the need to fund expensive AI infrastructure, specifically data centers filled with advanced and costly Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) required to train sophisticated AI models. The move highlights a stark divide where established giants like Meta and Oracle can access low-interest debt, while unprofitable AI startups are forced to cede ownership through equity fundraising, giving the titans a major advantage. This debt-fueled spending spree represents a core strategic bet on achieving artificial superintelligence, with its success or failure set to determine the winners in the AI race and reshape the global economy for a generation.

This debt-fueled spending spree represents a core strategic bet on achieving artificial superintelligence, with its success or failure set to determine the winners in the AI race and reshape the global economy for a generation. In a stunning financial maneuver that signals a new phase in the artificial intelligence arms race, Facebook's parent company Meta turned to the debt markets this week, borrowing a staggering $30 billion. The move reveals a fundamental shift for cash-rich tech behemoths, as even the most profitable companies are finding their war chests insufficient to bankroll the astronomical costs of the race for superintelligence. This pivot to massive debt accumulation marks a pivotal moment, raising profound questions about the sustainability of the AI boom. For decades, internet titans have been defined by immense cash flows, able to fund ambitious projects from profits alone. That era may be closing. Meta's decision to issue bonds comes despite the company taking in over $100 billion in annual revenue. The sheer scale of this borrowing indicates that the financial requirements for leading the AI revolution are unprecedented, dwarfing even the most ambitious tech projects of the past. A market of contradictions The debt offering occurred on the same day that Meta's stock price plunged more than 11 percent, a reaction from shareholders spooked by aggressive spending and disappointing earnings. This divergence paints a complex picture: equity investors are growing anxious, while debt investors displayed overwhelming confidence. Demand for Meta's bonds was reportedly four times greater than the supply, a clear signal that the credit market views the social media titan as a safe bet. This confidence is not unfounded. Meta's underlying financial health remains robust. Excluding a one-time charge, the company's net income for the recent quarter was a colossal $18.6 billionâsurpassing the combined profits of General Motors, Netflix, Walmart and Visa. For bond investors, this massive profit engine represents a near-guarantee that their loans will be repaid with interest, regardless of whether Meta's AI bets ultimately pay off. The high cost of the AI arms race Why does a company swimming in cash need to borrow $30 billion? The answer lies in the breathtakingly expensive infrastructure required for advanced AI. The core of this is the data center, massive facilities packed with advanced computer chips called Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). These incredibly powerful and expensive processors are uniquely capable of handling the immense calculations needed to train sophisticated AI models. Acquiring these chips and building the facilities to house them requires capital on a scale rarely seen outside of national defense budgets. Meta is not alone in this debt-fueled pursuit. Oracle raised $18 billion in a bond offering last month and is reportedly preparing to secure an additional $38 billion through bank loans. These moves highlight an industry-wide trend. The AI race is no longer a sprint funded by petty cash; it is a marathon requiring financial endurance that even these giants cannot maintain through revenue alone. A two-tiered financial ecosystem This rush to debt creates a stark divide in the AI landscape. For established tech titans like Meta and Oracle, the debt markets are wide open. Lenders see their immense cash flows and physical assets as solid collateral, making the risk of default seem low. This access to low-interest debt provides a monumental competitive advantage. For pioneering AI startups like OpenAI and Anthropic, the situation is entirely different. These companies, despite their groundbreaking technology, are not yet profitable. The debt market is a hostile territory for them, as lenders would charge exorbitant interest rates to compensate for the risk of failure. Consequently, these younger companies are forced to continue raising money by selling equity stakes, gradually ceding ownership and control to outside financiers. The specter of an AI bubble As billions pour into AI infrastructure, a critical question emerges: is this a sound investment, or are we witnessing the inflation of a historic bubble? The markets, for now, are shrugging off the possibility of a burst. The confidence in Meta's bond offering suggests that institutional investors believe the AI revolution is real and that its leaders will be rewarded. However, the parallel decline in Meta's stock price serves as a cautionary tale. It reflects a growing concern on Wall Street that the returns on this massive AI investment are uncertain and far in the future. CEO Mark Zuckerberg's spending appears to have no limit, and while the company can afford to service its new debt, shareholders are worried that the aggressive pursuit of AI could come at the expense of near-term profitability. "The AI race is astronomically expensive because training and operating advanced AI models requires immense computational power, which consumes a colossal amount of energy," said BrightU.AI's Enoch. "Building and maintaining the data centers and specialized chips for this purpose demands massive capital investment in both hardware and physical infrastructure. Ultimately, the cost is driven by the fundamental, non-negotiable need for vast quantities of electricity, a resource that cannot be manufactured like currency." The ultimate gamble The ultimate conclusion of this high-stakes financial drama remains unwritten. The $30 billion debt offering by Meta is more than a simple corporate loan; it is a bellwether for the entire technology sector. It demonstrates that the pursuit of artificial superintelligence is now the primary strategic objective for the worldâs most powerful companies, an objective so costly that it requires mortgaging future profits for decades to come. The success or failure of this gamble will not only determine the winners and losers in the AI race but will also reshape the global economic landscape for a generation.

Sources include:Â Techexplore.com msn.com barrons.com BrightU.ai Brighteon.com For decades, internet titans have been defined by immense cash flows, able to fund ambitious projects from profits alone. That era may be closing. Meta's decision to issue bonds comes despite the company taking in over $100 billion in annual revenue. The sheer scale of this borrowing indicates that the financial requirements for leading the AI revolution are unprecedented, dwarfing even the most ambitious tech projects of the past. A market of contradictions The debt offering occurred on the same day that Meta's stock price plunged more than 11 percent, a reaction from shareholders spooked by aggressive spending and disappointing earnings. This divergence paints a complex picture: equity investors are growing anxious, while debt investors displayed overwhelming confidence. Demand for Meta's bonds was reportedly four times greater than the supply, a clear signal that the credit market views the social media titan as a safe bet. This confidence is not unfounded. Meta's underlying financial health remains robust. Excluding a one-time charge, the company's net income for the recent quarter was a colossal $18.6 billionâsurpassing the combined profits of General Motors, Netflix, Walmart and Visa. For bond investors, this massive profit engine represents a near-guarantee that their loans will be repaid with interest, regardless of whether Meta's AI bets ultimately pay off. The high cost of the AI arms race Why does a company swimming in cash need to borrow $30 billion? The answer lies in the breathtakingly expensive infrastructure required for advanced AI.

The $30 billion debt offering by Meta is more than a simple corporate loan; it is a bellwether for the entire technology sector.

Oracle raised $18 billion in a bond offering last month and is reportedly preparing to secure an additional $38 billion through bank loans. These moves highlight an industry-wide trend. The AI race is no longer a sprint funded by petty cash; it is a marathon requiring financial endurance that even these giants cannot maintain through revenue alone. A two-tiered financial ecosystem This rush to debt creates a stark divide in the AI landscape. For established tech titans like Meta and Oracle, the debt markets are wide open. Lenders see their immense cash flows and physical assets as solid collateral, making the risk of default seem low. This access to low-interest debt provides a monumental competitive advantage. For pioneering AI startups like OpenAI and Anthropic, the situation is entirely different. These companies, despite their groundbreaking technology, are not yet profitable. The debt market is a hostile territory for them, as lenders would charge exorbitant interest rates to compensate for the risk of failure. Consequently, these younger companies are forced to continue raising money by selling equity stakes, gradually ceding ownership and control to outside financiers. The specter of an AI bubble As billions pour into AI infrastructure, a critical question emerges: is this a sound investment, or are we witnessing the inflation of a historic bubble?

A linkup with an artificial intelligence player helped power shares of a top cloud-computing services company higher Monday, while an acquisition in the consumer goods space sent the two stocks on divergent paths. Major U.S. equities indexes ended the first trading day of November mixed, kicking off a market week that will bring a wave of big-name quarterly reports. The S&P 500 added 0.2%, while the Nasdaq was up 0.5%. The Dow ended the session 0.5% lower. For more from Investopedia on the day's major market news, click here. IDEXX Laboratories (IDXX) shares jumped 15%, the best performance on the S&P 500 today, after the pet health specialist reported better-than-expected third quarter sales and profit. The company raised its 2025 revenue and earnings per share guidance, highlighting global customer adoption of its new diagnostic tools, which IDEXX says can help veterinarian teams increase clinical insights and streamline their workflows. Paper products giant Kimberly-Clark (KMB) said it would buy Tylenol, Band-Aid, and Listerine parent company Kenvue (KVUE) in a cash-and-stock deal valued at around $49 billion. Kenvue, which completed a spin-off from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) in 2023, has been navigating litigation over allegations that its talcum powder causes cancer and statements from the Trump administration linking Tylenol to autism. Kenvue shares rose more than 12% Monday following the announcement of the deal, which came at a significant premium to Friday's closing price for Kenvue stock, while Kimberly-Clark shares plunged more than 14%. The latter company's shares were the worst performers on the S&P 500 today. Amazon (AMZN) shares jumped 5% after ChatGPT owner OpenAI signed an agreement to buy more than $38 billion worth of capacity its Amazon Web Services cloud unit. OpenAI said the deal to use AWS infrastructure would provide it with access to a significant number of Nvidia (NVDA) graphics processing units that could be employed to train its AI models. Nvidia shares gained 2.2%. Moderna (MRNA) stock sank 8.3% Monday, reversing a portion of the gains posted last week amid reports that the vaccine maker had held strategic talks with a major pharmaceutical company about a potential partnership or sale. Waning enthusiasm around a possible deal and concerns about the company's financial situation overshadowed Moderna's announcement that it administered the first dose in an early stage study of its experimental multiple myeloma therapy. KeyBanc downgraded Charter Communications (CHTR) stock to "sector weight" from "overweight" after the cable and internet provider reported lower-than-expected third-quarter sales and profit in its most-recent quarterly release. Analysts cited competitive headwinds to Charter's broadband subscriber growth, which can affect its free cash flow. Its stock fell about 5%.

Such adjustments include, but are not limited to, real estate optimization and transformation initiatives, certain litigation charges and loss contingencies, costs related to acquisitions/divestitures and the related amortization, impairment and related charges, depreciation, equity compensation, tax benefits, and other adjustments. For example, stock-based compensation may fluctuate based on the timing of employee stock transactions and unpredictable fluctuations in the company's stock price. Any associated estimate of these items and its impact on GAAP performance could vary materially.

Non-GAAP financial results are reported in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The company does not forecast GAAP operating expenses, net income (loss) or earnings per share because it cannot predict certain elements that are included in reported GAAP results.

Title: All Roads Lead To NVIDIA: Bankrolling Its Own AI Gold Rush

ByRoomy Khan, Contributor. NVIDIA just wrote a $5 billion check for a stake in Intel. It's the AI gold rush in microcosm: the biggest winner is now bankrolling its own boom. The Intel deal is one small piece of an extraordinary surge. In 2025, through October, nearly one trillion dollars in AI infrastructure commitments has surfaced: $500 billion from Stargate alone; approximately $150 billion in NVIDIA-driven strategic and supply commitments; and a cascade of hyperscaler, private-equity, and sovereign GPU procurement moving at unprecedented velocity. This isn't a tech cycle. It's a capital reordering. And it reveals a fundamental power shift—the company at the center of the AI buildout is now funding it. Every boom has two sides: those writing checks and those cashing them. The spenders? Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Amazon. Over $750 billion in datacenter spending between 2023 and 2025. Nearly $400 billion in 2025 alone. In recent earnings calls on October 29–30, 2025, all four signaled plans to increase spending materially in 2026. And the investor base is multiplying. Private equity firms are raising billion-dollar AI infrastructure funds. Investment banks are structuring datacenter acquisitions. Sovereign wealth funds are locking in GPU capacity years in advance. The recipients span the entire infrastructure stack: GPUs, memory, networking, cooling, and power. Plenty of companies are winning on volume. But one company captured the lion's share—NVIDIA. 80–95% of the AI accelerator market. 70–80% gross margins. Between 2023 and 2025, revenue surged from $27B to $130B while market value exploded nearly tenfold. NVIDIA didn't just participate in the AI boom. It won. Now, with a war chest built from these sales, NVIDIA is deploying capital strategically to control both supply and demand in the infrastructure buildout. Unlike traditional VCs who simply take equity stakes, NVIDIA takes equity and turns portfolio companies into GPU customers locked into its ecosystem. The pattern repeats across the portfolio. In July 2023, a $50 million investment in Recursion Pharmaceuticals enabled the biotech firm to build BioHive-2, an NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD supercomputer with 504 H100 GPUs, completed in May 2024. By mid-2025, Perplexity AI, backed by NVIDIA since April 2024, was likely deploying Blackwell GPUs for its AI search engine, consistent with NVIDIA’s strategy of providing early access to its latest hardware. The loop is elegant: NVIDIA Invests Capital and Takes Equity → Portfolio Companies Buy GPUs → Additional GPU Revenue → Portfolio Equity Appreciates → Larger War Chest → Repeat. Each investment converts to infrastructure deployment. Each partnership locks in ecosystem adoption, creating a reinforcing cycle where NVIDIA effectively funds its own customer base. On March 10, 2025, Oracle CEO Safra Catz announced a figure on an earnings call that stunned analysts: $48 billion in new cloud contracts signed in a single quarter, the largest booking quarter in the company's history. The backlog hit $130 billion, up 63% year-over-year. Then came the kicker: those numbers didn't even include Stargate. The $500 billion OpenAI-Oracle-SoftBank megaproject announced two months earlier wasn't included in the reported backlog. By late September, Stargate had committed more than $400 billion and secured seven gigawatts of capacity. An even larger wave followed. Between mid-September and late October 2025, the AI infrastructure market detonated with hundreds of billions more in commitments. Anchoring the blitz: NVIDIA and OpenAI's up to $100 billion letter of intent for 10 gigawatts of compute, with the first gigawatt online mid-2026. Flanking it: CoreWeave signing $36.6 billion in five days—$22.4 billion with OpenAI, $14.2 billion with Meta. AMD locking in 6 gigawatts with OpenAI. Broadcom securing another 10 gigawatts of custom ASICs starting late 2026. NVIDIA is directing capital to reinforce its AI ecosystem moat. $5 billion into Intel, $2 billion into xAI's Colossus 2 supercomputer, $1 billion for a Nokia stake. Then came the deal that revealed the whole game: a BlackRock-led consortium, including NVIDIA, Microsoft, and xAI, spending $40 billion to acquire Aligned Data Centers. It wasn't a traditional tech acquisition—it was a buy-the-grid play. They weren't buying a business; they were buying power, land, and priority access to the electrical future. This isn’t a spending cycle. It's an arms race for computational sovereignty—and the infrastructure is sold out before it's even built. The numbers are staggering, yet the mechanics are variations on a single, ruthlessly efficient playbook. Flywheel one—equity appreciation: In April 2023, NVIDIA invested $100 million in CoreWeave at a $2 billion valuation. Added another $250 million at the March 2025 IPO at $40 per share. Total investment: $350 million. CoreWeave now trades around $135 per share. NVIDIA's stake: roughly $3.3 billion. Nearly 10× on its initial position. As CoreWeave lands customer contracts, that equity value climbs. Flywheel two—GPU revenue: To fulfill those contracts, CoreWeave buys hundreds of thousands of NVIDIA GPUs. Each purchase generates chip revenue for NVIDIA. The rising revenue and equity value help enable more investments, accelerating the loop. The structure is nearly bulletproof. Heads, NVIDIA wins. Tails, NVIDIA still wins. What's unusual about the CoreWeave relationship: NVIDIA has committed to buy back $6.3 billion in capacity through 2032 if CoreWeave can't fill its data centers. Most cloud providers assume full inventory risk on multi-billion dollar GPU purchases. NVIDIA backstopped its own customer. Not everyone buys it. "There's a lot more that can go wrong with Nvidia than can go right," says Jay Goldberg, an analyst with Seaport Global Securities. NVIDIA did not respond to requests for comment. AMD's revenue grew from $22.7 billion in 2023 to $25.8 billion in 2024, on track for roughly $32-34 billion in 2025. A 45% two-year climb, respectable but modest against an AI boom that quintupled NVIDIA's revenue. AMD had been scrambling to break into the AI GPU market. In October, it finally got its break. AMD announced a 6-gigawatt deal with OpenAI, its biggest contract ever. The price of landing a transformational AI customer? AMD issued OpenAI warrants for up to 160 million shares at a penny each, potentially giving OpenAI 10% of AMD's equity just to become a supplier. The warrants vest in tranches as OpenAI deploys gigawatts and as AMD's stock hits targets escalating to $600 per share. UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri calculated the stake could reach $100 billion if OpenAI holds through completion, though he expects OpenAI will likely sell shares along the way to finance GPU purchases. AMD is essentially financing OpenAI's purchases with its own equity. But AMD isn't just buying in. It's building a genuine alternative. The Helios rack-scale platform matches NVIDIA's Vera Rubin spec-for-spec: 72 GPUs, integrated networking, turnkey deployment, plus 50% more memory at 31TB HBM4. Both systems target mass production in late 2026. AMD projects a $500 billion datacenter AI accelerator TAM by 2028, a conservative estimate given $400 billion in big tech AI capex this year alone. AMD has competitive technology and a massive market opportunity. What it lacks is time and ecosystem lock-in. NVIDIA buys into customers; AMD dilutes to get them. That asymmetry shows NVIDIA's chokehold on the market. Broadcom is playing a different game and winning. Revenue jumped from $35.8 billion in 2023 to $51.6 billion in 2024, on track for roughly $60 billion in 2025. That's a 67% surge as hyperscalers embraced custom ASICs for high-volume inference. On October 13, the company secured 10 gigawatts of custom OpenAI-designed accelerators starting late 2026. It already has design wins generating billions in revenue across Google, Meta, and other hyperscalers. These are application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), custom chips built for one job—high-volume inference. They're dramatically cheaper and more power-efficient than GPUs for repetitive tasks like answering ChatGPT queries. This is real business taking real market share. The tradeoff? ASICs are appliances, not platforms. A Broadcom chip designed for OpenAI can't run Meta's models. It can't adapt when workloads evolve. However, this matters less than NVIDIA hopes. For mature, stable inference at massive scale, ASICs win on economics. Broadcom isn't a curiosity. It's a genuine competitive threat to NVIDIA's inference dominance. But none of that matters if the grid does not come through; the bottleneck is electricity, not silicon. AI datacenters currently consume approximately 6–8 gigawatts globally. A single gigawatt of electricity—roughly the output of one nuclear reactor running continuously—can power a large AI datacenter. The September OpenAI/NVIDIA deal requires 10 gigawatts. The math is straightforward. At a modern power usage effectiveness (PUE) of ~1.3, a 10-gigawatt facility delivers roughly 7.5 GW of usable compute power. With ~80% dedicated to GPUs—the standard for next-generation AI datacenters—nearly 6 GW goes to accelerators. At ~1 kilowatt per Blackwell-class GPU, this translates to ~6 million chips across ~83,000 racks. OpenAI builds the datacenter buildings, cooling systems, and networking infrastructure—but it does not generate the power. The grid must deliver the electricity, equivalent to ~10 nuclear reactors running 24/7. The grid must deliver the electricity, equivalent to ~10 nuclear reactors running 24/7. For grid operators, the surge is unprecedented. “I have not seen this degree of change in a forecast in my career, and no one has seen these nationwide growth levels since the 1980s,” says Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies. The U.S. grid adds roughly ~10–15 gigawatts of new capacity per year. Meeting the ~44–51 GW requirement by 2026 means building 3–5× faster—just for AI datacenters. High-voltage transmission lines take 3–5 years to build, even before community battles and permitting delays. California’s grid operator says datacenter upgrades won’t finish until late 2027. In Northern Virginia, two-thirds of Loudoun County substations face delays through 2026. Small modular reactors won’t arrive until the 2030s. Natural-gas plants are faster but face infrastructure constraints. The deals promise power years before the grid can supply it. Even if the power arrives on schedule, demand itself could evaporate. A structural shift toward cheaper, distributed, and more efficient AI could erode the very economics this boom depends on. If inference improves on lower-cost infrastructure, and if specialized architectures—from domain-specific ASICs to emerging analog accelerators—deliver order-of-magnitude efficiency gains for targeted workloads, the rationale for premium datacenter GPU infrastructure weakens. The $180 billion in deals assumes AI remains proprietary, centralized, and compute-intensive. History rarely cooperates. Technology cycles bend toward efficiency, commoditization, and distribution. Regulators compound the uncertainty. NVIDIA’s model binds capital, supply, and demand into a single reinforcing loop — a structure increasingly under scrutiny in cloud-AI partnerships. In January 2024, the FTC opened a formal Section 6(b) inquiry into AI investment and cloud-compute arrangements, compelling major firms to disclose terms around preferential access, exclusivity, and required cloud-spend. A follow-on FTC report in early 2025 highlighted concerns that equity-linked compute access and tied-spend agreements can reinforce incumbency and limit competition. If regulators conclude these arrangements distort market access, NVIDIA’s flywheel could meet friction. Jensen Huang has built the most elegant flywheel in modern capitalism. But flywheels spin both ways. The loops that accelerated gains can amplify pain when the cycle turns. For investors and strategists, the implications are clear: NVIDIA has built structural advantages that extend far beyond chip performance. Its capital deployment strategy creates switching costs and ecosystem lock-in that competitors can't easily replicate. But the same feedback loops that drive exponential growth in boom times can accelerate downturns. The questions aren't whether NVIDIA dominates today—it does—but whether power infrastructure can support the buildout, whether demand justifies the scale, and whether regulators will allow the flywheel to continue spinning unchecked. The answers will determine whether this is the decade's most prescient capital allocation or its most spectacular miscalculation.

Title: Meta Stock Up 8%. Why Zuckerberg’s Innovation Drought May Sink $META

ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Meta's stock fell after Q3 earnings as investors questioned its AI spending without clear revenue, a contrast to peers who saw gains from their AI investments.Concerns are mounting over Meta's use of private debt for AI data centers, with some comparing it to subprime mortgage securitization.Despite skepticism, many Wall Street analysts maintain highly optimistic price targets for Meta's stock. Meta Platforms stock is up 8% this year – lagging Nasdaq’s 22% rise. This follows a disappointing third quarter earnings report that set Meta apart from its peers – Amazon, Google and Microsoft – in the derby to spend billions on AI data centers. Unlike rivals, Meta has yet to build measurable revenue from its AI investment. Does the market’s reaction to Meta’s latest earnings report make the stock a bargain? Here are three reasons to avoid Meta stock: Meta views its AI spending as vital. The company said more spending is crucial for the company’s pursuit of AI that vastly outperforms human capabilities – dubbed superintelligence, Zuckerberg told the Wall Street Journal. Meta will use any extra computing resources from that investment to speed up the company’s core business. “That way, if superintelligence arrives sooner, we will be ideally positioned for a generational paradigm shift in many large opportunities,” Zuckerberg said. “If it takes longer, then we’ll use the extra compute to accelerate our core business. In a worse case scenario, “we would just slow building new infrastructure for some period while we grow into what we build,” he added. Wall Street seems to share the company’s optimism – the consensus price target implies Meta’s stock has 30% upside. Four technology giants – Google, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon – all raised forecasts for their 2025 AI capital spending to a total of $380 billion, according to CNBC. All of the companies – with the exception of Meta and Microsoft – received a round of applause from investors. Here are why the winners enjoyed a rise in their stock prices following their latest earnings last week: Amazon stock rose after beating on revenue and earnings and announcing a $7 billion boost to its capital expenditure budget for the year. AWS revenue grew 20% – topping analyst expectations; total sales rose 13% beating analysts’ consensus by about $2.4 billion while earnings per share of $1.95 topped estimates by 38 cents, noted CNBC. Amazon will spend $125 billion on AI capex – a figure expected to rise in 2026. “We’ll continue to make significant investments, especially in AI,” Amazon CFO finance Brian Olsavsky said on the earnings call. “We believe it to be a massive opportunity with the potential for strong returns on invested capital over the long term,” he added. Alphabet, Google’s parent, beat earnings expectations and boosted its capex forecast. In its Q3 report, Alphabet hit a record -- over $100 billion in revenue – enjoying growth in both its core advertising business and Google Cloud – with help from AI demand. Alphabet raised its capex forecast 15% to $92 billion at the midpoint of a range, reported CNBC. Microsoft lost ground among investors while exceeding estimates and increasing its capex growth view above analysts’ expectations. The company’s fiscal Q1 revenue and earnings beat consensus – reaching $77.6 billion abetted by a 40% rise in Azure revenue – and EPS of $4.13. Yet Azure demand exceeded capacity – limiting growth. This may explain why Microsoft forecast a 45% increase – to a minimum of $94 billion in capex for fiscal 2026 after previously saying growth would slow, wrote CNBC. Despite beating expectations and raising guidance, Meta’s stock was hit harder – falling 13% since reporting on October 30 – due to an increase in capex without a clear path to new revenue from the investment. This drop subtracted more than $25 billion from Zuckerberg’s net worth, noted Forbes. Revenue rose 26% in the third quarter to $51.24 billion – $1.8 billion above estimates; adjusted EPS of $7.25 was 56 cents higher than consensus; and Meta’s Q4 revenue guidance of $57 billion – the midpoint of a range – exceeded the StreetAccount estimate, according to Zacks. Meta’s capex forecast of $71 billion -- $2 billion more than previously forecast – spooked investors due to a lack of clear revenue upside. “Meta doesn’t have a cloud service and lacks a clear revenue story that’s tied to its AI investments,” reported CNBC. When investors asked Zuckerberg about how Meta would generate revenue from its investment, his reply was vague. “The right thing to do is to try to accelerate this to make sure that we have the compute that we need, both for the AI research and new things that we’re doing, and to try to get to a different state on our compute stance on the core business,” Zuckerberg told analysts on the investor call. While Meta said AI improves targeting in the company’s core digital ads business, one analyst did not find this argument compelling. Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to hold -- citing an “unknown revenue opportunity,”according to CNBC. Moreover, Oppenheimer sees Meta’s pursuit of superintelligence as potentially following the same path as the company’s metaverse – which has not paid off. How so? In 2021 and 2022, Meta invested heavily in what he touted as spending to create the future of computing. After burning billions “of dollars a quarter on its investments in augmented reality,” wrote CNBC, Meta’s Reality Labs unit lost $4.4 billion in the latest quarter on $470 million in revenue. Another analyst similarly lacks confidence in Meta’s AI bets. “The total dollar spend is just kind of what hangs us up a little bit,” Zacks Investment Management analyst Brian Mulberry told the Journal. “They have to start doing a better job of showing us when that comes back to the balance sheet.” “The return on invested capital is definitely a huge metric for us and the fact that they are being a little bit cagey and not quite upfront with what exactly is going on doesn’t help soothe those fears,” Mulberry added. Meta is not slowing its investment in data centers. The company plans to spend “$600 billion on data centers and other infrastructure in the U.S. through 2028,” Zuckerberg said at a recent White House dinner, according to the Journal. Questions about Meta’s ability to earn a return on its superintelligence bet come in the context of a simple problem: With the exception of the company’s advertising model, Zuckerberg has very little success as an innovator. He is better at execution, strategic acquisitions, and disciplined monetization. For instance, he adapted the social networking concept developed by others, created News Feed and targeted advertising at scale, and most successfully identified and acquired Instagram before it became a threat – transforming a $1 billion gamble into $63 billion in estimated 2025 annual revenue, noted eMarketer. Zuckerberg is struggling to communicate how Meta’s AI bet will evolve into a revenue generating product. “Our view is that when we get the new models that we’re building in MSL in there and get like truly frontier models with novel capabilities that you don’t have in other places, then I think that this is just a massive latent opportunity,” he told investors in the earnings call. This response contrasts sharply with OpenAI which is bringing in $20 billion in annual revenue from ChatGPT – while losing money. Unlike Meta, “there really is a fast-growing product at the bottom of all the OpenAI hype. A fast-growing ARR figure goes a long way to answer questions,” noted TechCrunch. To be fair, Meta is working on promising experiments. These include the Meta AI assistant which has more than a billion active users with help from three billion active Facebook and Instagram users. Yet Meta AI falls short of ChatGPT’s capabilities. Meta also offers Vibes video generator – which did boost the company’s daily active users but lacks significant scale, noted TechCrunch. Finally, Meta is working on the just-launched Vanguard smart glasses – which “feel more like an extension of Meta’s Reality Labs work than a real attempt to harness the power of” large language models, reported TechCrunch. There is also concern about Meta borrowing money to pay for its AI capital expenditures. Last month, the company – which had $28.8 billion in debt at the end of September – announced a $27 billion private-debt deal to “finance the construction of a massive new Louisiana data center, called Hyperion,” reported the Journal. Meta – which partnered with private-credit firm Blue Owl Capital – owns a 20% stake in this project. This deal is ringing alarm bells for investors who remember subprime real estate deals – the collapse of which contributed mightily to the 2008 financial crisis. To be fair, in Q3 Meta had $12.3 billion in unlevered free cash flow from which it could make the lease payments. A typical interest rate for a data center lease is 10%, according to ION Analytics. For Meta, such a lease payment would amount to $1.2 billion annually. Private-equity firms such as Blue Owl put up or raise the money to build a data center, which a tech company will repay through rent. Data-center leases from “Meta can then be repackaged into a financial instrument that people can buy and sell—a bond, in essence,” investor and a financial consultant Paul Kedrosky told the Atlantic. Data center leases – which represent an $800 billion market for private equity firms through 2028 – can be combined into a security and sorted into tranches based on their risk of default, noted the Atlantic, as were subprime mortgages in the years before the financial crisis. While data centers are not houses, the former have different sources of risk. Data centers depreciate in value rapidly. The chips inside them become obsolete within a year or two as Nvidia and rivals release more powerful models. Meanwhile, new generations of AI chatbots are not improving as significantly as previous generations did. This failure to advance suggests spending more on superintelligence is becoming “more tenuous by the day,” added the Atlantic. Nevertheless, investors are optimistic about Meta stock. Some 42 Wall Street analysts set an average price target of $847 – implying more than 30% upside from the recent price, reported TipRanks.

ByJJ Kinahan, Senior Contributor. Key Takeaways -Trade talk between US and China helped calm Markets - Tech and Health Care deals over weekend - Earning season continues The trade truce that was established last week between the US and China is having a positive effect on the markets in today’s premarket trading. We saw the Asian markets with a positive reaction overnight (although Japan was closed for a Holiday) and the S&P500, Nasdaq and the Dow Jones Industrial Average Futures Contracts are all positive in premarket trade today. The major Indices are hoping to build on the momentum of last week and last month. In the month of October, we saw the S&P 500 up approximately 2.5% and the Nasdaq up just under 5%. In what is often a tough month we had an uneven but positive reaction the positive news that we received from Amazon.com on Friday certainly helped us finish on a strong note. As mentioned, we have positive signs in premarket trade, but we also have some deal news that could also help drive markets higher. We had news that Microsoft Corporation announced that they have entered into a contract with IREN Limited, for $9.7 Billion that will allow Microsoft Corporation to have access to NVIDIA Corporation Chips. The five-year contract will include a 20% prepayment and is clearly being viewed positively by the Market. In premarket trade we have both stocks higher, with IREN Limited up by over 20%. We also have a deal in Health Care area, with Kimberly Clark Corporation purchasing Kenvue Corporation which is the parent company of Tylenol. The cash and stock transaction will value the Kenvue franchise at $48.7 Billion. This is a weekend with lots of news coming into Monday, but there are still some other things to keep our eyes on that will move markets and some things we will talk about for the rest of the week. The first thing is to not forget that we are still in the height of earnings season and with that there are some favorites of Retail Traders reporting this week. That starts today with Palantir Technologies. We see the options market is pricing in an expected move of about 2% for the move after earnings on a stock that has doubled this year. We also have Advanced Micro Devices on Tuesday, and all will be waiting to hear more about their recent deals, particularly more about the details on the Oracle Corporation deal. The other major earnings on Monday and Tuesday include Uber Technologies, Shopify Incorporated and Pfizer incorporated The government shutdown continues and besides the human toil and effect of this, we are also seeing companies starting to suffer because of this with the Airlines front and center, as we are starting to see the delay times at airports continue to stack up and companies waiting on approvals for things from the government having to wait while this is settled. We also and news from OPEC+ group this weekend as they announced that they would halt planned production increases at the beginning of 2026. The price of Crude Oil is largely unchanged in premarket trade. We do have some numbers this week, the non-delayed numbers include ISM Services and Consumer Sentiment. Plenty of opportunities this week, as always, stick to your trading plan and long-term goals

Title: Top investing tips for both AI bulls and bears

Disney pulled all of its channels, including ESPN and ABC, from YouTube TV… and its stock went up. Is there no justice in the world? Rundown But first, there's two sides to every story. Love Business Insider? Log into Google and make us a preferred source. Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up now Market musings In my years covering markets, I can't recall a time when there's been more polarizing views on the future of stocks. Sure, there's always chatter when indexes are near record highs about what could send it all crashing down. But it feels different now. The arguments are more multi-faceted, and go beyond the traditional "market-wide valuations are too high" takes. Whether it's concerns over AI capex spending, or cries of unprecedented mega-cap tech weightings in indexes, it seems like the bear case has more meat on the bone right now. On the bullish side of the ledger, investors are happy to lean into the narrative that AI spending will eventually lead to transformational profit growth, pushing stocks even higher. They also see Fed rate cuts as rocket fuel for the entire market, since they've historically served as such, especially for economically sensitive sectors. As a card-carrying (but possibly converted) member of the "not a bubble" camp, the huge sell-off in Meta last week got my attention. It showed that investors are ready to start questioning huge AI spending, even if the company's more diversified tech peers didn't absorb the same share-price hit. But we see both sides of the coin here at First Trade, and have compiled investing recommendations specifically for bulls and bears. For bulls If you're a member of this faction, it's likely you see Fed rate cuts as a godsend, because they'll stimulate economic activity. You also probably feel pretty good about inflation, despite it staying persistently above the Fed's target. Well, you're in luck. Bank of America recently recommended the following sector ETFs that are due for a catch-up if the economy booms in the first quarter of 2026: If you're looking to stick with the AI wave, UBS says these three under-the-radar names are poised for outperformance: For bears If you're fearful of an AI-driven meltdown, fret not, BofA has you covered from this angle as well. The firm says these are the two best places to invest for upside protected from US tech exposure: One additional way to continue outperforming during a tech-driven downturn is through the purchase of momentum stocks. The most popular fund for this is iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF (MTUM). Jason Browne, the founder of Alexis Investment Partners, told BI this past week that the strategy is ideal for when one area of the market — like the tech sector — enters a lengthy rough patch. With US economic data on ice for the foreseeable future, uncertainty reigns supreme in the market. But now you're armed with some trades to deploy, regardless of where you line up. "If you come at the king, you best not miss." — Omar Little from "The Wire" Let's just say I learned this the hard way, and am currently eating crow. Last week, ahead of Amazon's earnings, First Trade wrote about the drastic underperformance of the company's stock over the past five years, relative to the Mag 7 and S&P 500. Well, Andy Jassy must've used it as bulletin-board material, because Amazon promptly crushed earnings and sent its stock spiking 10% (pictured above). The main reason was the stellar performance of AWS, which is also one of the main areas of AI investment. In one fell swoop, Amazon dispatched lingering worries about a core business and assuaged concerns over huge AI spending. The stock still has a long way to go to catch up with peers, but last week was a massive step in the right direction. This chart from Bank of America supports one of the recommendations from the Market Musings section above: buy Chinese stocks if you're afraid of a US tech sell-off. The light blue line — which plots Chinese stocks versus government bonds — is close to a multi-decade low, suggesting immense catch-up potential. Compare that to the dark blue line, which offers the same ratio for US stocks versus sovereign bonds. It's at multi-decade highs, implying limited relative upside. In this section, a weekly feature on Mondays, we manage a hypothetical portfolio. Current stocks: Amazon, JPMorgan, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla Now that's more like it! The First Trade index absolutely crushed it over the last week, and a big part of that was the new addition of Nvidia. Not to mention Amazon spiking 10% on Friday after blockbuster earnings. Those two stocks largely carried our basket of stocks to market-beating performance. What we have here is a perfect example of the electric upside offered by the tech stalwarts that make up the Magnificent 7. These stocks are largely responsible for the stock market's ongoing record-breaking rally, given their massive weightings, and the First Trade index got the same boost as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100. When all was said and done, the First Trade index ended the week 6% higher, handily beating the S&P 500's 1% return. Also, after trailing the S&P 500 last week, First Trade is now outperforming it by more than double since this project started. Can we keep the roll going and do even better this week?

Transcription (Edited): Darren: Hi, I’m Darren Woolley, founder and CEO of TrinityP3 Marketing Management Consultancy, and welcome to Managing Marketing, a weekly podcast discussing the issues and opportunities facing marketing, media, and advertising with industry thought leaders. If you’re enjoying the podcast, please like, review, or share this episode. To be the marketing leader for a major successful consumer packaged goods brand is one thing, but to oversee a portfolio of high-profile, well-loved brands—almost cultural signposts in the market, with decades of prominence—is a major challenge. How do you honor that tradition while nurturing these brands through changes in consumer dietary needs and habits? My guest today has taken on such a challenge at Bega Group. Please welcome the Executive General Manager at Bega Group, Darryn Wallace. Welcome, Darryn. Darryn: Hello, Darren, and thank you for having me. It’s a pleasure to join your podcast today. Career Evolution in Iconic CPG Brands Darren: It’s great catching up. We met when you were at Cadbury, and I’ve followed your career as you’ve built expertise in CPG, beverages, and most recently, dairy. How did you get here? Darryn: I got into consumer goods by chance. I joined Cadbury Schweppes as a graduate in the finance team, which gave me two or three years of grounding in how a business works. I was fortunate to join a company that invested in management experience and learning. I was able to weave my way through many roles, eventually becoming the general manager of marketing at Cadbury, applying the trade to growing great brands. I’ve always had a passion for creating products that the Australian public can love. I’ve zigzagged across categories: confectionery and beverage, and for the last 10 years, dairy, juice, spreads, and staples like Vegemite, Bega Peanut Butter, and Super-Duper ice creams. I’ve been fortunate to work on iconic local brands, but also global brands like Pepsi, Gatorade, and Red Bull. Darren: The portfolio you now manage includes what I call “passion brands.” Vegemite is a cultural signpost. Dairy Farmers, Daily Juice, Pura, and Bega are staples. It must be interesting to apply your global and local experience to these cultural icons. Darryn: If you think about it too long, you can be intimidated. Brands like Farmers Union Greek yogurt (1888), Bega (1899), and Dairy Farmers (1900) are in their third century. You feel a great sense of responsibility and accountability to ensure they remain relevant for today and the next generation. I find it exciting to shape brands with such established heritage and personality to make them modern. The Bega Group is one of the largest agricultural businesses listed on the ASX. We are Australian-owned and local. The ability to be empowered and manage these brands using our local team, local insights, science, and technology is incredibly rewarding. Local Ownership and Relationships in the Dairy Sector Darren: The heavy emphasis on dairy is interesting. Dairy was traditionally connected to the farm, often through co-ops, before corporatization. The industry seems to benefit significantly from local ownership. Darryn: It does. My first impression was that it’s a business of relationships. We run personalized relationships with over 800 farmers across the country who are critical to our success. The market was regulated for a long time, so brands like Big M in Victoria and Masters Milk in West Australia have deep history in their local communities, creating high levels of trust and loyalty. Dairy is an “always on” business. With short shelf-life products, you’re fighting for distribution every day. Our ability to service the market relies on deep relationships because we’re running seven days a week, 52 weeks a year. CPG/FMCG as the Ideal Marketing Training Ground Darren: Many marketers say starting a career in CPG/FMCG is one of the best ways to get hands-on training in the full skillset of marketing. Teams work across product, packaging, pricing, and distribution. Do you feel this comprehensive training is important? Darryn: One hundred percent. I was fortunate to join Cadbury Schweppes when it was integrating businesses, giving it a broad portfolio. As a local business, we had the autonomy to influence what products we made, how we marketed them, where we sold them, and how we priced and promoted them. Cadbury also invested heavily in people, providing training in core marketing disciplines and executive skills like managing change and acquisitions. This comprehensive training has changed over the last 10 years due to globalization. But one of the joys of working with the Bega Group is that we are a local business, which retains the ability to steward brands through a great local team with autonomy over brands and customer relationships. Darren: In global organizations, there’s often more siloing. A strength of CPG/FMCG is a clear understanding of the role of sales to customers (securing pricing and distribution) and marketing to consumers (driving demand) working hand-in-hand—the basis of the Four Ps. Darryn: I have a philosophy I call “removing alibis”—getting rid of excuses so the team can do their best work. Accountability is high. You have to develop the right product with the right insights, explain it to the customer so they stock it, have it come off the shelf, and ensure the consumer likes it enough to buy it again. You learn through doing, and you have no one else to blame. The ability for all technical and specialist functions to work in concert makes the difference. Darren: I find the talk that the generalist is no longer needed overlooks dealing with complexity. While you have specialists (the vertical of the ‘T’ capability), you still need someone with an overview to bring it all together (the horizontal of the ‘T’). Darryn: I grew up in a world that prioritized getting the product right and ensuring availability before promotion or advertising. That generalized capability is really important—knowing which dots to join up. I’m highly dependent on the team and the new skills they bring. I didn’t grow up in the e-commerce era, where for some categories, a third of sales are consumed online. The ability to blend that breadth of knowledge and experience with the art needed in each discipline is key. Product Trends and E-commerce in a Portfolio Strategy Darren: Thirty percent of sales through e-commerce is significant. While people focus on performance media in e-commerce, brand has never been more important. Also, customer experience of the brand has become more important than just the messaging. Darryn: We all shop with our eyes. In a digital environment, products need to “pop off the page and say, ‘Purchase me.'” For food or beverage, it’s the appetite appeal of the images, the relevant words, and being in the right place on the digital shelf. All these disciplines are still focused on making sure we stand out in the most compelling way. We have a large portfolio—more than 30 brands. To manage this, we prioritize eight “power brands” that are market leaders, bring a clear point of difference, and represent over three quarters of our profit. We look after the base and prioritize those eight to make them relevant and future-proof. Darren: Let’s focus on dairy trends. Dairy is ancient, yet we see trends like high fat, low fat, and now high protein. How do you determine whether a trend is a short-term fad or worth tapping into? Darryn: Protein is nearly a mega-trend right now, driven partly by a consequence of COVID. People of all ages are proactively attuned to their health and well-being, consciously focusing on macronutrients. Darren: The focus on longevity and the switch against sugar and carbohydrates have replaced the old low-fat focus, which often relied on corn syrup or high sugar to replace texture. This is now replaced by the need for high protein. Darryn: Flavored milk has taken the next leap. Dairy is a great source of protein, so we can now offer a drink with 30 grams of protein, no added sugar, and reduced fat milk. It brings all the macronutrients of dairy—hydration, calcium, B vitamins, and protein—at a low calorific value. This has become a convenient, enjoyable, and affordable meal replacement. We are seeing the advancement of functionality in dairy. pouch yogurt continues to grow because of its convenience and ease of consumption, with many offering 15 grams of protein. Distribution, Pricing, and the “Always On” Operation Darren: Let’s talk about distribution. I initially thought of your brands as supermarket grocery, but dairy drinks are in every convenience store and servo, plus 30% online. Darryn: I’ve really enjoyed the breadth of customer or channel in dairy. For yogurt, we sell through traditional supermarkets, bulk discounters (Costco, Aldi), online, petrol stations (7-Eleven), health and aged care, and QSR (McDonald’s Happy Meals). Back-of-house yogurt and cream go into most restaurants and cafes. We serve a diverse customer base, so understanding the right offers, pack sizes, and pricing equations for each is vital. Packaging serves multiple roles: providing the correct serve size and representing the brand as a trust mark. Darren: On pricing, the cost-of-living crisis has seen prices on essentials increase significantly, driven by whole supply chain issues, especially energy. Darryn: Inflation has been a real challenge for the Australian public, and dairy has been at the heart of it. We’ve had environmental issues impacting the cost to produce milk, as well as rising costs for transport, ingredients, and packaging. Dairy is a low-margin category, so our focus is productivity first, then pricing to offset costs after all productivity measures. We are deliberate about what price to take, on which products, and how it aligns with household affordability. The last few years have been challenging because you don’t want to take a price that causes consumers to reappraise your brand. Darren: With the short shelf-life of fresh white milk (18 to 20 days is the shortest), there’s little time to move the product from farm to consumption. You’re constantly trying to build a business model that’s efficient and without disruption. This makes it a seven-day-a-week operation—you constantly have to move. Brand Promotion and Distinctive Advertising Darren: For the agencies listening, let’s get onto promotion. You have brands with decades of positioning. What’s your philosophy or approach to advertising for building these brands? Darryn: It’s changed slightly in the last 10 years. We probably don’t invest enough, but where we do, we aim to be noticed and distinctive, leveraging existing assets and fame. For Dairy Farmers, the traditional ad would have shown the farmer, cows, and rolling paddocks, focusing on purity. Our most recent ad shows a cow surfing on a surfboard with people eating different Dairy Farmers products. We are trying to bring more personality and emotion to the advertising and move away from stereotypes. We wanted to capture the emotion of feeling alive and ready to conquer the day. Our advertising is about being brave to do something different. The message, “start the day with oomph,” brings distinctiveness and works well across all aspects of the brand. To me, staying modern, bringing personality to life, and capturing the emotion is the key to building loyalty. Darren: Absolutely. The heritage was good for its time, but being much more consumer-focused—answering the question “what’s in it for me?”—is really important, and your approach does that. Darryn, time has run away from us. It’s been an absolute pleasure, and thank you so much for sharing what you’re doing at Bega Group. Darryn: No, I thank you for being able to spend this time. Hopefully, there are a few nuggets for your listeners to take out of our conversation.

Watch CBS News November 2, 2025 / 7:32 PM EST / CBS News Editor's note: On October 31, 2025, correspondent Norah O'Donnell spoke with President Donald J. Trump at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla., and this is a transcript of that conversation. They started by discussing the president's recent meeting with China's President Xi Jinping. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, first of all, we get along great, and we always really have. We had the COVID moment, which was not-- attractive as far as I was concerned. I wasn't so happy. But outside of that, we have always had a great relationship. He's a powerful man. He's a strong man, a very powerful leader. And-- we've always-- had the best of relationships, probably the best of-- I could-- I think I could speak for him, just about as good as it gets from his standpoint and from my standpoint. And having that is important because of the power of the two countries. NORAH O'DONNELL: What did you get out of this deal that you wanted? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I got sort of everything that we wanted. We got-- no rare earth threat. That's gone, completely gone. We have tremendous amounts of-- dollars pouring in-- 'cause we have-- very big tariffs, almost 50%. We never had anything in terms of tariffs, although I put tariffs on China, but Biden let it lapsed by the-- by the fact that he gave exemptions on almost everything, which was just ridiculous. But-- we have-- billions and billions of dollars coming in, and we have a very good relationship. I mean, we have-- a great relationship with a powerful country. And I've always felt if we can make deals that are good, it's better to get along with China than not, if you can't make the right kind of a deal than not, because, you know, China, along with many other countries (they're not alone in this), they've ripped us off from day one. They've ripped us so much. They've taken trillions of dollars out of our country. And now they're-- it's the opposite. I mean, we're doing very well with China, and hopefully they're gonna do very well with us. But I do think it's important that China and the U.S. get along, and we get along very well at the top. NORAH O'DONNELL: This trade war, though, was hurting Americans. I mean, our soybean farmers. China had stopped buying the soybeans. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. NORAH O'DONNELL: As you mentioned, they were-- China was withholding these rare earth materials that you need for everything from smartphones to-- to build submarines. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure. NORAH O'DONNELL: What-- what was the crucial thing? I mean, how tough of a negotiatior-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, when you say hurting-- NORAH O'DONNELL: --is President Xi-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --it was a temporary hurt. It was a hurt because-- I was takin' in a lot of money from China. We're doing very well against China. And all of a sudden they said, "You know, we have to fight back." And so they used their powers. The power they have is rare earth because of the fact that they've been accumulating it and-- and really taking care of it for a period of 25, 30 years. Other countries haven't. Now we are. I mean, we have tremendous rare earth, and it's going to be-- you know, it's going to be-- it'll be a strength, but it won't really be a strength if everybody has it. Everyone's gonna have it pretty soon. And they were doing it-- on a singular basis. Now-- they use that against us, and we used other things against them. For instance, airplane parts. That's a big deal. They have-- hundreds of Boeing airplanes. We wouldn't give them parts. We were both acting-- maybe a little bit irrationally, but the big thing we had was tariffs ultimately. I said, "Look, if you don't open up, then what we're gonna do is we're gonna impose a hundred percent tariff over and above what you're already paying." And as soon as I said that, they came to the table. We met in South Korea, as you saw, right? A lot of people watched. And-- we made a really good deal. And it was good for them also, I hope. I mean, I want 'em to be good for both sides, but-- we'll be takin' in hundreds of billions of dollars-- in the form of tariffs. You know, tariffs are incredible, because they really give us great national security. As an example-- when they pulled the rare earth on us and the rest of the world, if we didn't have tariffs to fight back, I-- I immediately instituted a 100% tariff over and above what they were already paying. And when I did that, they immediately came to the table. Without tariffs, we would not have had that privilege. We would have-- not have had that right. Tariffs give us national security and great wealth. NORAH O'DONNELL: You talked about those rare earth minerals. Of course-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. NORAH O'DONNELL: --I-- my understanding is about 90% of them come from China. That's their-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Right now. NORAH O'DONNELL: Yeah-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But within a short period of time-- we'll have everything we need for ourselves. You know, we've instituted an emergency program, and we will have-- within a year from now to a year and a half, we'll have everything we need, no matter what kind of a threat is being-- NORAH O'DONNELL: How? How do we do that? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Because we've taken over. First of all, you saw the partnerships w-- we've established with Japan, with Australia, with U.K., w-- with just about everybody, frankly. And we're all doing it together. You know, this wasn't a threat against the United States. This was really a threat against the world. So the w-- whole world has come together, I think, at our behest. And rare earths, in-- within two years, rare earths will cea-- really cease to be a problem. NORAH O'DONNELL: The one thing that China wants but it doesn't have is the world's most advanced semiconductors. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That's right. NORAH O'DONNELL: That's what the United States has. Will you-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Chips in particular. NORAH O'DONNELL: Chips. That's right-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. NORAH O'DONNELL: Will you allow the chip maker, Nvidia, to sell their most advanced chips to China-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No. No, we won't do that. But-- NORAH O'DONNELL: It's not on the table at all? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --we will let them-- deal with Nvidia. Nvidia's the prime-- company in the world for that. And we will let them deal with Nvidia but not in terms of the most advanced. The most advanced, we will not let anybody have them other than the United States. NORAH O'DONNELL: Because then they would win the AI race. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, they wouldn't win it necessarily, but they would certainly have-- an equal advantage. Right now we're winning it because we're producing electricity like never before by allowing the companies to make their own electricity, which was my idea, which nobody, frankly, had thought of. These massive plants that are being built are building their own electric generating plants along with the plant itself. And that gives them all the electric they need without going to an old grid that's, you know, 150 years old. And-- they're makin' it-- themselves, and then they're selling back any excess electricity into the grid, so we benefit in all ways. But most importantly, it allows the c-- the companies to go immediately forward. We're getting-- approvals done in two and three weeks. It used to take 20 years. And we are leading the AI race right now by a lot. We are leading it by numbers that people have no idea. It's been-- it's been really great. We've been very, very far-reaching for it-- th-- look, that's the new internet. That's the new everything all put together. The AI race is a big deal. NORAH O'DONNELL: Mr. President, you just negotiated this one-year trade deal with China-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yep. NORAH O'DONNELL: But as you know, the Chinese, they think in a hundred years. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure. NORAH O'DONNELL: They play the long game, including on our own soil. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We play the long game too. NORAH O'DONNELL: Our own intelligence agencies say the Chinese have infiltrated parts of the American power grid and our water systems. They steal American intellectual property and Americans' personal information. They bought American farmland. How big of a threat is China? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's like everybody else. We're a threat to them too. Many of the things that you say, we do to them. Look, this is a very competitive world, especially when it comes to China and the U.S. And-- we're always watching them, and they're always watching us. In the meantime, I think we get along very well, and I think it's-- I think we can be bigger, better, and stronger by working with them as opposed to just-- knocking them out-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Hmm. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --of the economy. They can produce things that we don't want to produce because it's not really worth our while-- making-- undergarments, makin' this-- you know, certain things. We don't want to do that, and we can buy them inexpensively from other places in the world while we can lead the world in AI, and chips, and lots of other things. Within-- two years from now, we'll have 40% or 50% of the chip market. What's happening here, the biggest companies are leaving Taiwan. They're coming into the United States because of tariffs. If we didn't have tariffs, they wouldn't be doing it because-- NORAH O'DONNELL: In how many years? You think we'll be producing-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think in two years, we'll start opening up plants and we'll have a very substantial portion of the chip market. Right now we have almost none. We should have had a hundred percent. If we had par-- if we had presidents that knew anything about business or knew what they were doing, because, frankly, they didn't. We lost 50% of our automobile business. It's all coming back. We lost a hundred percent of the chip-- you know, it used to be all Intel and other companies. And what happened is other countries came in, and they stole our chip business, and we didn't charge tariffs. If we would have charged let's say a 100% tariff, none of those companies would have left. But they all left. Now they're all coming back, Norah, because the only way they avoid the tariffs is to build in our country. If they build in our country, make their plant and make their product in our country, then it's a very simple thing. They-- they don't have any tariff to pay. NORAH O'DONNELL: Uh-huh. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And that's what they want to do. And so instead of charging somebody a 100% tariff and you can make your product outside, they come in, and they make-- and this is why we have $17 trillion being invested in the United States right now. By the time it-- it-- just to show you how big that is, it's the biggest in history by many times. No other country's been any-- seen anything like it. The Biden administration in four years did less than a trillion. We have 17 trillion-- more than $17 trillion right now, and I'm in my ninth month. By the time we finish up, I think we're gonna have over $20 trillion invested in the United States or to be invested in the United States-- NORAH O'DONNELL: How will that trickle down to the average worker? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Because of jobs, because they're building plants. W-- we're bringing back the auto industry into our country. We lost 58% of the automobile manufacturing business to other countries. You know, we used to be the king of automobile and automobile manufacturing, and now we're not really the king anymore, you know? Within a year and a half, two years, we're gonna be the king again. We're gonna-- the-- the-- as an example, I was also in Japan, as you know, and South Korea. We had-- the biggest Japanese companies are investing billions of dollars in building auto plants in the United States. If I weren't elected-- if I weren't elected, we would be losing all of these jobs. We would be losing far more of the auto industry. We would be nowhere in chips. Our country would have been bankrupt, and we would have had a bigger welfare roll. They would have expanded welfare and forgotten about everything else. Now we're building a country that's gonna be so strong, I don't know if you saw the last numbers in terms of employment. They're all non-government jobs. Not just government. Government jobs are easy. I could-- I could immediately inc-- do anything I want with government jobs. I'd just say, "We're gonna add up-- we're gonna add on a million government jobs," and you're gonna say, "Oh, what wonderful numbers." They don't mean anything. We are building jobs at a level that nobody's ever seen before. But when all of these plants that are currently under construction and to be under construction, when they open, we're gonna have an economy like our country has never seen before, the strongest economy in the world. We're doing very well. By the way, the stock market just hit-- perfect timing for your show, just hit an all-time high. It's hit an all-time high 48 times during the course of my-- nine-month period. But just yesterday, the stock market hit an all-time high. We're doing really well, and everybody knows it-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Can I ask-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Let's put it this way-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Can I-- can I ask you-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The smart people know it. NORAH O'DONNELL: Uh-huh. Can I ask you, Mr. President-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The smart people definitely-- NORAH O'DONNELL: --on that point, though? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. NORAH O'DONNELL: When the stock market is doing well, that doesn't affect everybody. Not everybody's invested in the stock market-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It does. Oh, it does, it does. NORAH O'DONNELL: But there have been-- grocery prices are up-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Look, 401(k)s. People have 401(k)s. Their 401(k)s are double what they were a year ago. NORAH O'DONNELL: Uh-huh. But for people that don't have 401(k)s, who are not invested in the stock market-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure. But-- but-- NORAH O'DONNELL: --they've seen their grocery prices go up, inflation-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, you're wrong. They went up under Biden. Right now they're going down. Other than beef, which we're working on, which we can solve very quickly. So the beef-- the ranchers have really taken a drubbing over a 30-year period. Because of what I've done, the ranchers have done well. But with that, the beef price went up a little bit. We're gonna get the beef price down very quickly. It'll be very nice, just like eggs. When I first took over, eggs were double, triple, quadruple what they were. This was because of Biden. All of these problems were caused by Biden, whether it's-- the people that came into our country through jails. I mean, they were released from jails. They were lease-- released from mental institutions into our country. These problems are caused by Biden. We had an open border. Now we have a border that's, as you know, absolutely shut other than-- NORAH O'DONNELL: How-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --people are allowed to come into our country, but they have to come in legally. NORAH O'DONNELL: I do want to talk about immigration and some other- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure. NORAH O'DONNELL: --domestic issues. But just-- if we could stay on China for just a moment-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure. NORAH O'DONNELL: One potential flash point with China, probably the potential flash point with China in the coming years, is over the issue of Taiwan. The Chinese military is encroaching on Taiwan's sea lanes, its airspace, its cyberspace. I know you have said that Xi Jinping wouldn't dare move militarily on Taiwan while you're in office. But what if he does? Would you order U.S. forces to defend Taiwan? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You'll find out if it happens. And he understands the answer to that. NORAH O'DONNELL: Why not say it-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: This never even came up yesterday, as a subject. He never brought it up. People were a little surprised at that. He never brought it up, because he understands it, and he understands it very well. Taiwan is a very interesting case. It's 69 miles away from China. We're 9,500 miles away. But that doesn't matter. He understands-- what will happen. He and I have spoken about it. But it was never even brought up during a two and a ha-- or two-and-a-half-hour meeting we had yesterday. NORAH O'DONNELL: Do you mind if I ask, when you say, "He understands," why not communicate that publicly to the rest of us? What does he understand that-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --I don't want to give away-- I can't give away my secrets. I don't want to be one of these guys that tells you exactly what's gonna happen if something happens. The other side knows, but-- I'm not somebody that tells you everything because you're askin' me a question. But they understand what's gonna happen. And-- he has openly said, and his people have openly said at meetings, "We would never do anything while President Trump is president," because they know the consequences. NORAH O'DONNELL: Less than an hour before your meeting with President Xi, you posted on social media that you instructed the, quote, Department of War to start testing our nuclear weapons-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That's right. NORAH O'DONNELL: --immediately. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah-- NORAH O'DONNELL: What did you mean? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, we have more nuclear weapons than any other country. Russia's second. China's a very distant third, but they'll be even in five years. You know, they're makin' 'em rapidly, and I think we should do something about denuclearization, which is gonna be some-- and I did actually discuss that with both President Putin and President Xi. Denuclearization's a very big thing. We have enough nuclear weapons to blow up the world 150 times. Russia has a lot of nuclear weapons, and China will have a lot. They have some. They have quite a bit, but-- NORAH O'DONNELL: So why do we need to test-- NORAH O'DONNELL: --our nuclear weapons? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, because you have to see how they work. You know, you do have to-- and the reason I'm saying-- testing is because Russia announced that they were gonna be doing a test. If you notice, North Korea's testing constantly. Other countries are testing. We're the only country that doesn't test, and I wanna be-- I don't wanna be the only country that doesn't test. We have tremendous nuclear power that was given to us largely because when I was president (and I hated to do it, but you have to do it)-- I rebuilt the military during my first term. My first term was a tremendous success. We had the greatest economy in the history of our country. But my second term is blowing it away. It's blowing it away when you look at the numbers, the stock market, the jobs. Look at the job numbers, how good they've been. And, again, I have costs down. Remember, Biden gave me the worst inflation rate in the history of our country-- NORAH O'DONNELL: I-- I w-- definitely want to talk about the economy, but I just want to make s-- sure we-- we button up this issue-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure. NORAH O'DONNELL: --on nuclear weapons. And I want to clarify this-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure. NORAH O'DONNELL: Are you saying that after more than 30 years, the United States is going to start detonating nuclear weapons for testing? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm saying that we're going to test nuclear weapons like other countries do, yes. NORAH O'DONNELL: But the only country that's testing nuclear weapons is North Korea. China and Russia are not-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, Russia's-- no, no. Russia's testing nuclear weapons-- NORAH O'DONNELL: So my understanding-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And China's testing 'em too. You just don't know about it. NORAH O'DONNELL: That would be certainly very newsworthy. My understanding is what Russia did recently was test essentially the-- delivery systems for nuclear weapons, essentially missiles, which we can do that but w-- not with nuclear warheads- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Russia's testing, and China's testing, but they don't talk about it. You know, we're a open society. We're different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it, because otherwise you people are gonna report-- they don't have reporters that gonna be writing about it. We do. No, we're gonna test, because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea's been testing. Pakistan's been testing. NORAH O'DONNELL: Not nuclear weapons, is my understanding-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Of course they have-- NORAH O'DONNELL: North Korea has, but not nuclear weapons-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But they don't go and tell you about it. And, you know, as powerful as they are, this is a big world. You don't necessarily know where they're testing. They-- they test way under-- underground where people don't know exactly what's happening with the test. You feel a little bit of a vibration. They test and we don't test. We have to test. And Russia did make-- a little bit of a threat the other day when they said they were gonna do certain forms of a different level of testing. But Russia tests, China-- and China does test, and we're gonna test also. NORAH O'DONNELL: So we are going to-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Doesn't it sorta make sense? You know, you make-- you make nuclear weapons, and then you don't test. How are you gonna do that? How are you gonna know if they work? We have to do that-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Apparently, we don't need to test our nuclear weapons, 'cause they're the best in the world, according to experts I've spoken with-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: According to me. We have the best, and I was the one that renovated them and built them during a four-year period. And I hated to do it, because the destructive capability is something you don't even wanna talk about. But if other people are gonna have 'em, we're gonna have to have 'em. And if we have 'em, we have to test 'em, otherwise you don't really know how they're gonna work. And we don't wanna ever use them. And in the meantime, I've solved eight wars. I knocked out eight wars. I had eight wars-- I brought a little list for you if you'd like to see it-- but I took eight wars and stopped during an eight-month period, during eight months. Before the ninth month I stopped eight wars. The only one I haven't been successful yet in, and-- and that'll happen, is Russia Ukraine, which I thought actually would be the easiest one because I have a very good relationship with President Putin. But-- we are respected again as a country, and that's the way I've been able to stop the wars. I also stopped them because of trade. NORAH O'DONNELL: Who's tougher to deal with, Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Both tough. Both smart. Both-- look, they're both very strong leaders. These are people not to be toyed with. These are people you have to take very serious. They're not-- they're not walking in saying, "Oh, isn't it a beautiful day? Look how beautiful. The sun is shining, it's so nice." These are serious people. These are people that are tough, smart leaders. NORAH O'DONNELL: And on that note, you talk about Ukraine, that being the one war that you are not able to solve. In August, I mean, you rolled out the red carpet for Vladimir Putin in-- Alaska. But there's been-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I roll out the red carpet for everybody. NORAH O'DONNELL: Okay. But is-- but there's been no ceasefire-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think I made-- yes, there isn't-- NORAH O'DONNELL: What's—is he ignoring you? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --because he thinks-- because I inherited a country where he thinks he's winning. That was a war that would've never happened if I was president. He even said that. That was a war that would've never happened. Joe Biden was the president. Joe Biden gave $350 billion to Ukraine, including a lot of weapons, a tremendous amount of weapons, which allowed them to fight, 'cause we make the best weapons in the world. You know, I rebuilt our military during my first term. They used a lotta those weapons in that war. We make the best weapons in the world. Now we make even better weapons. But that was-- NORAH O'DONNELL: So why won't Putin end this war? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --that was-- but-- but Norah, that was Joe Biden's war, not my war. I inherited that stupid war. That should not have been a war. That would've never happened if I were president. And by the way, for four years it didn't happen. There was never even a doubt. Then the election was rigged and stolen, and all of a sudden you see them forming up at the line. And now I come back and I'm gonna get that one solved too. But I brought, I mean, just a little list of-- of-- look at this, wars. How many did I solve? Cambodia-- this is Cambodia Thailand. Kosovo Serbia. Congo-- the Congo and Rwanda. Pakistan and India, that was gonna be a beauty. They shot down seven planes. Israel and Iran, you've heard about that one? Egypt and Ethiopia, that's another beauty. Ethiopia built a big-- dam where there's no water going to the Nile. Armenia and Azerbaijan. And if you take a look, Israel and Hamas, which is a, you know, rough little situation, but it's gonna be-- NORAH O'DONNELL: I do wanna talk about-- I mean, you have branded yourself the peace president. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I think I did-- NORAH O'DONNELL: What-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --pretty good. I-- I solved-- those are eight of the nine wars I solved. I-- NORAH O'DONNELL: When-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --you know how I solved 'em? I said, in many cases, in 60% I said, "If you don't stop fighting, I'm putting tariffs on both of your countries and you're not gonna be able to do business with the United--" NORAH O'DONNELL: So why isn't that-- why isn't that working with Putin? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It is working with Putin, I think. I did different with him because we don't do very much business with Russia, for one thing, you know? He's not, like, somebody that buys a lot from us because of-- foolishness. And I think he'd like to be. I think he wants to come in and he wants to trade with us, and he wants to make a lotta money for Russia, and I think that's great. That's what I like-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Can you get it done in a couple months, do you think? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think we're gonna get it done, yeah. I think he really wants to do business with the U.S. But it did work with India, and it did work with-- Pakistan, and it did work with-- 60% of those countries. I can tell you, if it wasn't for tariffs and trade I wouldn't have been able to make the deals. But I stopped, as an example-- India does a lotta business with us. They were going to war. They were gonna have a nuclear war with Pakistan. The-- Prime Minister of Pakistan stood up the other day and he said, "If Donald Trump didn't get involved, many millions of people would be dead right now." That was a bad war he was ready to start. NORAH O'DONNELL: Let's talk about-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Shot down airplanes all over the place. That really-- that was gonna be a bad war. And I told both of them, I said, "If you guys don't work out a deal fast, you're not gonna do any business with the United States." And they do a lotta business with the United States. And they were both great leaders, and they worked out a deal, and they stopped the war. That would've been a bad war. It would've been a nuclear war. NORAH O'DONNELL: I wanna stay on the issue of foreign policy, and let's turn to our hemisphere. There have been at least eight boats in the Caribbean destroyed by the U.S. military-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Fortunately. NORAH O'DONNELL: And now the U.S.S. Gerald Ford, that is the world's largest aircraft carrier, on the way to the Caribbean. Are we going to war against Venezuela? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I doubt it. I don't think so. But they've been treating us very badly, not only on drugs-- they've dumped hundreds of thousands of people into our country that we didn't want, people from prisons-- they emptied their prisons into our compan-- country. They also-- if you take a look, they emptied their mental institutions and their insane asylums-- into the United States of America, 'cause Joe Biden was the worst president in the history of our country-- NORAH O'DONNELL: But why is our aircraft carrier-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Let me just finish. NORAH O'DONNELL: --going down there? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Joe Biden was the worst president in the history of our country. We had the worst inflation, we had the worst of everything. But the worst thing he did was allow millions of people to come into our country that were many-- in many cases, criminals, murderers, 11,888 murderers were let into our country. Venezuela let a lot of those people in. But they were from all over the world. This isn't just Venezuela. They were from all over the world. NORAH O'DONNELL: We are gonna talk about-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And what he did to our country should never be forgotten. He had an open-border process, and people would come in, and I'm not discriminating against tattoos, but people would come in with tattoos all over their faces, and say, "Come on in, come on in, come on in." They let people in that should've never been. Venezuela emptied their prisons into the United States of America. And every one of those boats that you see shot down-- and I agree, it's a terrible thing-- but every one of those boats kills 25,000 Americans. Every single boat that you see that's shot down kills 25,000 on drugs and destroys families all over our country. NORAH O'DONNELL: We will talk about immigration in a moment, but I just wanna talk about the scale of the military operation around Venezuela, because it has been described to 60 Minutes as using a blowtorch to cook an egg. Is this about stopping-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I don't think so. Look-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Is it about-- let me ask you, though. Is it about stopping narcotics? Or is this about getting rid of President Maduro? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, this is about many things. This is a country that allowed their prisons to be emptied into our country. To me, that would be almost number one, because we have other countries-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Well we don't need to blow up boats in order to deal-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Look, Mexico has been very bad to us in terms of drugs, okay? Very bad. We have a closed border right now. You probably noticed that for five months in a row, they have zero-- think of this, zero people coming into our country through our southern border. And it was millions of people a year just a little more than a year ago. Millions of people a year walked into our country totally unchecked, unvetted. We had no idea who they were. And we're never gonna let that happen again. That's what made Biden the worst president, because you know what, inflation I've already taken care of. We had the worst inflation in the history of our country, and now we don't have inflation. It's at 2%. It's-- it's the perfect inflation. NORAH O'DONNELL: Aren't-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But what made him so bad-- well, the weaponization of law enforcement, all of that. Look, he was bad in every way. But the worst thing that he did is allow millions, and millions, and millions of people to pour into our country unvetted, unchecked. And they were criminals, they were murderers, they were drug dealers, they were people from jails, and people from mental institutions. NORAH O'DONNELL: You-- you have had success on immigration, I wanna talk about that in a minute. But on Venezuela-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Big success. NORAH O'DONNELL: On Venezuela in particular, are Maduro's days as president numbered? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I would say yeah. I think so, yeah. NORAH O'DONNELL: And this issue of potential land strikes in Venezuela, is that true? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't tell you that. I mean-- I'm not saying it's true or untrue, but I-- you know, I wouldn't-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Why would we do it? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --I wouldn't be inclined to say that I would do that. But-- because I don't talk to a reporter about whether or not I'm gonna strike. I'm not gonna-- you know, you're a wonderful reporter, you're very talented, but I'm not gonna tell you what I'm gonna do with Venezuela, if I was gonna do it or if I wasn't going to do it. NORAH O'DONNELL: Why do we need an aircraft carrier and all of group--strike group-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's gotta be somewhere. It's a big one. NORAH O'DONNELL: I just think it-- it leads to the suggestion that the United States military is planning a larger operation involving Venezuela. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, we're not gonna allow countries from-- what-- you know, it's countries from all over the world coming in. You know, they come in from the Congo where we just settled that war. But it come-- they come in from the Congo, they come in from all over the world, they're coming, not just from South America. But Venezuela in particular-- has been bad. They have gangs-- Tren de Aragua, do you ever hear of it? NORAH O'DONNELL: Of course-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The most vicious gang anywhere in the world. They cut people's hands off if they call up the cops. You know, they call up the police and they said, "Did you call the police?" "Yes, I did. You took my apartment, you live in my building, you took my apartment." They cut his hand off. NORAH O'DONNELL: I-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: "Don't ever call the police again." NORAH O'DONNELL: I fully underst-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: These are animals. Wait a minute. And they came in from Venezuela. Worst gang-- probably the worst gang, most vicious gang in the world. And you know what I did? In Washington, D.C., we had a lot of 'em. We took care of business. They're gone. Washington, D.C., right now is a very safe place, as it should be. Washington, D.C., be-- before I got here was almost like a crime capital of the world. It's the capital of this country. To me, it's the capital of the world. You see the way they treat me. I go to Japan, I go to South Korea, I go to Chi-- any place I go, and you know what I call that? Respect for our country. They didn't treat Biden that way. When Biden went there-- first of all, he hardly went anywhere. Guy couldn't leave his bedroom. But they didn't treat Biden that way. They had no respect for Biden falling up the stairs going to an airplane three times. I mean, this is a man who should've never been president. This was a rigged election. And we-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Can I ask-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --have to get back-- we have to get to the bottom of that also, because we don't want that to ever happen again. You see what's going on. We don't ever want that to happen again. Look what happened to our country by having Biden as the president. NORAH O'DONNELL: I-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our country went to hell. And if we-- NORAH O'DONNELL: I wanted to ask you about Israel-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --had another couple of years, if Kamala had won the election, our country right now would be finished. It was a dead country, and now we have the hottest country anywhere in the world. We have the strongest stock market, we have everybody wants to come in. A year ago we were a dead country. Right now we have the hottest country anywhere in the world. Think of that. And I did that in nine months. And it's only gonna get better. NORAH O'DONNELL: Let's talk about Israel, as we're on foreign policy and talking about some of your successes. You got-- on Israel, you got the remaining Israeli hostages out of Gaza. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I did. NORAH O'DONNELL: You arranged a ceasefire, however fragile that may be. Those are major-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's not fragile. It's a very solid-- you know, I mean, you hear about Hamas, but Hamas could be taken out immediately if they don't behave. They know that. If they don't behave they're gonna be taken out immediately. They know that-- NORAH O'DONNELL: How do you get Hamas to disarm? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If I want 'em to disarm, I'll get 'em to disarm very quickly. They'll be-- they'll be eliminated. They know that. Don't forget, you said I got the remaining hostages. I got all the hostages out. But I always said the last 10 or 20 are gonna be tough. But we were tough also, and they let 'em all out. NORAH O'DONNELL: You were tough-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And now, by the way, they're getting-- a lot of the bodies are coming out too. Did you know a lot of the parents-- this is very interesting-- were-- the people that lost their child, you know, mostly sons, but sons and daughters, they knew they were dead, in some cases. Do you know that they were as anxious or even more anxious of getting their child out, even though they knew it was a body that we were dealing with, than the people that had a living child-- a living, breathing child that they knew they were alive, if-- if barely, because the way they lived was so horrible. And-- you saw yesterday four more just came out. We're gonna get them out too. They're buried in many cases. They're buried under rubble. But we pretty much know where they were. But I didn't get just the 20 out. I got all of the hostages out. NORAH O'DONNELL: You pushed the Israeli Prime Minister to make this deal, to get a ceasefire, to apologize-- to Qatar. Can you push Bibi Netanyahu to recognize a Palestinian state? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, he's-- he's fine. He's fine. Look, he's a wartime prime minister. I worked very well with him. Yeah, I mean, I had to push him a little bit one way or the other. I think I-- I did a great job in pushing-- he's a very talented guy. He's a guy that-- has never been pushed before, actually. And that's the kind-- that's the kind of person you needed in Israel at the time. It was very important. I don't think they treat him very well. He's under trial for some things, and I don't think they treat him very well. I think it should-- you know, we'll-- we'll be involved in that to help him out a little bit, because I think it's very unfair. But he's a wartime prime minister. I did, I pushed him. I didn't like certain things that he did, and you saw what I did about that. I also stopped-- you know, I-- we knocked the hell out of Iran, and then it was time to stop, and we stopped. Iran wants to make a deal. They don't say that, and they probably shouldn't say-- no good deal maker would. But Iran very much wants to make a deal. The key to Middle East peace-- I made Middle East peace. For 3,000 years they couldn't do it. I did it. And I did it with some very good partners in Israel. But the key to the Middle East peace was knocking the hell out of their potential-- nuclear. When we, with those beautiful B-2 bombers-- we just ordered 20 brand new ones, the newest and the greatest-- but with those beautiful B-2 bombers, when they went in there and they blew the hell out of that, you know, potential nuclear weapons site-- there were two of 'em, actually. And every single missile hit every single air shaft. You know, they had to go down an air shaft. Every single one of 'em hit their target. And I remember fake news CNN said, "Well, maybe it wasn't as powerful or as good as we thought." No, it was much-- turned out it was actually better. You know the Atomic Energy Agency said the hit was even stronger than anyone ever thought possible. And those pilots did a great job. What they were able to do-- and those machines. But it wasn't only them. They were surrounded by F-22s and F-16s. They were surrounded by F-35s. They were-- do you know we had 52 tanker planes, loading 'em up with jet fuel, because it was a long flight. They flied-- they flew for 37 hours. Of course, I flew for thirty-- 42 hours over the last three days, so I know how they feel. But they flew-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Except there's a bathroom on Air Force One-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --but they were sitting in one seat. I was-- I was able to walk around a little bit. But yeah, they said 42 hours. I've been in the air for 42 hours over a few days-- and that was fine, because we took in trillions of dollars into our country. And we also-- you know what's interesting, Japan took tremendous advantage of us over the years. You know, they sold cars to us, we couldn't sell cars to them. They made a fortune, we didn't make anything, we lost money. But it's the exact opposite now. But you know what? They like us more now than they used to because they respect us now. They didn't used to respect us, and they have great respect for us, all of 'em. Every country has-- including China. China now has great respect for us. They didn't have respect for us when they had Biden and when they had Obama. Obama was a terrible president. Nobody wants to talk about it because they wanna be politically correct. I don't care. He was a terrible president. Our country was-- it really started a very bad downward spiral. Then I stopped it, then we had a rigged election, and then-- what-- what Biden did to our country should never, ever be forgotten. NORAH O'DONNELL: We're still on-- on foreign policy, so I just have another question-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, I'm with-- I'm on all policy. NORAH O'DONNELL: I know you are-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm not talking about foreign-- no, no. I'm talking about everything. NORAH O'DONNELL: Well, I just wanna-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm talking about economy, I'm talking about everything-- NORAH O'DONNELL: I wanted to ask you about the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia is coming to the White House-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That's right. NORAH O'DONNELL: --this month. He has said they won't join the Abraham Accords without a two-state solution. Do you believe that? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No. I think he's gonna join. I-- I think-- we will have a solution. I don't know if it's gonna be two-state. That's gonna be up to Israel and other people, and me. But-- look, the main thing is you could've never had any kind of a deal if you had a nuclear Iran. And you essentially had a nuclear Iran. And I blasted the hell out of 'em, and no president is-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Are you convinced they have no nuclear capability right now in Iran? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Do you wanna know-- do you wanna know-- they have no nuclear capability, no. Do you wanna know that-- the pilots, I invited them to the White House-- NORAH O'DONNELL: I saw that. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --'cause they were very brave. I mean, I wouldn't have wanted to do it, you know, getting in a plane, and they know you're coming, and you're going right into Iran airspace. And, you know, they're very experts, and you're flying in with machines, these big, fantastic, unbelievable, beautiful wings that carry massive 100,000-pound bombs, and you don't-- I personally-- I can think of other things I'd rather do. These guys are very brave people. They're-- they were beautiful-looking people. They were-- they're real-- I mean, they're real American heroes, and I thought they deserved to be invited. And I invited 'em to the White House, the Oval Office, including the mechanics and the people behind the scenes, I invited-- NORAH O'DONNELL: I saw that. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --a lot of 'em. And they told me something I didn't know. They said, "Sir, for 22 years we've been practicing this route. Our predecessors," obviously, before them-- but "our predecessors and ourselves, for 22 years we've been practicing this hit, three times a year, every year, for 22 years. And you were the only president that let us do our job." I said, "Let me ask you. Is this a job you wanted to do?" "Yes, sir, 'cause it was the right thing." These are really brave people. These are really amazing people, and talented people. When you can hit at midnight with no moon, with no vision, every single air shaft, where that bomb went deep into that mountain and exploded and beat the hell out of it, I'll tell you what, they deserve to come to the White House. I gave 'em all a medal. They deserve to come to the White House. And it was a pleasure to meet 'em. These are great people. We have great people in this country. NORAH O'DONNELL: Mr. President, we've talked about foreign policy, now let's focus on issues here at home-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Okay, sure. NORAH O'DONNELL: --some of that you have already mentioned. We are now approaching the longest shutdown in American history. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Democrats' fault. NORAH O'DONNELL: Under your presidency, we're talking about more than a million federal workers who are not getting a paycheck, including our air traffic controllers. You see there's traffic snarls out at the airports now. This weekend food aid for more than 42 million Americans is set to expire. What are you doing as president to end the shutdown? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, what we're doing is we keep voting. I mean, the Republicans are voting almost unanimously to end it, and the Democrats keep voting against ending it. You know, they've never had this. This has happened like 18 times before. The Democrats always voted for an extension, always saying, "Give us an extension, we'll work it out." They don't wanna give us an extension because they used to think it was good for him, but the polls are turning around because-- not turning around. I just saw a poll where they're down 20-25%. What's happening is the people understand they're losing so much, they call it Trump derangement syndrome. They are losing so much that they don't know what to do. They've lost their way. They've become crazed lunatics. And all they have to do, Norah, is say, "Let's vote." And you can open the-- the economy could open up during our interview-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Is there something you can do, though-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Maybe it did. NORAH O'DONNELL: Is there something you can do-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: All I can do-- NORAH O'DONNELL: --to bring this to an end? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --is give the facts. Here's what I can't do. I can't give them $1.5 trillion so that they can give welfare to people that came into our country illegally. So that prisoners, and that people from mental institutions, and people that are drug dealers get vast amounts of money for healthcare. That I can't do-- NORAH O'DONNELL: So my under-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: What I can do is I can continue to run a great country. We have the best economy we've ever had. I can continue to do that. What they should do-- look, this started a long time ago. I always said-- and you know I've been very consistent-- Obamacare is terrible. It's bad healthcare at far too high a price. We should fix that. We should fix it. And we can fix it with the Democrats. All they have to do is let the country open and we'll fix it. But, you know, people are gonna get an 18-19% increase in Obamacare. It was a faulty program, it should've never been approved. But it was approved. NORAH O'DONNELL: So now that we're in-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If we fix it it'll be-- one of the greatest achievements. But-- NORAH O'DONNELL: But if ending the government shutdown-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --they have to let the country open, and I'll sit down with the Democrats, and we'll fix it. But they have to let the country-- and you know what they have to do-- NORAH O'DONNELL: So your plan-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: All they have to do is raise five hands. We don't need all of ''em. NORAH O'DONNELL: But so you're saying your plan is to tell the Democrats to vote the-- to end the shutdown. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Correct, very simple. NORAH O'DONNELL: And that you will put forward a healthcare plan? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No. We will work on fixing the bad healthcare that we have. Right now, we have terrible healthcare and too expensive for the people, not for the government, for the people. NORAH O'DONNELL: But Mr. President, with all due respect-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The people are paying-- NORAH O'DONNELL: --you've been talking about fixing the healthcare insurance plan since 2015-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure. And you can't do it because of the Democrats. That's right. NORAH O'DONNELL: Since 2015, you said you'd fix it. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I've been talking about it for a long time. We almost did it. We were one vote short. We woulda had great healthcare. We were one vote short. And coupla Senators that we currently have made the mistake, and they-- they made a big mistake. John McCain made a mistake, frankly. We were one vote short. We woulda had great healthcare. And I've been saying ever since, "We can fix it. It's too expen--" it's got two things. It's too expensive, and it's lousy healthcare. It's too expensive for the people. They're gonna get a very big increase this year. And it's because-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Well, they're gonna get an increase if they don't-- if you don't extend the subsidies. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, no. But the subsidies is part of it. We're supposed to spend trillions of dollars to take care of something that-- that is defective. What I'm saying is, we can make it much less expensive for people and give them much better healthcare. And I'd be-- NORAH O'DONNELL: But where is that plan? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --willing to work with the Democrats-- NORAH O'DONNELL: But where is that plan? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --on it. The problem is, they want to give money to prisoners, to drug dealers, to all these millions of people that were allowed to come in with an open border from Biden. And nobody can do that. Not-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Can I just-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --one Republican would ever do that. NORAH O'DONNELL: Can I just button that up? Because the extension of these Obamacare subsidies, if they are not extended is that's what the Democrats are pushing for. I know you understand that. Tens of millions of Americans will see their monthly payments double. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, no. It's going to double-- NORAH O'DONNELL: That's a lot. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --anyway. It's gonna double anyway-- NORAH O'DONNELL: My understanding is, it's just the...but can I-- may I just-- my understanding is, if those healthcare subsidies are not expan-- extended, premiums will double for many of the people that are on it. And I was looking into it. Three quarters of these people that will see their healthcare premiums double live in states where you won in the last election. I mean, even here in Florida has the highest number of residents on Obamacare in the country. If those-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And I'm saying we can fix it, Norah. NORAH O'DONNELL: But if the subsidies are not extended, they're not gonna be able to afford health insurance-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Look. It was a defective plan put into line by Barack Hussein Obama, who was a lousy president, not nearly as bad as Biden, by the way, who by the way is building a museum that's, like, four times over budget. It'll never open, built in a neighborhood that-- you know, it's just not gonna work. The neighborhood doesn't even want 'em. NORAH O'DONNELL: Okay. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And it's a disaster. The same guy that did his museum, which is a total catastrophe, came up with a bad healthcare plan. And for the sake of one vote, we would have had, you know, it's so sad thinking back-- NORAH O'DONNELL: But how-- I guess the question is-- I hear you. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If we had the vote, that one vote, we would have great healthcare at a much lower cost, and that's what I want. But I don't want to give $1.5 trillion to prisoners and drug dealers and-- and the people that-- that came into our country from mental institutions. What they allowed to come into our country, and we're getting 'em out, but what they allowed to come into our country, Norah, is horrible. So-- NORAH O'DONNELL: I just-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --ready? NORAH O'DONNELL: Okay. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We can make it good. NORAH O'DONNELL: I don't want to get into a back-- too much of a back and forth on this-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, but here's all I have to do. Open up the country. Open up the country. NORAH O'DONNELL: You mean, end the shutdown-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We only need five of the-- of their votes. We only need five votes, and already a couple of Democrats, a few Democrats are already voting. They want to open up. And we'll fix all of those problems. NORAH O'DONNELL: You're st-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Those problems are much easier than what I just did with solving all these wars. NORAH O'DONNELL: Last question-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We had-- wait a minute, we had nine wars on our planet. I solved eight of 'em. I have one to go, Russia-Ukraine. I thought that was gonna be one of the easier ones but it's not because Putin is tougher than people thought-- NORAH O'DONNELL: You have-- you-- you have helped these government shutdowns in the past when it came about-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I did. NORAH O'DONNELL: And you did it by bringing back-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm very good at it, but I'm not gonna do it by-- NORAH O'DONNELL: You brought members of Congress to-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --I'm not gonna do it by extortion-- NORAH O'DONNELL: --to the White House. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm not gonna do it by being extorted by the Democrats who have lost their way. The-- there's something wrong with these people. NORAH O'DONNELL: So then what happens on November 15th-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Schumer-- Schumer is a basket case. NORAH O'DONNELL: --when the troops don't get a paycheck? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Schumer is a basket case. He's gonna be defeated in the next election by a vast number of people. And he has nothing to lose. He's become-- I just left Japan. He's become a kaz-- kamikaze pilot. This guy-- NORAH O'DONNELL: It sounds like-- it sounds like this is not gonna get solved-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --is, this guy is a kamikaze. He would rather see the country fail than have Trump and the Republicans do well. But the people don't want that-- NORAH O'DONNELL: It's, I know, I hear you. It sounds like-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: So we have a record-setting country right now, and we're not gonna be extorted by a man who's grossly incompetent, who-- who is gonna be defeated by any one of five different candidates. We're not gonna let that happen-- NORAH O'DONNELL: It sounds like this is not gonna get solved. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Say it? NORAH O'DONNELL: It sounds like it's not gonna get solved, the shutdown. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's gonna get solved, yeah. Oh, it's gonna get solved. NORAH O'DONNELL: How? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We'll get it solved. Eventually, they're gonna have to vote. NORAH O'DONNELL: You're saying the Democrats will capitulate? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think they have to. I mean, look, I-- I use the word kamikaze, not freely. I don't like to have to use that word. They are kamikazes, but there are gonna be four or five Democrats that come. We need five. They're gonna come and vote. NORAH O'DONNELL: That's-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And if they don't vote, that's their problem. Now, I happen to agree to something else. I think we should do the nuclear option. This is a totally different nuclear, by the way. It's called ending the filibuster. NORAH O'DONNELL: Did you see John Thune said today they're not gonna do that-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I know John doesn't-- well, John and a few others. But, you know what? The Republicans have to get tougher. If we end the filibuster, we can do exactly what we want. We're not gonna lose power. The theory is, oh, then we'll do it, but then when they get into power someday they'll do it. That's true. But you know what? NORAH O'DONNELL: So you think John-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We're here right now. No, I like John Thune. I think he's terrific, but I disagree with him on this point. NORAH O'DONNELL: Okay. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't-- I don't even know-- actually, I don't even know his attitude on the filibuster, but I think we should do it-- NORAH O'DONNELL: He j-- he said today he wasn't gonna do it. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, that's too bad. You know, I mean, I think we're much better off. 'Cause here's the problem. The Democrats will do it in the first week in office. The Democrats, and I told that to John. The de-- and I get along with him great. We've had a great relationship-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Yes. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And I also know there are other Republicans that feel the other way. And I understand that too, but they're wrong. The Democrats will do it. If they get into power and someday I guess they will. Who knows? It's hard to believe when they have men in women's sports, open borders, open everything, a transgender for everyone. The Democrats will do it in their first day in office, and the only reason they didn't do it is because of Sinema and because of a man named Joe Manchin from West Virginia-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Senator Kyrsten Sinema--. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --good man. And they disagreed with it. Now wait. Had they approved it, I think just one of 'em, had they been able to get those votes, you would have had the nuclear option used. You would have had the filibuster ended, and the Democrats would have used it. So I say to the Republicans that want to be, you know, all like, "Oh, well, we-- you know, we're above all that," the Democrats will do it. See, the Republicans have much better policy. We have smart policy. We have great policy. That's how we win. The Democrats are vicious. They're vicious. They have horrible policy, but they are the most vicious human beings on Earth. They are people that weaponize government. They do a lotta bad things. But-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Can I ask you about-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --the good thing is, from our standpoint, from the standpoint of winning is, they have the worst policy of-- it's hard to believe. Think of it. Open borders, men playing in women's sports, transgender for everybody. I mean, I could go point-- these are not 80:20-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Can I ask you about the economy-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --these are 99:1 issues. And they don't change. I just watched this morning a show where-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Mr. President, can I ask you about the-- the economy-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, just-- just one thing. I watched a show this morning where a very well-known Democrat Congressman was fighting like hell for men playing in women's sports. They don't change it-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Who was that? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't want to tell. You'll be able to check it. Just check your local TV. NORAH O'DONNELL: Okay. On the economy, the signature part of your economic plan is tariffs. The Supreme Court is gonna hear arguments this week on whether you have the authority to impose these sweeping tariffs without Congressional approval. The lower courts have ruled against you. That's why it's at-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, no. NORAH O'DONNELL: --the Supreme Court right now. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Very close rulings, yeah. NORAH O'DONNELL: What happens to your economic plan if the Supreme Court invalidates your tariffs? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think our country will be immeasurably hurt. I think our economy will go to hell. Look, because of tariffs, we have the highest stock market we've ever had. Because of tariffs, 401(k)s at the highest level that-- and this is millions and millions of people that we've ever had 401(k)s. Because of tariffs, I've ended six of the eight wars that I've ended, and it'll end up being used also for the last war in a different way. Because of tariffs and the economy, but because of tariffs, we have a great economy. Because of tariffs, our country is wealthy again. Because of tariffs, tremendously good things happened. Because of tariffs, our country is respected again. Because of tariffs, a president-- NORAH O'DONNELL: So what if the Supreme-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --wait a minute. Because of tariffs, President Xi allowed us to win every single point. He bought billions and billions of dollars of-- of our soybeans, of our everyth-- it was the money they're spending. When I came out, did you see what happened with the farmers? They're having rallies for Trump right now because of tariffs. Because it gives us national security. If we didn't have tariffs, and remember this. Tariffs are used against us. Let me talk about that lawsuit. That lawsuit against us was instituted and backed by foreign countries that have been ripping us off for years. They don't want it because they were rippin' us off for years. And if we lose that lawsuit, they'll continue to rip us off and you're not gonna end up with a country. I think it's the most important subject discussed by the Supreme Court in 100 years. If they don't-- if they take away the power of tariffs from us, and it has to be quick and nimble, you can't have Congress, well, hundreds of people have to look. They can't even agree to continue a country. You can't have Congress here. This has to be quick and nimble. As an example-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Well, you just-- finish that sentence. You said, "If they take away my power to do tariffs," what? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It would be a very sad day for the United States of America. We're making a lot of money. We're respected again all over the world. We have great national security. Let me give you an example. With China, they were, you know, very strongly threatening us frankly with the rare earths. And then I said, "Well, if you're gonna play that card, I'm gonna put a 100% tariff on over and above what you're already paying," which was 55%, which was very high. A lotta money coming in, tremendous money like we've never seen. "I'm gonna put a 100% tariff on everything over and above." And you know what happened? We got a phone call 20 minutes later. "We'd like to talk." If they take away the right to tariff, if they-- if-- if we're forced to use Congress to approve, they can't approve anything. They would be sitting around for years debating whether or not we should use tariffs. If they take-- NORAH O'DONNELL: You want that power. You want that executive power. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You need it to ru-- to protect our country. This is a national secure-- tariffs are national security. If you take away the right to tariff, and remember this. NORAH O'DONNELL: And-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Tariffs have been used against us. NORAH O'DONNELL: Can you just answer that question that tariffs have led to inflation? They have led to an increase in cost of living for most Americans-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They haven't led to inflation. We have no inflation. We have no inflation. Biden had inflation, and he didn't have tariffs. He didn't use tariffs. NORAH O'DONNELL: For the average American-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You know why he didn't use 'em? 'Cause he's not smart enough to use 'em. NORAH O'DONNELL: But the companies say they passed on more than 30% of these costs to the American consumer off the tariffs-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Okay, ready, are you ready? NORAH O'DONNELL: Somebody has to pay for it. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. You have to pay, but we don't have any inflation. Inflation is the que-- is the real test of paying. Everybody said, "Oh, if you do tariffs, you're gonna have inflation." So Biden had the highest inflation in the history of our country by far, okay. No tariffs. I have very modest tariffs compared. Let me tell you. These tariffs ultimately are so good that at some point when they're used properly, and I use them more properly than anybody's ever even dreamt possible, think of it. We become rich. We're taking in trillions of dollars. And I have no inflation. And I have total national security. When I put the 100% tariff on China over and above what they were already paying, which was about 55%, so 155%, they came to the table immediately and they made a deal with us that was a very fair deal. That's called national security. And then I didn't make 'em pay the 100%. That would have been instituted. That would have come to fore on November 1st. Norah, Norah, listen to me-- NORAH O'DONNELL: I know our time with you is limited. I hear you. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If I didn't have the power of tariff, we would be-- we would be like a subject nation. We'd be subject to everyone else. Everybody uses tariffs on us. If I wasn't allowed to use tariffs on them, we would be a third rate-- we would be a third world nation. NORAH O'DONNELL: I know your time is limited, so I do want to make sure I get through another-- more of these topics. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure. NORAH O'DONNELL: Immigration. I mean, you campaigned on immigration. You largely won the election on a promise to close the border-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Did great job, don't you think? NORAH O'DONNELL: --and you succeeded on that. Illegal crossings at the Southern border are at a 55-year low. Want to ask you about this. More recently, Americans have been watching videos of ICE tackling a young mother, tear gas being used in a Chicago residential neighborhood, and the smashing of car windows. Have some of these raids gone too far? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No. I think they haven't gone far enough because we've been held back by the-- by the judges, by the liberal judges that were put in by Biden and by Obama. We've been held-- NORAH O'DONNELL: You're okay with those tactics? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, because you have to get the people out. You know, you have to look at the people. Many of them are murderers. Many of them are people that were thrown outta their countries because they were, you know, criminals. Many of them are people from jails and prisons. Many of them are people from frankly mental institutions. I feel badly about that, but they're released from insane asylums. You know why? Because they're killers. NORAH O'DONNELL: Well, you promised in your campaign that you were going to deport the worst of the worst, violent criminals-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That's what I'm-- oh we're doin' that-- NORAH O'DONNELL: --rapists. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, that's what we're doing-- NORAH O'DONNELL: But a lot of the people that your administration has arrested and deported aren't violent criminals. Landscapers, nannies, construction workers-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Oh, no, no, landscapers who are criminals-- NORAH O'DONNELL: --farmworkers. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Now, look, look. NORAH O'DONNELL: The family of US service members-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I need landscapers and I need farmers more than anybody, okay. NORAH O'DONNELL: But was it your in-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We-- and we want to-- we focus on the bad ones, and we've gotten tremendous numbers of bad people. Don't forget. NORAH O'DONNELL: The-- there-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: When you have over 11,000 murderers released into our country, over 11,000, 50% of which have murdered more than one person, we gotta get 'em outta here. NORAH O'DONNELL: Is it your intent to deport people who do not have a criminal record? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We have to start off with a policy, and the policy has to be you came into the country illegally, you're gonna go out. However, you've also seen, you're gonna go out. We're gonna work with you, and you're gonna come back into our country legally. Because we have a lotta good people. We have some great people. But, you know, the problem we have, and people don't like talking about-- these are very-- NORAH O'DONNELL: But there isn't-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --wait. These are very smart countries. Their leaders are very smart. They're very street-wise. They might not have gone to the finest schools, but they're very street-wise. They want-- they don't want, they have good people. They want people that are bad out. So they, what do they do? They open their jails. They let 'em out. They get rid of their drug dealers. They let 'em out. But you know who else they get out? The people that are on welfare that aren't working. In other words, they have people that just don't work. They don't want people that just don't work, so they put them into our country. NORAH O'DONNELL: But if someone has been in this-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And we've accepted all of these people because of Biden's open border policy where people would walk in totally unchecked and unvetted, murderers and everybody else. NORAH O'DONNELL: When will you declare mission accomplished on immigration? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, it takes a long time, because, you know, probably I say 25 million people were let into our country. A lotta people say it was 10 million people. But whether it was ten or-- I believe I'm much closer to the right number. Of the 25, many of them should not be here. Many of them. But we're-- we're cleaning up our cities. You know, I campaigned on crime, but I've done a much better job on crime than I thought. You know, the crime numbers are way down, even though we have a lot more people in our country that really shouldn't be here. And many of them are stone-cold hard criminals. When I look at D.C. now, you can walk down the middle of the street. You can have your daughter who's ten years old meet you at the park. She's gonna be okay. NORAH O'DONNELL: In certain parts of D.C.-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: She woulda been murdered. Well, I-- in almost-- NORAH O'DONNELL: I live in D.C. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, you tell me-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Certain parts of D.C. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: How big a difference is D.C. now compared to what it was a year ago? NORAH O'DONNELL: Uh-huh. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Right? I mean, you have to be honest with me. People walk-- people in the White House, they walk up to me, young ladies I've never seen. "Sir, thank you very much." I know-- I-- they don't even have to tell me what they're thanking me for. But when I ask why? He said-- she-- one girl said, "I'd get into Uber and I felt dangerous even in an Uber." They'd attack the car, okay. It wasn't even safe then. "Sir, I now walk to work every day and I walk, I-- I-- I-- I'm so safe. I f-- there's nothing going to happen. 100% safe." And you know that too, Norah. NORAH O'DONNELL: I wanna ask you about the s-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You live here. You know that too. NORAH O'DONNELL: I wanna ask you about amer-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Do you see a difference? NORAH O'DONNELL: --American cities-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You see a difference? NORAH O'DONNELL: --in Washington, D.C.? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yes. NORAH O'DONNELL: I think I've been working too hard. I haven't been out and about that much-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Oh, that's not a fair answer. You see the difference. NORAH O'DONNELL: I get in my car and go to work and I go home-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That's good. You don't have to use that one. Don't worry. Don't worry. I don't want to embarrass her. NORAH O'DONNELL: I've been working too hard-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's-- it's like you know what the difference is? Like, day and night. NORAH O'DONNELL: I want to ask you more about some American cities. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure. NORAH O'DONNELL: We are about-- we're on the eve a number of big state and local elections. One of the most watched is the one for Mayor of New York City. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. NORAH O'DONNELL:. . . he is, Zohran Mamdani, 34-year-old Democratic Socialist. He's the front runner-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Communist, not Socialist. Communist. He's far-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Some-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --he's far worse than a Socialist. NORAH O'DONNELL: Some people have compared him to a left-wing version of you, charismatic, breaking the old rules. What do you think about that? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I think I'm a much better looking person than him, right? NORAH O'DONNELL: Okay. Well, former governor Andrew Cuomo, who you know is campaigning for mayor, he recently said that "If Mamdani becomes Mayor of New York City that you will take over New York." Cuomo said this. He said, "He will be President Trump and Mayor Trump. He's gonna take over New York and send tanks down Fifth Avenue." PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Oh, that's so crazy. Look. When I left New York, we were at the-- the epitome of it was a great city. It was doing great. It was a great city, but there were some bad sides, because we had a guy named de Blasio, who was the worst mayor. Like I say Biden was the worst president, de Blasio was the worst mayor in history-- NORAH O'DONNELL: What if Mamdani becomes mayor? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think he's probably gonna make de Blasio look great. I think he will make de Blasio look like one of our great mayors. De Blasio was the worst mayor we've ever had. Now I saw that, you know, but I was sort of leaving during that period of time. I got to see de Blasio, how bad a mayor he was, and this man will do a worse job than de Blasio by far. And it's gonna be hard for me as the president to give a lot of money to New York. Because if you have a Communist running New York, all you're doing is wasting the money you're sending there. So I don't know that he's won, and I'm not a fan of Cuomo one way or the other, but if it's gonna be between a bad Democrat and a Communist, I'm gonna pick the bad Democrat all the time, to be honest with you. NORAH O'DONNELL: Uh-huh. This past Tuesday, while speaking to American troops in Japan, you talked about U.S. cities that are having trouble with crime. And you said, "If we need more than the National Guard, we'll send more than the National Guard." What does that mean, send more than the National Guard? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, if you had to send in the Army or if you had to send in the Marines, I'd do that in a heartbeat. You know, you have a thing called the Insurrection Act. You know that, right? NORAH O'DONNELL: Uh-huh. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Do you know that I could use that immediately and no judge can even challenge you on that. But I haven't chosen to do it because I haven't felt we need it. Do you know that we have a place called Chicago that, with a very bad governor. They threw him outta the family business. He became governor. Do you know that 4,000 people were murdered during his governorship. 4,000 people were murdered during his governorship, and yet he won't let us bring in the National Guard. He won't let us bring in-- in Chicago-- NORAH O'DONNELL: But when you say, "Send in more than the National Guard," what does that mean? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, more would be Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines. NORAH O'DONNELL: So you're gonna send the military into American cities? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, if I wanted to I could, if I want to use the Insurrection Act. Do you know how many presidents-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Will you-- what would be the-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, no. NORAH O'DONNELL: What would-- what would cause you to do that? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Do you know how many presidents have used the Insurrection Act? NORAH O'DONNELL: Tell me. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Almost 50% of 'em. Do you know that some of the presidents, recent ones, have used it 28 times? Twenty-eight times. The Insurrection Act has been used routinely by presidents. I haven't chosen to use it, but if I-- because I've done well without it. But if I needed it, I could do it. And if I needed it, that would mean I could bring in the Army, the Marines, I could bring in whoever I want. But I haven't chosen to use it. I hope you give me credit for that. NORAH O'DONNELL: I wanna ask you about-- another matter. James Comey, John Bolton, Letitia James were all recently indicted. There is a pattern to these names. They're all public figures who have publicly denounced you. Is this political retribution? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You mean, do you think it's bad that I went after a public figure? NORAH O'DONNELL: Is it political retribution? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You know what? You know who got indicted, the man you're lookin' at. I got indicted, and I was innocent. And here I am, because I was able to beat all of the nonsense that was thrown at me. I got indicted. They indicted the President of the United States. You know, they impeached me twice and I got out of it quickly and easily? They impeached me twice. These people are scum. And yet, when you go after a dirty cop like Comey or a guy like Bolton, who I hear has, I don't know anything about it, I hear he took records all over the place, who knows. Letitia James is a terrible, dishonest person, in my opinion. Terrible. I just won the case against her. She wanted me to pay $500 million for something I didn't do anything wrong on. And the judge just overturned the-- the decision. So and then you-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Have you-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Wait, wait, wait. And then you tell me about me. Just so you understand, you say I went after these people. These people are bad people. They're dishonest people. NORAH O'DONNELL: No, I was just asking, is it political retribution-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And Comey's a dirty cop. Look, Comey's known as a dirty cop. I'm not known as a dirty person. They indicted me many times, indicted me. They were after me. I'm lookin' at you now. I'm President of the United States. I went through numerous indictments and two impeachments. And you tell me that I went after people? These people are dishonest. Look. Biden didn't have a clue. He illegally used, as you know, a machine, the autopen in order to give pardons to people. The only pardon he signed it looks like was his son, Hunter. He signed Hunter's, so, "Hunter, you're free, con-- congratulations, Hunter." But everyone else, I think those pardons are all just, were just a waste of time. Those pardons-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Did you instruct-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --wait a minute, those pardons-- NORAH O'DONNELL: --the Department of Justice to go after them? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Did I what? NORAH O'DONNELL: Did you instruct the Department of Justice to go after them? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, and not in any way, shape or form. No. You don't have to instruct 'em because they were so dirty, they were so crooked, they were so corrupt that the honest people we have, Pam Bondi's doin' a very good job. Kash Patel's doing a very good job. The honest people that we have go after 'em automatically. But they instructed them to go after me, because the records now have been found. So when you tell me about I went after Comey, Comey's low on the totem pole. They went after the President of the United States. Do you know that they raided my house in Palm Beach, Florida called Mar-a-Lago? They raided my house. I had 78 or 98 FBI agents with arms-- NORAH O'DONNELL: I know how you-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --come into my house. And you're telling me, Norah, that I went after some low-life named Comey, who's judged to be a crooked guy. He lied all over the place. He lied to Congress and did many other bad things. NORAH O'DONNELL: But I was just asking, has this-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: For that, you should be ashamed. NORAH O'DONNELL: No, no. I was just asking, is this-- is this retribution on your part? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, it's the opposite. I think I've been very mild-mannered. You're looking at a man who was indicted many times, and I had to beat the rap. Otherwise I couldn't have run for president. They tried to get me not to run for president by going after me and by indicting me. But even during my term, on a perfect phone call, I got impeached. This call was perfect. Tim Scott, from South Carolina, highly respected, a legitimate person totally legit, he read the tran-- thank goodness we had a transcript of the call. The call I got indicted on, a call on Ukraine of all places, with the President of Ukraine. It was a perfect phone call. Tim Scott said, "I just read the transcript. The President didn't do anything wrong, was perfect." And that was the end of the indictment pretty much. But I had to go through a whole process. You know, the Democrats knew that I wasn't guilty, because they didn't know the-- the call was-- I didn't know either, the call was essentially taped. So we knew exactly what the call. When they found out that the call was taped, Nancy Pelosi went crazy. She said, "You made me go into this mess." She screamed at all these people that made her do it, bad people like Schiff, et cetera, et cetera. So what happened is, she went nuts and just to conclude, and they said, "Let's do it anyway." They did it anyway, and I won very easily as you know. But you can't then accuse me of weaponizing government. They were horrible human beings. They went after the President of the United States. They went after my children. They went into my wife's-- drawers. NORAH O'DONNELL: I know-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They went into my wife's closets. They held the dresses up. She came back. She said, "Oh, what happened? What happened?" 'Cause she's a very meticulous person. Everything's nice and neat. NORAH O'DONNELL: I've heard you talk about it. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: All of a sudden, everything's, like, they went into my office. They took things that I was allowed to have file-- under the Presidential Records Act that I was allowed to have. I had records. I was allowed to have 'em. Only the president's allowed, but I was-- and it was nothing very significant anyway. There was, like, nothing. Wait, just one second. They opened these-- I'm a very meticulous person too. I have files, beautiful. They took the files, threw 'em all over the phone-- all over the floor. They were all over the floor-- and they took pictures of 'em. This is my office. I said, "What the hell? That's not my office." They took files, they threw 'em all over, and they took pictures and they released 'em to the public that this is "President Trump's office. We caught him with all of this stuff," like it was all over the floor in my office. These are crooked people. These are the same. So don't ask me about, "Did you go after?" Letitia's-- NORAH O'DONNELL: I-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Letitia James, in my opinion, and I only say in my opinion 'cause I guess the lawyers would prefer that I say that 'cause I have a much stronger opinion, she's a total crook. She's a low-life. Comey's a dirty cop. Bolton actually helped me a lot because he was crazy. He's the one who want, him and-- and Cheney, a couple people got Bush to go out and blow the hell outta the Middle East and then take-- you know, then leave. And actually, Bolton helped me 'cause every time somebody saw Bolton standing behind me, foreign countries, they conceded. You know why they conceded? 'Cause they said, "Bolton's a nut job. Trump is gonna take us to war." But I don't listen to people that are stupid. Go ahead. NORAH O'DONNELL: And I know my time is-- is limited with you so I want to be respectful of-- of you, Mr. President. The issue of political violence I want to get to, because you were nearly assassinated in Butler, Pennsylvania. Charlie Kirk. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yup. NORAH O'DONNELL: Was assassinated. Pennsylvania Governor, Josh Shapiro's house was firebombed. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Uh-huh. NORAH O'DONNELL: Minnesota lawmaker murdered. What's your message to those on the left and the right who would seek to commit acts of violence? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I think primarily on the left. A little bit of both, but I think primarily on the left. I think they have to tone it down. I think they have to approve the shutdown so it's not shut down. I think it's very bad what they're doing. They're hurting people. You know, if you think about it, if people aren't gonna get paid, there're gonna be, you know, a lot of angry people out there. They want to get their food. They want to get the money so they can live. In some cases-- whatever they want to get, they want to get. I think by the Democrats not giving us the votes, I think it's-- I think it endangers both parties. I think it's very bad. There's never been a case like this. This is, you know, this is fairly standard stuff. You do auto-- extensions are almost automatic. In fact, they were virtually automatic. This is the only time they don't want to do the extension, because they're losing so badly that they said, "Maybe we have some leverage." One of the Senators said that. "Maybe this is the first time we have some leverage." NORAH O'DONNELL: I wonder if we're-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But they really don't have leverage, because-- NORAH O'DONNELL: I wonder if we're at a breaking point? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --the Republicans can't be extorted in order to ruin our country. NORAH O'DONNELL: Do you feel like we're at a breaking point? Given everything that you-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No. NORAH O'DONNELL: --just said? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No. It's been much worse. NORAH O'DONNELL: Because you-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I mean, over-- over history? NORAH O'DONNELL: Well. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's been much worse. NORAH O'DONNELL: Sure, but the political violence that, you know, we just outlined. The number of-- of members of people in public that have been targeted-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, that's-- that's a different question. Yeah, I think-- NORAH O'DONNELL: --that have been targeted. And then I just read that there's now a number of your cabinet secretaries and aides who are now living on military bases. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. Usually when people talk they're not the problem. It's the ones that don't talk, in terms of that. But-- yeah, I-- I think it's-- it's a lot of the rhetoric. Look, they call me a Nazi all the time. I'm not a Nazi. I'm the opposite. I'm somebody that's saving our country. But they call me Nazi. They have talking points, you know? They have just talking points. And the press is-- is largely responsible for it. The fake news, what they've done-- I think one of the greatest terms I've ever come up with is fake news. What they've done to our country is very bad. They have to change around. Now, nobody believes the fake news. Nobody believes 'em. I mean, they've gone, you talk about popularity, you talk about approval, their approval numbers have gone f-- from, like, in the 90s to in the teens now. We need borders. We need fair votes. And you really need a fair press. If you-- and you do, you have some great journalists and great reporters. But you have some terrible, terrible, dishonest journalists. And I see it all the time, because I'll give 'em a story and they'll have it. Even my trip with China, it was so successful. But of all, the Wall Street Journal, they said, Trump Lowers Tariffs. That was the headline. Trump Lowers Tariffs. That wasn't what happened. I lowered tariff-- tariffs in order to get everything that anybody could possibly dream of. The point wasn't lowering tariffs. I put up a high number, I cut it, and I got everything. And yet the headline in the Wall Street Journal, beautiful picture of myself and President Xi, everything nice. But the headline was Trump Lowers Tariffs. That wasn't the story. The story was Trump got everything, got everything. Including world peace. We're respected as a country. We're not threatened right now. And we're not gonna be threatened. As long as we have a strong, smart president, we're never gonna be threatened by anybody. NORAH O'DONNELL: There's been a lotta talk about 2028 and who will be at the top of the-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well. NORAH O'DONNELL: --Republican ticket. Can you set the record straight? You're not gonna try and run for a third term? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I don't even think about it. I will tell you, a lotta people want me to run. But the difference between us and the Democrats is we really do have a strong bench. I don't wanna use names, because it's, you know, inappropriate. But it's too early. We're talking 3 and ¼ years-- NORAH O'DONNELL: But people do like when you start talking about whether you like J.D. Vance or Secretary Rubio-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I do like J.D. Vance. I like-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Or secretary-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --Marco Rubio. I like-- I like so many people. We have an unbelievable bench. We could run two people together. We have a great bench. So I don't wanna start talking about elections. It's too early. One thing I can tell you, the 2020 election was rigged. And a lotta people say when it's rigged you're allowed to do it again. It was rigged. And it's been caught. And they-- and you see the same information that everybody else does. And it's coming out now in spades. But with all of that, we have a great bench. We have unbelievable people. You could go up and down my cabinet, we have great people. They don't. They have a guy that's ruined the state of California, ruined it, destroyed it. And I have a lotta property out there, I can tell you they've ruined the state of California. He has been terrible. Other than he's got a good line of--bullshit, that's all it is. He's ruined the state. And he's one of the people running. Jasmine Crockett, she's a low-IQ person. They say she might run for president, Jasmine Crockett. This is a very low-IQ person. AOC, I watched her speak the other day, almost the first time she was screaming. She was like a crazy person. Her-- she's got-- not a good speaker. Doesn't have, I don't think, but you never know what it is. You never know what it is c-- that can spark an election. When Joe ran first time I thought he was terrible. He was horrible. I-- I won by a lot. The second time he was running he was doing very poorly, he had a bad debate, and they replaced him in the middle the election. That never-- this could only happen to me. They replaced him with somebody, the press got behind her. Oh, they were so behind her. But eventually she failed because she couldn't speak. She wasn't a very intelligent person, in my opinion. But she couldn't speak properly. She could not speak. And actually 60 Minutes paid me a lotta money. And you don't have to put this on, because I don't wanna embarrass you, and I'm sure you're not-- you have a great-- I think you have a great, new leader, frankly, 'cause the young woman that's leading your whole enterprise is a great-- from what I know. I don't know her, but I hear she's a great person. But 60 Minutes was forced to pay me-- a lot of money because they took her answer out that was so bad, it was election-changing, two nights before the election. And they put a new answer in. And they paid me a lot of money for that. You can't have fake news. You've gotta have legit news. And I think that it's happening. I see-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Mr. President-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --I see good things happening in the news. I really do. And I think one of the best things to happen is this show and new ownership, CBS and new ownership. I think it's the greatest thing that's happened in a long time to a free and open and good press. NORAH O'DONNELL: Mr. President, can I also ask you, we're now at the end of your first year. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. NORAH O'DONNELL: Of this second term. What do you hope to accomplish in the next three years? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I hope I can have the same year that we had. Look, we have been acknowledged to have the greatest nine months. You know, it's nine months. The greatest nine months in the history of the presidency. So if I can keep that going I'll be very happy. Because, you know, what we've done, what we-- I inherited a mess. And I've fixed it, other than it will take a while to get all the criminals, the real criminals, the ones-- the real bad ones, out. But we've gotten a lot of them out. We've gotten a lot of the murderers out. We've gotten a lot of the people from jails out and we've taken 'em back to their countries. In some cases they're so dangerous that we've actually had to put them in our jails because we didn't want 'em coming back. I wanna just keep it going pretty much the same way. I want safety in our cities. Our cities are a mess. And I hate to say it, they're Democrat-run cities. If you take the top 25 cities, they're almost all-- almost every one of 'em is run by Democrats. NORAH O'DONNELL: And to people that say they're-- struggling with the cost of living, expenses-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, cashless bail-- NORAH O'DONNELL: What could you do about that-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, let me just say, cashless bail is a disaster. It's gotta be changed. Sanctuary cities really have to be changed. They're sanctuary, you know what they're sanctuary for? Criminals. Things-- some basic things have to be changed. But one of the things I really have focused on is making Chicago great again. Making-- and we're just getting started in Chicago. But what we did in D.C., where we took D.C. from being so bad to so beautiful, such good-- the restaurants are booming. You can't get into a restaurant. They were closing and now they're all opening every-- you can't get a restaurant now. You can't get into a restaurant. But you c-- if you wanna buy a restaurant or-- or own a restaurant you almost can't find it. I wanna make this happen all over the country. I want it to be like that in New York, in L.A., in Chicago. I wanna do it as much as you can. You know, by the way, Memphis, we're there now. Memphis was a dangerous hellhole. 65% down in crime. And this is after two weeks. We can do it all over the place. It's turned out to be a new passion for me, making our city-- I had no idea we could be that successful. I thought it would take a much longer period of time. Do you know in Washington, in 12 days it was really good. In one month it was close to perfect. NORAH O'DONNELL: And for those that are suffering with cost of living increases and saying they're living paycheck to paycheck-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I'd be very upset with-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Prices are up PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --Biden. Because we don't have any of those problems. We-- we don't have inflation. You know, essentially we don't have inflation. We-- I inherited the worst inflation in the history of our country. We don't have infl-- we're down to 2%, even less than 2%. A couple of items like beef I'm getting down. But our groceries are down-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Healthcare-- healthcare premiums? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I can fix healthcare, give them better healthcare for less money. Obamacare is-- is hurting people. Obamacare was a disaster from day one. I can fix it and make it good. I'd really rather start with a fresh plate, but if it's-- if it's required to keep it, we can make it much better. But it's bad healthcare, and they're gonna get big increases, and that has nothing to do with me. That has to do with the fact that it was originally put into play. It's a shame. But we can make it better. Energy is way down. You know, you're gonna have $2 gasoline very soon. Nobody could believe it. You were at $4, $5, $6, and even $7. Look at the cost of gasoline in California. What it was, I brought it down. The problem is when I bring it down here in California they put more tax. They-- they tax the gasoline to such an extent. No, we're in great shape. This country is in great shape. We're ready to really rock. As I say often-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Are you-- are you-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --we were a dead country. We were a dead country one year ago. Now we have the hottest country anywhere in the world. Leaders have said that to me. Just recently they said that to me. Even President Xi, he said, "I'd like you-- you to be congratulated." He said it so beautifully. "I'd like you to be congratulated on the incredible job you did in bringing back the United States of America." President Xi said that to me. NORAH O'DONNELL: I know we're out of time, but just on that matter, we talked about that-- because I know how closely you follow the stock market. Do you worry about an AI bubble? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I guess. I worry about everything, you know? I mean, you know, I'm a worrier. I worry. But you know what I do? I worry and then I fix it. I fix it. That way I don't have to worry. NORAH O'DONNELL: There's a lotta money behind AI-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, there's a lotta money. And right now I'm taking advantage of it, because we're leading AI. You know, we're leading it by a lot. China's in second place, but we're leading it by a lot. We have the greatest minds of any country anywhere in the world, and we're using that. I'm using those great minds to help us. Now, will something happen later? I guess, you know, something. But it could also be something very good happens. And I hope it's gonna be very good. But if it's not so good, we're protected. Our country is doing great. We're strong. We're solid. We've never been-- I think we haven't been like this in-- maybe ever. Maybe ever. We have a great country, and you should be very proud of it. NORAH O'DONNELL: Mr. President, thank you very much for your time-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Thank you very much, Norah. NORAH O'DONNELL:Thank you. NORAH O'DONNELL: Do I have the opportunity to ask you two more questions? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If you want, if it helps-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Okay. Okay. Two more questions-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That means they'll treat me more fairly if I do-- I want to get-- It's very nice, yeah. Now is good. Okay. Uh, oh. These might be the ones I didn't want. I don't know. Okay, go ahead. NORAH O'DONNELL: Is everybody ready? NORAH O'DONNELL: This is a question about pardons. The Trump family is now perhaps more associated with cryptocurrency than real estate. You and your son-- your sons, Don Jr. and Eric, have formed World Liberty Financial with the Witkoff family. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Right. NORAH O'DONNELL: Helping to make your family millions of dollars. It's in that context that I do wanna ask you about crypto's richest man, a billionaire known as C.Z. He pled guilty in 2023 to violating anti-money laundering laws. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Right. NORAH O'DONNELL: Looked at this, the government at the time said that C.Z. had caused "significant harm to U.S. national security", essentially by allowing terrorist groups like Hamas to move millions of dollars around. Why did you pardon him? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Okay, are you ready? I don't know who he is. I know he got a four-month sentence or something like that. And I heard it was a Biden witch hunt. And what I wanna do is see crypto, 'cause if we don't do it it's gonna go to China, it's gonna go to-- this is no different to me than AI. My sons are involved in crypto much more than I-- me. I-- I know very little about it, other than one thing. It's a huge industry. And if we're not gonna be the head of it, China, Japan, or someplace else is. So I am behind it 100%. This man was, in my opinion, from what I was told, this is, you know, a four-month sentence. But this man was treated really badly by the Biden administration. And he was given a jail term. He's highly respected. He's a very successful guy. They sent him to jail and they really set him up. That's my opinion. I was told about it. I said, "Eh, it may look bad if I do it. I have to do the right thing." I don't know the man at all. I don't think I ever met him. Maybe I did. Or, you know, somebody shook my hand or something. But I don't think I ever met him. I have no idea who he is. I was told that he was a victim, just like I was and just like many other people, of a vicious, horrible group of people in the Biden administration. NORAH O'DONNELL: The government had accused him of "significant harm to U.S. national security"-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That's the Biden government. NORAH O'DONNELL: Okay. Allowing U.S. terrorist groups to, you know, essentially move millions of dollars around. He pled guilty to anti-money laundering laws. That was in 2023. Then in 2025 his crypto exchange, Binance, helped facilitate a $2 billion purchase of World Liberty Financial's stablecoin. And then you pardoned C.Z. How do you address the appearance of pay for play? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, here's the thing, I know nothing about it because I'm too busy doing the other-- NORAH O'DONNELL: But he got a pardon-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I can only tell you that-- NORAH O'DONNELL: He got a pardon-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Norah, I can only tell you this. My sons are into it. I'm glad they are, because it's probably a great industry, crypto. I think it's good. You know, they're running a business, they're not in government. And they're good-- my one son is a number one bestseller now. My wife just had a number one bestseller. I'm proud of them for doing that. I'm focused on this. I know nothing about the guy, other than I hear he was a victim of weaponization by government. When you say the government, you're talking about the Biden government. It's a corrupt government. Biden was the most corrupt president and he was the worst president we've ever had. I only care about one thing. Will crypto be-- will we be number one in crypto? Crypto has turned out, and in that sense I've been right. Crypto's turned out to be a massive industry, if you wanna call it that. And I'm very proud to say that we are far and away ahead of China and everybody else. Now, China is getting into it very big, right now. If you wanna go after people, you're gonna kill that industry. And it'll be very bad. Tremendous number of jobs. I campaigned positively on crypto, very openly. I campaigned. Biden campaigned against it. When Biden found out that I was getting, like, 100% of the crypto vote, which was a lot, he switched totally and he went in favor of crypto. They were totally in favor. They had many people under indictment. They let 'em all go. They let 'em all go. You know that. Many people were under indictment. Biden was a corrupt president. Biden went all in on crypto at the very end because he thought he could get some votes. It didn't work. They voted for me. I wanna make crypto great for America. That's the only thing. I don't wanna have somebody else have crypto and have China be number one in the world in crypto. Because in crypto it's a kind of an industry where basically you're going to have number one and you're not gonna have a number two. And right now we're number one by a long shot. I wanna keep it that way. The same way we're number one with AI, we're number one with crypto. And I wanna keep it that way. NORAH O'DONNELL: So not concerned about the appearance of corruption with this? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I can't say, because-- I can't say-- I'm not concerned. I don't-- I'd rather not have you ask the question. But I let you ask it. You just came to me and you said, "Can I ask another question?" And I said, yeah. This is the question-- NORAH O'DONNELL: And you answered-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't mind. Did I let you do it? I coulda walked away. I didn't have to answer this question. I'm proud to answer the question. You know why? We've taken crypto-- NORAH O'DONNELL: But just generally speak-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me. We're number one in crypto in the whole world. Other people wanna be. They're fighting like hell to be. But we're number one in crypto because I'm the president. Biden wanted to also, at the very end, you know, he totally switched his thing. You know, Biden was totally in favor of crypto at the end. Do you know that many people that were indicted under Biden for crypto, at the very end before the election, were let go? You know why? He wanted the vote. We are number one in crypto and that's the only thing I care about. I don't want China or anybody else to take it away. It's a massive industry. NORAH O'DONNELL: Mr. President, thank you. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Thank you very much. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. (01:13:50) Copyright ©2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

Title: Trump’s Industrial Policy: What’s Right and Wrong
URL: http://washingtonmonthly.com/2025/11/02/trumps-industrial-policies-whats-right-and-wrong/
Time Published: 2025-11-02T23:25:19Z
Full Content:
In recent months, Donald Trump’s administration has supplemented its globe-spanning tariffs with bespoke industrial policy deals with U.S. corporations. These include the federal government taking equity stakes in Intel, a “golden share” in U.S. Steel, and profit sharing on Nvidia and AMD’s chip sales in China. The deals have astonished and unnerved economic analysts across the political spectrum. Commentators from The Wall Street Journal editorial page to MSNBC have decried them as “unprecedented” and amounting to “socialism,” “corporatism,” or “state capitalism with American characteristics.” In truth, Trump’s actions are rooted in a long history of presidents from both parties taking temporary control or ownership of systemically important companies. However, until now, most of these interventions have been temporary and involved either wartime emergencies or too-big-to-fail corporate collapse. Under Woodrow Wilson, the federal government took temporary ownership of the railroad industry to support troops during World War I. During World War II, Franklin D. Roosevelt’s administration directed much of the corporate industrial sector. In 1980, Jimmy Carter’s administration extended loan guarantees to Chrysler in exchange for stock warrants. After the company recovered and repaid its loans, the government earned $311 million in capital gains. During the financial crisis, Barack Obama’s administration provided the auto industry with tens of billions of dollars in exchange for equity stakes and commitments for substantial restructuring. Trump’s moves also build on recent industrial policy interventions by his and Joe Biden’s administrations. Until now, those policies stopped short of the government seeking direct influence over corporate governance through golden shares or equity stakes. During his first term, Trump primarily conducted industrial policy through targeted tariffs and trade actions to promote American industry, and by jawboning corporations to boost domestic manufacturing. The Biden administration went further, providing computer chip and clean energy companies with hundreds of billions of dollars—and detailed requirements for how they could be spent—as part of a long-term post-neoliberal industrial strategy for national security. Those actions were consistent with, though a major step beyond, Trump’s first-term trade policies, just as Trump’s second-term corporate dealmaking is an advance on Biden’s (even if neither president would admit it). So, while Trump’s dealmaking spree is not unprecedented, it ventures into new territory reflecting his strongman tendencies: He has claimed for himself concentrated power to oversee and influence corporate decision-making, authority thus far ceded to him by Congress and the courts. He has operated outside the law through handshake deals that corporations often cannot afford to refuse, endowing the presidency with powerful—and dangerous—economic tools for routine use. This is unlikely to be a mere Trump-era aberration. Presidents typically don’t forego inherited powers. Today’s novelty policies may become tomorrow’s precedent, as the last decade has shown. Some elements of industrial policy with Trumpist characteristics may become long-term features of American governance. But Congress and the judiciary should assert democratic and constitutional control over American industrial policy now and in the future to prevent its abuse and, potentially, its collapse. Here’s a rundown of Trump’s corporate dealmaking thus far: U.S. Steel: In June, the White House greenlit Nippon Steel’s takeover bid for the American steelmaker U.S. Steel. Trump overturned Biden’s blocking of the deal—on the condition that the government receive a “golden share” of the company, allowing it to veto major corporate decisions, such as offshoring jobs and closing plants. MP Materials: In July, the Department of Defense announced an investment in MP Materials, the country’s only active producer of certain rare earth minerals used for military equipment. The deal provided government support for the company, guaranteeing a minimum price for its products and providing a guaranteed buyer—the federal government—for all its output for the next 10 years. The feds also extended a $150 million loan and purchased $400 million in company stock, making it MP’s largest shareholder. Japan: Also in July, the White House announced a trade deal with Japan that purportedly included Tokyo creating a $550 billion investment fund for the administration to use toward its industrial policy priorities, including energy infrastructure, semiconductor manufacturing, critical mineral supply chains, pharmaceutical production, and shipbuilding. Japan quickly contested the administration’s description of the deal, explaining that the investment fund would be nearly entirely composed of loans the U.S. would need to repay. Nvidia and AMD: In August, the administration agreed to allow the semiconductor makers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices to sell certain modified chips in China, reversing national security restrictions. The companies also agreed to give 15 percent of all profits earned in China to the U.S. government. Intel: Later that month, the administration took a 10 percent equity stake in the chipmaker Intel. The deal converted billions of dollars in grants the company was due under the CHIPS and Science Act into equity stakes, making the federal government Intel’s largest shareholder. That conversion also, without any legal authority, dispensed with CHIPS Act taxpayer safeguards that required Intel to reach milestones toward completing new domestic manufacturing sites to receive federal funding. Trump’s economic interventions bear a number of distinctive qualities that expand on industrial policy precedent, but five stand out. 1. Unilateralism: Trump’s industrial policy has been personalist, flowing from and controlled by the president himself. Unlike the Biden administration, which shepherded industrial policy bills through Congress, Trump relies exclusively on executive action. His industrial policy has at times been colored by favoritism and personal relationships. The Nvidia export agreement, for instance, came after meetings between Trump and CEO Jensen Huang. The president himself asked Huang for a share of the company’s Chinese profits. In other cases, bargained-for benefits have been structured to accrue directly under Trump’s control. The Nippon Steel agreement gave control of the golden share not to the office of the president but to Trump himself; only after he leaves office does the share transfer to the secretaries of treasury and commerce. Finally, the (contested) $550 billion pot from Japan would be, according to Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, a fund to be spent however Trump wished—part of “a national security and economic fund managed by Donald Trump.” 2. Public ownership in the absence of a fiscal crisis or national security justification: While direct government ownership of industry is not unheard of in American history, the Trump administration has been uniquely eager to wield it as a routine industrial policy tool. The MP Materials and Intel deals both gave the government equity ownership of private companies, and the U.S. Steel approval netted the government special, powerful veto rights over that company’s decision-making. After announcing the (contested) terms of the Japan trade deal, administration officials even contemplated using the deal’s (disputed) investment fund to build government-owned factories that could then be leased to private companies. 3. Bullying individual companies: Trump has a quid pro quo mentality of wanting a cut of any private gains he feels he has facilitated—he has openly compared his presidential dealmaking to waiving property rights on his real estate for the benefit of a third party, in exchange for a fee. When he agreed to grant Nvidia export licenses to sell modified chips in China, Trump told its chief executive, “If I’m going to do that, I want you to pay us something.” Or as Lutnick described the Intel equity stake, “If we’re going to give you the money, we want a piece of the action.” 4. Leveraging government power: Beyond just flexing the rhetorical might of the presidential bully pulpit, Trump has used the levers of government to offer firms deals they can’t refuse. The administration has created or exploited bargaining power to induce targeted firms to relent to its demands. Under export control regulations, Nvidia and AMD needed the administration’s permission to sell chips in China, forcing them to acquiesce to Trump’s profit-sharing demand. Nippon Steel could not take over U.S. Steel without approval from the government’s foreign investment review committee. Shortly before Intel agreed to the equity deal, Trump ratcheted up the pressure by calling for its executive to be fired and withholding its CHIPS Act grants. Two other examples illustrate Trump’s leverage power plays. In May, he issued an executive order instructing pharmaceutical companies to agree to adhere to “most-favored-nation price targets … to bring prices for American patients in line with comparably developed nations.” The order threatened that the administration would put the squeeze on pharmaceutical companies that don’t comply, through newly authorized competition from drug imports, restrictions on their own exports, antitrust scrutiny, reconsideration of FDA approvals of their drugs, and loss of National Institutes of Health grants. And in August, the administration announced that it would impose high tariffs on semiconductor imports—but would exempt tech companies that made new domestic investment pledges. The administration thus imposed tariffs to create leverage and offered relief from those tariffs to advance its industrial policy goals. 5. Legally dubious boundary pushing: Much of Trump’s industrial policy has operated in legal gray zones. To bypass routine federal contracting and procurement laws that typically require competitive bidding, the administration’s investment in MP Materials relied on a little-used provision of the Defense Production Act authorizing transactions “without regard to the limitations of existing law.” Trump’s profit-sharing deal with Nvidia and AMD flouts prohibitions on export taxes and fees under both the Constitution and federal law. There is also no firm legal basis under the CHIPS Act to convert Intel’s grants into equity (nor was there to withhold its grants in the first place). Trump has avoided legal constraints by relying on “regulation by deal,” rather than legislation or agency rulemaking. (He’s also been firing the regulators who would otherwise shape such government interventions.) Companies have acquiesced to White House demands that may not otherwise withstand legal scrutiny to avoid lost business opportunities, the cost and time of litigating against the federal government, and the general ire of the Trump administration. This has insulated much of Trump’s industrial policy from administrative procedure, due process, and judicial review. Some elements of Trump’s approach are likely to endure. The wraparound support for MP Materials, for example, could well become a model for how the U.S. government cultivates strategically important domestic production. The type of golden share Trump obtained in U.S. Steel could be on the table for future mitigation agreements between the federal government and foreign companies seeking to invest in critical domestic sectors. As I have written for this magazine, there are also compelling reasons for the government to insist on a direct return on its industrial policy investments. Taking equity stakes in semiconductor companies funded by the CHIPS Act was originally a Bernie Sanders proposal. When used in the right context, equity stakes ensure that industrial policy returns upside revenue to the public, instead of merely socializing profits for corporations. External trends may also lend Trump’s industrial policy approach greater staying power. As policymakers seek new revenue sources beyond traditional taxation, they may increasingly look to levers like equity stakes, profit-sharing agreements, and royalties. Congress’s tendency toward gridlock and paralysis has long spurred administrations to seek creative executive workarounds, but the courts have increasingly limited the discretion given to the administrative state. That may steer administrations toward regulation-by-deal as a flexible means for the executive branch to regain power from the judiciary. It’s not hard to imagine where Trumpist industrial policy may be headed. White House advisers have said they will seek equity stakes in other companies receiving federal grants and loans to seed a sovereign wealth fund. Moreover, if Intel cannot right its ship, it may be forced to revisit previous discussions of spinning off its semiconductor factories to a foreign firm like the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. The Trump administration, which has opposed such a move, could, as Intel’s largest shareholder, dictate the terms of such a deal. (Indeed, the Intel agreement included a poison pill to stymie the sale of its foundries.) Plus, any such sale must win the administration’s approval through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. One could imagine the administration negotiating on economic and national security grounds for government ownership of Intel’s factories, which could then be leased to another chipmaker. Trump’s industrial policy toolkit may empower future administrations with different priorities. For instance, federal policies—steep tariffs and national security exclusions—are sparing U.S. automakers from a flood of low-cost, cutting-edge Chinese electric vehicles. A future administration could condition that continued industry protection on American carmakers offering more affordable low-emissions vehicles and ramping up their research and development investments. A future administration could use the specter of the government’s statutory powers to limit or override patents on federally funded technologies to negotiate long-term profit-sharing agreements with artificial intelligence companies. It could also use similar authority to negotiate price reductions from pharmaceutical companies and leverage the Medicare Advantage market to acquire golden shares in health insurance companies, with veto power over major corporate decisions. A future Democratic administration could grant targeted tariff reductions to countries or companies that decarbonize their energy grids and production processes—and dangle extra reductions to those that use American-made clean energy technology. It could use the Defense Production Act’s preemption power to expedite clean energy and new housing development around other legal impediments. If the industrial policy arc from the first Trump administration to the Biden administration is any guide, the next Democratic president will make fulsome use of these kinds of Trump-inspired tools. So sheer inertia may well propel Trumpist industrial policy forward. But there are several stark and urgent reasons Congress and the courts should pump the brakes and reconsider major elements of Trump’s approach. For one, this approach may simply yield worse industrial policy. Absent exceeding care and deliberation, go-it-alone executive branch industrial policy can overreach and implode without the safeguards and democratic legitimacy of operating through Congress. Even if Trump’s deals successfully evade the courts, a subsequent administration could deem some contrary to law and declare them null and void—regulation by deal has far less long-term durability than regulation by regulation, let alone legislation. Such whipsawing will make the U.S. government a less reliable, more tumultuous economic actor. For another, elements of Trump’s industrial policy are a recipe for abuse and corruption. Pay-to-play regimes for exporting sensitive technologies to foreign adversaries jeopardize fair competition and national security. Personalist policymaking is a recipe for cronyism, corruption, and favoritism for well-connected dominant firms. As The New York Times reported, Trump’s family was directly benefiting from billions of dollars of investment in its crypto company by the United Arab Emirates—at the same time it agreed to provide the UAE with highly sensitive and valuable advanced semiconductor chips. It is all too easy to foresee more future gambits redounding to the private benefit of the Trump family (like the Paramount merger with Skydance, which routed $16 million into the Trump presidential library). Moreover, while leverage can be useful for achieving policy aims, marshaling the vast regulatory state as one big pressure cooker to coerce concessions from targeted companies risks undermining other vital policy interests. We’re already seeing that regarding antitrust. Companies seeking merger approvals have won favorable treatment from the Trump administration by making side promises for domestic manufacturing investments. The potential for Trumpist misuse of industrial policy risks poisoning the whole enterprise. That’s where Congress and the courts come in—or where they should. Congress was a true coequal branch during the Biden administration’s major industrial policy programs, shaping and passing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act through normal legislative processes. It could again instill democratic prerogatives and guardrails for industrial policy. Congress could determine when the government should take equity stakes in private companies. It could set ground rules around taking golden shares, like which corporate decisions may be subject to a government veto and which are off-limits. It could set standards around appropriate uses of revenue-sharing deals with the federal government. It could stipulate where the revenue generated from industry policy investments should go and how it should be spent. It could set rules preventing the government from unduly favoring companies where it has taken equity stakes in competitor firms. It could establish safeguards to ensure that industrial policy is not used to enrich public officials. Meanwhile, the courts may need to revisit legal doctrines like standing to ensure that some party can contest deals of questionable legality, like the Nvidia revenue-sharing agreement or the Intel equity swap. If Congress fails to act, it could be understood as blessing Trump’s mode of industrial policy by one-man dealmaking. That doesn’t just invite corruption, but is also a recipe for managerial disaster. The Obama administration’s masterful overhaul of Detroit is arguably less remembered today than the failure of Solyndra. After receiving an Energy Department loan, the solar panel firm’s bankruptcy led to a series of high-profile investigations that ultimately uncovered no criminal wrongdoing or corruption but soured the public on Obama’s nascent clean energy industrial strategy. With Trump’s state capitalism, the hands-off market fundamentalism era is over. The question is whether the government’s new terms of engagement with industry will be dominated by the president or deliberated on by Congress and the courts. Acquiescence by the other branches to Trump’s deals, warts and all, risks heralding the unchecked and unbalanced industrial policy of the unitary executive. Activation by them, however, could lead to a whole-of-government effort to sand away the roughest edges of Trump’s approach to craft an industrial policy that is both powerful and responsible to effectively guide the country forward.

Title: I Tried Aldi's Diet Coke Copycat And It's Not Even Close To Everyone's Favorite Fridge Cig
URL: https://www.tastingtable.com/2013384/aldi-summit-diet-cola-diet-coke-copycat-review/
Time Published: 2025-11-02T18:20:00Z
Full Content:
As of 2025, Diet Coke reigns as the number one diet soda in the U.S., which doesn't surprise me at all. I will check and see if restaurants have Coke or Pepsi before I go. I'm that picky. And I'm not the only fan! Diet Coke ranks fifth among all top-selling sodas in general, coming in after regular Coca-Cola, Dr Pepper, Sprite, and Pepsi, in that order. And there are a lot of sodas out there! But recently, we heard a little rumor that there was a Diet Coke dupe that tasted even better and was cheaper, which had us more than intrigued. Personally, as a diehard Diet Coke fan, I have to say I was incredibly suspicious and needed to do my own investigating. (Those are some pretty big claims to be making.) The copycat — Aldi's Summit brand diet cola — is one of many dupes by this grocery store. Luckily, there is an Aldi very close to me, so I ran right out to grab a 12-pack. Already having Diet Coke on hand, because I use it in everything from mocktails and cocktails to baking sweet treats, it would be easy to do a head-to-head taste test. Giving each a 24-hour window to chill in my refrigerator, I sat down to taste them. I was ready for anything. I took a deep breath and opened my mind to the possibilities. Would it taste the same? Would it actually be better? Well, here's what I found. When working on this piece, Summit Diet Cola was available at my Aldi for $4.69 for a 12-pack of 12-ounce cans. There are over 2,500 Aldi locations scattered through 39 states in the U.S. So, the availability is somewhat accessible, although not as widely distributed as Diet Coke. As far as Diet Coke goes, at my local Kroger, there is always a BOGO sale going on, so I always stock up. The week I purchased these sodas, it was a buy two, get three free weekend sale. With a 12-pack of 12-ounce cans costing $10.99, that worked out to $4.39 per pack, which was an even better deal than Aldi. While Kroger only operates in 16 states and territories, I feel like there are other stores that probably offer similar discounts. When I checked out Walmart prices at the time of this writing, it had 24-packs of Diet Coke cans for $13.78, making a 12-pack $6.89. And Walmart does operate in all 50 states. Additionally, Costco (operating in 49 states and territories) had 35-packs of cans for $19.85, which would leave you paying around $6.60 per 12-pack. So, there are deals to be had if cost is an issue. I cracked open the chilled can of Summit Diet Cola and went in for my first taste. It had an immediate sweet cloud that covered my palate and filled my mouth. There was a nice carbonation about it that tingled my tongue and gave the soda an overall round, full profile. Oddly, there was an overly obvious citrus taste to it that reminded me of the lemon and lime flavor of Sprite, but with a touch of vanilla. It wasn't bad, just odd. But it couldn't garner too much attention, as the sweet flavor demanded center stage throughout. The sweetness tasted artificial and exceedingly apparent, like a small child vying for the spotlight. It carried the flavor in and stayed long after any citrus, spice, or carbonation was gone. And while it didn't go over the top or become offensive, it was still somehow larger than it needed to be. In the end, all the tastes stopped very abruptly, leaving the palate seemingly coated with a nothingness that wasn't entirely clean. This diet cola wasn't bad, but it was very obviously an off-brand, a generic interpretation of something familiar. I could taste what it was trying to achieve, but it tried too hard and missed the mark with its overzealous flavoring. Taking a sip of Diet Coke offered a layer of flavors and carbonation to cascade across my taste buds, dancing with tiny, prickling bubbles. There seemed to be a blanket of caramel that was soft, lush, and slightly sweet. Underneath the caramel was a hint of citrus that seemed to complement the spicy aesthetic without drawing too much attention to itself. The sweetness of it all seemed to be but a welcome guest of equal measure on the journey of flavors. Nothing tasted to stand out on its own; rather, every flavor worked together in harmony. The flavors of Diet Coke appeared to be deliberately refined, balanced on rich fizz that teased the taste buds into new heights of enjoyment. And when it left my mouth, the flavors and slight burn of carbonation lingered only for a moment before taking their final leave. Overall, refreshing and soft but strong, drinking Diet Coke was incredibly satisfying. I tasted both diet sodas over ice, one at a time. Then, I did the same straight from the can. To ensure I was comparing them as accurately as possible, I also went back and forth, taking sips side by side. The Summit Diet Cola had flavors that were audacious compared to Diet Coke. They went too far, became too artificial, and were too sweet. Instead of working together, the Summit Diet Cola came across as a battle for attention from one flavor to the next, while Diet Coke's flavor, carbonation, and sweetness all worked in tandem to complement and enhance each other's qualities. It would be one thing if rumors had said that this dupe was somewhat comparable. That I could see. Both sodas have a citrus component, an artificial sweetness, and a caramel aesthetic. However, Diet Coke remained subdued in all its flavors and maintained a refreshing quality that was enjoyable rather than complicated. Summit, on the other hand, was like a little kid dressing up in their parents' clothes, trying to be something it wasn't, and ending up as an obvious farce. Diet soda alternatives keep coming after Diet Coke. But I just don't believe that any of them will ever beat the OG. And why do we need them to? With the ability to get discounts or bulk amounts of Diet Coke, the savings are negligible. You just need to look around and see where you can find the best deal. To get the best taste, I feel it's more than worth it.

A Chinese embassy post highlighting Hsinchu Science Park underscores rising geopolitical risks to the world’s most advanced chip supply. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. On Friday night, China’s embassy in Washington posted a familiar message to X: “There is but one China in the world.” But this time, the predictable rhetoric from China came with a glossy photo carousel that included a sweeping aerial shot of Hsinchu Science Park, the epicenter of the world’s most advanced semiconductor manufacturing. As analyst Patrick Moorhead highlighted in a response to the embassy’s post, Hsinchu includes TSMC’s Fabs 12A, 12B, 20, 3, 5, 8, 2 and the Advanced Backend Fab 1, all crammed into the park’s core, along with the company’s Global R&D Center, “where all the world’s advanced foundry IP is created,” he wrote, pointing out that chips for Nvidia, AMD, Apple, Qualcomm, and even Intel depends on this small square of land. There is but one #China in the world; #Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory. Every inch of Taiwan Province, China, is vibrant under the "Jilin-1" space satellite's perspective. 🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳💧Sun Moon Lake 日月潭⛰Alishan 阿里山🏙Taipei City 台北市⚓️Taipei Port 台北港… pic.twitter.com/bOIvAdrSuyOctober 31, 2025 While the post didn’t mention chips directly, it didn’t have to. Hsinchu is home to TSMC’s original fabs, the headquarters of MediaTek and UMC, and key government agencies that oversee Taiwan’s space and chip strategy. There is no other place on Earth with the same concentration of cutting-edge logic process nodes. This is where the GPUs that train AI models begin, where desktop and server CPUs are etched, and where bleeding-edge silicon IP is designed. Expand the embedded tweet below to see the images. Let me be clearer. Here are the TSMC fabs currently in Hsinchu Science Park in Taiwan: Fab 12A/12B/20/3/5/8/2 and Advanced Backend Fab 1.

In recent months, Chinese naval forces have staged simulated blockades in the Taiwan Strait, inspecting commercial cargo ships and raising fears of a chokepoint disruption. The Trans-Pacific Express Cable System, which directly connects Taiwan to the U.S. East Coast, Japan, South Korea, and China, was damaged by a Cameroon-flagged freighter, Shunxing39, earlier this year, prompting Taiwan to increase legal penalties for damaging undersea cables. According to a recent special report from Reuters, U.S. officials have begun modeling worst-case scenarios for the Bashi Channel, a key shipping lane essential to Taiwanese exports like advanced wafers and electronics, in response to recent incursions. In September, the US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called Taiwan’s chip sector the “single greatest point of failure for the world economy” because 99% of high-performance chips are manufactured there, and back in June 2021, a White House review warned that even a temporary hit to TSMC output could ripple through everything from datacenters to defense. China’s embassy didn’t need to mention any of that directly. A single photo of Hsinchu was enough at a moment while tensions remain high.

Tech firms will likely command the spotlight during this week’s earnings calendar, though pharmaceuticals and gig economy providers are also likely to be in focus. Artificial intelligence demand will be top of mind for market watchers when chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices, Qualcomm, and Arm Holdings, as well as software provider Palantir, report earnings this week. Results from pharmaceutical firms come amid pressure from the Trump administration to lower prices. Market watchers are likely to pore over private-sector jobs data for October in the absence of the originally scheduled U.S. employment report, which is likely to be delayed again as the government shutdown enters its second month. Read to the bottom for our calendar of key events—and one more thing. Advanced Micro Devices will report on Tuesday, and investors will likely want to hear more about recent deals like the one signed in October to supply AI chips to Oracle. Other chipmakers are on the corporate earnings calendar this week, including Qualcomm, which last week unveiled two new AI chips for data centers. Chip designer Arm Holdings is also scheduled to report this week. In other tech-related reports, Palantir’s earnings on Monday come as the software maker’s shares have more than doubled this year on strong demand for its AI platforms. Cloud network provider Arista Networks is also on the calendar on Tuesday. Novo Nordisk reports on Wednesday, and the maker of Ozempic faces pressure from President Donald Trump over the costs of the weight loss treatment, which he said should run about $150 a month instead of the more than $1,000 it costs now. Other noteworthy pharmaceutical firms to report this week include Amgen, Pfizer, and AstraZeneca, and they come as firms have made deals to lower drug prices in response to Trump's threat of hefty pharmaceutical tariffs. Several key firms in the so-called “gig economy” are also expected to report this week, including ride-sharing app Uber, food delivery service DoorDash, and property-rental app Airbnb. While the Federal Reserve has raised worries over the health of the labor market, the government shutdown is again expected to keep officials guessing over employment levels in the U.S. Originally scheduled for Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics' monthly employment report for October is expected to be delayed due to the work stoppage. It would be the second straight monthly jobs report delayed due to the shutdown, which is entering its second month. Data on factor orders, the U.S. trade balance, and job openings are also likely to be delayed due to the shutdown. Market watchers won’t be totally in the dark when it comes to jobs in the U.S., as the private-sector ADP employment report remains scheduled for release on Wednesday. The closely followed ISM surveys on the manufacturing and services sectors are also scheduled this week, giving investors some indications on employment and pricing in those sectors. The Fed’s report on consumer credit and the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey are also expected this week. Remarks from Philadelphia Fed President Anna Paulson, St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem, and New York Fed President John Williams will also be of note after the central bank last week cut interest rates for the second time this year.

Title: Here's What We Learned From Big Tech Earnings Last Week

Time Published: 2025-11-02T11:00:00Z

Earnings season kicked into high gear last week when five of the Magnificent Seven members with a combined market value of over $15 trillion reported results. The tech titans—Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META)—reported better-than-expected results across the board, and forecast their massive investments in artificial intelligence will grow in the coming year. Below, we take a closer look at some of the key takeaways from this round of big tech earnings. These tech giants account for a sizable share of the U.S. stock market, making their quarterly earnings some of the most highly anticipated and consequential events on Wall Street. Their investments in artificial intelligence have also been a boon to the U.S. economy over the last year. One thing made clear in last week's earnings calls, was that the hyperscalers’ AI investments are showing no signs of a pullback. Amazon on Thursday raised its full-year capital expenditures forecast and said that investments will increase next year. Alphabet also bumped up its capex guidance for the third time this year and forecast another “significant” increase next year. Microsoft didn’t share a quarterly or full-year capex estimate, but CFO Amy Hood said investments will grow even faster in fiscal year 2026 than in 2025. Executives stressed that, despite their massive investments up to this point, they expect demand will continue to outstrip supply into next year. Microsoft’s cloud computing platform, Azure, likely bore the brunt of its capacity constraints, according to Hood, who said the company has been forced to prioritize other core business offerings. She, like Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, also said that their internal AI teams need more computing capacity. Citi analysts in a note on Thursday said they expect cloud data center capex to grow 24% in 2026, which should be a boon to semiconductor makers like Nvidia (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Spending on data centers is all well and good with Wall Street, as long as investors perceive rising profits will make it worthwhile. Meta shares tanked on Thursday after the company posted earnings that missed estimates due to a one-time tax charge, and raised the low end of its full-year capex guidance. Meta also said it expects its capex growth will accelerate next year. "The real focus coming out of earnings is Meta's updated view on 2026 capex and expenses as the company looks to build out an industry-leading amount of compute," JPMorgan analysts told clients in a note Thursday. "The costs for Meta are outsized relative to Google and Amazon, as those companies are larger and both have cloud businesses that provide an immediate path to Gen AI monetization, unlike for Meta,” they said. Higher operating costs added to Wall Street’s concerns about Meta’s AI spending. Total expenses rose 32% year-over-year in the third quarter, compared to 12% in the previous quarter, and are expected to grow even faster next year. Employee compensation was one of the largest contributors to rising expenses. Meta went on an AI hiring spree this year, making headlines for poaching top talent with eye-watering pay packages. That's added more pressure on Meta to find ways to cut costs. Recent reports of layoffs, including in its AI division, could point to some signs of strain in Meta's efforts to keep its spending in check. In the first inning of the AI craze on Wall Street, Alphabet was often looked at as a laggard in the space. Its Bard chatbot flubbed its first public demonstration, and analysts worried that the rising popularity of chatbots from startups like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity, could spell major disruption for Google’s core search business. However, Alphabet's strong quarterly results—thanks in part to AI search features—would counter that narrative. According to executives, Google’s AI search features, AI Overviews and AI Mode, are helping to increase search query volume, the opposite of what Wall Street expected. Google’s search revenue growth has accelerated throughout the year, rising from 10% to 12% in the second quarter, and then to 15% in the third. Executives added that Google is monetizing AI search queries at about the same rate as traditional search. “Search acceleration (paid clicks up 7% vs 4% in 2Q) despite OpenAI's strong usage growth suggests AI is expanding the overall ‘information’ opportunity, driving higher query volume and improving monetization,” wrote Bank of America analysts in a note on Thursday. Some investors have become concerned in recent months that the AI boom is being fueled by a handful of companies striking very large deals. For example, OpenAI accounted for nearly all of Oracle’s (ORCL) massive cloud computing backlog in the most recent quarter, and Nvidia said in its most recent earnings report that two direct customers accounted for almost 40% of its quarterly sales. But Microsoft executives sought to soothe worries about concentration risks during Wednesday’s earnings call. When asked about the breadth of contracts contributing to Microsoft’s record backlog, which grew 51% to $392 billion, CFO Amy Hood said, “it covers numerous products. It covers customers of all sizes." CEO Satya Nadella also suggested he sees broadening demand related to AI over time, telling analysts, “concentration risk gets mitigated by being thoughtful about how you really ensure the build is for the broad customer base.” The wider enterprise adoption cycle, he said, "is just starting."
