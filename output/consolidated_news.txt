Pirates, Plunderers & Predators… The US criminal terrorist organization and its banks, mega-corporations, and secret drug enforcement units are now openly stealing property and presidents and running terror-style operations while the social propagandists roll out fake videos of people who ‘own nothing but are happy’. I am Jeff Berwick and this is my 3D Game Video. In this video game, I’ve been dodging weaponized Cat 5 hurricanes and giant earthquake boulders to get the truth out there about an insane, deranged psychopath system that is trying to kill and enslave everyone on earth. For my trouble, I got a WARNING that said “You’ve offended Mossad”. As I talk about the past week’s clown show, Banana republic, cheap ass propaganda and lies, I’m battling “truth” salesmen Alex Jones, Tim Pool, Nick Fuentes who are full-on shilling for the Slave System and its government bodies and elite institutions. In this game, I’m tracking the Venezuela takeover – ruthless, bloodless and not in the least suspicious. BlackRock gets bitcoin. JP Morgan gets silver. Benjamin Mileikowsky gets to hand-pick a new anti-Iran, pro-Israhell regime. And, Trump gets Mar-A-Venezuela. Next up: Colombia and Cuba (both of which have some pretty great riviera estate for Trump Towers and golf courses). And, Greenland. Because national defense and so on, you know. Of course, if you were really going to round up the world’s worst dictators and druglords, the Clintons, the Bushes, the Obamas, the Bidens and Trumps would all be on death row, along with Anthony Fraudci, Kill Gates, Albert Bourla and the rest. In my video game, Berwick.exe (status Stateless Dog Walker) has only one curse, given by the Oracle of Early Sight: “You will see the trap before it springs, but most won’t believe your crazy tales before it’s too late.” Am I crazy? Or do I know these things because I’m not registered in the System and I can see through the Mirror projection? I swore no oath and wear no crown. I carry no sword… but a pouch full of silver coins… And a bag of ITOADASO’s.

Title: What’s Going On With Bitcoin And The Stock Market? Analyst Breaks It Down

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Bitcoin (BTC) and the stock market have experienced sharp price swings and declines since 2025. Because of this volatility, a crypto analyst has warned that the market correction could intensify further in 2026. In a detailed analysis, he outlines a bearish scenario for Bitcoin, suggesting the flagship cryptocurrency could soon face another price crash amid persistent downward pressure in the broader stock market. Market analyst Doctor Profit has raised concerns about the direction of the crypto and traditional markets, warning that both Bitcoin and stocks are currently in a severe bear market. In a technical breakdown on X this Monday, the expert highlighted three major bearish setups forming simultaneously in Bitcoin. He highlighted a massive Bearish Divergence on the weekly and monthly charts, a clear bearish flag signaling a potential drop toward $70,000, and a possible Head and Shoulder pattern that could still play out. While he acknowledged that Bitcoin could still experience short-term price increases and briefly rise toward the $97,000-$107,000 range due to strong liquidity, he said that the ultimate target remains $70,000. Doctor Profit emphasized that Bitcoin’s potential decline to $70,000 could go two ways. It could either break out of the bearish flag to that downside target or complete the Head and Shoulders pattern before reaching $70,000. He stated that he will not add new short positions at current prices but plans to increase them aggressively from $115,000 to $125,000 if Bitcoin moves into the $97,000 to $107,000 range. The analyst painted a similarly grim picture for the stock market. He said he was “ultra-bearish” on both Bitcoin and the financial system. He also noted that the banks are stressed and that forced liquidations in precious metals like Silver are creating ripples across the broader market. Additionally, Doctor Profit noted that insider activity shows clear signs of panic among investors, with record levels of selling since August 2025. Because of this, the analyst believes that the market is heading for a 2008-style crash. Consequently, he has concluded that the current market conditions are too extreme. On the bright side, Doctor Profit said that although he maintains short positions on stocks and Bitcoin, he remains bullish on Gold and Silver. He explained that any upside to the $97,000-$107,000 range will prompt him to increase his short exposure and roll spot profits for BTC from $85,000 into these positions. Toward the end of his analysis, Doctor Profit discussed upcoming events that could influence Bitcoin and the broader financial markets this week. He stated that the US CPI inflation forecast of 2.7% will be released this Tuesday. Other than this, the rest of the week is expected to have few market-moving events. Doctor Profit has also highlighted January 15 as an important date because US lawmakers will vote on the CLARITY Act. He explained that if the bill passes, it will move closer to becoming law, setting clear rules and oversight for the crypto market.

Title: Trump criminal probe of Fed Chair Powell marks unprecedented escalation — and a warning to his successor

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell confirmed the central bank had been served by the Justice Department in connection with allegations related to congressional testimony on the renovation of the bank’s headquarters. (Credit: Federal Reserve) President Donald Trump's criminal probe targeting Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell marks an extraordinary escalation in his battle with the central bank, sending a clear warning to the next Fed chair about the risks of defying the White House. Powell confirmed the Department of Justice investigation on Sunday evening in a video statement, calling the move "unprecedented" and another example of what he described as the Trump administration's ongoing efforts to intimidate the central bank. Powell's decision to respond so publicly, after days of private consultation with advisers, marked a sharp departure from the central banker's typically measured approach. TRUMP VS THE FEDERAL RESERVE: HOW THE CLASH REACHED UNCHARTED TERRITORY U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell confirmed the Trump administration's criminal investigation in a video statement. (Al Drago/AFP/Getty Images) The probe focuses on whether Powell was truthful during congressional testimony about the project to overhaul the Fed's two main buildings on the National Mall. No charges have been filed, and Powell has denied any wrongdoing. The White House referred questions to the Department of Justice. U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro said Monday that her office proceeded with the probe after failing to receive a response from Powell, prompting prosecutors to initiate a legal process. "The United States Attorney’s Office contacted the Federal Reserve on multiple occasions to discuss cost overruns and the chairman’s congressional testimony, but were ignored, necessitating the use of legal process—which is not a threat," Pirro stated. "The word "indictment" has come out of Mr. Powell’s mouth, no one else’s. None of this would have happened if they had just responded to our outreach." Powell, widely viewed as one of the most crisis-tested Federal Reserve chairs in modern U.S. history, built his career as a lawyer and investment banker in New York before entering public service in the administration of President George H.W. Bush. He joined the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors in 2012 and was tapped to lead the central bank in 2017. Now, a criminal investigation may represent the biggest test of Powell’s leadership, unfolding as Trump weighs his choice for the next Fed chair with Powell’s term set to expire in May. President Donald Trump visited the Federal Reserve's headquarters in Washington, D.C., to tour the ongoing renovation. (Official White House photo by Daniel Torok) The next Fed chair would take on one of the most powerful economic jobs in the country, helping decide how expensive it is to borrow money for things like homes, cars and credit cards. Those decisions directly affect the cost of everyday living for Americans. FROM MORTGAGES TO CAR LOANS: HOW AFFORDABILITY RISES AND FALLS WITH THE FED Trump has narrowed his shortlist to four candidates as he approaches a final decision on leadership at the Fed: Kevin Hassett, Kevin Warsh, Christopher Waller and Rick Rieder. White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett has been a loyal supporter of Trump's economic agenda. (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) Kevin Hassett is Trump’s top economic advisor and a loyal defender of the administration’s policies. He currently serves as director of the White House’s National Economic Council, and held two senior roles during Trump’s first term and advised the president on economic policy during the 2024 campaign. POWELL REVEALS WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO STEP DOWN FROM THE FED AS PRESSURE MOUNTS Meanwhile, Kevin Warsh, a former Morgan Stanley banker, has emerged as a vocal critic of current Fed leadership, sharpening his attacks as he positioned himself as a potential replacement for Powell. He became the youngest person to serve on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in 2006. Kevin Warsh, former governor of the U.S. Federal Reserve, was long considered for Treasury Secretary before Trump ultimately tapped Scott Bessent. (Tierney L. Cross/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Federal Reserve Gov. Christopher Waller has repeatedly called for rate cuts, a move that aligns, in part, with Trump's demands. Of the candidates, he is considered the veteran academic of the group. He has also reiterated the importance of maintaining an independent Federal Reserve. And BlackRock Global Fixed Income Chief Investment Officer Rick Rieder is the last candidate to have an interview with Trump before the president makes his decision. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who did pre-interviews with all the candidates, said Trump is expected to announce his decision by the end of January. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Meanwhile, some lawmakers on Capitol Hill said they would block the confirmation of Trump's Federal Reserve nominee until the legal matter is resolved. As the investigation unfolds and a decision on the next Fed chair approaches, the episode underscores the growing political pressure surrounding a role long viewed as insulated from the White House.

Title: Meta Reportedly Laying Off More Than 10% Of Reality Labs
URL: https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-reportedly-laying-off-over-10-of-reality-labs/
Time Published: 2026-01-13T16:06:21Z

Meta is laying off more than 10% of its Reality Labs division, specifically targeting VR and Horizon Worlds, The New York Times reports. Reality Labs, if you're unaware, is the division of Meta behind its Quest headsets, Horizon software, smart glasses, and sEMG wristband, as well as researching future technologies such as Codec Avatars and true AR glasses. The New York Times estimates Reality Labs at roughly 15,000 staff, suggesting that more than 1500 could be losing their job. Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth has scheduled an all-hands meeting for tomorrow, both the NYT and Business Insider claim, describing it as the “most important” of the year. The report comes just over a month after Meta officially confirmed "shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward AI glasses and Wearables", a statement which itself followed early reports of the cuts from The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and Business Insider. "Within our overall Reality Labs portfolio we are shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward AI glasses and Wearables given the momentum there," last month's statement read. "We aren't planning any broader changes than that." With the layoffs reportedly taking place this week, we'll bring you updates as we learn of Meta staff affected. Meta's funding shift from Horizon Worlds and VR to smart glasses is happening just over a year after a leaked memo from Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth told Reality Labs staff that 2025 will determine whether their projects are "the work of visionaries or a legendary misadventure". In the memo, Bosworth described 2025 as "the most critical year in my 8 years at Reality Labs", and told staff they "need to drive sales, retention, and engagement across the board but especially in MR". Note that at the time, Meta was using MR to refer to VR too, a nomenclature that it ended earlier this year. "And Horizon Worlds on mobile absolutely has to break out for our long term plans to have a chance", Bosworth followed that sentence with. Since then, Reality Labs saw its highest-ever quarterly revenue in Q4 2024 with the launch of Quest 3S, which was the top-selling console on Amazon US for Christmas. But this momentum did not carry through into 2025 at all. The first two quarters of 2025 saw Quest sales decline year-over-year, revealing that while Quest 3S was a popular stocking stuffer, it simply is not a successful year-round product. While Q3 saw a rebound, Meta explained that this was due to retailers stocking up on Quest 3S for this year's holiday season. Meanwhile, Meta has continued to push its Horizon Worlds "metaverse" platform with multi-million-dollar creator competitions, especially focused on smartphone-only worlds, as the company hopes to scale the platform from a social VR space to a cross-platform Roblox and Fortnite competitor. This relative stagnation in Meta's Quest and Horizon Worlds effort is contrasted with skyrocketing sales and significant public and investor interest in its smart glasses. In multiple earnings calls last year, Meta's partner EssilorLuxottica said that the Ray-Ban Meta glasses were performing "exceptionally well", with sales having more than tripled compared to 2024. Both companies have claimed to be selling many models as fast as they can make them. Meta has also claimed "unprecedented demand" for its higher-end Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, recently announcing a delay of its international expansion plans to catch up with US production. UPDATE: UploadVR can confirm that the layoffs include the closure of Twisted Pixel Games (Deadpool VR), Sanzaru Games (Asgard's Wrath), and Armature Studio (Resident Evil 4 VR). UPDATE 2: Meta announced that its VR/MR fitness service Supernatural will no longer receive any "new content or feature updates". Get a weekly summary of the most important VR and AR news.

No demo or credit card required. Start a free trial immediately and get top legal AI at your fingertips. What problem does your product solve? Most solo and small-firm attorneys are relying on generic LLMs (like ChatGPT) outside of their working environment (e.g., Microsoft Word), because the most advanced legal AI is largely being built for large teams, such as Am Law 100 firms and S&P 500 legal departments. That leaves lean legal teams with a tough choice: use general-purpose AI that isn’t designed for legal workflows, or spend time piecing together tools and prompts, then rechecking everything to meet professional standards. Bradwell closes that gap by making top-tier, domain-specific legal AI accessible to solo and lean firms. Built by a team of former practicing attorneys and AI experts, Bradwell handles multi-step complex legal work and adapts to how you practice over time. Who are your competitors? Bradwell competes with four categories of tools: Where Bradwell wins is as an AI-native environment built to learn and mirror a firm’s institutional knowledge directly within Word.

We create value by helping lawyers work faster and more confidently, and we will grow by deepening adoption in our core segment (small and mid-sized legal teams), then expanding into additional segments over time. We’ll invest in integrations with the tools lawyers already live in (e.g., Microsoft 365 and CRMs), and scale distribution through partnerships and product awareness. As we expand, we’ll keep a lawyer-first product roadmap, adding new workflows and practice-area modules, while building customer success that drives sustained adoption and long-term expansion. Have you received outside funding? $1M – $5M in outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. Bradwell is female-founded and female-led, as both co-founders are women! We’ve built a team with a mix of backgrounds (legal practice, product, engineering, and AI research), so we get different perspectives in the room and build better. We run the team on clear norms: be kind, be sharp, and do remarkable work. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? At Bradwell, we’re building legal technology that works for any legal professional, and we take pride in the following: Through these efforts, we aim not only to make an impact within our company, but also to inspire the broader legal tech ecosystem. Anything else you’d like us to know? N/A. Company Name Candle AI Elevator Pitch Candle AI is the legal email assistant that helps small and mid-sized law firms eliminate email overload freeing up hours for higher-value work. It works right inside Outlook/Gmail and 1) instantly pulls client and case details from systems like Clio and Filevine into the inbox, 2) drafts accurate, context-aware replies in second, and 3) manages email templates so you can respond to clients faster. Lawyers and paralegals save up to 90 mins per day on email and respond to clients up to 75% faster. What makes your company unique or innovative? While most legal AI tools require lawyers to leave their inbox, navigate case systems, and learn complex prompts, Candle brings the legal workspace directly into Outlook and Gmail, where legal teams already do a lot of their work, so there’s no workflow change. Our AI leverages firm-specific data, templates, and systems, reducing risk while improving accuracy and compliance. We turn email from one of the biggest time drains in a law firm into a revenue-driver and client service advantage. This helps reduce non-billable time and enables law firms to provide alternative billable models which focus on efficiency and productivity. What problem does your product solve? Attorneys spend a large portion of their day on email (up to 66%), constantly switching between inbox, case management systems, and documents. This leads to a loss of focus, lost billable time, and slower client responses. Candle significantly reduces context switching and drafts accurate email responses instantly, helping legal teams work faster and stay focused. We are also focused on empowering small and mid-size law firms and giving them a competitive advantage through Candle AI. Who are your competitors? There are general AI email assistants such as Superhuman, Copilot and Gemini which focus on individual productivity but are not designed for law firm workflows or shared case context. There are also legal specific tools such as Vesence and August that offer Outlook and Microsoft-based integrations and helpful assistance with email composition and summarizing. Candle AI takes a different approach by treating email as the central workspace for a lot of legal work. Most client communication and case activity already happen in the inbox. By integrating directly with systems such as Clio, Filevine, CasePeer, and INSZoom, Candle AI brings fuller matter context into Outlook and Gmail and connects email to the firm’s systems of record. This allows Candle to automate client communication and support legal teams beyond drafting and summarizing.

We recently expanded beyond organic adoption into targeted marketing to accelerate growth. We also support attorneys across the 50 states and globally. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. We are scaling distribution through legal tech marketplace listings, deeper integration with case systems, and partnerships with bar associations and legal service providers. As adoption expands, we aim to become the primary interface for accessing matter information from communication channels and overall managing client communication which strengthens our competitive moat. Our vision is for AI that can structure information in the inbox automatically and allows lawyers to trigger workflows using simple commands directly from the inbox. Have you received outside funding? Less than $1M in outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. Our team reflects multiple ethnic backgrounds including immigrant heritage and legal experience. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? One of our co-founders is a former immigration attorney, and the other is an immigrant, which shaped our initial focus on supporting immigration law firms that serve individual immigrants. That lived and professional experience informs how we design Candle AI to reduce administrative burden and improve communication for legal teams working with high email volume and helping clients who are in high stress situations. We support firms by making technology accessible without requiring major workflow changes. We also actively involve attorneys from diverse backgrounds in product feedback to ensure the platform works well for firms of different sizes and practice areas. Anything else you’d like us to know? Candle AI turns the inbox into a productivity powerhouse for legal teams. It gives lawyers and paralegals time back each day and improves client service.

What is the price of your product or service? $150/month. Tell us more about your traction. We have around 10 customers paying us monthly recurring. We are expecting a $200K investment in 2026. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Our primary goal within the next year is to refine the product and spread through Texas. Following Texas, we will have state specific features for the top five states for the legal community (TX, IL, NY, CA, FL). Following a commanding presence within the Big 5, we will spread to where we are most needed in the US. We are also looking at relationships with lawyers in India but that may not materialize within the next five years depending on revenue. Have you received outside funding? No outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. The primary owner is an African American man. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? Anything else you’d like us to know? We applied in 2024-25 as CaseCrafter but there was already a company by that name. We have since changed our name to CaseCreate, refined our branding, and cleaned up our web functionality so we are ready for this year. Company Name ChronoTracer Elevator Pitch ChronoTracer helps litigators and investigators easily master the facts of their case. It automatically creates a complete, defensible chronology from evidence, transforming emails, texts, social media, call logs, media files, and other formats into structured events. With deterministic extraction and instant, intuitive filtering, teams surface what matters immediately and stop wasting weeks building chronologies by hand. What makes your company unique or innovative? ChronoTracer is the only platform that begins with a full chronology rather than an empty container. It automatically assembles comprehensive, source-linked events across every major evidence type with no hallucinations or guesswork. Automatic, deterministic extraction lets ChronoTracer reach tens of millions of events – something manual, drag-and-drop tools simply can’t do. It requires no integrations, is easy to adopt, and offers fast onboarding, minimal training, and SOC 2–aligned controls. What problem does your product solve? Even with modern e-discovery systems, building a factual chronology remains a slow, manual task. Teams spend countless hours stitching together communications, phone logs, and documents just to understand what happened and when. This slows strategy, obscures patterns, and forces costly, repetitive review cycles. ChronoTracer eliminates that bottleneck by generating a full, structured chronology automatically—and then making it effortless to filter and search for exactly the events, custodians, channels, time periods, or themes teams need. Instead of hunting through evidence, users get clarity on day one instead of week six. Who are your competitors? ChronoTracer competes with spreadsheets and other manual chronology-building approaches, e-discovery and fact-management platforms that require drag-and-drop timelines, digital forensic consultants who produce reports with specialized tools, and various start-ups focused on fact organization. These alternatives rely heavily on human effort, limiting accuracy, slowing insight, and capping the volume they can handle. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://www.loom.com/share/e09d14d2bb1d40ae8eeda303771a7686 When was the company founded? 2025-01-01. Where is the company located? Austin, Tex. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Large and medium-sized law firms and boutique litigation firms that handle cases with high evidence volumes; investigation teams; corporate legal departments; and government. What is the price of your product or service? Ranges from $5k-$20k per month depending on evidence complexity and volume. Tell us more about your traction. We have supported several large high-profile cases, including an FCPA case, a federal public corruption case and a state RICO case. We are also supporting complex civil cases, internal investigations and international arbitrations. Customers have told us that they could not have handled some of these cases without ChronoTracer. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Over the next five years, ChronoTracer will grow through a mix of direct sales and strategic partnerships. We are currently focused on selling directly to law firms handling complex litigation and investigations. In the coming year, we will expand distribution by partnering with e-discovery service providers and selling directly to corporate legal departments for internal investigations and compliance matters. As the platform matures, we will also work with government contractors to introduce ChronoTracer to investigative agencies, attorneys general, regulators, auditors, and prosecution teams. This multi-channel strategy positions ChronoTracer to become the standard chronology solution across the legal and investigative ecosystem. Have you received outside funding? No outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. Our five-person core team is meaningfully diverse. We include individuals from different religious traditions, ethnic backgrounds, genders, national origins, and sexual orientations. These varied perspectives shape how we build ChronoTracer and how we support our customers. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? As a young company, our broader community impact is still developing, but we aim to contribute meaningfully over time. As we grow, we plan to support pro bono litigation and the legal teams pursuing cases that align with our values. Anything else you’d like us to know? I attended last year’s event and the startup showcase, and it was clear how valuable the forum is for new legal technology providers. We would welcome the opportunity to introduce ChronoTracer to this year’s audience. Company Name CollBox. Elevator Pitch CollBox helps law firms get paid 40% faster without turning lawyers into bill collectors. We automate and manage accounts receivable using smart reminders, integrated workflows, and a human-first approach that reduces write-offs, shortens payment cycles, and improves cash flow—while preserving client relationships. $100M+ recovered for small to mid-sized firms. Awarded Best Business of Law App in the 2025 Clio Integration Awards. What makes your company unique or innovative? CollBox is unique because we don’t treat accounts receivable as a software-only problem. Most legal tools stop at sending reminders. CollBox combines intelligent automation with trained, U.S.-based A/R specialists who step in when automation alone isn’t enough. Our platform is purpose-built for law firms, integrating directly into their billing workflows and applying proven collections strategies that preserve client relationships. This hybrid model, AI-assisted automation plus human follow-up, helps firms get paid faster without asking attorneys or staff to become bill collectors. We’ve modernized a critical but neglected function in legal operations by making collections proactive, measurable, and client-friendly. What problem does your product solve? Law firms struggle to get paid on time for work they’ve already completed. Invoices go unpaid, follow-ups are inconsistent, and collections often fall to attorneys or overextended staff – none of whom are trained or incentivized to manage accounts receivable effectively. This results in delayed cash flow, write-offs, administrative strain, and uncomfortable client interactions. Most legal software stops at sending automated reminders and offers no real strategy for collecting overdue balances. CollBox solves this by turning accounts receivable into a structured, proactive process—helping law firms reduce payment delays, recover more revenue, and eliminate the burden of collections from their legal teams. Who are your competitors? CollBox operates in a category that overlaps with, but is distinct from, several existing solutions. Our closest alternatives are law firm billing and practice management platforms (such as Clio, MyCase and Smokeball) that offer basic invoice reminders but stop short of managing accounts receivable or collections strategy. Some firms also rely on in-house staff or traditional collection agencies, which are either inefficient, costly, or harmful to client relationships – especially for work in progress or recently completed matters. Unlike these options, CollBox is purpose-built to manage the full accounts receivable lifecycle for law firms, combining automation with human follow-up in a client-friendly way. We don’t replace billing software or act as a collection agency; we fill the critical gap between invoicing and getting paid. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYKZcWJlYA When was the company founded? 2015-12-21. Where is the company located? Austin, Tex. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Small to mid-sized law firms (~3-30 attorneys). What is the price of your product or service? Starting at $599/month. ARPU is $775/month. Largest client pays $2,280/month. Pricing is based on the volume of clients a law firm bills in a typical month. They are then paced on a flat monthly subscription fee where they keep 100% of dollars recovered. Clean-up is available for older invoices for an additional one-time project fee (avg. of $10,000). Tell us more about your traction. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. CollBox is launching a new funding round in January 2026. The goal of this raise is to encode years of accounts receivable mastery from what is already the leading A/R solution for SMB law firms into an AI-driven operating system that gets law firms paid for their hard work and minimizes attorney & legal staff involvement – quickly, reliably, automatically. There is no clear leader in the market for solving the cash flow crisis that is rampant in SMB law firms and practice management systems’ features aren’t getting the job done. CollBox intends to define the accounts-receivable category in legal and cross $1B recovered for law firms by the end of 2030. Have you received outside funding? $1M – $5M in outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. CollBox is intentionally building a diverse, multi-lingual, and inclusive team across professional background, geography, and lived experience. Our leadership combines expertise from financial operations, technology, and customer service, including professionals who have worked alongside law firms. We employ team members from a range of geographic locations and career paths, prioritizing skills, empathy, and communication over traditional credentials alone. This diversity of perspective is critical to our human-first approach to accounts receivable, where prioritizing the dignity of law firm clients and maintaining respectful relationships matters even more than the technology we create. As we grow, we are committed to inclusive hiring practices and building a team that reflects the diversity of the legal professionals and clients we serve. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? CollBox contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community by lowering barriers to access for law firms that historically lack the resources of larger organizations. By making professional-grade accounts receivable support affordable and scalable, we help small and midsize firms—many of which are minority-owned, women-owned, or first-generation practices—run healthier, more sustainable businesses. We also prioritize respectful, client-friendly communication in our collections approach, reinforcing ethical, inclusive practices that protect both firms and the clients they serve. Internally and externally, we value collaboration, transparency, and empathy, and we actively participate in legal industry events, education, and knowledge-sharing to help firms of all backgrounds succeed. Anything else you’d like us to know? While founded technically in 2015, we created CollBox for law firms just 2.5 years ago when we launched our product into the Clio ecosystem, which earned us recognition as one of the best three new apps in the 2023 Clio Integration Awards. Company Name CounselPro Elevator Pitch CounselPro is the AI financial intelligence engine for legal professionals. We instantly structure years of raw PDF financial history (bank statements, check images, and credit card records) into audit-ready data. Whether tracing commingled assets or auditing bankruptcy filings, we replace weeks of manual entry with instant precision. Our platform delivers a source-linked audit trail, turning chaotic discovery into defensible legal strategy in minutes. What makes your company unique or innovative? While the legal AI boom has focused almost entirely on text (drafting, research, and contracts), CounselPro solves the massive, ignored bottleneck of financial data. We are the first platform to successfully automate the “forensic loop” for legal professionals. Our innovation lies in three key differentiators: What problem does your product solve? We solve the “Financial Discovery Bottleneck.” In high-stakes litigation like divorce, bankruptcy, and fraud, the “smoking gun” is often hidden within thousands of pages of PDF bank statements. Extracting this evidence is currently a broken, manual nightmare. Legal teams are forced to burn billable hours or paralegal budgets on “stare and compare” data entry in Excel. This is low-value grunt work that kills morale and destroys margins. Beyond the cost, this manual process introduces significant risk. Human review suffers from fatigue, leading to high error rates where critical fraudulent transfers or hidden accounts are easily missed. Existing tools fail to bridge this gap. OCR software merely provides raw text, while accounting platforms require pristine data to function. CounselPro solves the disconnect between “raw PDF” and “legal strategy,” eliminating the manual friction that makes financial cases so expensive, slow, and prone to error. Who are your competitors? Valid8, Docuclipper, Lido. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://www.counselpro.ai/watch. When was the company founded? 2024-07-01. Where is the company located? New York, N.Y. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Small to midsized law firms specializing in bankruptcy, family law, estate planning, accounting, and PI. What is the price of your product or service? Tiered based on usage, from $100/mo – $5,000+/mo. Tell us more about your traction. In the first six months of active selling, CounselPro onboarded 50 law firms entirely through inbound demand, with zero outbound sales. All acquisition to date has come from referrals, SEO, and GEO-driven discovery, indicating strong product market fit. Customers include solo family law practitioners, U.S. bankruptcy trustees, accounting consultancies, and teams working on complex federal civil rights matters. Adoption is fully self-service. Users discover the product independently, onboard without assistance, and see immediate value on their first set of documents. Revenue is driven by subscription and usage-based expansion as customers apply CounselPro to additional matters. The product is used on live cases, and multiple customers have described it as a “game changer” for financial discovery. Volume: we have already processed over $10B+ in financial transactions, proving our architecture scales to enterprise demands immediately. Retention: we are seeing rapid expansion within firms; once a single partner uses CounselPro for one case, it typically becomes the standard operating procedure for the entire firm’s financial discovery. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Our growth strategy is grounded in doubling down on the channels and behaviors that have already driven organic adoption, while expanding the surface area of the product within the legal ecosystem. We will continue to lead with a product-led, self-service motion supported by educational content that addresses real financial discovery problems. This includes practice-area-specific guides, examples, and workflows that help practitioners understand not just how to use the product, but how to apply financial intelligence more effectively in litigation. In parallel, we plan to deepen our presence at industry events where hands-on demonstrations matter, including ABA TECHSHOW and other practitioner-focused conferences. Live exposure to real documents consistently accelerates understanding and adoption. We will also pursue partnerships and integrations with widely adopted practice management and case management platforms that lawyers already use every day. Potential partners include Stretto, Clio, and Smokeball. These integrations allow CounselPro to fit naturally into existing workflows and reduce friction in how financial documents move from intake to analysis. Finally, we plan to expand the product’s analytical capabilities and supported use cases across bankruptcy, family law, fraud, and complex civil litigation while maintaining disciplined growth. Our goal is to become the default financial intelligence layer for legal professionals by making the product indispensable, rather than sales driven. Have you received outside funding? No outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. As a bootstrapped company, our leadership and workforce reflect a diversity of incentives and perspectives that are often absent in venture-backed legal tech. Because we are not constrained by VC growth mandates, predefined pricing models, or top-down product roadmaps, we stay directly aligned with the day-to-day realities of legal professionals doing complex financial work. This structure allows us to build alongside our users, not above them. Product decisions are driven by real practitioner feedback across firm sizes, practice areas, and geographies rather than by investor expectations. In practice, this results in more accessible pricing, faster iteration on real problems, and tooling that serves solo and small firms just as effectively as larger ones. We believe this proximity to the problem creates a more inclusive product and a more representative legal-tech ecosystem by ensuring that advanced financial analysis tools are not limited to firms with large budgets or enterprise buying power. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? We contribute to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community by lowering the barrier to advanced financial analysis for firms that have historically been priced out of it. Today, meaningful financial discovery often requires expensive forensic accountants, large internal teams, or enterprise-only software. That reality disproportionately favors well-resourced firms and limits access for solo practitioners, small firms, legal aid organizations, and professionals working in underserved jurisdictions. CounselPro changes that dynamic. By delivering court-defensible financial intelligence through self-service software and usage-based pricing, we make sophisticated forensic capabilities available to a much broader range of legal professionals. This enables more equitable representation for end clients and allows smaller firms to compete on analytical depth, not headcount or budget. We believe inclusivity in legal tech is not just about who builds the software, but who is empowered to use it… and who ultimately benefits from it. Anything else you’d like us to know? The legal industry is at an inflection point where AI adoption is moving beyond drafting and research into operational, evidence-driven workflows. Financial discovery is one of the major categories still dominated by manual processes and spreadsheets. CounselPro exists because this shift cannot be solved with general-purpose AI. It requires defensibility, traceability, and domain-specific logic. We believe this category will define the next wave of legal technology, and we are building the foundational platform for it. Company Name DraftyAI Elevator Pitch DraftyAI is an AI-powered drafting and case-prep tool built specifically for immigration attorneys. It helps lawyers generate high-quality USCIS briefs, motions, and support letters in minutes using their own templates, evidence, and jurisdiction-specific requirements. By automating the most time-consuming part of immigration practice, DraftyAI saves attorneys up to 60% of drafting time while maintaining attorney control, accuracy, and data security. What makes your company unique or innovative? Most legal AI tools are generic, prompt-based, or optimized for research – not real legal work. DraftyAI is immigration-first, built by practicing immigration attorneys, and designed around how cases are actually prepared. We combine guided workflows, template-based drafting, evidence uploads, and jurisdiction-aware formatting to produce filing-ready drafts. What problem does your product solve? Immigration attorneys spend 40–60% of their time drafting repetitive, high-stakes documents, often nights and weekends, because outsourcing is expensive and generic AI is risky. This bottleneck limits case volume, increases burnout, and delays filings for clients. DraftyAI removes drafting as the choke point in immigration practice by turning hours of manual writing into minutes, without sacrificing quality, accuracy, or attorney oversight. Who are your competitors? Our competitors include immigration-specific AI tools such as CaseBlink, Visalaw.ai, Parley, Imagility, and Visas.ai, as well as general legal drafting tools embedded in platforms like Clio or Filevine. Unlike research-focused or form-centric tools, DraftyAI is purpose-built for immigration case preparation and drafting, with an emphasis on real attorney workflows, template control, and filing-ready output. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://www.draftyai.com. When was the company founded? 2023-04-13. Where is the company located? Coral Gables, Fla. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? DraftyAI primarily serves solo, small, and mid-sized U.S. immigration law firms (1–25 attorneys), including employment-based, family-based, asylum, and removal defense practices. Our customers are firms handling moderate to high case volume that need to scale drafting and case preparation without increasing headcount or risking quality, compliance, or burnout. What is the price of your product or service? Various monthly plans starting at $250 per person. Tell us more about your traction. DraftyAI is a live, revenue-generating SaaS platform used by immigration attorneys across the U.S. We have dozens of active paying law firms and a growing pipeline driven primarily by founder-led education, referrals, and conference exposure. Customers report saving up to 60% of drafting time on complex immigration filings. DraftyAI has been featured in Bloomberg Law and the ABA Journal, selected for AILA’s Innovators Spotlight, and is actively used by firms handling high-volume, high-stakes matters. We are seeing steady month-over-month growth in users and engagement, with strong retention among firms that incorporate DraftyAI into their daily workflows. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Over the next five years, DraftyAI will expand from an immigration-specific drafting solution into a broader case preparation and workflow platform for immigration law firms. Near-term growth focuses on deepening value for existing customers through enhanced drafting workflows, collaboration features, and integrations with popular immigration tech stacks. Mid-term, we will scale distribution through strategic partnerships, CLE-driven education, and bar association engagement. Long-term, our goal is to become the default infrastructure layer for immigration case preparation, supporting firms as they scale volume, improve quality, and reduce burnout, while maintaining strict attorney oversight and compliance. Have you received outside funding? Less than $1M in outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. DraftyAI is led by a woman immigration attorney and immigrant founder, and was built alongside two co-founders who are also immigrants. We come from different professional backgrounds (law, engineering, and operations) and built this company through years of trust, collaboration, and shared values rather than a traditional startup pipeline. As immigrants and children of immigrants, our lived experiences directly inform the way we approach immigration law, legal technology, and the responsibility that comes with building tools lawyers rely on for high-stakes work. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? DraftyAI contributes to a more inclusive legal tech community by making advanced AI tools accessible to immigration lawyers who are often left out of traditional legal tech, especially solo and small immigration firms, many of which are led by women, immigrants, and first-generation professionals. We focus on affordability, ease of use, and education. That means transparent pricing, free trials, and free resources that help lawyers understand and use AI responsibly without needing a technical background or enterprise budget. Our goal is to make modern legal technology feel usable and safe for everyday practitioners, not just large firms. Anything else you’d like us to know? DraftyAI was built by immigration lawyers who have lived the realities of high-stakes casework, client anxiety, and burnout. Our approach to AI is intentionally conservative, attorney-centered, and compliance-first. We believe the future of legal tech isn’t about replacing lawyers; it’s about protecting their judgment, time, and well-being, especially in practice areas where the human impact is profound. Company Name EstateMin Elevator Pitch EstateMin modernizes trusts and estates departments. We replace pen-and-paper and fragmented processes with a structured, digital intake workflow that captures accurate client information upfront, reduces administrative burden, and improves the client experience from first contact. What makes your company unique or innovative? EstateMin was built to replace the pen-and-paper workflows still common in trusts and estates. Co-founded by a former Clio Product Manager, probate paralegal and a technical co-founder, we use AI to rapidly ship updates and new features based on real law firm needs. Since launching in September, EstateMin has been adopted by over 20 paying firms. What problem does your product solve? Collecting intake information for every asset, debt and beneficiary in an estate takes hours when done manually. EstateMin replaces this fragmented, pen-and-paper process with a structured digital intake, saving significant staff time, reducing errors, and allowing firms to start matters with complete and usable client information from day one. Who are your competitors? Our primary competitors are pen-and-paper intake processes and legacy workflows. In the software market, alternatives include Trustate and Decision Vault, with many of our customers having already converted from these solutions. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://www.loom.com/share/34b38e1f115440fb972a945ff85a370c. When was the company founded? 2025-09-08. Where is the company located? Boston, Mass. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Small to mid-sized firms with a trust and estates department. What is the price of your product or service? $99-$250 per month. Tell us more about your traction. EstateMin began in Ireland, where we secured early customers and validated the core intake workflow. To support scale, we prioritized deep integrations and partnered with Clio before expanding into the U.S. market. In August, we onboarded three U.S. pilot firms—100% of which converted to paying customers. Since launch, EstateMin is live with firms in over 10 U.S. states, supporting multiple users and active matters. To date, more than 70 estates are live on the platform, with law firms and their clients actively using the product. We have also had four one-call closes, where firms signed up and paid within a single 40-minute demo and are now active users. One Florida firm said, “I had high expectations and they have been exceeded.” Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Over the next five years, EstateMin will scale from client intake into a full estate lifecycle platform. Our near-term focus is growth within trusts and estates practices, with a target of 300 law firms by the end of 2026, representing approximately $950K in ARR. From there, we will expand into a digital estate vault, extending access to accountants and wealth managers. Using AI, the platform will continuously track and update clients’ entire estates during their lifetime, creating a shared, accurate source of truth across professional advisors. Have you received outside funding? Less than $1M in outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. EstateMin is led and co-founded by a female CEO. Diversity and inclusion are core to our leadership perspective and inform how we build, partner with law firms, and support the legal community. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? EstateMin actively contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community through both formal policies and everyday culture. We are led by a female founder, prioritize inclusive hiring and collaboration practices, and intentionally partner with and support underrepresented voices in the legal profession. Inclusion is embedded in how we build our product, engage with law firms, and foster an open, respectful team culture. Anything else you’d like us to know? In just three months, EstateMin has onboarded multiple paying customers, built a strong pipeline, and secured partnerships that position us for significant growth in 2026. Our momentum is driven by a highly complementary founding team combining deep legal domain knowledge, senior product leadership from Clio, and a technical co-founder with strong execution capability. We have also recently closed a small funding round to accelerate delivery and scale. Company Name EstateScribe Elevator Pitch EstateScribe is an AI-powered drafting platform built specifically for estate-planning attorneys. We turn a client intake data, interviews, and client documents into fully formatted, jurisdiction-specific estate plans in minutes, using context-aware automation designed, built, and tested within an estate planning law firm. From intake, to drafting, and client funding on the backend, EstateScribe automates the entire process, so attorneys can focus on what really matters, advising their clients. What makes your company unique or innovative? EstateScribe is the first AI-native drafting engine built exclusively for estate planners. Unlike tools that bolt AI onto legacy templates or offer a simple chatbot, we designed our system from the ground up to mirror the attorney workflow—starting with intake, continuing through interview mapping and logic validation, and ending with a fully-formatted, attorney-level plan. Our platform uses a hybrid approach combining deterministic legal logic, a proprietary knowledge map, and a context-aware generative model trained on structure rather than client data. Every edit, decision, and dependency across the matter is connected. When the attorney updates a key fact or changes a distribution scheme, the entire drafting system updates downstream provisions automatically and transparently. This makes EstateScribe the first tool that can actually think like an estate-planning attorney, rather than merely assemble documents. Streamlining intake, voice transcribing client interviews, drafting in seconds vs. hours, and always keeping the attorney in the loop is the core of the EstateScribe platform. While legal tech broadly is crowded, estate planning is uniquely underserved. Most innovation has focused on litigation, CLM, or large-firm workflows. Trusts and estates — especially for solo and small firms — remain dominated by legacy template tools and manual processes. What problem does your product solve? Estate-planning attorneys spend an enormous amount of time on repetitive drafting: combing through intake forms, reconciling notes, updating provisions, formatting long trust documents, and making sure every related clause stays consistent. Traditional automation tools require rigid templates, complex interviews, or manual exports into Word – slowing attorneys down instead of speeding them up. We built this while running an Estate Planning firm, so we know these problems because we’ve lived them firsthand. We found that almost 90% of our time was spent on intake and drafting, rather than the actual fun and useful part of running a law firm, which is spending time with more clients to ensure their plans are as effective as possible. EstateScribe solves this by eliminating the manual drudgery of intake, drafting, and client communication. Attorneys upload their intake worksheet or fill out our interactive digital interview, and EstateScribe generates a jurisdiction-specific, cleanly formatted estate plan that reflects attorney preferences, standard clauses, and state law nuances. The system flags and explains every AI-generated section, ensures consistency across all documents, and preserves attorney control. The result: faster drafting, dramatically fewer errors, and the ability for attorneys to scale their practice without burning out or hiring additional staff. Estate planning is one of the few areas of the law that consistently bills at a fixed fee rate, so the more efficient attorneys can be, the higher their margins or the ability to adjust pricing to have as competitive advantage in the market. My co-founder and I didn’t start this journey hoping to be legal tech founders, we started hoping to build a main-street law firm that could offer top tier estate planning for clients in our town. With all the amazing things happening in the legal tech ecosystem, we were ready to sign up for the latest and greatest AI product for estate planners, yet nothing came. After scheduling every demo out there and trying to wrap our heads around why no one was changing this industry like they were PI, Litigation, and Corporate Law, we decided it was time to do something about it. Who are your competitors? Our primary competitors are WealthCounsel, InteractiveLegal, HotDocs and other legacy drafting platforms. We have competition from the direct-to-consumer side from companies like Trust&Will.com, Vanilla, Wealth.com, Legal Zoom, and Estate Guru. We firmly believe in the importance of the estate planning attorney in the process. The estate-planning market broadly breaks into three distinct verticals, each serving a different customer with different incentives, economics, and risk profiles. 1. Direct-to-Consumer Estate Planning. Examples: LegalZoom, Trust & Will. These platforms sell estate-planning documents directly to consumers, typically at low price points. Strengths: Limitations: These tools serve basic needs, but they are not substitutes for attorney-led planning, especially as estates grow more complex. 2. B2B Through Wealth Managers/RIAs. Examples: RIA-embedded estate planning tools, advisor-led document platforms (wealth.com, vanilla, Estate guru). These solutions position estate planning as a value-add for financial advisors, often using attorneys behind the scenes. Strengths: Limitations: These platforms work well for select advisor-driven use cases, but they don’t meaningfully modernize how estate-planning attorneys actually practice law. 3. EstateScribe’s Vertical: B2B for Attorneys. EstateScribe is built specifically for estate-planning attorneys – not consumers and not intermediaries. We believe this is the most defensible and scalable segment because: Our approach preserves attorney oversight while unlocking efficiency, consistency, and scale. The majority of estate plans in the U.S. are drafted by solo and small-firm attorneys, yet this group has been historically underserved by both consumer platforms (too simplistic), and enterprise legal tech (too expensive and rigid). By focusing on B2B for attorneys, EstateScribe: This creates a structurally defensible position that consumer-facing or advisor-centric platforms cannot easily replicate. EstateScribe does not compete by replacing attorneys or bypassing them. We compete by making attorneys dramatically more effective, enabling them to serve more clients –including underserved middle-class families – while maintaining quality, compliance, and trust. A core principle of EstateScribe’s strategy is that attorneys must see us as partners, not threats. While the other verticals bypass the attorney entirely or reduce their role a post-hoc rubber stamp, we are intentionally designed to be the opposite. Demo Video URL (if you have one) N/A. When was the company founded? 2025-01-01. Where is the company located? Jackson, Wyo. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Small and solo estate-planning firms, boutique trusts and estates practices, and any attorney looking to scale without increasing staff overhead. Our platform is built for the 1–10 attorney firm where time savings, workflow efficiency, and document quality have an immediate and direct economic impact. However, we also see opportunity to address estate planning departments within larger firms to help increase the volume and capabilities in that specific niche. What is the price of your product or service? $350/month/seat (1 free paralegal, additional paralegal +100). Custom enterprise pricing for large firms. Tell us more about your traction. EstateScribe has secured pilot commitments from estate-planning firms in Wyoming and Texas – our initial rollout states – and has expanded into early interest from firms in Maryland and Kentucky. We recently secured a co-marketing agreement with 8am, providing us access to a broad distribution channel. We presented on the Solutions Showcase stage at Legal Tech Connect NYC, have been invited to meet with the Wyoming State Bar Estate Planning Counsel, and attended The Legal Tech Fund Summit 2025. Multiple firms are in our onboarding pipeline as we prepare for a public launch. Our MVP has already demonstrated the ability to produce attorney-level estate plans in minutes, dramatically accelerating drafting and intake workflows, and is in use at our law firm. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. In five years, EstateScribe will be the default drafting and workflow platform for estate-planning attorneys nationwide – trusted, embedded, and indispensable – while enabling firms to scale profitably and better serve the underserved middle-class market. We believe technology should amplify attorney judgment, not replace it. EstateScribe is built on the premise that senior legal expertise remains essential, even as drafting, intake, and workflow become increasingly automated. Our growth strategy follows a deliberate, credibility-first path: 1. Establish category leadership in standard to mid-complexity estate planning. We will initially dominate the $250,000–$15 million net-worth segment, where the majority of estate-planning demand exists and where inefficiencies most directly constrain firm growth. This segment offers the strongest combination of volume, repeatability, and immediate ROI for attorneys. 2. Expand upward without alienating the profession. Rather than positioning EstateScribe as “AI replacing lawyers,” we position it as infrastructure for modern estate-planning firms. As adoption grows, we will increasingly support higher-complexity practices by accelerating drafting, enforcing consistency, and reducing operational drag—without compromising attorney oversight. 3. Product expansion driven by real practitioner demand. Our V2 roadmap includes asset protection planning, complex irrevocable trusts, business formation services, probate automation, and related workflows. These expansions will be released incrementally, informed by real-world usage data and direct feedback from practicing attorneys—not speculative feature development. 4. State-by-state credibility, then national scale. We are launching in beachhead states (Wyoming and Texas), where our Chief Legal Officer is licensed and actively practices, ensuring product validity and practitioner trust. While the platform is architected for all 50 states, we will continue expanding through pilot firms in each jurisdiction to validate document quality and state-specific compliance. Our goal is nationwide availability by the end of 2026. 5. Relationship-led growth. Our core growth engine is user trust. EstateScribe was built directly out of an estate-planning practice, and we believe sustained adoption depends on deep practitioner alignment. As a result, our early scaling investments prioritize customer success and support. This approach ensures high retention, strong word-of-mouth growth, and a product that evolves alongside its users. We have unique insights from running an active estate planning practice and can sell to our customers better than anyone else. Our hope is for founder-led sales to get us established and growing exponentially until we can justify/it makes sense from a growth perspective to hire an outbound sales team. By combining disciplined market entry, practitioner-driven product expansion, and a clear respect for the attorney’s role, EstateScribe is positioned to become the long-term infrastructure layer for estate-planning firms nationwide. Have you received outside funding? $250k in friends-and-family round in addition to reinvesting our law firm revenue into the company. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. We are a first-generation founding team operating out of rural markets in Wyoming and Idaho – areas traditionally underrepresented in legal tech innovation. Our leadership backgrounds span law, trust administration, engineering, and entrepreneurship. We work with distributed engineering talent, including individuals from underrepresented groups in software development and law. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? By equipping small and solo firms with advanced drafting tools, EstateScribe expands access to high-quality estate planning for middle-class families, rural communities, and underserved regions that often lack affordable estate planning services. Our software enables attorneys who serve diverse demographics to increase capacity and reduce costs. We’re working on engagement with bar associations and are working with community-based practitioners to ensure that modern drafting tools are not limited to large or urban firms. Our goal is to democratize technology that historically required high overhead, expensive training, or large staff. Anything else you’d like us to know? EstateScribe was built because we lived the problem. As small business owners who learned to run and operate a law firm, we know how difficult, expensive, and time-consuming drafting and other manual workflows can be, and how deeply it affects access to estate planning nationwide. Our approach is not theoretical; it’s based on thousands of real client interactions. We believe estate planning is one of the most impactful areas of law, yet one of the most underserved by modern technology. EstateScribe is bringing true innovation to this critical practice area at a time when demand is rising, and attorney capacity is shrinking. Company Name Immediator Inc. Elevator Pitch Gut instinct, tradition, and billable hours currently drive the process in determining when to begin settlement negotiations in personal injury litigation. Immediator saves both sides time and money by applying data analytics to signal when settlement negotiations are likely to succeed. Developed by experts in law, data science, and insurance, Immediator is an AI-driven decision support tool that uses data, not speculation, to provide an objective method for evaluating optimal settlement timing. What makes your company unique or innovative? Litigation consumes time and money because decisions about when to negotiate settlement rely on instinct instead of statistical insight. Lawyers and insurers spend months debating when a case is ready to resolve, during which costs rise, reserves stay idle, and relationships strain under uncertainty. Immediator brings the discipline of data to the art of negotiation. Our neutral, AI-powered platform is the first of its kind because it provides an objective evidence-based measure of settlement readiness, a percentage we call PRISM (Probability of Imminent Settlement), helping both sides know when it’s a fruitful time to begin negotiation. Built by litigators, claims professionals, and data scientists, Immediator applies secure, legally engineered analysis that protects privilege, safeguards data, and delivers clarity professionals can act on confidently. The result is faster settlements, lower costs, and smarter decisions. Unlike systems that manage files or scrape data to create documents, and unlike human mediators who rely on intuition, Immediator defines a new category— settlement intelligence. Immediator does the job of a human mediator. Unlike a human mediator who parachutes in after the close of discovery and the expenditure of massive amounts of litigation costs, Immediator goes to work even before the lawsuit is filed, comparing the parties’ alignment on key issues to signal when to begin settlement negotiations, even if the optimal time is before discovery closes. What problem does your product solve? There is no system that tells plaintiff lawyers and insurance companies the right moment to settle, so insurance defense lawyers end up controlling the timeline. Plaintiffs (and their lawyers) and insurance companies are aligned in their interest in keeping costs down and resolving cases sooner. Defense lawyers are paid by the hour. This misalignment of interests often leads to unnecessary delays, unnecessary litigation expenses, and 55% of claim dollars lost to transaction costs. Immediator is the solution. Immediator uses data to detect the right moment for settlement and triggers direct negotiation between plaintiffs and insurers, preventing months of avoidable billable hours and other potentially unnecessary litigation expenses. Who are your competitors? Immediator has no direct competitors other than traditional human mediators. Most emerging legal tech platforms focus on facilitating communication or expediting document preparation, not determining settlement readiness. Immediator’s differentiation lies in using data science to model alignment and readiness objectively, while safeguarding confidentiality and neutrality. Immediator’s closest B2B SaaS competitors are Bot Mediation, EvenUp, Riskonnect, and Discover Docket. None of these tools offers neutral, data-driven predictive analysis of optimal settlement timing. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zngh4I7VEbs. When was the company founded? 2025-06-27. Where is the company located? Savannah, Ga. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Our target customers are liability insurers (and their adjusters) and personal injury (plaintiff) lawyers. The goal is to become the go-to platform for personal injury litigants by demonstrating time and cost savings for both sides. What is the price of your product or service? Immediator plans to charge an annual subscription fee per user and a separate charge per case/claim handled on the platform. The specific rates will be negotiated with the customers and subject to a specific user agreement. The prices will begin small, in order to build our customer base, and increase over time as our platform’s value to customers grows. Customers will be offered bundles to reduce cost. We anticipate that our product will become sticky, which will provide us with opportunities to expand our pricing to match its value. Tell us more about your traction. Every plaintiff lawyer we have spoken with is interested in the tool and many have become angel investors. We have reached out to one major liability insurance company so far (a company everyone would recognize by name and immediately know their slogan), and that company has expressed great interest. We are working on a pilot project with them for beta testing, data partnership, and ultimately as a future customer. The product is not yet ready for customers, so we have not pursued sales opportunities. We are focusing our energy on finishing the product and working with our interested partners. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Immediator plans a land and expand strategy. Initially, we will work to grow our customer base by selling the benefits of the platform to liability insurers, because Immediator ultimately has the potential to save insurance companies as much as 40% on their litigation costs, including hourly attorney fees and expenses. Plaintiff attorneys will be invited to the platform by the insurance companies. We plan to reach out to plaintiff lawyers independently to demonstrate the benefits and neutrality of Immediator. We will provide white glove service and inexpensive pricing to our initial customers so as to show them the value the product can add to their bottom line. We plan to offer software integration with the litigation tools already utilized by our customers so that adoption can be seamless. We will allow direct, encrypted communication and transmission of evidence and documents between the parties, with firewall protection preserving confidentiality and attorney-client privilege. The end goal is to make the platform so universally used and sticky that litigants and insurers cannot afford not to use it. Have you received outside funding? Less than $1M in outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. Two of Immediator’s four founders are women, and one is a U.S. military veteran. Maury Argento, a former captain in the U.S. Army, will be our CEO, and she has also served as our head of product development. Dr. Jill Ferdinands, our chief data scientist, created the algorithm we call PRISM (Probability of Imminent Settlement), and she will lead the company as it refines its AI-driven model as more and more data are obtained and analyzed. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? The heart of Immediator is its neutrality. Rather than utilizing the good old boys’ network or defaulting to gut instinct, Immediator will be the first platform to bring hard science and numbers as the driving force behind the decision when to begin settlement negotiations. The vast majority of human mediators are men. Immediator was created by women to replace the old way of doing business with rationality, as opposed to emotion. Anything else you’d like us to know? Immediator was conceived by our co-founder, Jason Crawford. He represents catastrophically injured victims, and he has practiced for over 32 years. Over that time, he has watched his clients’ recoveries be consistently diminished because litigation is so expensive. His goal has always been to put more money in his clients’ pockets by being a good steward of their case expenses, and a dollar saved to a client is even better than a dollar added to the settlement because a percentage of the latter is shared with the plaintiff lawyer. Reduced litigation spending makes a real difference in personal injury victims’ lives, but it also adds to the bottom line of the insurance companies. Understanding this fundamental alignment of interests ultimately led to the creation of Immediator. It also helped that Jason was married to a Ph.D. who specializes in data science. Company Name Lawdify Elevator Pitch AI-native evidence analysis and claims preparation for construction disputes, akin to a contractor-side equivalent of what EvenUp does for PI plaintiffs. A contractor drops project materials (contracts, emails, daily logs). Lawdify OCRs, parses and organises everything by parties, dates and issues (delays, variations) and generates a claim (or defence) pack with a fact-checked timeline, a structured claim/response, and flags for weaknesses in evidence. What makes your company unique or innovative? We are building the first AI-native collaboration platform purpose-built for construction and infrastructure disputes, designed to create a true network effect across the entire ecosystem: downstream users like law firms and expert witness firms, midstream claims consultants, and upstream in-house contractor teams. What makes us different is that we have engineered Lawdify from day one to work for global projects. Founded in Singapore and now expanded into Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, the U.K., and Dubai (with the US next), we have continuously tuned the platform to handle two realities that break most legal tech at scale: the idiosyncrasies of evidence across jurisdictions and the complexity of working across languages. At the core of the product is a dispute intelligence layer that turns project documentation into a living “Case Brain” of the contract: rights, obligations, and how they connect to change requests, time extension requests, and variations over the life of a project. Using graph and vector databases, we map and trace large volumes of evidence to claims, and track how the case narrative evolves over long time horizons. This gives teams a clearer, continuously updated view of what the contract says, what the evidence supports, and how the dispute is developing (across borders, languages, and stakeholders). We are the only AI tool with an Excel add-on that connects directly to the “Case Brain” behind the matter allowing for fact-checking massive spreadsheets (such as project schedules, progress logs, cost trackers, and payment applications) against thousands underlying emails, reports, meeting minutes, and other project records. What problem does your product solve? Lawdify solves the problem of inefficient, adversarial construction dispute resolution. Contractors often lose time, money, and margin due to poorly organised evidence, unclear claims, and late-stage legal intervention. Disputes cost the industry over $80 billion annually and take 13-18 months to resolve on average, driven largely by incomplete records, unsubstantiated claims, and poor contract compliance. By replacing fragmented workflows and costly legal prep with an AI-native, claims-ready workspace, Lawdify cuts down dispute resolution time, reduces legal fees, and gives contractors a faster, fairer path to resolving or avoiding disputes entirely. Who are your competitors? (Somewhat) Direct competitors: Indirect competitors in eDiscovery (Relativity, Everlaw, Reveal, Luminance) but they usually stop at review and only relevant when a construction claim has become a full-blown dispute rather than focus on dispute prevention and pre-dispute management. General copilots like MS Co-pilot, GPT Enterprise, Gemini Enterprise etc while they can draft claims given sufficient context, they are not really built to ingest and structure years of messy evidence. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://youtu.be/4lsf-J_K4lc. When was the company founded? 2023-09-09. Where is the company located? Singapore. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Law firms with construction disputes practice, claims consultants, and contractors. What is the price of your product or service? From $10K/year to $100K/year depending on size of the team, volume of documents, and complexity of the workflows. Tell us more about your traction. Working with some of the largest law firms in Asia specialized in complex and high value construction disputes, claims consultants, expert witness firms, and construction contractors. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Year 1 (2025). We are growing Lawdify by tapping into disputes teams in Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Japan that focus on high stakes disputes including construction. Year 2 (2026). We expand across APAC with law firm’s construction disputes and expand by pulling in the rest of the ecosystem on each matter (claims consultants, expert witnesses, and law firms) as collaborators on the same structured record, creating a network effect and repeatable referrals. We start US expansion focusing on mid-tier contractors. Year 3 (2027). We replicate this playbook to create the go-to platform for construction disputes with contractors based in the US that have global presence including in APAC. Year 4-5. We become the default disputes infrastructure for construction matters by standardizing these workflows across firms and experts, and extending from claims preparation into full-stack dispute handling (from intake through tribunal-ready filings) Have you received outside funding? $1M – $5M in outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. Eliza Jiang (CEO & co-founder): Chinese descent (Guangzhou native, native Cantonese and Mandarin speaker), culturally Latina since I grew up in Panama (Panamanian national, fluent/native Spanish speaker). First generation Chinese immigrant to Panama, first one to attend university in the family with international student financial aid. First lawyer/professional in the family and paid law school with scholarships and student loans. Lived and worked in Toronto, Ottawa, New York, China, Hong Kong, Singapore. Hong Kong permanent resident. Max Godoy (CTO & co-founder): Chilean national, grew up in the island of Chiloe in south of Chile, self taught coder and have been coding since 14. Trained as engineer and recruited by Singaporean aerospace engineering company. Lived in Asia, 2x startup founder of AI and blockchain analytics company. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? Lawdify contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community by expanding what “legal tech” serves and who it is built for. We are building from APAC outward for a global user base, not the other way around. That means supporting cross-border matters, multilingual evidence, and region-specific dispute processes so teams in markets that are often underserved by US-centric tools can still benefit from high-quality AI workflows. We also focus on a part of the legal ecosystem that is frequently left out of innovation: construction and infrastructure disputes, where outcomes affect livelihoods, public works, and small-to-mid-sized contractors. By making evidence organization, fact-checking, and claims preparation faster and more accessible, we help smaller teams (including boutiques and lean in-house groups) operate with capabilities that previously required large headcount and expensive systems. Finally, our collaboration approach brings together the full set of stakeholders on a matter (law firms, expert witnesses, claims consultants, and contractors) on a shared, structured record. That reduces information asymmetry and makes dispute work more transparent, consistent, and accessible across different teams, geographies, and working styles. Anything else you’d like us to know? We started a more general AI legal tech tool for disputes case preparation and have found a wedge and great use case in construction disputes, which is why we are doubling down on this industry. Company Name LawFi, Inc. Elevator Pitch LawFi offers flexible and customized legal fee financing options, allowing clients to access legal services while paying the costs over time. LawFi’s legal fee financing platform combines financial technology, a proprietary loan origination system, and utilizes AI to assess market and court data to determine the optimal term and loan amount for each matter. LawFi can approve a legal fee loan in minutes, not days or weeks. Now, lawyers can offer clients a better way to pay for legal services. What makes your company unique or innovative? LawFi is not a litigation funding provider investing in high-stakes contingency legal cases. LawFi is the first installment loan product specifically designed to finance legal service fees. Our proprietary AI-driven decision engine uses alternative data (employment, income, cash flow) to approve more clients, not just those with prime credit. We enable law firms to embed financing directly into their workflows, depositing funds directly into client trust accounts, transforming legal payments, and providing access to justice. What problem does your product solve? LawFi helps address the access-to-justice gap by enabling the 166 million Americans living paycheck to paycheck to afford legal representation. We remove financial barriers for clients who are either unable to pay upfront fees or prefer to finance their legal services, while ensuring that lawyers receive payment upfront. This approach increases the number of clients served and reduces receivables. Who are your competitors? Competitors include credit card companies, Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) providers, and general personal loan platforms. However, these traditional loan options are not tailored or customized for legal services. They do not underwrite the legal matter being financed, and often have higher costs, lower approval rates, and less flexible terms for legal matters. We differentiate ourselves from BNPL solutions targeting the legal market because (i) LawFi is the lender and underwriter; we are not simply a lead pass-through to a thrid-party BNPL underwriter or lender; (ii) Our technology enables us to approve a significantly higher percentage of applicants than BNPL solutions, by using open banking technology and cash flow underwriting allowing us to evaluate the ability to repay based on a broader range of factors; (iii) Our proprietary algorithms underwrite the legal matter being financed to establish what a matter should cost and the proper repayment terms based on the type of dispute, jurisdiction, market and court data; (iv) We provide law firms with an advanced platform and embedded finance tools and resources to quickly and easily add financing to their payment options; (v) LawFi has developed the first fully functional and bar complaint legal fee financing platform, not just a link found in a payment processor platform payout page; and (vi) Unlike a BNPL solution, LawFi has developed the first fully compliant refund policies that do not claw back fees or loan proceeds from law firms. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://bit.ly/lawfi_demo, Password: LegalFintech. When was the company founded? 2021-11-08. Where is the company located? LawFi is a remotely operated company with headquarters located in Jacksonville, Fla. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? LawFi customers include lawyers, law firms, and their clients (borrowers). LawFi can target the full spectrum of lawyers and law firms, from sole practitioners to large law firms. Our initial focus is on small to mid-sized law firms, solo practitioners, and their clients. We are targeting firms focused on serving the needs of individual consumers and small business owners, making loans for services in practice areas such as family law, trusts & estates, civil litigation, and other consumer-facing areas, as well as business law, transactions, and commercial litigation. What is the price of your product or service? LawFi legal merchant accounts are free to lawyers and law firms. We do not charge any set-up, implementation, or other subscription fees. Like other credit card networks, lenders, or BNPL financing options, LawFi only charges its law firm clients a Merchant Discount Rate (“MDR” or “financing fee”) on the total loan amount for the matters we finance after the firm has approved and accepted the financing and confirmed receipt of the funds in their account. Our fees range from 7.5% to 15% of the loan amount. Borrowers pay a fixed interest rate (significantly lower than other financing options) and a 2% loan origination fee, which is added to the loan amount and paid over the term of the loan. Tell us more about your traction. LawFi launched its platform in June 2025 at the 75th Annual Florida Bar Convention. We have developed a growing waitlist and have partnered with Cordell & Cordell, the nation’s largest family law firm, and others to offer our legal fee loans in a limited Florida rollout. We plan to expand the rollout across the entire state of Florida to complete our pilot program and then expand across the country. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. LawFi plans to scale nationwide by partnering with bank sponsors, credit unions, law firms, bar associations, legal payment processors, and other legal technology providers to expand its digital lending platform and AI-driven underwriting capabilities. We will continuously enhance our technology, broaden our network, and develop new products to support access to justice for millions of Americans. Have you received outside funding? Yes, LawFi has been capitalized to date by founders, friends, and family (angels), raising $3M in cash and significant non-cash contributions from team members. We are currently negotiating three term sheets for our first seed credit facility of $25 million, with an accordion feature to $150 million, to support our Florida pilot program. Additionally, we are preparing to launch our first institutional equity offering for between $5M and $10M. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. LawFi’s leadership team comprises professionals from diverse backgrounds in legal, finance, technology, compliance, and operations, with experience spanning major fintech firms, law firms, and financial institutions. We emphasize building strong, inclusive, and equitable teams. Our current team includes minorities and women. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? LawFi’s mission is to make legal services financially accessible to all, especially middle-class Americans and those who are underserved. By bridging the Access to Justice Gap, we empower diverse communities to obtain legal representation. Anything else you’d like us to know? LawFi is the inventor of the Legal Fee Loan and the only company offering a proprietary legal fee lending platform purpose-built for the legal industry. Our technology is designed to transform the way legal services are paid for and accessed, ensuring that everyone can obtain legal services regardless of their financial situation.

The ones that hesitate will be stuck wondering how it all changed so fast. LawQi delivers what most AI training can’t: true literacy, foundational competency, and actual behavior change. Affordably scalable for any organization, it equips the people who power competitive advantage. What makes your company unique or innovative? LawQi is where lawyers use AI to learn AI. Legal professionals build real competency through real work, not passive lectures or demonstrations. LawQi builds real AI competency. The first innovative differentiator is the learning method itself. The platform serves as both personal AI tutor and experimental workspace, where users master prompting techniques, test capabilities, and analyze documents in real-time through interactive discovery. This builds transferable skill and valuable AI understanding and intuition that works across any AI platform. Comprehensive modules cover AI fundamentals, advanced techniques, the tools landscape, and critical professional topics including liability and insurance coverage. Users navigate content at their own pace, and each lesson incorporates hands-on experimentation with immediate feedback to lock in and extend the learning. Core course material is supplemented by 100+ topic explainers in LawQi’s memory, drawn on to support answers and presented as clickable citation links when relevant to a learner’s conversation with the AI tutor. Our approach sidesteps the biggest pitfalls in AI training: LawQi delivers true AI literacy, foundational competency, and actual behavior change. The second innovative differentiator is the delivery model. A fully-managed, turn-key solution for bar associations, law firms and other organizations. Whether supporting larger initiatives or serving as the complete program for organizations lacking training infrastructure, LawQi scales to create true AI literacy, foundational competency, and actual behavior change organization-wide. For lawyers in small firms, bar associations are the institutions legal professionals trust above even their firms to prepare them for an AI-powered future. However, smaller bar associations lack the time and funding to prepare their members for the AI transformation, and larger bar associations lack the capacity for dynamic delivery, timely content creation and agile platform integration of emerging models. Among firms, smaller and many mid-size firms lack dedicated training staff. Meanwhile larger firms implementing specialized tools are too stretched to provide foundational training for their broader workforce. Whether supplementing larger initiatives within a firm or serving as the complete program for organizations lacking training infrastructure, LawQi scales to create true AI literacy, foundational competency, and actual behavior change organization-wide. The third innovative differentiator is the price. We price as low as $1 per member per year for bar associations and as low as $1 per FTE per month for law firms for organizations engaging our global platform (some conditions apply). Private instances, including the ability to incorporate the bar or firm’s learning materials and capable of customization to their priorities, are also available. The final innovative differentiator is our foundation. We built LawQi as the evolution of our experience developing and supporting the “AI Academy” programs of the Ontario Bar Association and Canadian Bar Association. Our technology partnership with Praxis AI means we deliver our programming on award-winning platforms that are battle-tested across major universities and enterprises – a leading-edge stack that combines pedagogical excellence with enterprise-grade security and scalability, from an organization profiled by Anthropic and described by them as “leading the AI revolution in education.” Our foundation speaks to our ability to immediately accommodate ALL associations and firms recognizing the AI transformation now underway and the urgency of equipping the people who power their capacity to meet the moment. What problem does your product solve? Poor AI literacy and competency among lawyers is now an industry-scale problem, and it calls for an industry-scale response. LawQi is the only provider immediately capable of delivering baseline AI training at an industry scale. No amount of webinars, pilots or even firm-wide rollouts of legal AI products changes the fact that the rate of AI advancement means that all facets of legal knowledge work and practice will be impacted in unknown and unknowable ways throughout 2026 and beyond. While some lawyers, firms and legal organizations are at the vanguard, most are at the starting line, unaware that a race has even begun. We have an urgent, mass-education need and a dawning realization that our traditional thinking and approaches to technology training takes us in the wrong direction when it comes to AI. I’d go so far as to say that lawyers in particular have at most 12 months left to develop a holistic understanding of generative AI in the context of what it means for the practice of law and administration of justice before the window closes for good. That’s how fast AI is evolving. If we don’t act, we risk the majority of our AI learning opportunities being reduced to those focused on operating systems we didn’t design, managing processes we don’t understand, in a transformation we never guided. It doesn’t have to be that way. The ultimate trajectory will be of our own making, but our collective ability to guide the transformation means we need a critical mass with baseline understanding of how AI works now. We don’t have that baseline yet because legal AI advancement, innovation and adoption has been sparse, diffuse, and either seen as optional or for the foolhardy. Our institutions (firms, bar associations, courts and legal departments of all sorts) haven’t embraced meaningful full-firm, full-bar or full-org AI training to build that baseline. Indeed, before LawQi, it wasn’t even an option. It is now. Who are your competitors? All CLE providers, whether private, bar affiliated, non-profit or commercial, and whether targeting individuals, firms or bar associations. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://youtu.be/6uDpwAgxBqE. When was the company founded? 2025-05-06. Where is the company located? Ottawa, Ontario. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Bar associations (or similar) of any size (from small county to the largest state bars), firms and legal organizations of 50 FTE (all roles) or larger. Our offering is scalable to organizations of any size. What is the price of your product or service? We price as low as $1 per member per year for bar associations and as low as $1 per FTE per month for law firms for organizations engaging our global platform (some conditions apply). Private instances, including the ability to incorporate the bar or firm’s learning materials and capable of customization to their priorities, are also available at higher price points. Tell us more about your traction. The first iteration developed for the benefit of the 16,000 member Ontario Bar Association (OBA) came in November 2024. Launched in beta as the “AI Academy,” it was conceived by Colin Lachance, then holding an appointment as the OBA Innovator-in-Residence, with a dual purpose of fulfilling his mandate to AI education for the OBA and for evaluating the potential of this particular learning approach. Following a content update and learning path refresh, its popularity among Ontario lawyers grew, as did demand from other Canadian jurisdictions for access. In July 2025, the 40,000 member Canadian Bar Association contracted with LawQi (the newly incorporated business that assumed management of the OBA AI Academy and now provides the distinct LawQi Global platform) to roll out the CBA AI Academy nationally (including assuming OBA’s financial responsibility for Ontario beyond the term of the prior arrangement). Throug the CBA, the AI Academy has been accredited for 2.75 hours of Ethics/Professionalism and 0.25 of substantive law. The commercial version of LawQi outside the ambit of the CBA relationship took shape over the early fall, with successful beta testing across multiple customer groups, and the go-to-market content and platform experience were finalized in early November 2025. Clients in pilots or anticipated to onboard in January/February 2025 include: placements at two national and three large regional law firms with a combined FTE of 4,000), state-wide availability to over 1500 team members across 50+ legal aid offices, roll-outs to teams of 50-100 of three different pro bono organizations in three different jurisdictions. Several other active client conversations likely to result in pilots or launches by the end of February include three state bars, two county bars, three trial lawyers associations and one legal insurance company (for the benefit of its insured attorneys). In addition, LawQi will be placed at no-charge in at least 3 law school classes. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Our goal for 2026 is to serve as many lawyers as we can. In a recent “Lawyers who Learn” Lawline podcast, we talked about upskilling 100,000 attorneys by 2030, but we are confident that we can (and must) go well beyond that in just 2026 to build the baseline competency we believe the profession needs. That is our sole priority for 2026 and we will keep our offering and price points in line with that focus. Beyond 2026, consistent and vocal user feedback from among our AI Academy and LawQi base highlights the high demand for experiential training in other aspects of attorney work. Our relationship with Praxis AI also reveals a number of promising avenues for ultra-personalized learning, professional development and even practice activities. We will closely monitor user feedback as it relates to demand for those services and plan for product expansion beyond AI training in 2027. Have you received outside funding? No outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. N/A. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? LawQi advances inclusion by partnering with bar associations – the institutions serving the entire legal profession, not just elite firms. Similarly, we also prioritize support of legal aid, pro bono and not-profit organizations through pricing our offerings to them at bar associations rather than law firm levels. Our bar association pricing – as low as $1 per member per year – makes professional-grade training accessible regardless of practice setting or resources. Solo practitioners, small firm lawyers, legal aid attorneys, and underserved communities access the same quality training as large corporate firms through their bar membership. This prevents a divide where only well-resourced organizations develop AI competencies while others fall behind. Bar associations serve diverse memberships across practice areas, geographic locations, and career stages. By empowering these trusted institutions to lead their members through the AI transformation, LawQi reaches the full spectrum of legal practice—from rural solo practitioners to urban specialists, from new lawyers to experienced practitioners transitioning to new technologies. The platform’s self-directed design accommodates diverse learning styles, experience levels, and schedules. Professionals navigate modules on fundamentals, advanced techniques, tools landscape, and critical professional topics at their own pace, removing one-size-fits-all constraints disadvantaging learners with different backgrounds or time availability. The embedded AI assistant provides personalized support, meeting users where they are rather than assuming baseline technical literacy. Legal professionals from non-technical backgrounds, different generations, or varied educational experiences all develop essential competencies—from prompting techniques to understanding liability implications—ensuring the entire legal community can participate in shaping the AI transformation of law.

Company Name LegalBridge Elevator Pitch LegalBridge is AI-powered case management built exclusively for immigration law firms. We automate the entire visa workflow: document categorization, cover letter drafting, recommendation letters, exhibit generation, form filling, client portals, case tracking, invoicing, and final export. Attorneys cut case prep time by 60% while doubling client capacity. Serving 70+ U.S. law firms, from solo practitioners to 20-attorney practices. What makes your company unique or innovative? LegalBridge is the only immigration case management platform with native AI across every workflow stage. Five core innovations set us apart: Unlike legacy platforms that digitize paper workflows, LegalBridge reimagines them. We built for AI-first, not AI-added. What problem does your product solve? Immigration attorneys face a crushing operational burden. Preparing a single O-1A or EB-1A case requires organizing hundreds of documents, drafting 20-page cover letters, generating dozens of exhibit labels, filling government forms, and coordinating with clients, employers, and recommenders across time zones. Most firms rely on outdated software designed before modern AI existed. The result: paralegals spend 15+ hours per case on manual document organization. Attorneys write the same cover letter sections repeatedly. Client communications scatter across email, text, and phone calls. Form errors cause RFEs that delay approvals by months. LegalBridge solves this by consolidating every immigration workflow into one AI-powered platform. Document uploads auto-categorize. Drafts generate from templates trained on successful filings. Client portals centralize communication and document collection. Questionnaires pre-populate government forms. Exhibit lists generate and reorder with drag-and-drop. The outcome: attorneys handle 2x the caseload without adding headcount, case preparation time drops by 60%, and RFE rates decrease through AI-driven consistency checks. Who are your competitors? Our competitors include INS Zoom, Docketwise, Cerenade and E-Immigration. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://youtu.be/RG2UySU8K5k?si=l8nL4qzz9I276XBT. When was the company founded? 2023-11-03.

Target: $10M+ ARR, 2,000+ law firms globally. Have you received outside funding? No outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. LegalBridge is founded and led by immigrants. Our leadership team represents India’s technology and startup ecosystem, bringing firsthand understanding of the immigration challenges we solve. The company includes team members from multiple backgrounds, gender identities, and regions across India and the U.S. Diversity is embedded into our lived experience and our product vision immigration is our founders’ personal story, not just a market opportunity. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? LegalBridge actively supports the immigrant founder and legal tech communities from diverse background through several initiatives: We host events for our community of 20,000+ immigrant founders and professionals, creating networking opportunities and sharing immigration knowledge freely. These events connect entrepreneurs navigating their own visa journeys with attorneys who can help. Our pricing structure democratizes access to advanced technology. Solo practitioners and small firms pay $5,000/year, receiving the same AI capabilities that larger firms access. This ensures immigration attorneys serving underrepresented communities can compete with well-resourced practices. We partner with immigration attorneys who serve asylum seekers, DACA recipients, and other vulnerable populations, offering discounted access to ensure technology reaches those handling the most critical cases. As immigrant founders building for immigration law, we are committed to ensuring this practice area, which directly shapes who gets to participate in American society, has access to the best possible technology. Anything else you’d like us to know? LegalBridge exists because three immigrants decided the system that shaped their lives deserved better technology. We built every feature immigration attorneys actually need: AI document categorization, document chat, client collaboration portals, AI-drafted cover letters and recommendation letters, drag-and-drop exhibit lists, email questionnaires, automated form filling, final export, case status tracking, one-click invoicing, and one-click retainer generation. One platform. No juggling systems. We bootstrapped without outside funding because we wanted to build for customers, not investors. Every feature exists because an immigration attorney told us they needed it. The immigration legal market remains underserved. Legacy vendors carry decades of technical debt. New entrants bolt AI onto old architectures. LegalBridge is AI-native from day one. We are profitable, growing, and obsessed with making immigration attorneys more effective. TECHSHOW recognition would accelerate our mission and introduce LegalBridge to firms still struggling with fragmented, outdated tools. We would be honored to demonstrate how AI transforms immigration law practice. Company Name Litmas Inc. Elevator Pitch Litmas is an AI powered tool designed specifically for litigation attorneys that digitizes the workflows litigators use to move a case through the litigation process, in one unified platform. Litmas AI enables attorneys to responsibly draft motions, pleadings, discovery documents, organize evidence and conduct in-context verifiable case law research. This combination of AI enhanced workflows results in substantial time savings and greater accuracy and visibility. What makes your company unique or innovative? Litmas AI is built for litigation, not general legal work. It connects facts, evidence, and case law into one drafting workflow instead of producing free form AI text. Every result is thoroughly traceable to source documents and cited authority, so attorneys can verify accuracy instantly. This makes Litmas usable in real litigations, where mistakes and hallucinated citations are unacceptable. What problem does your product solve? Litigation work is slow and manual. Attorneys repeatedly draft similar motions, pull facts from scattered documents, and double check research under deadline pressure. Generic AI tools make this worse by hallucinating case law and forcing lawyers to verify every single output. Litmas solves this by connecting facts, evidence, and precedent into a single workflow, reducing drafting time while maintaining professional reliability. Who are your competitors? Our competitors include traditional legal research platforms such as Westlaw and Lexis, AI assisted drafting tools, and newer AI legal assistants such as Spellbook or Clearbrief. These products either focus primarily on research, provide general AI chat experiences, or address isolated drafting tasks. Litmas differs by combining motion drafting, evidence organization, and case law application into a single litigation focused workflow. with fully sourced outputs designed for use in active cases. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://litmas.ai/video-overview/. When was the company founded? 2025-07-14. Where is the company located? Wilmington, Del. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Our primary target customers are small and mid-sized firms. What is the price of your product or service?

Litmas AI is deep in talks with several AM 100 firms for piloting the platform. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Litmas AI is currently live in all 50 states. Over the coming years, Litmas AI will deepen its existing coverage by extending its library of litigation documents and improving its proprietary motion drafting and evidence mapping workflows. Have you received outside funding? Less than $1M in outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. Litmas is built by a globally distributed team with diverse professional and cultural backgrounds. Our team includes former litigators, appellate attorneys, AI researchers, and engineers based across multiple regions and countries. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? Litmas AI gives smaller firms and contingency based practices access to advanced litigation technology that has traditionally been available only to large firms. Anything else you’d like us to know? Litmas was built based on practicing litigators input and logic every step of the way and is used daily on real life litigation cases throughout the country, today. Company Name PowerPatent Inc. Elevator Pitch PowerPatent is an AI co‑pilot for patent lawyers that turns invention disclosures and drawings into near‑ready patent applications in minutes. It automates first drafts, checks consistency between claims, spec, and figures, and flags patentability risks so firms can file stronger patents faster, increase flat‑fee margins, and free attorneys to focus on strategy, not slog work. What makes your company unique or innovative? PowerPatent is unique because it combines a highly automated, “full‑spec in minutes” drafting engine with built‑in diagnostics that continuously check quality, consistency, and patentability while you work.​ End‑to‑end AI drafting co‑pilot. Unlike tools that only help with snippets or templates, PowerPatent can generate background, summary, detailed description, and even claims from disclosures, figures, and part lists in a single, guided flow.​ The system is designed so attorneys start from an almost complete draft, then refine and strategize, instead of building the application from scratch.​ Embedded quality and risk checks. PowerPatent layers in AI‑powered consistency checks, functional‑claim analysis, and automated cross‑referencing between claims, spec, and drawings to catch gaps and ambiguities that weaken enforceability.​ It also uses prior‑art and Section 103 conflict prediction signals to highlight potential patentability issues early, making the drafting process more strategic, not just faster.​ Workflow and ecosystem integration. The platform integrates drafting, review, docketing, and USPTO Private PAIR connectivity, so firms do not have to juggle separate tools for composition, checking, and prosecution.​ Cloud collaboration features let inventors and attorneys co‑develop drafts, with AI suggesting additional embodiments and variations to broaden protection and reduce design‑around risk.​ What problem does your product solve? PowerPatent solves the problem that patent drafting and prosecution work in law firms is slow, labor-intensive, and margin‑compressed, by automating first‑draft generation and routine prosecution tasks so attorneys can spend more time on strategy and client counseling.​ Core problems for law firms Traditional patent drafting requires many hours of manual background, claim, and detailed description drafting per case, limiting throughput and making flat or capped fee work less profitable.​ Attorneys and staff lose time to repetitive tasks such as reusing boilerplate, aligning specs and drawings, and ensuring formality compliance across multiple jurisdictions, which increases turnaround time and risk of error.​ How PowerPatent addresses them For drafting, PowerPatent’s AI co‑pilot turns an attorney’s input (claims, invention summary, drawings/part lists) into a comprehensive first draft in minutes, including background and detailed description sections aligned with the figures.​ For prosecution, PowerPatent supports the full patent lifecycle by first turning raw invention disclosures into high‑quality, consistent applications that are easier to prosecute efficiently and strategically. During prosecution, it tracks office actions, automates responses, and surfaces metrics so teams can control cost and maximize term and portfolio strength. Once assets are granted, the platform helps map patents to products and markets, inform valuation and monetization strategies, and then periodically flag low‑value or non‑core assets for pruning using portfolio views and AI‑driven keep‑vs‑drop analysis.​ The system analyzes large patent datasets to propose accurate, guideline‑compliant language and structure, reducing drafting errors and downstream prosecution rework while allowing lawyers to focus on tailoring claims and legal strategy.​ Impact on law‑firm economics By compressing drafting time and automating low‑value steps, firms can increase associate productivity, handle more matters per attorney, and make fixed‑fee patent work more scalable and profitable.​ Cloud collaboration and workflow features let distributed teams and outside counsel iterate on drafts faster, improving responsiveness to clients and shortening time to filing without adding headcount.​ Who are your competitors? PowerPatent competes in the AI patent‑drafting/prosecution‑support space with a large and fast‑growing field of tools.​ Direct AI drafting competitors: DeepIP (formerly Davinci)​, Rowan Patents​, Dolcera IP Author​, ClaimMaster (AI‑assisted drafting and proofreading)​, Qatent​​, IP Author/IP Author.ai, Patently Create​, ipagent.ai​, PatentGPT​, XLSCOUT Drafting LLM​, Paximal​, Added Matter​. Broader AI patent tool ecosystem: Solve Intelligence (drafting + workflow)​, Black Hills AI​, Edge (disclosure + drafting)​, PatentBots (review, analytics, statistics)​, NLPatent/similar AI prior‑art tools listed in reviews​.

For enterprise price please call 669-2323440 Tell us more about your traction. Law‑firm and investor traction: PatentPC uses PowerPatent to streamline drafting and prosecution on active client matters, validating that the workflows support sophisticated U.S. practice and flat‑fee economics.​ Tran.vc applies PowerPatent across a growing portfolio of AI, robotics, and deep‑tech startups, demonstrating scalability from single cases to multi‑asset portfolios.​ Inventiv channels early‑stage founders into the platform, showing that it can compress time from disclosure to filing and support monetization‑driven IP decisions.​ In‑house corporate traction. Cisbay, Micronoc, Monolithic 3D, and IntraAction use PowerPatent in‑house to draft, refine, and manage patent filings more efficiently than with outside counsel alone, using automation to cut cost while maintaining attorney‑level quality.​ These internal deployments show that the platform works not only for law firms but also for lean corporate IP teams that need repeatable workflows for drafting, prosecution metrics, and portfolio pruning. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. PowerPatent plans to grow over the next five years by deepening product capabilities across the patent lifecycle, expanding into more practice settings (firms, in‑house, and government), and building a partner ecosystem that drives distribution and data advantages.​ Product expansion. PowerPatent will evolve from “AI drafting co‑pilot” into a full lifecycle platform covering invention capture, drafting, prosecution analytics, portfolio valuation, monetization, and pruning. The roadmap emphasizes more domain‑specialized AI models, richer automation for office‑action responses, and tools that tie patents directly to products, revenue, and risk so legal teams can make board‑level decisions from within the product.​ Go‑to‑market and customer segments. Growth will focus on three core segments: patent boutiques and mid‑size firms doing flat‑fee work; in‑house teams at IP‑intensive startups and growth companies; and eventually larger enterprises and public‑sector organizations that need scalable IP workflows. Channels will include direct sales to firms, partnerships with VC funds and incubators (leveraging Tran.vc and similar relationships), and integrations with existing IP management and docketing systems to reduce switching friction.​ Data, ecosystem, and defensibility. Over five years, PowerPatent aims to compound its data advantage by learning from anonymized drafting and prosecution outcomes to continuously improve drafting quality, claim strategy suggestions, and keep‑vs‑drop recommendations. The company will also pursue alliances with search, analytics, and IP valuation providers, positioning PowerPatent as the drafting and decision‑making layer that sits on top of the broader patent data ecosystem.​ Have you received outside funding? No outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. PowerPatent is led and staffed mainly by minorities, with a founding and core team that is Asian and African Americans, bringing perspectives that are historically underrepresented in both legal tech and the patent profession. This diversity shows up not only in ethnicity, but also in career background, combining patent attorneys, engineers, and entrepreneurs who have navigated immigration, first‑generation professional, and cross‑border innovation ecosystems. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? PowerPatent contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community by putting minority founders, inventors, and patent attorneys at the center of its product and ecosystem. The company is led and staffed entirely by minorities (Asian and African), and it actively mentors and trains underrepresented founders, students, and junior practitioners on how to use AI to access high‑quality patent protection without needing a large‑firm budget. PowerPatent also collaborates with minority‑owned firms, diverse startup ecosystems, and global technical communities, ensuring that voices from outside the traditional AmLaw and BigTech corridors help shape how AI is applied to patents and IP strategy. Anything else you’d like us to know? PowerPatent is built by practicing patent attorneys and engineers who live the daily realities of drafting, prosecution, and portfolio strategy, so the product is grounded in real‑world workflow and ethics rather than hype. The team is already embedded in the legal community through teaching, mentoring founders, and speaking on AI and patents, and views ABA TECHSHOW as a long‑term partnership opportunity to help solo, small, and mid‑size firms safely adopt generative AI. PowerPatent is committed to transparent, human‑in‑the‑loop use of AI, clear data‑handling practices, and continuous feedback from practitioners so that automation strengthens, rather than erodes, professional judgment and access to high‑quality patent representation.

Five-Year Growth Strategy for SayWell: Phase 1: Validation & Integration (Year 1). Phase 2: Product Scale and Evolution (Year 2). Phase 3: Market Leadership (Years 3–5). Have you received outside funding? Less than $1M in outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. Well it’s really just me right now so I guess that inherently means zero diversity. 🙂 Kidding aside, I would say my background as a non-attorney with a product background from customer facing retail is generally diverse vs the traditional players in this market. Outside, customer-centered focus -> innovation. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? We are based in the heart of Atlanta which is extremely diverse and my office is a tech co-working space that is surrounded by diversity. I will likely hire from within this talent pool as we grow. Anything else you’d like us to know? I’m a father of two awesome kids that recently stepped away from a 20-year corporate career with The Home Depot with the last 15 years focusing on leading product management teams. I’ve had a long passion for wanting to solve customer problems and having gone through my own recent divorce I spotted an opportunity to make an impactful change. SayWell is taking a fundamentally different approach to improving coparent communication (and the fallout that lawyers ultimately deal with). The legacy providers try to stop parental fighting by documentation and eventual hand slapping. SayWell is an in-conversation moderator positioned to make a real impact on co-parents lives. Company Name SecureSplit. Elevator Pitch SecureSplit is an AI powered divorce financial platform for family law firms, mediators, and CDFAs. We replace spreadsheets and email with a single workflow for client intake, organizing income, expenses, assets, and debts, running state specific support and property division calculations, and producing clean, court ready financial reports that save time and reduce costly errors. What makes your company unique or innovative? Most tools in family law focus on documents, not the numbers. SecureSplit is built for the financial side of divorce, from intake to court ready reports, in one browser-based workflow. Both spouses enter data once, the system standardizes it, runs state specific support and division calculations, and flags gaps or inconsistencies with AI assisted checks. It is collaborative, multi state, and API ready, so firms can plug a modern divorce financial engine into the rest of their legal tech stack. What problem does your product solve? Divorce lawyers, mediators, and CDFAs are stuck juggling spreadsheets, PDFs, email, and outdated calculators to make financials court ready. This manual, fragmented workflow is slow, error prone, and hard to delegate, which drives up costs and stress for clients. SecureSplit solves this by turning messy inputs from both spouses into a single structured dataset so professionals can run support and division calculations and generate clean reports in a few clicks. Who are your competitors? Our main competitors are legacy divorce financial tools like Family Law Software, DissoMaster, and other state specific support calculators, plus the “DIY stack” of Excel, PDFs, and email that firms still rely on. We compete by offering a single, modern workflow that covers intake, calculations, and reports in one place. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://securesplit.com/investor-page When was the company founded? 2025-01-01. Where is the company located? Newark, Del., HQ; San Diego, Calif. and Greensboro, N.C. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Our primary target is solo and small to mid-sized family law firms, mediators, and divorce focused financial professionals (CDFAs and RIAs). Over time, we will expand to larger firms and law departments, but our initial focus is on the teams that live in the day-to-day financial details of divorce and need a faster, more standardized workflow. What is the price of your product or service? We use a tiered subscription model. Professional plans for firms, mediators, and CDFAs start around $100 dollars per professional per month, with premium and enterprise pricing based on seats, features, and overall size of the firm. The consumer version is offered as a separate low-cost monthly subscription on essentials.securesplit.com. Tell us more about your traction. We are currently pre revenue with approximately 50 professional customers using SecureSplit on live divorce matters, including family law firms, mediators, and CDFAs. Usage is growing through referrals and a waitlist of additional firms, and we are seeing strong engagement and feedback through regular product sessions and Fireside Chats as we prepare for full launch. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Over the next five years, we will grow SecureSplit by first converting our current professional users into paying subscribers and deepening adoption within their firms. In the near term, we are focused on launching in a small set of key states, refining our core workflows through design partnerships with family law firms, mediators, and CDFAs, and adding integrations to the legal tech tools they already use. As we prove retention and unit economics, we will expand to additional states, introduce premium and enterprise tiers, and develop advanced AI assisted modeling and reporting. Longer term, we will scale through channel partnerships, education and certification programs for divorce professionals, and a complementary consumer product that feeds organized cases directly into our professional network. Have you received outside funding? No outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. Our leadership team is gender diverse and comes from different professional and cultural backgrounds, spanning financial planning, divorce practice, AI, and customer experience. One founder brings 20 years in regulated financial services and divorce work, while the other has led product and CX teams in software. We also work with advisors across geographies, ages, and practice types, which helps us design SecureSplit for a wide range of families and firms. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? We design SecureSplit to lower the financial and technical barriers that keep many families from getting quality help. By standardizing the numbers work, we make it easier for smaller, community focused firms and solo mediators to serve clients who have been historically underrepresented or priced out of traditional advice. We are also building a diverse network of testers and advisors, including women led and minority led practices, and we intentionally use plain language, accessible UX, and remote friendly onboarding so a wide range of professionals can participate in and benefit from the legal tech ecosystem. Anything else you’d like us to know? SecureSplit is at a pivotal stage, with a functional beta in use by about 50 professional users and a broader launch ahead. We are actively seeking design partners among family law firms, mediators, and CDFAs who want to modernize the numbers side of divorce. If selected, we will demo live case workflows, share lessons from 20 years in divorce focused financial planning, and show a clear path from spreadsheets to a modern standard for financial disclosures. Company Name Simone. Elevator Pitch Simone Reception is an AI-powered virtual receptionist built exclusively for law offices. It answers every call instantly with a calm, professional, human-like voice, gathers intake and conflict-check information, and routes calls intelligently. Clients call when life happens. Simone will be there to answer. What makes your company unique or innovative? Simone is unique because it is built exclusively for law firms and designed around legal realities, not generic AI use cases. Unlike traditional virtual reception or generic AI voice tools, Simone is purpose-built for legal intake. It understands the structure of law firms, the importance of conflict checks, confidentiality, ethical boundaries, and the difference between a new lead, an existing client, a court, or an opposing party. Simone is not just answering calls. It is executing legal-specific workflows. It gathers structured intake data, captures names for conflict searches, routes urgency intelligently, and integrates directly into tools like Clio and HubSpot so information is immediately usable, not buried in voicemail or transcripts. What makes Simone truly innovative is balance. It delivers 24/7 responsiveness for clients while protecting lawyer focus and wellbeing. Clients get a calm, professional first voice when life happens. Lawyers and their staff get fewer interruptions, better data, and control over when and how humans step in. Finally, Simone improves over time. As a firm evolves, Simone adapts to its language, services, and priorities, becoming a smarter front door rather than a static receptionist. In short, Simone brings enterprise-grade AI capability to small and mid-sized law firms in a way that is ethical, controlled, and deeply practical. What problem does your product solve? Simone solves the problem of missed calls, interrupted work, and poor first impressions in law firms. Legal problems do not arise on a schedule. Clients often call when they are stressed, anxious, or in crisis, and many of those calls happen outside office hours or when staff are unavailable. When calls go to voicemail, firms lose potential clients, create frustration, and miss critical information. At the same time, answering every call pulls lawyers and staff away from higher-value work and contributes to burnout. Research on workplace interruptions shows that when professionals are pulled away from focused work, it takes an average of over 20 minutes to fully regain concentration. In legal practice, where work is complex and high-stakes, frequent call interruptions quietly erode productivity, accuracy, and wellbeing. Simone reduces that hidden cost by answering calls without breaking lawyer focus. Simone solves this by ensuring every call is answered instantly, professionally, and consistently, 24/7. It captures structured intake and conflict-check information, routes urgency appropriately, and integrates directly into firm systems so nothing is lost or delayed. Simone recognizes that every call is not a 1-minute interruption but a 20-minute productivity hit. The result is a better client experience, fewer interruptions for legal teams, improved lead capture, and a calmer, more sustainable way for law firms to stay responsive without being always on. Who are your competitors? AI Reception services (i.e. CasefloodAI), Live Virtual Reception services (i.e. SmithAI, Ruby, LexReception), Generic AI Voice or Call-Handling platforms (i.e. Google Voice, Twilio), and In-House Reception or Voicemail Demo Video URL (if you have one) N/A. When was the company founded? 2025-10-01. Where is the company located? Toronto, Ontario, Canada Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Small, medium and large law firms. Legal Aid and pro bono services. What is the price of your product or service? Starting at $250 per month. Tell us more about your traction Our traction is early, but it is real and practitioner-led. Simone Reception is currently being actively used and tested inside a live law office environment (Evolve Family Law). We are not building this in isolation. It is operating in real conditions, handling real client calls, and being refined based on day-to-day legal workflows. We have validated three key things already: Our immediate traction focus is deliberate. We are prioritizing product quality, ethical guardrails, and legal-specific workflows before scaling sales. The next phase is converting this validated internal use into a structured beta with a small group of law firms, followed by broader commercial rollout. In short, Simone is already proving value inside a real law office, replacing existing paid solutions, and generating strong early demand. We are building on a foundation of real usage, not assumptions. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Our five-year growth plan is deliberate, phased, and grounded in how law firms actually adopt technology. Year 0–1: Product excellence and focused market entry Our priority is to become the best AI receptionist in the legal market, not the fastest-growing generic tool. We will focus on small and mid-sized law firms in Canada and the US, refining Simone Reception through real-world use, structured pilots, and early paying customers. During this phase, we will deepen legal-specific workflows, expand integrations with core legal platforms, and build a reputation for reliability, professionalism, and ethical design. Growth will be steady and intentional, driven by referrals, conferences, and partnerships rather than aggressive sales tactics. Years 1–3: Geographic expansion and platform maturity. Once Simone Reception is proven and stable at scale, we will expand more aggressively across North America, Europe and Australia. This includes deeper US market penetration, multilingual support, and stronger relationships with legal software providers. At this stage, Simone becomes not just a receptionist, but a trusted front door for law firms, handling intake, triage, scheduling, and payments in a way that feels seamless and human. Years 3–4: Product expansion within the Simone ecosystem. With a strong customer base and mature core product, we will expand beyond reception into adjacent AI agents designed specifically for law firms. These may include intake specialists, internal assistants, and client communication agents, all built on the same ethical and legal-first foundation. Existing customers become the primary growth engine, adopting additional Simone products rather than churning to competitors. Years 4–5: Enterprise adoption and global reach. By year five, Simone will be positioned as a category-defining legal AI platform. We will pursue enterprise partnerships with larger firms, legal networks, and professional service providers, while expanding into additional jurisdictions where legal workflows are similar. At this stage, Simone will be deeply embedded into law firm operations, with strong recurring revenue, high retention, and a brand associated with trust, calm, and professionalism. Throughout all five years, our guiding principle remains constant: We grow by solving real problems, protecting lawyer wellbeing, and improving the client experience, not by chasing hype or replacing humans for its own sake. Have you received outside funding? Less than $1M in outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. Our leadership team is diverse in professional background, geography, and perspective, which directly strengthens how we build and grow Simone Reception. Beau Atkins — Legal and Founder Perspective Beau is a practicing family law attorney and CEO of a tech-forward law firm in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. He founded Evolve Family Law with a focus on modern, client-centric legal services and technology integration, and he actively serves on legal innovation and technology committees. This gives Simone deep insights into legal workflows, ethical standards, client anxiety, and the real pain points lawyers and their clients experience with intake and reception. Beau’s lived experience as a lawyer driving process innovation directly informs how Simone is designed to support legal professionals. Sanjay Khandor — Entrepreneurial and Operational Leadership Sanjay brings entrepreneurial and business leadership grounded in technology delivery and growth. Based in Toronto, he has led ventures in digital services and operations, demonstrating success in building and scaling companies. His experience expanding businesses into new markets—including cross-border expansion efforts—enables strategic growth planning for Simone. Av Utukuri — Technical and Product Technology Leadership Av is a seasoned technologist with decades of experience in software and product development across digital systems, hardware, and embedded technologies. His background spans engineering, product strategy, and technology innovation, which positions Simone to deliver a robust, secure, scalable AI platform tailored to legal use cases. Geographic and Professional Diversity The leadership spans multiple regions of Canada, from Alberta to the Greater Toronto Area, bringing different market perspectives. This geographic spread helps Simone understand both regional legal practices and major urban legal tech ecosystems. The team bridges front-line legal practice, entrepreneurial business strategy, and deep technical execution, which is a rare combination in legal tech startups. Diversity of Experience and Perspective We come from distinct professional paths ranging from law practice, technology innovation, and entrepreneurial operations. These differences mean Simone is shaped by varied and multidisciplinary viewpoints, not a single discipline or worldview, and the product is informed by real users (lawyers and clients) and real technical constraints (secure, compliant systems). Each founder contributes a unique lens on problem solving, and that blend produces a more thoughtful, usable, and ethically grounded AI reception product. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? Simone contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community by lowering barriers to access, reducing bias at the first point of contact, and supporting healthier ways of practicing law. First, Simone expands access to legal services by ensuring that every call is answered professionally, regardless of when it comes in. Many people reach out to law firms during moments of stress, crisis, or vulnerability, often outside traditional office hours. By being available 24/7, Simone helps ensure that people who cannot call during business hours are still heard and treated with respect. Second, Simone is designed to reduce bias at the front door of the legal system. Human reception, while valuable, can be influenced by fatigue, assumptions, or unconscious bias. Simone delivers a consistent, calm, and professional experience to every caller, regardless of accent, background, or emotional state. Built-in multilingual and accent support further improves accessibility for clients who may otherwise struggle to communicate clearly or feel understood. Third, Simone supports inclusion within the profession itself. Smaller firms, rural practices, and solo lawyers often lack the resources to provide round-the-clock reception or advanced intake systems. Simone gives these firms access to enterprise-level capabilities without requiring large teams or overhead, helping level the playing field between small and large firms. Finally, Simone contributes to a more sustainable and humane legal tech ecosystem by protecting lawyer and staff wellbeing. By reducing constant interruptions and after-hours pressure, Simone helps create healthier work environments. A more sustainable profession is one that can retain diverse talent over time, rather than burning people out. In short, Simone promotes inclusion by improving access for clients, consistency and fairness at intake, and sustainability for legal professionals, all while being built intentionally for the realities of legal practice. Anything else you’d like us to know? Yes. Simone was built by practitioners, not observers. This product emerged from real frustration inside a working law office and has been shaped through live use, not hypothetical workflows. We are intentionally building slowly and responsibly, with a focus on trust, ethics, and real-world impact rather than hype or speed alone. We believe AI in law should reduce stress, improve access, and support healthier professional lives. Simone is our contribution to that vision, and we are committed to building it thoughtfully, transparently, and in partnership with the legal community. Company Name AutoDox Co., Ltd. Elevator Pitch While everyone builds chatbots, Sonar solves the real pain: formatting. Every lawyer knows the frustration: you inherit a document from a colleague, and spend the next hours fighting with the ruler, restarting numbering for the tenth time, or succumbing to the format painter’s dark arts. Sonar eliminates the pain with one click. Your house styles, applied instantly, perfectly, inside Microsoft Word. What makes your company unique or innovative? (1) Formatting-First Philosophy: Legal Tech goes AI-first. Sonar goes formatting-first. We’re the only legal tech solution that fully automates document formatting end-to-end—the bottleneck everyone feels but nobody addresses. (2) Built Under Constraint, Built to Last: We launched in Thailand with zero legal tech infrastructure, no VC funding, and legal teams operating on razor-thin margins who demanded results from day one – not vague promises of efficiency gains. These constraints forced us to build leaner and smarter than well-funded competitors. What started as a limitation became our edge: enterprise-grade capabilities at a fraction of the cost, designed for real lawyers with real budgets doing real work. What problem does your product solve? (1) The Formatting Bottleneck: Legal work demands perfect formatting, but achieving it manually is brutally time-consuming. Nobody wants to deliver a poorly formatted document to the client, so lawyers spend hours fighting with the numbering ribbon, the ruler, and the format painter, trying to push a paragraph exactly 0.1 inches to the left, or fix that paragraph number that won’t fix itself despite clicking “Restart at 1” fifty times. Unlike knowledge gaps that disproportionately affect juniors, formatting is the great equalizer: it wastes everyone’s time, period. A senior partner at 2 AM before a client deadline faces the same broken numbering as a first-year associate, and there’s no way to delegate it to a secretary or junior. (2) The Broader Workflow Crisis Beyond formatting, legal workflows break down in predictable ways. Junior lawyers doing first-pass redlines without access to the firm’s best precedents. Teams rely on manual error checks that inevitably miss critical issues. Expertise remains trapped in senior lawyers’ experience rather than codified in playbooks anyone can follow. Each inefficiency compounds, turning substantive legal work into administrative chaos. Sonar tackles both problems head-on. First, formatting: we instantly reformat entire documents to match any house style. Second, workflow: our complete suite handles definition tracking, redlines, error checks, playbooks, automations inside Microsoft Word, and an Outlook integration that enables seniors to teach juniors to write professional emails. All of this lives where you work – natively in Word and Outlook. Just open Word, launch Sonar, work smarter. Who are your competitors? Document Formatting: No direct competitors. We’re the only solution that fully automates legal document formatting end-to-end. However, given our broad suite (Word, Outook, Web), we operate in competitive spaces with several established platforms, including: Definitions/Error Checks: Contract Companion (Litera), Definely, LawVu Draft (formerly ClauseBase). AI Drafting/Redlining: Luminance, Litera One, Spellbook, DraftWise, GC AI, and a new one launching every Tuesday. AI Legal Assistant (Legal Research, Workflows, Tabular Reviews): Harvey, Legora, Midpage, DeepJudge. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://youtu.be/HmeX8E8XKSI. When was the company founded? 2023-04-09. Where is the company located? Bangkok, Thailand. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? In-house legal departments of all sizes, small to mid-size law firms What is the price of your product or service? We offer a generous free-forever tier with no credit card required. Paid plans start at $49/month for solo practitioners and scale to $79/month for unlimited usage. Custom enterprise pricing is available for corporate clients and larger teams. Tell us more about your traction. Successful implementations (selection): Law Firm: A leading international law firm in Southeast Asia chose Sonar Legal after evaluating multiple legal tech vendors. In-House: The legal department of Thailand’s largest conglomerate selected Sonar Legal following a comprehensive pilot and evaluation. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. We’re currently a team of seven in Bangkok, with proven traction at both ends of the market. Our next phase focuses on deepening Southeast Asian presence while preparing for international expansion. We’ll grow the team to 20 by the end of 2026, adding dedicated sales and customer success roles to convert our pipeline and support enterprise accounts. Revenue from regional clients will fund controlled expansion into markets with similar pain points: starting with Singapore and Hong Kong, where international firms already recognize the formatting problem. By 2027, we’ll leverage these reference clients to enter the US and UK markets, where legal tech budgets are larger but the core frustration is identical. Have you received outside funding? No outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. Sonar Legal was born diverse. Greek and Thai co-founders, 50% female leadership, team spanning Europe and Southeast Asia with experience in US, EU, and Thai legal systems. Five people, multiple jurisdictions, different legal traditions and cultures shaping everything we build. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? Sonar Legal democratizes access to advanced legal AI through a generous free-forever tier and pricing starting at $49/month. This makes enterprise-level capabilities accessible to solo practitioners, small firms, and underrepresented legal professionals traditionally priced out of premium technology.2. Education & Awareness in Developing Markets. Our founders are actively promoting legal tech adoption in Southeast Asia through guest lectures at ASEAN universities, preparing the next generation of lawyers for an AI-powered legal landscape. Anything else you’d like us to know? N/A. Company Name StreamSettle, Inc. Elevator Pitch We believe that if negotiating parties have a safe place to be reasonable, they will be. StreamSettle is a secure platform that instantly resolves cases by acting as a triple-blind “deal detector.” Both sides confidentially input their true settlement threshold. Our system detects if an overlap exists. If it does, the claim settles automatically at the midpoint. If no overlap, the data remains hidden, and no fees are charged, making StreamSettle truly risk-free for both sides. What makes your company unique or innovative? What problem does your product solve? The core problem is that offers and demands are unreliable data points. In an effort to gain leverage, both sides routinely exaggerate their positions. They then rely on this flawed data to answer a critical question: “Can this case settle?” When the gap between these postured numbers is wide, parties falsely conclude they are “too far apart.” This forces them into years of costly, unnecessary litigation to reach a settlement result that likely existed from the start. It is a classic case of “garbage in, garbage out” – bad data drives efficient markets into expensive gridlock. Who are your competitors? Direct Competitors (Automated Negotiation): Indirect Competitors: Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex6EHDV-l0U. When was the company founded? 2022-10-29. Where is the company located? Cypress, Tex. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? We target a two-sided market: 1. The “Demand” Side: Plaintiff law firms. These range from large “billboard” firms with thousands of active files to mid-sized litigation boutiques and solo firms. These firms are motivated by cash flow velocity and reducing their own overhead costs per case. 2. The “Supply” Side: Insurers & Defense law firms: We target Claims Directors cutting LAE, and forward-thinking Defense Partners who differentiate themselves by offering clients (insurers or self-insured businesses) speedy, efficient resolution. What is the price of your product or service? We operate on a Risk-Free Success Fee model. We charge a fee only if a settlement is reached on the platform. Fee: 1% of the total settlement amount per party. Cap: Maximum fee of $1,000 per party ($2,000 total per case). We plan to raise the cap as we scale, except for our early adopters. No Upfront Costs: There are no subscription fees, setup costs, or charges for testing thresholds that do not result in a deal. Tell us more about your traction. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Years 1-2: The Texas Beachhead (Density Phase): Year 3: Product Expansion (Stickiness Phase): Years 4-5: National Scale (Expansion Phase): Have you received outside funding? Less than $1M in outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. StreamSettle is proudly woman-co-founded and led (Chrysa Jones, COO) and veteran-founded (Joe Jones, CEO, Marine Corps Veteran). Beyond the founders, we have intentionally built a diverse Advisory Board to ensure our product serves the entire legal community. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? Anything else you’d like us to know? We are not just a software company; we are building the settlement infrastructure of the future. Beyond our direct users, we are actively pursuing pilots with major court systems to deploy StreamSettle as a docket-clearing solution. By identifying settleable cases before they consume judicial resources, we aim to drastically reduce the overwhelming backlogs that paralyze our courts, freeing up judges to focus on complex litigation. Our true mission is to reduce the human toll of the process. By removing adversarial friction from routine claims, we allow injured parties to receive fair compensation months faster. We are live, generating revenue, and executing a density strategy that is proving the model works. We would be honored to showcase this at the ABA TECHSHOW. Company Name Trailmate Elevator Pitch Trailmate is the first client-facing AI agent built for law firms – a digital employee designed to handle client-facing work end to end. Lawyers tell Trailmate what they need done (run intake, collect documents, gather discovery responses, give case updates, etc.), and Trailmate turns that request into action – contacting clients and following up autonomously until the task is complete. Firms supervise progress and results in real time, without chasing clients or adding staff. What makes your company unique or innovative? Trailmate is unique because it is not just a chatbot or workflow tool. It is an outward-facing digital employee that actually engages clients autonomously. Lawyers delegate an objective in plain English, and Trailmate autonomously contacts clients, conducts structured conversations, follows up until tasks are complete, validates the results, and escalates only when human judgment is needed. This “delegate and supervise” model creates a new category in legal tech: AI as a digital employee, not software. What problem does your product solve? Trailmate solves one of the most persistent and costly problems in law firms: client-facing work that requires constant chasing, follow-up, and coordination. Intake, document collection, discovery responses, status updates, and other routine communications are repetitive, often deadline-sensitive, and highly dependent on client responsiveness, yet they consume enormous staff time and routinely stall matters. Who are your competitors? Our closest points of comparison are Case Status and Hona, which are modern client communication and portal tools. However, these products are fundamentally passive: they surface information to clients but still rely on firm staff to drive follow-up, collect documents, and move matters forward. Trailmate operates in a different category. It is not a client portal or messaging layer. It is an outward-facing AI agent that executes client-facing work end to end. There is no direct equivalent to this “delegate and supervise” digital-employee model in the legal market today. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://vimeo.com/1152280813 When was the company founded? 2025-06-12. Where is the company located? Woodland Hills, Calif. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Small to medium size law firms with consumer clients (particularly plaintiff-side firms in areas like employment, personal injury, immigration, family law, and consumer law) What is the price of your product or service? Trailmate is sold as a subscription, priced based on the number of active matters and the volume of client-facing work handled by the AI agent. Contracts range from $1,000 per month to $5,000 per month or more, depending on the firm’s volume. Tell us more about your traction. Trailmate is currently in stealth, with a public launch scheduled for January 13, 2026. To date, we have several law firms actively piloting the platform and additional firms in the pipeline that have expressed strong interest and are queued for onboarding post-launch. We have been running Trailmate in production within my own firm, Frontier Law Center, as a design-partner environment. In that setting alone, Trailmate has already conducted 100+ hours of active client conversations, autonomously collected over 1,100 client documents, and completed more than 350 distinct client-facing tasks on behalf of the firm. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Over the next five years, Trailmate’s growth plan is centered on category creation, disciplined expansion, and deep integration into how law firms operate. We will begin by converting our current pilots into paying customers immediately following our January 2026 launch, while onboarding additional early adopters through founder-led sales and partnerships with legal-tech platforms. Shortly after launch, we plan to raise a pre-seed round to accelerate product development, integrations, and go-to-market execution. Trailmate has been fully bootstrapped to date, with product-market validation driven by real usage inside my own law firm. As a domain-expert founder and recognized thought leader in legal AI, I am well connected with both forward-thinking law firms and complementary legal-tech vendors. I plan to leverage these relationships, in addition to traditional advertising / marketing efforts. Have you received outside funding? No outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. I was born in the Philippines and came to the U.S. when I was 3 (half Filipino) and my co-founder is Indian. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? Trailmate is committed to building a diverse and inclusive legal tech community by intentionally hiring with diversity in mind as we grow. We believe assembling a team with varied backgrounds and perspectives leads to better products, a broader worldview, and technology that serves a wider range of law firms and clients more effectively. Anything else you’d like us to know? I am a very early design partner with Eve. We were featured as one of the first law firms to coin the term “AI-Native Law Firm” – https://www.legaltech-talk.com/frontier-law-center-taps-eve-to-become-the-first-ai-native-law-firm/ Company Name TwinCounsel, Inc. Elevator Pitch TwinCounsel is an AI delegation platform for solo and small law firms. Our AI teammate lives in the lawyer’s inbox, automatically building case context from emails and attachments. Lawyers delegate tasks like drafting subpoenas or financial disclosures in plain English – just by replying to an email. Every fact is auditable with source citations. We’ve proven 90% time savings, cutting 90-minute tasks to nine minutes. What makes your company unique or innovative? We solve the context problem that blocks AI adoption in legal. Most legal AI tools are “bring-your-own-context” – they are blank slates that require manual input before they can help. TwinCounsel is different. We automatically build structured case knowledge from the lawyer’s inbox – extracting parties, timelines, facts, deadlines, and documents without any data entry. This organized case intelligence is what makes trusted AI delegation possible. Three differentiators: (1) Inbox-native – we live where lawyers already work, eliminating adoption friction; (2) Automatic case context – our system understands the matter before the lawyer asks for help; (3) Auditable outputs – every generated fact links back to its source, solving lawyers’ #1 trust barrier. What problem does your product solve? Solo lawyers lose over 60% of their day to administrative chaos. Critical case facts are buried across 50-300 emails per matter – scattered in threads, attachments, and forwarded documents. Before lawyers can do actual legal work, they’re forced to manually hunt, organize, and re-type information. This “context gap” causes missed facts, missed deadlines, malpractice exposure, and the painful reality of working 8 hours but billing for only 3. Existing tools don’t solve this. Practice management software requires manual data entry – it’s the source of administrative work, not the solution. Generic AI tools are “blank slates” that require lawyers to copy-paste sensitive client data and provide context for every task. Neither approach gives AI what it needs to actually help: deep, organized knowledge of the case. Who are your competitors? 1) Incumbent practice management systems: Clio, MyCase (reactive dashboards requiring manual data entry) 2) AI-native point solutions: CoCounsel (Thomson Reuters), Spellbook, Gavel Exec (bring-your-own-context tools with no systemic case knowledge) 3) Generic AI chatbots: ChatGPT, Claude (high-friction copy-paste workflows with confidentiality risks) Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://www.loom.com/share/525e13a6982848539308722214b7031d. When was the company founded? 2025-05-17. Where is the company located? San Jose, Calif. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Solo and small law firm attorneys (1-10 attorneys), initially focused on family law, criminal law, and estates/private client practices. What is the price of your product or service? TBD: Subscription fee, tiered by number of matters. Tell us more about your traction Pre-revenue, but we’ve validated the core thesis hands-on. We embedded ourselves for two months inside a San Jose family/criminal law firm, running a “Concierge MVP” where we manually did the work our software will automate. This proved three things: 1) We can build a 360-degree view of a case from email. By assembling context from scattered emails, attachments, and threads, we created the organized case knowledge that makes accurate AI outputs possible. 2) Context + AI done right = highly accurate work. With proper case context, our AI-generated drafts were more accurate than the firm’s paralegal – and verifiable back to source documents. 3) 90% time savings are real and repeatable. Financial disclosures dropped from 90 minutes to 9. Routine court filings from 60 minutes to 6. We’re now expanding our design partner program across practice areas (workflows): our original criminal/family law partner (subpoenas, financial disclosures), personal injury (demand letters), and estates (discovery responses). The workflows differ but the pattern holds – scattered inbox context transformed into accurate, cited drafts. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Year 1: Win the beachhead. Convert design partners to paying customers, ship self-serve onboarding, and integrate with core tools lawyers already use (Clio, Google Workspace, Microsoft 365). Prove that we can turn inbox chaos into organized case intelligence that powers trusted AI delegation. Year 2: Expand across practice areas (family → criminal → estates → immigration → plaintiff PI) and scale to 500+ solo and small-firm users. Deepen integrations so TwinCounsel becomes the connective layer between a firm’s scattered tools—the AI that finally makes their existing software work together. Years 3-5: Become the AI orchestration layer for the small law firm ecosystem. Our structured case knowledge—automatically built from email, documents, and connected systems—becomes the foundation that powers increasingly autonomous workflows. We capture a meaningful share of the $60B legal support market by replacing manual administrative work with intelligent delegation. Have you received outside funding? Less than $1M in outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. Our founding team bridges three continents. Josh Dorward (CEO) is a dual U.S.-Taiwan citizen who spent the past year in Taiwan connecting with the local startup ecosystem; we’re building our core engineering team there. Kenji Hashimoto (CTO) holds triple citizenship – Japan, U.K. and U.S. – bringing a global perspective to our technical leadership. Together we combine Silicon Valley startup experience with deep ties to Asian engineering talent and international markets. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? As an early-stage company, we’re just beginning to engage with the legal tech community. Our approach to team-building is intentionally global – we’re hiring our founding engineering team in Taiwan rather than defaulting to Silicon Valley, bringing geographic and cultural diversity into legal tech from day one. As we grow, we’re committed to maintaining this global perspective in our hiring and community participation. Anything else you’d like us to know? We’re YC S17 alumni with a prior exit (Indivio acquired by Cloudinary). This is the same proven founding team reuniting with perfect founder-market fit: Josh brings legal domain expertise (licensed CA attorney, JD/MBA) plus AI product leadership (Cloudinary GM); Kenji brings 10+ years of automation/AI systems architecture. We’re not theorizing – we’ve validated workflows inside a real firm and proven 10x efficiency gains. Company Name LMI Network LLC Elevator Pitch In an online world where AI algorithms polarize and divide, ZODR (pronounced Zoe-D-R) promotes conflict resolution using AI to help mediators resolve legal disputes between parties. Since most mediators use Zoom, a tool that is also installed on millions of potential mediation parties’ devices, ZODR, through its Zoom integration, gives mediators 1 hub to manage their mediation cases, and after all parties’ give consent to the AI “listening in,” lets mediators get AI recommendations on how to resolve the dispute. What makes your company unique or innovative? ZODR differs from standard case management software and generic use of Zoom for mediation in three ways: What problem does your product solve? Since the shift to online dispute resolution (ODR) after the pandemic’s “zoom boom,” and the explosion of AI legal tools after the 2022 public launch of ChatGPT, conflict resolution professionals are still figuring out how to administer an online mediation practice that incorporates AI and scale it on the web in an era where physical borders no longer matter. While the digital world moves instantly, mediators and arbitrators still spend manual time incorporating AI, chasing emails, scheduling across time zones, and drafting routine settlement clauses from scratch, all as part of their workflow. This friction delays justice and limits the number of clients a professional can serve. ZODR presents an intuitive platform that incorporates optional AI into the mediation session, and helps the conflict resolution professional manage all their matters in kanban-style birds-eye views. Additionally, ZODR addresses the fragmented workflows of the past where sensitive case data is scattered across Zoom, email, and Word documents, creating security risks and breaking the mediator’s flow. ZODR brings order by helping mediators actively manage the lifecycle of the dispute from intake to signed agreement, all with the help of an AI co-mediator. Who are your competitors? Some competitioners in the ODR space include: ODR.com, ADRNotable, Immediation, Next Level Mediation. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://youtu.be/BALex6b2FTk. When was the company founded? 2025-05-31. Where is the company located? Houston, Tex. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Our primary users are private mediators, arbitrators, and boutique dispute resolution firms. Our secondary market includes court-annexed mediation programs and ombuds offices looking to streamline high-volume case management. What is the price of your product or service? $29.99 per seat per month after a 14-day free trial, but discounted on an annual basis and for larger organizations. Tell us more about your traction. Since evolving the “Instant Mediators” community into the LMI Professionals (pros.lminetwork.com) list of online mediators, we have a subscriber base that will be the first to experience ZODR alongside others who have signed up for the wait list. More data will be available soon as we make ZODR fully operational to the general public. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. First, we are not starting from zero since ZODR is part of the LMI Network (lminetwork.com); We are looking to convert the existing user base of LMI “Professionals” (pros.lminetwork.com) (formerly InstantMediators.com). Additionally, we are leveraging the “Justice Sites” (justicesites.com) initiative (launching 2026) to bundle high-performance lawyer and mediator websites with a ZODR subscription. This creates a “sticky” ecosystem where a mediator’s marketing (website) and operations (ZODR) are unified so we can sell a complete “virtual practice” to online mediators. Lastly, we own the LMI Network YouTube channel (YouTube.com/@lminetwork) and podcast (lmipodcast.com), which provides an existing outlet for marketing ZODR features and capabilities in video format. The channel lets us host media content, engage with users, and deliver support tips via video on a ZODR videos playlist. By year 2, we plan to then expand from individual practitioners to small firms and court-annexed mediation programs or community mediation offices. We believe there’s a market for larger high-volume mediation organizations who want to develop their online dispute resolution presence and handle disputes at scale across multiple jurisdictions. This would be most advantageous to family and small claims mediation organizations. By year 3, we want to focus on growing internationally across several markets and expand in multiple languages. AI’s ability to translate/interpret conversations in real time lowers the costs once associated with multilingual dispute resolution. Now mediators around the world can use ZODR to mediate with residents who not only reside outside their jurisdictions, but who also speak a different language. ODR is a worldwide phenomenon because all societies have conflicts and most adults globally now have a full mediation office in their pockets called Zoom. ZODR leverages these 2 facts in order to promote access to justice. Have you received outside funding? No outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. ZODR is a minority-owned business, founded by a first-generation immigrant lawyer and mediator who believes in the American Dream. Mac Pierre-Louis’ cross-border perspective ensures the platform is designed for global jurisdictional compatibility and will drive the mission of democratizing access to justice by making dispute resolution accessible to anyone who can use Zoom for mediation. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? In addition to the above where ZODR is a minority-founded company led by a Black male attorney-mediator and first-generation American residing in Texas, ZODR has hired a Bangladesh-origin development firm, headquartered in Wyoming. This cross-border and diverse leadership ensures our product design avoids the “US-centric/English-only” bias often found in many legal tech. Additionally, we promote access to justice. ZODR is about lowering the cost of dispute resolution by helping mediators run and manage their practices online with the assistance of AI. Traditional litigation is expensive and intimidating; ZODR’s efficiency tools allow mediators to handle lower-value cases profitably. This indirectly empowers underserved communities—who can be encouraged to use Zoom for mediation since they often cannot afford to take time off work to travel to a physical courthouse. ZODR gives the mediator a platform to run and manage their Zoom mediation so that disputing parties can access justice from their mobile devices. Anything else you’d like us to know? While it’s great to disrupt industries and change paradigms to make products better and increase value, we are mindful that in the legal field, innovation will also be measured by how much chaos or stability the innovation brings. Therefore, ZODR is not trying to replace mediators or just outsource legal disputes to AI. ZODR brings the focus back to the human neutral in the middle by augmenting their skills so they can help other people. Human-based conflict resolution will remain the focus of our work.

Title: BlackRock to slash hundreds of jobs — latest Wall Street biz to kick off 2026 with firings
URL: https://nypost.com/2026/01/13/business/blackrock-to-slash-hundreds-of-jobs-latest-wall-street-biz-to-kick-off-2026-with-firings/
Time Published: 2026-01-13T15:39:23Z
Full Content:
BlackRock is reportedly slashing hundreds of jobs across the company, making it the latest Wall Street giant to start the New Year with sweeping layoffs. The world’s largest asset manager plans to cut 250 jobs, or roughly 1% of its global headcount, across its investment and sales teams, sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. It’s unclear when the layoffs may take place or what is the driving force behind them, though rival banks and asset managers have linked job cuts at their own businesses to restructuring, cost-cutting, artificial intelligence and economic uncertainty. CitiGroup is set to axe about 1,000 jobs this week and UBS Group AG is planning a round of layoffs this month, with another round later this year, according to Bloomberg. A BlackRock spokesperson cast the company’s layoffs as a bid to become more efficient. “Improving BlackRock is a constant priority,” the spokesperson told Bloomberg. “Each year, we make decisions to ensure that our resources are aligned with our objectives and that we are well positioned to serve clients today and in the future.” Shares in the asset management firm – which recorded roughly $13.5 trillion in assets at the end of September – fell roughly 1% Tuesday. BlackRock declined to comment to The Post. The company, which has about 24,600 employees, led two rounds of layoffs last year, each time slashing roughly 1% of its workforce. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has been looking to lead the company deeper into alternative investments. The firm closed a $12 billion acquisition of alternative credit manager HPS Investment Partners in July. Since then, it has been integrating new executives and readying a new range of funds for investors. In its 2026 investment outlook, BlackRock said it will focus on investment themes such as artificial intelligence, income and diversification. “The first is really what are the biggest growth opportunities in the market today,” Jay Jacobs, BlackRock’s head of equity exchange-traded funds, told CNBC’s “ETF Edge” last week. “Where you have to get laser focused to try and find some of these targeted exposures, like artificial intelligence, that could do very well in this environment.” Sign up to receive On The Money by Charlie Gasparino in your inbox every Thursday. Please provide a valid email. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Never miss a story. The firm still sees artificial intelligence as a long-term, capital intensive investment cycle, and doesn’t believe it’s dying down anytime soon, Jacobs said. BlackRock is one of the few companies that offers specialized AI-focused funds, like its Tech Active ETF that has amassed more than $8 billion in assets. Income is another major focus this year because BlackRock expects the Federal Reserve to slash interest rates again, a move that would pressure yields on cash investments, Jacobs said. Diversification is the third focus in BlackRock’s annual report because investors are looking for new assets. “Where can you really get diversification for your portfolio?” he told CNBC. “Something that’s going to behave differently from stocks and bonds.” The company is set to report its fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday.

Title: 'Big Short' investor Michael Burry explains why he's betting against Nvidia, not Meta or Microsoft

Michael Burry says he's betting against Nvidia instead of Meta, Alphabet, or Microsoft because the chipmaker is particularly vulnerable to the AI boom ending in disaster. Nvidia is "simply the purest play," Burry wrote in a Substack post last weekend. The company has become "entirely dependent on hyperscaler spending, and I do not see how that math works," he continued. The investor of "The Big Short" fame, who pivoted from running a hedge fund to writing online late last year, added that Nvidia is likely to "sell $400 billion of its chips this year and there are less than $100 billion in application layer use cases." "Nvidia also is the most loved, and least doubted," Burry wrote. "So shorting it is cheap." Burry also name-checked CoreWeave, a provider of cloud services built for AI and a strategic partner of Nvidia, calling it the graphics-processor giant's "pet."

Nvidia's stock price has surged 12-fold since the start of 2023, making the graphics-chip maker the world's most valuable public company with a $4.5 trillion market capitalization. Nvidia did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Burry said that betting against Meta would mean he was "also shorting its social media/advertising dominance," and placing a wager against Alphabet would mean he was "shorting Google Search in all its forms, Android, Waymo, etc." He added that being short Microsoft would be tantamount to "shorting a global office productivity SaaS goliath," referring to the company's software-as-a-service tools, including Word and Excel. Those Big Tech titans aren't "pure shorts on AI" and have staying power, Burry wrote. "They will realize they should not be spending so much, write off assets, and possibly restate earnings," he said. "But they still are dominant companies globally away from the AI buildout." On the other hand, Burry said he would short OpenAI if it were a public company. He highlighted the ChatGPT maker's $500 billion valuation in October, which exceeds the market values of Johnson & Johnson, Bank of America, and Costco. Burry said he owns bearish put options on Oracle, and directly shorted the database company in the last six months. "I do not like how it is positioned or the investments it is making," he wrote, adding that the company, cofounded by tech billionaire Larry Ellison, is making unnecessary, inexplicable moves and "ego" might be the driver. Burry is famous for predicting and profiting from the collapse of the mid-2000s housing bubble, an episode of his career that was chronicled in the book and movie "The Big Short." He wrote on Substack that "technological obsolescence is on the menu as Nvidia now seems to introduce a new chip solution every year or less." That echoed a previous post in which he said Nvidia's Big Tech customers were overstating the lifespan of its chips to drag out their depreciation and flatter their short-term profits, raising the prospect of future writedowns. Burry also warned of trouble ahead, saying he's betting against AI stocks to "have the exposure on the right side when the music stops." Burry spoke about AI more broadly in his post, drawing a parallel between its rise and the history of electricity. He pointed out that building power plants and grids in the late 1980s and early 1990s required "massive upfront capital outlays," technological advances meant equipment such as transformers became quickly outdated and assets rapidly depreciated, and "cutthroat price warfare" between suppliers meant many ran into financial difficulties and were forced to merge with rivals. "What I see in electrification is very similar to what happened during the 2000 data transmission bubble and what I see happening with the AI bubble," he wrote. Burry said that electricity was as transformative to the modern world as a medicine that enables a patient to walk 10 feet, whereas AI "might be the anabolic steroid that allows superhuman feats of strength and ability," but could ultimately prove "more dangerous than anything." He also repeated his caution that if the US tries to win the AI race by going all-in on increasingly power-hungry chips, it will lose as China is ramping up its power-generation capacity much more quickly. "I see a big inventory problem in the AI buildout as a result of the current power generation setup," Burry said. Jump to

Title: Franklin Templeton retrofits money market funds for tokenized stablecoin market

Franklin Templeton is amending institutional money market funds to support stablecoin reserves and onchain cash use without launching new crypto-native products. Cointelegraph in your social feed Franklin Templeton has amended two Western Asset institutional money market funds (MMFs) to plug directly into the emerging US stablecoin regime and tokenized cash infrastructure rather than launching new crypto native products. According to a release shared with Cointelegraph, Franklin Templeton is adapting the two long‑running Western Asset institutional funds so they can be used more directly in US GENIUS‑aligned stablecoin reserve structures and blockchain‑enabled distribution channels, without changing their status as Securities and Exchange Commission‑registered 2a‑7 MMFs. The changes are designed to allow the funds to serve as regulated, government-backed collateral for payment stablecoins and other tokenized cash uses without altering their core regulatory status. ​Franklin Templeton’s Western Asset Institutional Treasury Obligations Fund (LUIXX) invests exclusively in short‑term US government obligations and is structured to be compatible with GENIUS Act reserve requirements, positioning it as plug‑and‑play infrastructure for payment stablecoin treasuries and bank‑style issuers that need SEC‑registered, government‑only collateral. Its Western Asset Institutional Treasury Reserves Fund (DIGXX), on the other hand, has added a blockchain‑enabled “Digital Institutional” share class on top of its existing 2a‑7 structure, intended to make it usable as 24/7, onchain collateral and cash management for tokenization platforms, custodians and broker‑dealers that want digital rails without moving into an unregistered vehicle. Related: XRP jumps 8% as Franklin Templeton, Grayscale ETFs begin trading Roger Bayston, head of digital assets at Franklin Templeton, told Cointelegraph that the company expects stablecoin reserves to be managed “in both tokenized and more traditional form,” and sees room for both exclusive and multi‑manager mandates as more financial institutions launch their own tokens. He said that several “significant products in the stablecoin market” are “backed by traditional high-quality short-term issuance through non-digitally native product structures,” including the recently launched FRNT stablecoin in the State of Wyoming, and the company sees opportunities to help such partners through its investment management expertise. Franklin Templeton’s role, he said, is to manage reserves “in the product model [clients] prefer,” whether via bespoke portfolios or open‑end mutual funds. Bayston cast the amendments as incremental rather than experimental, noting that Western Asset’s institutional Treasury fund only needed “relatively minor adjustments” to sit inside the GENIUS framework and complement Franklin Templeton’s existing onchain products. In his view, many large clients still want familiar, SEC‑registered 2a‑7 wrappers as they plug into onchain distribution and collateral systems, so the company is extending a digital stack across a broader liquidity “suite” instead of forcing migration to new vehicles. Related: Franklin Templeton expands Benji tokenization platform to Canton Network ​Rather than tying the new digital share class to a single collateral or tokenization platform, Franklin Templeton plans to support access through multiple “trusted partners” as banks, broker‑dealers and other intermediaries roll out their own blockchain‑enabled frontends. Franklin Templeton is not alone in repositioning money funds for stablecoin reserves under the GENIUS Act. BlackRock announced plans to modify a Treasury money market fund in October 2025, aimed at serving as an authorized reserve asset for US stablecoin issuers, tightening its investment mandate to short‑dated Treasurys and overnight repo (short‑term, secured funding), to align with the new federal framework. BlackRock was already managing a bespoke government MMF for Circle’s USDC reserves, as large asset managers increasingly see regulated cash funds as backend rails for tokenized dollars rather than purely retail cash products.

January 13, 2026 8:30am by Barry Ritholtz The transcript from this week’s, MiB: Ben Hunt, co-founder Perscient, is below. You can stream and download our full conversation, including any podcast extras, on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, and Bloomberg. All of our earlier podcasts on your favorite pod hosts can be found here. ~~~ Bloomberg Audio Studios, podcasts, radio News. This is Masters in business with Barry Riol on Bloomberg Radio Barry Ritholtz: On the latest Masters in Business podcast. What a fascinating conversation. I sit down with Ben Hunt, he writes Epsilon Theory, but he is also the president and co-founder of Persuent. What a fascinating analytic story they’ve put together. They essentially take feeds of everything that’s published around the world, whether it’s in English or Chinese or Russian. They create these large language models and use artificial intelligence to identify rising narratives. In other words, they’re looking for the things that will become storylines, but haven’t quite hit that yet. I I found this conversation to be absolutely fascinating, and I think you will also, with no further ado, my conversation with Persuent Ben Hunt. Ben Hunt, welcome to Bloomberg. Ben Hunt: Thanks for having me. Barry Ritholtz: This is long. time coming Ben Hunt: I love the intro. I gotta have you at all my events. It’s fantastic. Barry Ritholtz: That’s right. I’m available for hire. I can introduce you at, at weddings bar Mitzvahs. Wherever you’re giving a toast, I’ll be happy to tee you up. This is long overdue. I’ve followed your work for so long. I’m fascinated by both what you put out in your blog, Epsilon Theory, thank you, and which is now a blog and a newsletter and, and the work you do at persuent. We’re going to get to that stuff, but before we do, I gotta ask PhD from Harvard. You were a tenured political science professor. Was academia the original career plan? Ben Hunt: You know, it’s interesting, Barry. So I, academia was always a, I’ll call it a, a way station for me. It ended up being Barry Ritholtz: A 10 year way station? Ben Hunt: 10 years plus grad school. Barry Ritholtz: That’s a little more than a way station. I Ben Hunt: A little more than a waste station. But I bet this will be familiar for a lot of your listeners. I always had an entrepreneurial bug. You know, I started my first company when I was in grad school, started another one when I was, when I was a professor. And as I know, you know, a lot of your listeners, viewers know, it is, it is a bug. It’s not a feature. Barry Ritholtz: Yes, for sure. Ben Hunt: You can’t help yourself. And academia is not the place to be an aca, Barry Ritholtz: So let me ask you a question about that. Ben Hunt: An academia for sure. So I know why I’ve started a series of companies. I can’t work for other people. Why, why did you have that bug? What, what motivated you to say, I gotta get this out into the world? Barry Ritholtz: I love playing games and solving problems. I have a similar issue about working for other people, which fortunately, academia solves that to a large degree. I mean, you, you are working on your own stuff. You follow your own intellectual bliss in a way that I’ve really never rediscovered. The the problem with academia, of course, is, you know, it’s very, very low stakes. That’s why the academic fights are so vicious, because Ben Hunt: There’s nothing at stake. Right, right. And, and that that is actually true. That’s actually true. And, and so you learn survival techniques and that kind of jungle where nothing is really at stake, at least monetarily, because the, the goal of any sort of academia conference or presentation, like, is to appear smart. Right? It’s not to actually be smart. You’re not actually listening to a presentation to listen to it. What you learn to do is you’re listening to the presentation the whole time. You’re trying to calculate your head. What’s the most devastating question I can ask? 00:04:07 [Speaker Changed] So you’re gonna rock this guy back on his heels with a devastating, a 00:04:11 [Speaker Changed] Devastating question. And boy, that gets old after a while, Barry, I gotta tell you. Yeah. It, it really does. I, I loved the teaching. I loved the, the research. ’cause like I say, nobody tells you what to work on, but the, the church of academia, the, the actual institution of academia, a it’s for the birds, even back when I was doing it. Right. And I think it’s gotten significantly worse. 00:04:40 [Speaker Changed] I can imagine. I can imagine what’s happening with that. So, but the question that this leads me to is, yeah, you’ve had all these jobs within the world of finance. How did your background in academia shape how you view investing? Risk management allocation? 00:04:57 [Speaker Changed] Barry, starting from academia and then getting into our business of investing, I think it was the best thing that could have happened for me for when I got into it, which was kind of later in life, right? Same, same. You know, after I left academia finally to start a software company. And it, after we sold that software company Yeah. A, a a buddy of mine that I think this happens a lot. A buddy of, you know, you have a buddy who’s in the 00:05:29 [Speaker Changed] Business, Hey, you seem to be pretty smart. How would you like to apply this to 00:05:32 [Speaker Changed] This? We’re always, we’re always talking about company X or technology Y why don’t, you know, why don’t you come in? Let’s, let’s give this a try. So that was my path, if you want to call it a path. And what really sold me on it was that markets, it’s the biggest game in the world 00:05:52 [Speaker Changed] For sure. 00:05:54 [Speaker Changed] And like I say, I’m a game player. I love games 00:05:57 [Speaker Changed] And a game theorist. Let’s, let’s, let’s work down that. 00:06:00 [Speaker Changed] Well, I, I don’t like to talk about that because, you know, because the, 00:06:03 [Speaker Changed] The real game theorists get angry. 00:06:05 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Well, yes. And, and, and I, I understand I am a real one because that was, that was my field for a while. And it’s a real field and it’s a real thing. But it’s been so trivialized when some talking head will come on. Well, let’s look at the game theory of this. Right? And you just want to just, you know, right. Shoot yourself when somebody does this. 00:06:25 [Speaker Changed] So, so the other part of your research, the other part of your academic focus was on narrative theory. And so let’s talk about how did that focus develop? And, and we will talk a little later about what you do today at Persuent with the narrative machine. But what, and 00:06:46 [Speaker Changed] Believe it or not, believe it or not, it all ties together. I, 00:06:48 [Speaker Changed] I doesn’t don’t doubt that for a second. And, 00:06:50 [Speaker Changed] And it’s 00:06:51 [Speaker Changed] What initially led you down that rabbit hole. 00:06:54 [Speaker Changed] When we think about kind of who’s been an influence on you in your, in your life, had a very influential undergrad professor in political science. And then I had a very influential graduate advisor. Again, they don’t call it political science in, up at, up at Harvard. They call it government or something. Right? Something like that. But, but it’s political science. And, and the reason I say they were influential is that they really got me focused on the science side of political science 00:07:30 And that science side. Yes. It’s kind of some of the typical terrible stuff you see in all social sciences, like economics, where, you know, you’ve gotta learn how to deal with structured data. Right. And, and there was, there was a lot to learn. And I, it’s, it’s worth talking about because I see the same mistakes being made over and over again by people in our business who want to try to, well, you know, apply math to data and, and there are some real pitfalls and some, some real intellectual capital I think that you can achieve within academia that you can then bring in and apply to the, the, the investment world. What, 00:08:20 [Speaker Changed] What we’ve certainly seen amongst the quants, a very successful application of math theory to data. The, in fact, some of the best performing hedge funds are quantitatively driven. That’s not where you’re going. 00:08:37 [Speaker Changed] Well, it’s, it’s part of where I’m going. Right? So, so there, there, there’s a transition in all of all of the sciences, honestly, but certainly the, the social sciences where, where, yes, you start with numbers, structured numbers, right. Price over time, you know, things you can calculate and measure as those numbers. But what was clear immediately in politics, and I think has become increasingly clear in the world of investing, is that it’s not just the numbers that you get on your Bloomberg terminal, it’s also the words and the stories and the narratives that are told to us. Politicians have known this forever, right? So the story of politics is the story of people suggesting laws or policies and then having to present it in a way that gets them elected or keeps them in power or whatever that is. So there’s always been a focus, I’ll say more of a focus in political science than in economics with words. Economics is almost seen as a, as a sideline. Right? It, it’s somehow lesser than the numbers. Right. So what, what I was kind of early on was applying the same techniques that we have for understanding, you know, matrices and structured data, but applying it to unstructured data, which, you know, full circle, this is at the heart of all of the generative AI and the, the AI that we have today. 00:10:28 [Speaker Changed] Well, you’re, you’re getting way ahead of me now with generative ai. We’ll circle back to that. Yeah. But, but 00:10:32 [Speaker Changed] It’s all the, the math has not changed. Right. In 35 years since I started working with network math around unstructured data. I mean, we, we didn’t call it natural language processing back then, and we didn’t call it, you know, large language modeling, but that’s exactly what we were doing. 00:10:53 [Speaker Changed] So what was, what was the moment or the catalyst for you to say, Hey, I’m working in all these other areas, but the narratives continue to pop up over and over again on all sorts of different data sets. And I think in the financial markets, I can use a, a novel approach to identifying narratives and anticipate where the market’s going. What, what led to that sort of in insight, 00:11:25 [Speaker Changed] Not the, not the Great Recession, right? But the aftermath, 00:11:30 [Speaker Changed] Meaning the 2010s following the great financial crisis, 00:11:34 [Speaker Changed] Starting in, in, in 2009, and the recovery that we had out of 2009, and in particular when Win Ben Berke and the Federal Reserve move towards a very explicit effort to use their words to impact markets. 00:11:53 [Speaker Changed] So let’s talk a little bit about that. ’cause I have some really specific memories of the low, of the, the runup afterwards, all the noise Yeah. That was going on. Some of the phrases that have come out of that era, like financial repression and other such things are, are just the tip of the narrative iceberg. So, so walk us through your insight. It’s 2009. Yep. The market bottoms really kind of a v bottom and took off from that. What was that, March 9th, March 7th, something like that. Yep. Oh nine. And there was no turning back. What were you seeing? How were you integrating that into a concept of let’s identify narratives in order to anticipate market moves? Well, 00:12:47 [Speaker Changed] So I was co-founded a, a long short fund inside of a, a larger asset manager going back in oh five and oh 5, 0 6, 0 7. We did well, like everyone else did. Well. And then in oh eight we did great. 00:13:08 [Speaker Changed] Really? In oh eight, we did great. Oh eight, I think I wanna say s and p down 37% something. Yeah. We 00:13:12 [Speaker Changed] Were up 20 something net. 00:13:14 [Speaker Changed] Anything in the green, not in the red is 00:13:16 [Speaker Changed] Smith. Yeah. Amazing. And, and now I’ll tell you, and we can come back to this, like, the real question you should ask is that given what we believed, why wasn’t, why weren’t we up 40%? That, that’s actually, that, that’s actually a question you can ask. But 00:13:33 [Speaker Changed] I I’m, I’m gonna say a 47% relative price swing. I, I, I’ll take, 00:13:39 [Speaker Changed] Had a, had a, had a great year in oh eight and, and 00:13:42 [Speaker Changed] Did that continue in oh nine 00:13:45 [Speaker Changed] Flatlined. 00:13:46 [Speaker Changed] Alright. 00:13:47 [Speaker Changed] From oh nine, so from March of oh nine. So we did well in January 1st quarter, February and the first quarter, right. The rest from, from March of oh nine, our returns flatlined. So we never, we never lost money for our clients in our fund. But 00:14:01 [Speaker Changed] You didn’t catch that recovery. That 00:14:03 [Speaker Changed] V did not catch the recovery. Absolutely did not. And the, the recovery was interesting, right? You’re, you’re right. There was a v but there were, there were starts and stops to it. So the, the big move up from the bottom in late March going into April, it’s like, all right, that actually we caught a little bit of that and that that made sense, right? There was a second leg to the rally. Oh, for sure. April, may. And then in June, in June, June to October was a ferocious rally. 00:14:39 [Speaker Changed] Ferocious is the right word, but, 00:14:40 [Speaker Changed] But June in particular was a classic crap rally. 00:14:45 [Speaker Changed] Right. Meaning it was a low 00:14:46 [Speaker Changed] Quality, right. Low quality stuff. Right. The, the end of March going into April rally, it was Right. This makes sense, right? We bottomed fed the June rally. No, no, it was, we didn’t, we didn’t touch any Oh, 00:15:03 [Speaker Changed] That’s a, that’s fascinating. Go back, 00:15:05 [Speaker Changed] Go back and look at it. Right? I, and, and let me tell 00:15:07 [Speaker Changed] You, oh, I don’t, just so you know. Yeah. I, I have a vivid recollection of chatting with Jim Bianco about this, and we were both bullish, but for completely different reasons. To me, anytime US equity markets are cut in half, I’m a buyer and people say 1929, I’m like, great, you gotta go back a century to find the exception that proves the rule. But Jim was early on in the Tina trade, Hey, the Fed has made everything cash, trash bonds are, they’re forcing you into equities, which is what led my post, which everybody stole the line. This is the most hated bull market in history. Yeah, yeah. And I, I wrote that up. I send that out and I heard everybody borrow that. But I’m curious as to where the June rally took you. Well, 00:15:55 [Speaker Changed] This, and this is where I’m going about the role of forward guidance in Jim Bianco’s point about, because what the Fed did wasn’t just it’s policies around interest rates, you know, they took them to zero. And that’s where we stayed, 00:16:16 [Speaker Changed] Started buying mortgage backs and they did 00:16:19 [Speaker Changed] Qe, balance, balance sheet operations. Right, right. 00:16:22 [Speaker Changed] Quantitative easing, 00:16:23 [Speaker Changed] Actual, you know, actually, and I look, I, I think QE one, I think it saved the world. This 00:16:28 [Speaker Changed] Is what, right. And what was that? A trillion dollars something crazy. 00:16:31 [Speaker Changed] Something. Yeah, something something. 00:16:32 [Speaker Changed] 800 billion, something 00:16:33 [Speaker Changed] Something like 800 billion 00:16:34 [Speaker Changed] Unthinkable number. 00:16:35 [Speaker Changed] So I, I think that, so those were specific actions took, but, but even if you, people often say things when they’re leaving office. So, so Bernanke’s last speech is valedictory address. 00:16:48 [Speaker Changed] Right. More honest than intended. 00:16:51 [Speaker Changed] Much more so, and you see this all the time, right? George Washington leaving office. 00:16:55 [Speaker Changed] I was gonna say, I, 00:16:55 [Speaker Changed] I, I, Eisenhower Yeah. 00:16:57 [Speaker Changed] That’s a big, 00:16:57 [Speaker Changed] I mean, when, when, when, when freaking Eisenhower warns you against the defense industrial complex. You know, you might, you might. I’m just saying. No, I won’t listen. 00:17:06 [Speaker Changed] It’s general like to you. That’s 00:17:08 [Speaker Changed] Right. General, like to me, what Bernanke said when he is leaving his terms of office, he said, look, we had, we had two toolkits. One was traditional stuff, interest rates down to zero. At the time we didn’t know we could have negative interest rates. So, you know, that’s where we were. Right. Second were the balance sheet operations, large scale asset purchases, qe, quantitative easing. It said, you know, QE one was great. Did what we hoped it would do. QE two, eh, operation Twist, QE three, this is Bernanke saying, mind you. Yep. He says, I actually think that might have been a little counterproductive, 00:17:47 [Speaker Changed] Huh? 00:17:49 [Speaker Changed] They said, but we had another toolkit, and that was our communication policy. That was forward guidance, that we started using our words not to communicate to the market what we actually felt. We started using our words and coordinating our words to change the market, to change market behavior. This is what I mean about making a conscious effort to tell a story. And it, it’s not that it was necessarily lying, but they, they were using their words and choosing their words for effect 00:18:28 [Speaker Changed] To shape perception of their underlying 00:18:31 [Speaker Changed] Behavior to market, to, to shape market behavior. And he said, that worked better than we had any hope that it could. And that’s where we are now. 00:18:42 [Speaker Changed] So, so for the youngins listening, I have to point out, and you and I are old enough to remember back in the days where there were no minutes released there, there wasn’t an announcement, forget a press conference. You had to be watching the bond market to figure out what the Fed just did. Like today, there’s, we’re holding the, having this conversation. There was a fed the October meeting, a quarter point rate, cut a conversation about all sorts of stuff. I really didn’t pay a lot of attention to it. Yeah. Lack of clarity, no data, blah, blah, blah. 00:19:20 [Speaker Changed] Worse than that, Greenspan would be intentionally vague and obtuse. 00:19:25 [Speaker Changed] If you understood with you’re saying what I said then, then you misunders you misinterpreted it. Right? Exactly. 00:19:30 [Speaker Changed] Right. 00:19:30 [Speaker Changed] If you think you understand what I’m saying, 00:19:33 [Speaker Changed] You know, who led the committee to make all that change? Janet Yellen, she was vice chair. Yep. 00:19:39 [Speaker Changed] Back, back in, during the financial crisis. Yeah. 00:19:41 [Speaker Changed] So this was, it was a concerted effort. Bernanke Yellen to this is when they also started going, putting all the Fed Governors on a common calendar. 00:19:52 [Speaker Changed] Right? 00:19:53 [Speaker Changed] Follow all the, and assigning the fact, okay, you’re gonna speak this day, you’re gonna speak that day. That’s when all this started. It was an intentional effort. And again, this is something that politicians have known forever, right? Politicians craft the message and use their words. So I, I knew the, the tools to try to understand this, but what I wasn’t prepared for was how, and neither was Bernanke, was how powerful this would become to the point where today it’s not just central bankers using their words as their main policy toolkit, but it’s every CEO it’s every CEO Now, I mean, you go on this network or one of the other networks, and what makes for a good CEO is can you tell the story? Can you tell the narrative of your company to get a multiple, right? Because, because a multiple is a narrative. A multiple is a story. 00:20:52 [Speaker Changed] They’re 00:20:52 [Speaker Changed] All stories. Well look at, 00:20:53 [Speaker Changed] Look at some of the most successful CEOs throughout history. I would throw Jack Welch into that pile. ’cause he was a fabulous, fabulous. Yeah, he was a fabulous, fabulous. ’cause the stories he told were great, right? Up until the point where we found out that he was running a, a, a hedge fund with GE Capital, and they magically always beat by a penny. 00:21:17 [Speaker Changed] So I remember vividly when GE was coming to our shop, what they wanted was a fin a financial multiple, right? So they were making, they, they wanted, 00:21:33 [Speaker Changed] Even though they’re an old world industrial, 00:21:35 [Speaker Changed] Even though they’re an industrial, this, that this was, they wanted to tell a story that they should be seen as and get the multiple of a financial, that’s what GE was all about in those years leading up to the, the, the GFC. So a, my, my poster child for this is, is Mark Benioff Salesforce, because he’s pri you often see this with people who come out of sales like, like Mark did, right? But 00:22:08 [Speaker Changed] The way it’s all about storytelling. 00:22:10 [Speaker Changed] It’s all about storytelling. And 00:22:13 [Speaker Changed] What isn’t that true for go through the great, see, look, Steve Jobs, Reed Hastings, Larry Ellison at Oracle to some degree, Steve Ballmer at Microsoft, who wasn’t a great CEO, but he was a great cheerleader story, and a great storyteller, great 00:22:32 [Speaker Changed] Storyteller. What all of those companies have in common is that they’re great storytellers, and those are trillion dollar companies today. Right. What I would say to you is that you don’t remember or hear about the companies that did not have CEOs who are great storytellers. 00:22:51 [Speaker Changed] Well, Ken Lay was a great storyteller until you found out that it was all nonsense. And you could say the same thing about folks like Bernie Madoff. 00:23:00 [Speaker Changed] There are a lot of stories that get told that are not true. Right? What, and and I think even today, people think of this word narrative. They have a pejorative sense to it. It’s like, 00:23:15 [Speaker Changed] Oh, really? Really? That’s interesting. I didn’t think of it that 00:23:17 [Speaker Changed] Way. Oh, for, for, for, for for sure. That’s just your narrative, man. You know, the Big Lebowski, you know, that’s, that’s the, and it’s not that a story is a lie. It’s that the story is constructed for effect. It’s, it’s not, and it’s presented to you as if this is my true and inner thoughts, but the construction of the, the intentionality behind these stories, phenomenal. Benioff, for example, you know, created the metrics by which he wanted Salesforce to be judged. Not metrics of profitability, but metrics of what he called proforma, net revenue growth, whatever the hell that means. Right? Right. And because if you can construct the story, you can construct it in a way that, yes, I can beat and raise pretty much every quarter. So there was, there were three, I think, big changes that happened to make the role of narrative overwhelming as it is today. Whereas before, it’s always been there. To your point, it’s always been there today, it’s overwhelming. And, and I think it’s, it’s not just the success that first central bankers and then CEOs. I mean, wall Street’s the greatest copying machine. We Wall Street copies what works. Sure. So when you see that something’s working, oh, they’re, they’re getting a multiple by telling the story and going on Kramer, you know, four times a 00:24:50 [Speaker Changed] Year. It’s endless. It’s endless iteration. You’re just constantly tweaking it, doing works. And if it works, do more of it. And if it doesn’t, toss it out. So 00:24:58 [Speaker Changed] It was the, the fact that it works to tell a story and people got good at telling stories. It’s the growth of 24 7. I’m gonna use air quotes here and I’m glad we’re taping this news. Well, 00:25:11 [Speaker Changed] It’s media, social media news right 00:25:13 [Speaker Changed] Now. 00:25:14 [Speaker Changed] News, like news light. 00:25:16 [Speaker Changed] That wasn’t the case. 00:25:18 [Speaker Changed] So I wanna I wanna annotate what you said slightly. Okay. Because I think CEOs have always been storytellers, but they were storytellers to their boards, to their employees, to their shareholders. Correct. They always, the, you’re hitting now on the modern world of 24 7. Media telling a story in a boardroom is very different than sitting in a TV studio and talking about, Hey, here’s why our new chip is gonna catch up to Nvidia. Yep. And it’s the greatest thing ever. Yep. That’s a different skillset. It 00:25:52 [Speaker Changed] It changes the time horizon. It is a very different skillset because you’re not telling the story of, oh, I’m getting another, you know, turn of leverage in our operations, or, you know, our capacity utilization in this factory went up by 5%. Which are the kind of stories you would tell even on earnings call or certainly to a board. Now, this is the story where got a 00:26:16 [Speaker Changed] Gotta gotta 00:26:17 [Speaker Changed] A little bit. You, you’re, you’ve got a segment, you’re going on, Kramer, you got four you minutes and say bye bye bye. You got at most four minutes. Right? Right. How are you gonna tell that story that sings to that audience? Enormous change, change, structural change in our media, both quote unquote news media, but also financial news media. The Wall Street Journal today is a 24 7 news, financial news organization. Right. 00:26:47 [Speaker Changed] What, what isn’t It’s printed New York Times, Bloomberg, the Washington Post. Exactly. They all have websites that get updated around the clock. 00:26:54 [Speaker Changed] And here’s the thing, there’s not enough hard news to fill the time or to fill the space. So what takes the space opinion 00:27:04 [Speaker Changed] Story you were channeling 00:27:05 [Speaker Changed] Story takes the place of 00:27:06 [Speaker Changed] The hard, you were channeling Michael Creon from 25 years ago. Most of what you see in the media is speculation, opinion, and theory, not news. I, 00:27:18 [Speaker Changed] I’ve written so much about Creighton and his 00:27:21 [Speaker Changed] I know. That’s why I threw that back to 00:27:22 [Speaker Changed] You. He says he, he was, he was so far ahead 00:27:25 [Speaker Changed] This quarter century ahead of what, of what took place. 00:27:28 [Speaker Changed] And there’s a third piece though, 00:27:31 [Speaker Changed] Give us the third piece before we go to our next segment. Third 00:27:34 [Speaker Changed] Piece has changed. Everything is our smartphones 00:27:37 [Speaker Changed] That you walking around with. Right? Not only a studio, but a, a a a, a dopamine device that you’re constantly playing. 00:27:46 [Speaker Changed] It’s my dopamine machine, right. And I, we do it to ourselves. It’s not that someone forces us to hear these stories over and over again. We do it to ourselves. I mean, I get a little nervous if I, you know, pat, where’s my phone? Where’s my phone? That’s right. That’s right. I, I get a little nervous. And it’s a, it’s, it is absolutely a neurotransmitter addiction. I think it’s so important to keep that from our kids. That’s a whole nother thing. 00:28:17 [Speaker Changed] There’s a whole depression situation with teenagers today, and it all traces back to the phone and social media. 00:28:22 [Speaker Changed] These are three, I think, real secular changes we’ve had. Markets become this political utility, the success of constructing a story, structural changes in social media, and the devices that we insist on caring with our ourselves all the time, 00:28:46 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Absolutely Fascinating. Coming up, we continue our conversation with Ben Hunt, president and co-founder of Perent, explaining how he’s using AI to identify narratives in real time. I’m Barry Ltz. You’re listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. I am Barry Ritholtz. You are listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. My special guest this week is Ben Hunt. He is a academic fund manager, risk manager, entrepreneur, tech startup person. He is currently co-founder and president at persent, which applies AI tools to map and measure market narratives in real time. It’s really more than market mar narratives. It’s politics, it’s economics, it’s markets. You cover a whole lot of stuff. A 00:29:51 [Speaker Changed] Hundred percent. So what we’re able to do today, and this is the crazy change in the world back from when I was doing this on microfiche back in 00:30:02 [Speaker Changed] The 00:30:02 [Speaker Changed] 1980s. Yeah, exactly. We get, we have access to everything that’s published publicly in the world. And there are a couple of big data aggregators, Dow Jones, one LexiNexis another, everything that gets published in the world, all these languages, it’s available to you. And it’s, it’s not cheap, but it’s not crazy expensive like it used to be. And it’s always getting cheaper. So we’re able to take everything in the world that gets published, all the newspapers, all the websites, all the transcripts, everything that’s published publicly, we can pull in and then we can process it, process it with really, it’s the same math that I was using 30 years ago. Nobody’s invented cold fusion here, 00:30:55 [Speaker Changed] But the software tools are faster, stronger, better, 00:30:59 [Speaker Changed] And infinite. So the, the, the calculations here are not particularly complicated, but you have to do them at enormous scale. 00:31:08 [Speaker Changed] It’s, it’s a ton of volume. So, 00:31:10 [Speaker Changed] I mean, it’s crazy. The, the, just the, the scale of 00:31:15 [Speaker Changed] The numbers. Petabytes, terabytes just crazy. 00:31:17 [Speaker Changed] I mean, yeah. In the last couple of months we’ve processed over 200 billion tokens. Billion, 00:31:25 [Speaker Changed] Right. And a token is how much 00:31:26 [Speaker Changed] A, a token is like a word or a phrase. Okay. And so that’s the kind of the unit that you talk about when you’re putting through, when you’re putting something through a linguistic calculator. So 200, which is, which is what all of the, the 00:31:41 [Speaker Changed] LLMs, 00:31:41 [Speaker Changed] All the LLMs are, they’re linguistic calculators. And so, you know, we’ve processed, you know, several hundred billion tokens. Again, it’s not complex, but it is at scale. And what, what we’re doing with that is we’re reading the world’s news to understand the world’s stories and narratives. And you’re right, it’s, it’s much bigger than, or it’s much more focused that we have much higher resolution than just saying, oh, I’m bullish on financials. I mean, that’s a, that’s a narrative. Sure. Right. 00:32:20 [Speaker Changed] But 00:32:21 [Speaker Changed] There are 20 different variations of that. You’re, you’re bullish on financials. Why? 00:32:27 [Speaker Changed] So wait, let me, let me, you, 00:32:28 [Speaker Changed] And we can track all those, we can track all those stories and how they wax and wane over time. That’s really cool. So 00:32:32 [Speaker Changed] Let, really cool me roll back to, I want you to explain what Perent is. Who are the clients? I don’t mean names, but No, sorry. What type of of clients do you have and, and what do they do with Persian’s output? 00:32:47 [Speaker Changed] So we started Persent in 2018. My partner from, we were at a, a asset manager spun out there to take the, the technology that I’ve been working on for years and, and really been writing about with Epsilon theory. So we started that in 2018 to do the, the basic research into processing enormous amounts of financial news data and to track the stories and how they rise and fall and wax and wane over time. Is that, that was, that was the story. That was the 00:33:25 [Speaker Changed] Goal. So I, I love that description because there are a lot of trades going on where the storyline changes on a regular basis. Probably the Mac daddy of that is crypto first. It’s, Hey, you know, there’s fiat currency, this is outside of the system, it’s defi, then it’s a hedge for deflation, then it’s a hedge for inflation. Now it’s scarcity and, 00:33:51 [Speaker Changed] And digital gold. Right? Digital 00:33:53 [Speaker Changed] Gold. 00:33:53 [Speaker Changed] It’s, it’s, there are no fundamentals, right? With, with, with crypto. And I people will say there are, but there aren’t. Right? It’s, it’s driven by the waxing and waning of stories. And do, do they find purchase? Do they or do they kind of, people get tired of them? 00:34:11 [Speaker Changed] Well, they got tired of the defi story. And then once JP Morgan and BlackRock started creating, like, the Ibit is the fastest ETF to a hundred billion dollars. And so the old story of Defi is gone. And the new story is, oh no, this is an asset class at Wall Street’s embracing. That’s why you have to own it. 00:34:32 [Speaker Changed] That story, that story was, and very, that was a very similar story by the way, or a transition story from physical gold to GLD when that ETF came out. Right. Which was a very similar pattern because once it became a Wall Street, a, a table at the Wall Street Casino, right? Then it takes on a different meaning specifically around gold. Gold changed from being, okay, something that you bury in your backyard or you’re having your vault, you know, along with ammo and seeds for when the, the, the hard times come 00:35:11 [Speaker Changed] Bottled water, right? Bottled meals ready to eat, right, gold and lead. It 00:35:15 [Speaker Changed] Becomes a security. And its meaning changes from that, you know, apocalyptic bottled water. Right? And the meaning of gold today is as an insurance policy, a security against central bank error or government error. That’s the meaning of gold today. 00:35:35 [Speaker Changed] And is that the dominant narrative that you’re identifying as gold rallied over through 4,000? Ab 00:35:41 [Speaker Changed] Ab Absolutely. So, I mean, we’ve really been able to track that one in 00:35:46 [Speaker Changed] Specifically. So, so here’s the really big, here’s the million dollar or trillion dollar question. How do you identify a narrative and say, oh, gold is gonna double from here based on this narrative? Or, or are we not there yet? 00:36:00 [Speaker Changed] No, you, you identify the narratives. ’cause the narrative, the stories don’t ever change, right? So the, the story that leave gold aside for a while, think about you we’re talking about your bullish on company X, Y, Z because there are about, I don’t know, depending on how, again, how finely you want to resolve that. There are only about a dozen stories for why you’re bullish on something, right? They can be management change, top line growth, opportunity consolidation in the industry, 00:36:35 [Speaker Changed] Upcoming catalyst, 00:36:36 [Speaker Changed] Catalyst. So, so every catalyst story, new 00:36:38 [Speaker Changed] Products, new product, FDA’s gonna prove the new mo, new drug, new molecule. 00:36:43 [Speaker Changed] So that story, you just change the name. That’s the same story that’s repeated over and over again about any pharma or, or, or biotech company. The stories, we think that they’re amorphous and variable. The fact is that the, the core of the story, what we call the semantic signature, the meaning of a story, they’re amazingly constant over time. So what we’re looking for is for, and it’s, it could be dormant for a long time, but what you want to know is when that story starts picking up again, when someone starts playing that story, when it appears on Kramer and starts happening in the financial press, that’s the stuff we can pick up with real precision. So it’s both the stories that are starting to fade, 00:37:41 [Speaker Changed] But, 00:37:42 [Speaker Changed] But the, I think the really interesting stories are the stories that have been dormant for a long time and they start picking up again, 00:37:48 [Speaker Changed] You, you are reminding me of Campbell’s hero’s journey, that there’s only so many 00:37:54 [Speaker Changed] My hero, right? There are only so many stories Right. In the, in, in the world. And that, that’s a now I like to talk about in Hollywood, famously there are only like five scripts. 00:38:08 [Speaker Changed] That’s right. Right? 00:38:10 [Speaker Changed] Tolstoy is supposedly Tolstoy. He said there were only two stories that a man goes on a journey or a stranger comes to town. Those are the only two stories in the world. And 00:38:20 [Speaker Changed] Not quite, but he’s, he’s 00:38:21 [Speaker Changed] Not quite but you on, he’s pretty close. You’re on the right track. 00:38:23 [Speaker Changed] Right? Right. The 00:38:24 [Speaker Changed] The point is, there’s a finite number of stories, right? You can drill down. So you can get a couple of dozen about any sector you want to talk about or like, but it’s, it’s a finite number. And so what we do, and what I think is really interesting is to track that finite number of stories. And you’re right, it’s not just around markets. We track several thousand of these stories today. 00:38:50 [Speaker Changed] How so? Let’s, let’s delve into that. Yeah. So, so how do you, you have this massive database you’re sucking in every news feed. Yep. Everything magazine, newspaper, everything. Anything that you could quantify and, and run into a linguistics model. What’s the process for analyzing this? How to use artificial intelligence to, to go through this, and how do you make sense out of that heap of how do you find signal amidst all that noise? 00:39:23 [Speaker Changed] The crucial thing is you can’t just ask AI an open-ended question. Say, what are the narratives in Right? This comp for this company or for this sector? Don’t do that. Right? And this is a mistake that people make all the time. They ask open-ended questions of chat, GPT or or or whoever. The problem is chat, GPT will give you an answer. 00:39:45 [Speaker Changed] Just not a good one. 00:39:47 [Speaker Changed] Not a good one. It’ll hallucinate a lot. Yeah. Right. It’ll go out, it’ll find its own data. The, the secret to to using AI successfully is to take this magic genie because it’s a magic genie and you stuff it into that bottle, right? You do not let it out. You constrain it dramatically. You don’t let it go out and find data. You give it the data crucial thing. You don’t allow it to think. You tell it how to think. So the, the most important step that we do is we don’t ask ai what are the narratives that you look at? We tell it this is human direction. You have to have human control. 00:40:31 [Speaker Changed] So I’m hearing dataset is controlled by you as well as the thinking prompts. The seman. 00:40:39 [Speaker Changed] Yes. And it’s more than prompt, right? So the, it it, it includes prompt. But the, the phrase that’s used in this world is called not prompt engineering, but context engineering. 00:40:53 [Speaker Changed] Okay. That makes sense. 00:40:54 [Speaker Changed] So you want to, you want to control everything around the ai because you want to limit it to being that linguistic calculator. You want it to be your operating system. That’s really the way, the thing. And, and if you do that, then it will give you the same answer twice for the same inputs and the same question. That’s the crucial thing. So it’s 00:41:18 [Speaker Changed] Consistent 00:41:18 [Speaker Changed] For this to be true for, for it to be consistent, for it to be real signal. So this is a human directed process. You can’t ask AI an open-ended question. You have to control all the inputs. You have to control the output, meaning you judge it, you run it back through a different AI system to say, how’d they do? Did they go off the rails here? But the most important thing is you have to give it the scaffolding. You have to give it the, the skeleton. You have to tell it. These are the thoughts you are allowed to think about. You know what, and those are the, those are the, the signatures. 00:41:53 [Speaker Changed] I, I’ve kind of learned, I have to avoid asking questions that have a, a, a human emotional subtext. Like, tell me what was most surprising about this? Doesn’t know what a surprise is. Tell me what was most interesting about this. It does, it’s not able to do that. You really have to treat it like it’s a dumb machine. 00:42:18 [Speaker Changed] Well, that’s right. This is why, I mean, you treat it, you, you need to treat it as an operating system. You need to constrain every bit about it, particularly in how you allow it to think because it wants to please you so badly, right? It does. So if you ask it, what’s interesting, it will look back at its history of communication with you, and it’ll think, what will Barry find interesting? And it will give that answer to you. And if it can’t find it easily, it’ll make it up. It’ll make up an answer that you will find interesting. 00:42:48 [Speaker Changed] I, I find when I, I, I try and prompt, Hey, tell me about Ben Hunt’s background and gimme the timeline of his career that it’s good at. Hey, what was Ben Hunt really good at? It has, has got no idea. 00:43:04 [Speaker Changed] So what, what you’re able to do, if you’re able to, again, put the genie in the bottle, tell it how to think about a problem, is you’re able to identify, and this does go back to the work from 35 years ago, the type of stories we tell that we humans tell the, the about stocks or politics. We tell two types of stories. We tell descriptive stories. Oh, the, you know, the fed cut rates by 25 basis points today. A descriptive story. But, and we can also tell the description of the, you know, 00:43:45 [Speaker Changed] It’s the because clause, because we’re seeing slowing increasing layoffs and slowing consumer terms. 00:43:53 [Speaker Changed] And, and that’s high resolution and dec and, and very descriptive, right? The, the Powell was surprisingly hawkish today. And he was, that’s a description. There’s another type of story we tell Barry. And that’s prescriptive, 00:44:13 [Speaker Changed] Meaning, 00:44:13 [Speaker Changed] Meaning the Fed should be hawkish. The Fed should cut by 25 basis points. Those are the stories that are indicative of an effort being made to move public opinion in a certain direction. 00:44:33 That’s like the forward guidance that the Fed still does, right? Using their words for effect. They’re using words to nudge you and how you should think about the world, how to think about the world. So the crucial thing when we’re doing these, when we’re asking the AI to here’s, here’s all the text in the world, here are the stories that we want you to identify. We can also boil that down into identify the stories that are trying to tell the reader how they should think or how policy should go that we find has a lot of predictive capability to it. 00:45:18 [Speaker Changed] So you are in the business of analyzing the world’s narratives every day. How is that even possible? It seems like that is an impossible 00:45:29 [Speaker Changed] Test. That’s seem crazy. 00:45:30 [Speaker Changed] Crazy, right? 00:45:31 [Speaker Changed] And, and, and it used to be, it used to be crazy. I, I mean, Barry, I I really do remember my, in the academic days, I would literally hire grad students and give them a cup of dimes. So they go down to the microfiche machine. 00:45:46 [Speaker Changed] I remember those machines in the library. You 00:45:47 [Speaker Changed] Remember those 00:45:48 [Speaker Changed] Machines? Yes. 00:45:48 [Speaker Changed] Yes. You remember those machines? I would code, hand code the, or hand record the coded data. I would type it into remote access for a digital equipment mini frame. And the next day, you know, something would churn out for me. Right? Today it’s, I say we are, we’re processing hundreds of billions of tokens. We get millions of documents overnight like that. 00:46:16 [Speaker Changed] Is there there 00:46:17 [Speaker Changed] Any, is there infinite computing resources available to us? I, 00:46:20 [Speaker Changed] Is there anything you can’t access that you wish you had access to any data source? 00:46:28 [Speaker Changed] So one of the things that’s happened on Wall Street is that the banks and the sell side have become very jealous of their publications because they tend to think in their wrong that they’re good at it. Right? They’re that they’re good at analysis. I personally don’t think they are. Well, 00:46:49 [Speaker Changed] Let, let’s just say some are better than others. Some 00:46:52 [Speaker Changed] Are better than others, but, but none of ’em are really, if if they were, if there was, I’ll call it kind of significant alpha there, they wouldn’t be a bank. 00:47:04 [Speaker Changed] They’d be a hedge fund. 00:47:05 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. They wouldn’t be a ba on the, on the sell side. Now, so I’m interested in reading the sell side research, not because I think there’s some nugget of truth in there, but because I wanna see what they’re all talking about, 00:47:17 [Speaker Changed] Right? It’s reflective of, if not a consensus. Yeah. Certainly a a popular set of ideas. 00:47:24 [Speaker Changed] And, and this is a crucial thing to talk about what we do. I I don’t know what the truth is, right? I have 00:47:31 [Speaker Changed] No idea. Does it matter? 00:47:32 [Speaker Changed] And I don’t think it matters. I I want to provide this information to people who do have a view on the truth. Let’s say you’re a, you’re a value investor, right? You’re running a fund, you’ve got your views, you’ve done a, your homework, you’ve done your research, 00:47:47 [Speaker Changed] You’ve got a good back test. Yeah. 00:47:49 [Speaker Changed] You, yeah, yeah. You’ve got, so I’d say I’ve got, here are the companies where I think I’ve identified something special, something that’s valuable that the market does not recognize. And so I wanna buy it, and then I’m just gonna wait. I gotta wait until one day the market realizes the market comes to their senses and says, oh, wow, that should trade at a higher multiple or a higher price. Because that special thing that you saw, that source of value, the rest of the world comes to see that. Well, what I can think I can show you is when the rest of the world starts to wake up to whatever it is you’re looking for. 00:48:31 [Speaker Changed] So you’re catching the early lift off the bottom. That’s the 00:48:35 [Speaker Changed] Goal. I see. When the, when, when a value investment only works, when the market recognizes it. And we are tracking when something like that gets discovered by the market. 00:48:46 [Speaker Changed] So before Nvidia is 5 trillion, when it, when it starts ramping up to 500 billion, hey, something’s going on here. 00:48:57 [Speaker Changed] What I have found in my experience as an investor is that you make the most money on a trade during what I call the discovery phase of a trade. When the rest of the world wakes up to something that you had noticed and identified before, that’s when the money is made. Once it gets out there, 00:49:19 [Speaker Changed] Then it’s reflect then the, the market be ev is eventually efficient. 00:49:23 [Speaker Changed] It’s a different, it is a different risk and reward profile. Let me, let me put it that way. Fair. You, you, you get, you get a lot more ups and downs post that discovery phase than you do when you’re enjoying the discovery phase. It’s a lot harder. Once you have the, now you may say, oh, but there’s gonna be this other catalyst. And then say, well, 00:49:45 [Speaker Changed] But that, that discovery phase is, I’m gonna quote Doug, Cass, that’s the, there’s a phrase he uses it, it’s like a, a contrarian perspective. A variant perspective where a perspective, you have some insight that is not widely held. Right. And the market being mostly kind of sorta of eventually efficient if there’s a truth or at least a good story in your variant perspective, all 00:50:15 [Speaker Changed] It is a story, right? All it takes is a story. It’s 00:50:17 [Speaker Changed] Gotta be a good story though. Yeah. 00:50:19 [Speaker Changed] It’s gotta be a, well, I’ll call it, it’s gotta be a compelling story, right? Right. And that’s, that’s why you are looking for a CEO who can tell that compelling story. You’re looking for the ability to tell a compelling story, because that is what gives you a multiple. So let me multiple is story. 00:50:37 [Speaker Changed] So let me ask you a few more questions on, on Perent before we go into a few other areas. Sure. So first, you, you’ve been doing this for seven years. What are you doing today? That was unimaginable 4, 5, 6, 7 years ago. 00:50:54 [Speaker Changed] I, I tell you something that was unimaginable really two years ago. That’s amazing. And that is the ai. So what we were doing in our early days, we were basically doing small language models. We were making the language models essentially by hand. And, you know, we did our first models and our first versions of this, and we licensed it to some big banks. And here’s the problem, Barry. We, we had constructed a net and it was a pretty good net. I mean, when we would dip it into a data stream, we’d catch a fish meaning a signal. And the signal, oh, that, that signal works. You know, good, good. Hit on the, the signal that we put up. The problem was we were missing too many damn fish, right? Our, our net was too small. And we’d say, oh, we got this one. And then we’d look back at whatever it was. 00:51:46 We were designing the model. So we say, well, how did we miss all these other fish? And the answer was the small language model we were constructing. It’s incredibly complex if you are building these models without the probabilistic approach that modern LLMs allow you to take, right? So this is the whole notion of embedding. So that there are a million ways to say I’m bullish about the management change at company X, Y, Z. There are a million ways you can say that. And if you’re in the business as we were of kind of handcrafting, let’s write down all the ways you can say that. Oh, really? You miss a lot. Yeah. You’ve made a small net and what you’re trying to, to, to, 00:52:33 [Speaker Changed] And a and a small data set, and it’s 00:52:35 [Speaker Changed] A pretty small data set. So we, we rebuilt all of our software, again, using AI as an operating system context, engineering control, how you dole out the text data, how you test it, how you allow it to think. And we thought, all right, you know what? We’re building a bigger net. I bet we see five, maybe even six x improvement in our signal 00:53:05 [Speaker Changed] Catching. And what did you end up with over 00:53:06 [Speaker Changed] A hundred x? 00:53:07 [Speaker Changed] That’s unbelievable. 00:53:08 [Speaker Changed] Over a hundred x, it’s over. And now it’s, we’ve had a multiple of that. Again, it’s, it’s, it is hard to describe in, in the, in the, the expansion of the net is in so many different directions. Everything we were doing before was just English language, 00:53:23 [Speaker Changed] Right? So now you’re global and how many languages are you pulling into the, 00:53:29 [Speaker Changed] Anything, anything that an AI has been trained on, we read it and we can say we can, 00:53:35 [Speaker Changed] Is that 40 languages? Is that like how many languages? Well, there 00:53:38 [Speaker Changed] Are only a, you know, there are about a dozen languages that are useful in markets. So 00:53:43 [Speaker Changed] It’ll be Japanese, Chinese, a variety of European languages. So 00:53:47 [Speaker Changed] We can, we can 00:53:48 [Speaker Changed] Tell Indian, 00:53:49 [Speaker Changed] Here’s the, here’s a story here. The story about Chinese domestic markets. There’s a western story, western narrative, 00:53:57 [Speaker Changed] And there’s a domestic Chinese story. And the domestic 00:53:59 [Speaker Changed] Chinese story, 00:54:00 [Speaker Changed] Which is very different. 00:54:01 [Speaker Changed] Often it’s very different. So we were able, for example, picking up, we were able to pick up way before it, it, it got picked up in Western press. The demand for luxury goods in China went off a cliff. 00:54:19 [Speaker Changed] Cliff, yeah. 00:54:21 [Speaker Changed] In last November. 00:54:23 [Speaker Changed] Listen, you can’t go from a double digit GDP to like, low to mid single digits and not have it affect, especially in a country like that. Well, 00:54:31 [Speaker Changed] And, and, but, but it’s interesting, right? Because, because they’ve had, you know, ups and downs on business cycle before, but this is the first time where you saw consumer behavior that really was kind of similar to what you might find in a Western consumer behavior point being you didn’t hear that from LVMH or the Macau gaming guys until February. And we were picking that up in, in, in November from the domestic Chinese media. 00:54:58 [Speaker Changed] So, so that raises a, a really interesting question. You know, at the end of the day, clients want to be able to make money on your research. How are people putting this to work? How, how does what you are building help your clients generate alpha? 00:55:15 [Speaker Changed] What we think we’ve discovered is an entirely new source of data. And what we’re confident is that we’ve built the systems that are very different from what you see with this sort of analytics that are out there from anyone else. Right? So this is not sentiment, right? We’re not tracking or using mean words or nice words. By 00:55:37 [Speaker Changed] The way, that was a big thing, I dunno, was that 10 years ago we’re s we’re scanning Twitter to identify investor sentiment. Oh 00:55:44 [Speaker Changed] My god. I mean I, but I was just looking today and not to pick on Bloomberg, but you know, it was their live coverage of the Fed statement, right? Were at those meeting, they were analyzing the sentences and the fed statement for hawkish and dovish sentiment, 00:56:02 [Speaker Changed] How it changed from the last meeting. And, 00:56:05 [Speaker Changed] And 00:56:05 [Speaker Changed] So, so so you’re saying there’s not a whole lot of signal there. 00:56:08 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. I wanna be careful with what I say, right? Which is that there are a number of, I’ll call ’em high frequency stat arb guys, where if it’s important for you to note the difference in word choice on a millisecond level, I think there, I think you can get something outta that. I do. And so there are firms that can do that very well. That’s not our game, right? This is not the, what we’re trying to, to identify is not just sentiment, not just word choice. This is not Google trends and how many times did they mention AI in the earnings report, right? There’s, we’re able to track the actual stories that drive behavior. 00:56:54 [Speaker Changed] So that, that’s the next question. And, and I’m gonna give Dave not a credit for asking this. Does every narrative turn into a decision? How do you know when something is merely noisy versus where there’s a, a significant tradable signal? 00:57:14 [Speaker Changed] I don’t. Right. So this is, my goal is not to, oh, you know, do the trades. My goal is Mr. Hedge fund guy, Mr. Asset, allocator, you’ve got a, you know China, right? You know your companies, you know your commodities. Here is data that I think you’ll find useful. The efficacy of it though is up to you. I don’t know what you would, what, what you wanna do with it. I want to sell the picks and shovels honestly for this vast new data set that we all know is important. But we haven’t been able to measure it in a very predictive way before. 00:57:59 [Speaker Changed] So let’s talk about a few things related to that. Can I say one more 00:58:02 [Speaker Changed] Thing? Sure. And it’s not just about using this for investment. So we have a product for financial advisors, right? Which is your clients coming in, you’ve got a portfolio. You need to be able to say, what, what is, what is my client? What, what are they worried about? What are they nervous about? What are they hopeful for? What are the stories they’re reading? 00:58:26 [Speaker Changed] And you are pulling this out of the flow of media and 00:58:29 [Speaker Changed] We can tell you exactly for of, for the portfolio you’ve got for that client, here’s what they’re gonna be asking about, worried about. And here are the answers you can give them to show this is when has happened before, when this story has come up. Stay the course, it’s gonna be fine. This is the sort of stuff we can do for financial advisors. Huh. 00:58:46 [Speaker Changed] That’s really interesting. I would, I would love to see some of that. It’s not just 00:58:49 [Speaker Changed] In markets. Barry, I gotta tell you, the 00:58:53 [Speaker Changed] Policy makers, corporate executives, bankers, 00:58:56 [Speaker Changed] Policy. So we did a, you know, we did before in the run up to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and we published this on Epsilon Theory. And this is my old academic work, right? The book Getting to War before a country starts a war, they mobilize public opinion, right? And so we were looking at domestic Russian media looking at and saying, friends, this isn’t gonna li be a limited thing. 00:59:22 [Speaker Changed] This is happening. 00:59:23 [Speaker Changed] This is happening. It’s gonna be a full scale invasion. Because that was the messaging in domestic Russian media to the Russian people. 00:59:31 [Speaker Changed] Wow. 00:59:32 [Speaker Changed] So brands, right? So you are, you know, we’re working with some, some it sounds, but pro sports teams, you want to tell a story to 00:59:44 [Speaker Changed] Your fan 00:59:45 [Speaker Changed] Base, build a stadium, 00:59:46 [Speaker Changed] Sell some tickets to sell some 00:59:47 [Speaker Changed] Stadium. Yeah. Sell tickets, build a stadium, gimme some examples of people who have told good stories and how did that work for them? How can we do the same thing? So let’s, 00:59:56 [Speaker Changed] Let’s just start looking 00:59:57 [Speaker Changed] At storytelling. 00:59:58 [Speaker Changed] If Jeff Bezos was a subscriber to this back when he was trying to build a tax funded HQ on the Hudson, had he had your data and you were crunching all the New York City news stories about this, might you have been able to give him advice that he 01:00:19 [Speaker Changed] Suffered? A percent 01:00:20 [Speaker Changed] Suffered such a backlash. Because you 01:00:22 [Speaker Changed] Know what we have today? We have polls. Right? Right. Because, 01:00:24 [Speaker Changed] Which are terrible, 01:00:26 [Speaker Changed] Terrible, terrible. Right. Which are mostly terrible now, you know, and, and I love the poly market stuff and other things where you try to get as many people as possible to put money on something. Right? 01:00:34 [Speaker Changed] So, you know, when you ask a person a question, you’re asking them, Hey, what do you think you think? And what do you think you’re gonna do in the future when we know people are terrible at both of those things? 01:00:45 [Speaker Changed] Terrible at both of those things. 01:00:45 [Speaker Changed] But if you put a little money on it, alright, maybe they might be a little more circumspect that, 01:00:50 [Speaker Changed] That, that helped. That helps a ton. So, so in places where you can have a make a bet, I think that improves the kind of information you can get. It still lends itself to a lot of manipulation. Sure. And a lot of, 01:01:02 [Speaker Changed] They’re not issues around it, poly markets and cashie and all those things. It’s not the bond market. It’s not a hundred and something trillion dollars. It’s a couple of bucks on each of these. And sometimes that’s right, a million dollars moves a half a million dollars can move a market. 01:01:17 [Speaker Changed] But for a lot of things, let’s say you’re polling for a political candidate, right? You can’t ask them to put money down on something. Right? Right. You, but, but you really wanna know the, these, these policies that my candidate is thinking about taking on, is that popular? Does it resonate? Is it a compelling story? We can absolutely see if that is true by looking at local media, local social media, all of that. So it’s, it’s pretty wild there. I mean, once you start looking at how important stories are and once you’ve got a tool where you can actually measure them and visualize them, it’s like, it’s like, I feel like it was like when they invented whoever was Lovin Hook or whoever invented the microscope when you’re actually to see something that we all know is there, 01:02:05 [Speaker Changed] Well now we do back then. Right? Like remember germ theory took what a century to catch on it. 01:02:10 [Speaker Changed] It took a century. Yeah. And it takes, it takes seeing it, right? It takes the instrument to actually measure it before you actually believe in it. And so I, I, I feel like that’s kind of where we are right now. It’s these early days. But to actually see and measure the storytelling at this level of resolution, this magnification is pretty freaking cool. 01:02:29 [Speaker Changed] So, so we’re having this conversation with market at all time highs, and you’ve written about the ravine. Yep. Tell us a little bit about what is the ravine, how does, does your data identify that? Tell us what this means. 01:02:46 [Speaker Changed] Well there’s, there’s, there’s clearly been a change in policy regime out of, of Washington and 01:02:53 [Speaker Changed] New administration, and a radically different, 01:02:56 [Speaker Changed] Radically different 01:02:57 [Speaker Changed] Approach, even from the first Trump presidency, 01:02:59 [Speaker Changed] Even from the, the, the first presidency. And so what we’re able to, to measure, really measure is how does that, I’ll say play, but also what comes, narratives never happen in a vacuum. There’s always a counter story. For every bull story, there’s a bear story. And they, they, they, you can almost kind of see the battlefield of ideas, the battlefield of stories and how it emerges. So my strong sense, Barry, is that we are going towards politically in this country towards trench warfare, greater and greater, I’ll call it narrative violence. And it, if you look historically how that plays out in countries, it doesn’t, it doesn’t play out well. 01:03:56 [Speaker Changed] Civil war, domestic political violence, things like that. 01:04:01 [Speaker Changed] Sadly. Yes. Exactly like that. Exactly like that. So there’s that element. And so that’s a, that’s a sad one, you know, or a, a very troubling one and trying to, well, how do we navigate that? But even when in, in markets, and I alluded to this earlier, how capital markets have become a political utility and the, the role of markets in our society, you can really see how that changes in the stories we tell ourselves about the role of markets, what it’s there for. And I 01:04:38 [Speaker Changed] End of day options and speculation, what else is it supposed to be there for? 01:04:43 [Speaker Changed] But that, but that’s kind of what I’m getting at, Gary, right? You, you can see an enormous change in the meaning of markets. And it connects with a, yes, they’ll call it the speculation layer, but it also connects with financial nihilism, yolo, it, it, it leads to a very, I think, less attractive future for how we think about money and the role of markets and the role of capitalism 01:05:20 [Speaker Changed] Coming up. We continue our conversation with Ben Hunts, president and co-founder of persuent, discussing how money managers use their output to generate alpha. I’m Barry Ritholtz, you, you’re listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. I am Barry Ritholtz. You are listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. My extra special guest today is Ben Hunt. He is president and co-founder of Persuent, a data analytics narrative, storytelling, large language model, using artificial intelligence to find some signal amongst the noise firm. Their clients range everything from large money managers to hedge funds to academics and corporate America. So you write Epsilon Theory and some of it is for subscribers. Some of it is public. A lot of 01:06:35 [Speaker Changed] It’s public. Yeah. 01:06:36 [Speaker Changed] One of the things you wrote is absolutely my favorite item from the first few months of the Trump presidency because I like to talk in probabilities. ’cause I don’t know what’s gonna happen. Yep. But here’s the best case scenario. Here’s the worst case. Here’s all the middle scenarios. You wrote a piece, the end of Pax Americana that I thought was the most cogent, imaginative, well thought out. Hey, here’s the worst case scenario, and we are becoming dangerously flirting with this possible outcome. And I use that as all right, so here’s what I think is high probability. Yep. Here’s the best case. But if you really want to think about how this can go off the rails, check out what Ben wrote. And so tell us a little bit about how did Perent inform the end of Pax Americana? Because I, I get the sense that domestically that wasn’t really where a lot, what, how a lot of people were thinking. But I got the sense from overseas that was a much more common thought. Tell, tell us a little bit about both the piece and, and how the data informed it. 01:07:55 [Speaker Changed] I’ll start with the, I’ll call it the, the international dimension. I wanna come back to the domestic dimension because I, I think we’ve got some really interesting data recently to, to, to share. It goes back to this, yeah. Again, I, I cringe what I was talking about, but, but, but it is, it is game theory, right? And all game theory is, is strategic interaction. It’s that the, the United States, yes. Is the most powerful player on the world stage, but every country has some degrees of freedom and some autonomy in their, in the policies that they, that, that they implement this. There is not a dominant strategy, meaning an outcome. An equilibrium outcome. Again, I hate using these words, but I’ll use them anyway. All an equilibrium means is, it’s a balancing point where both parties, let’s call ’em the United States and a European country, where do they end up? Where they all say, okay, I can live with this, where I can live with this and the America first set of policies, and it’s all these set of policies. What you end up with is less potential economic growth, trade, all all of these things, 01:09:12 [Speaker Changed] All the things that we enjoyed post World War ii, that realignment, that imbued to our benefits so greatly, 01:09:20 [Speaker Changed] Enormously to our, to our, to our, to our advantage. Our advantage, yeah. Enormously to our advantage. It, it goes by the name of a soft power and you know, the dollar system, the bread, Bretton wood system, all of this 01:09:30 [Speaker Changed] Reserve currency on and off 01:09:32 [Speaker Changed] The reserve currency to finance our deficit. All of this is enormously to our advantage. And yes, there are free riders on that system. Yes, there are cost to that, particularly on defense and some other, some other areas. Tariffs are in other area where there’s absolutely free riders on that. So there’s improvement that can be made in that system, for sure. Right. But this is not, this is a different system. This is a different set of rules of the road. And it leads to a different strategic interaction between, between countries. So that’s what the note was about. And it’s, it’s, I’m not trying to predict, I’m just, I’m just trying to observe that. And which is a great line actually by George Soros, which is, you know, I’m, I’m not predicting, I’m observing, which I love that as a line I’m not. And our technology is not there to try to predict the future is trying to tell you what is true in the present today. 01:10:30 [Speaker Changed] I, I’m amazed how many people think they can forecast the future when they have no idea what’s happening. Right. I 01:10:36 [Speaker Changed] Wanna, I want to now cast what I want do. That’s exactly, yeah. Not, not forecast. I want to now cast. And that gets the, I wanted to talk about kind of domestic. So we started tracking the different narratives around immigration policy early last year and what you saw in some of the kind of simp 01:10:59 [Speaker Changed] This is during the run up to the election. 01:11:01 [Speaker Changed] Yes, exactly. And what you saw, and really going back, ’cause we can take, we take this stuff back for a decade or more. And what you absolutely saw up to last October, there’s a, there was an event from last October, not the election, but an event from last October. You see a steady increase in, regardless of your political affiliation. You know what immigration isn’t working for us isn’t as, as Americans saw a steady increase starting with the, they’re eating the, the cats. 01:11:37 [Speaker Changed] They’re eating the cats, they’re eating their dogs. They’re 01:11:40 [Speaker Changed] Eating the dogs. When you saw one, the, the Columbus mo when you, that, that moment, 01:11:45 [Speaker Changed] One of the most, that’s where things, the real moments in debate history. 01:11:49 [Speaker Changed] And we see very clearly in our media data, and this is, this is not mainstream media. This is everything that we’re pulling up. We’ve seen an, a really significant decline in the volume and density of, oh my God, immigration is a problem. We need mass deportations. On the contrary, we’ve seen an enormous increase, again, regardless of political affiliation, including Republicans. No, immigration is a good thing for this country. Huh? This is the stories of America that are pro-immigrant and immigration. Now, you would not believe that if you were looking at the policies that the White House has implemented during these first, you know, 10 months of the administration. 01:12:38 [Speaker Changed] So, wait, when did you first notice that? Regardless of policy, we think immigration is a net benefit to America. When did that first start showing up? 01:12:49 [Speaker Changed] It started changing right? In October because it, following 01:12:52 [Speaker Changed] The dogs, 01:12:53 [Speaker Changed] Cats, it was too far. It was, it was like, this is just silly stupid. This is silly and stupid. And it’s been a steady increase. You know? And you wouldn’t, you wouldn’t believe that if you were I immersed in Twitter stuff. But, but, 01:13:06 [Speaker Changed] So this 01:13:07 [Speaker Changed] Is, our country is actually quite pro-immigrant. I know that sounds cr 01:13:13 [Speaker Changed] But we are a nation of immigrants here. Here’s another data point that’s kind of mind blowing. We were talking about a different data point in, in the entirety of the US history, 2025 looks like the first year where the US population will decrease. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it’s a decrease in legal immigrants. Not, not only illegal immigrants, but legal immigrants. Add that with the deportations and just people staying away. 01:13:41 [Speaker Changed] Well, this, this gets back to the, the, the economic picture and from other, so what, what you’ve had is a clear, and again, we, we, we see this in our data from other countries. There’s a clear effort to repatriate assets and funds away from the us. There’s been a clear effort outside the us You see this with central banks, but also with 01:14:03 [Speaker Changed] Cor hence gold. The big and gold. Gold. Correct. 01:14:07 [Speaker Changed] Treasuries used to be a safe haven asset. Right? 01:14:11 [Speaker Changed] No 01:14:11 [Speaker Changed] More. That’s, that’s, it’s, it’s, 01:14:13 [Speaker Changed] Do you understand how significant that charge is? That you’re making, you’re basic, enormous, basically accusing the president, well, of submarining one of the single greatest assets America halts. Well, 01:14:26 [Speaker Changed] That it’s a, it is built up to such a, an extent, right? That the way I think of this is an iceberg that is melting, but it is melting. What we do not see, we do not see capital flight. 01:14:40 [Speaker Changed] Right? We, we saw it for like a week in April, and then that was quickly 01:14:44 [Speaker Changed] Reversed. That was it. So there’s, there, there is, there’s no capital flight there, there are no, 01:14:47 [Speaker Changed] But there was some fear US 01:14:48 [Speaker Changed] Investors that leaving the country that there were fears, and we can track it. If that starts to happen, we’ll see it immediately. That’s not happening. Repatriation continues to happen. 01:15:00 [Speaker Changed] Slowly measured, balanced, 01:15:01 [Speaker Changed] Melting iceberg. Right? Because there are limits to, if you’re a Bermuda reinsurer, I mean, you’re kind of, you’re, you’re stuck with treasuries, right? Right. I mean that, that 01:15:11 [Speaker Changed] You’re, you could buy some gold to offset it, but you can’t sell a hundred billion dollars worth of treasuries. No, you 01:15:16 [Speaker Changed] Can’t. You can’t. So it’s a melting iceberg. But we can clearly see that the dog is not barking yet and maybe never will is capital flight. What we see in politically domestically is that actually, and this was validated by a Gallup poll they’ve been doing 20 years, which also showed what we had saw, started seeing a lot earlier where immigration as a thing is actually pretty darn popular in the United States. 01:15:47 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. But so are, so is restricting assault rifles and we can’t get any change on that. I that’s 75, 80% or the actual 01:15:57 [Speaker Changed] Large. I, I gotta tell you, I gotta tell you that depends very much in how that question is asked. 01:16:01 [Speaker Changed] Well, that’s true for all polling. Well, 01:16:04 [Speaker Changed] This is the benefit of what I’m trying. So, so when, when we’re doing these seman, we call the semantic signatures, it has nothing to do with how you’re phrasing the question. We’re not doing polling. We’re seeing what people are actually the meaning of what they’re talking about in, in media. 01:16:20 [Speaker Changed] So how does that play out if people are legitimately saying no immigration is a good thing for America. Is there an impact on population and the economy? Is there an impact on markets? Is there an impact on policy and politics? 01:16:35 [Speaker Changed] I think there’s an impact on the election, the midterms next year. 01:16:40 [Speaker Changed] So we’re talking, we’re talking literally 12 months from now. 01:16:45 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. ’cause that’s how this, the stuff gets ca on the political front narratives and opinions. They get cashed out in elections. Right. Mark are different. You, you cash stuff out every day. The right, the market’s 01:16:59 [Speaker Changed] Open every day. The feedback loop is so rapid with markets. 01:17:02 [Speaker Changed] Ex Exactly. Politics is a different story. So Right. It gets cashed out in the elections. 01:17:08 [Speaker Changed] If you were to ask me before this conversation, what’s the most significant impact on the midterm elections? There was just a Gallup poll yesterday, GOP questions on the economy. They were plus 14% two years ago. They’re minus 4% this year. Yeah, I, 01:17:26 [Speaker Changed] I saw that. 01:17:27 [Speaker Changed] And, and that’s an amazing swing. And I’m, I’m saying to myself, you know, listen, the out of power party usually picks up, you know, 10, 15 seats. Yeah. You have the redistricting question, which may blunt that. But if, if the most important question during the election was on the economy, and that’s an 18% swing, this is looking like a pretty substantial shift. What I’m hearing from you is, hey, this isn’t just about the economy. 01:17:55 [Speaker Changed] It’s not, 01:17:56 [Speaker Changed] It’s not what, so it’s the economy, it’s immigration. What else? What else are you seeing? That’s interesting. That’s 01:18:01 [Speaker Changed] It. That’s, that’s pretty. Now there are other aspects though, where the, the stories, it, this is, this is people talking about immigration as a thing. Now, whether, now whether that gets translated into a political party position. ’cause I gotta tell you, the Democratic party I is enormous enough. But there, there are no, there are no narratives that are being put forward by the Democrats that are powerful. Or, or, or, or popular. So I 01:18:31 [Speaker Changed] I I don’t, other than the mayoral contest in New York. Yeah, 01:18:34 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. 01:18:35 [Speaker Changed] Right. That what I, that’s this 01:18:36 [Speaker Changed] One. What I’m saying is that the, is that the many of the policies that are being presented by this administration are unpopular, not just with the Democrats, but with Republicans. And increasingly so immigration being one of them. I think economy being another one, 01:18:58 [Speaker Changed] Tariffs aren’t really popular amongst, but people perceive that as a tax increase or, or a pressure on small business 01:19:07 [Speaker Changed] Government shut down. Right? So both also not popular. And also in this, it, it’s, it’s that ’cause the, the question, oh, well, the Democrats will get blamed. Well, that’s not really true. That’s not what’s happening now. How that all 01:19:19 [Speaker Changed] Pay, pay and by the out and listeners should know. It is a long way off. You are not a hard, you’re not a Democrat. Oh my 01:19:25 [Speaker Changed] God. No. 01:19:26 [Speaker Changed] Like, like I know you and your politics and the stuff you’re saying, I, I could hear people shrugging and saying, oh, that Ben Hunt is just a liberal Democrat. I’m like, no, no, no. That’s not who Ben is. 01:19:37 [Speaker Changed] No, no, it’s not. 01:19:39 [Speaker Changed] You are just talking about here’s what I see in the data. 01:19:42 [Speaker Changed] I’m saying I’m observing. I don’t, I’m observing. And I think that a lot of times, if we are like me very online and on Twitter too much, right? You, 01:19:53 You don’t see the broader picture of what is happening on blog posts and local newspapers and, and, and everything else. So I think having the ability to read everything and track these stories that, you know, they don’t, they, they, like I say, they wax and wane, but they don’t, they don’t ever go away. The, it’s, it’s, it’s something we’re very excited about to track the stories of America. I’ll, I’ll give you another one. And this one actually, I don’t know what to do with this. One of the stories of America is that America has raised the world’s wealth, right? That, that that 01:20:48 [Speaker Changed] Global standard of living, 01:20:49 [Speaker Changed] Global standard of living, that, that America has been this powerful force to, and, and capitalism and America have been this powerful force to raise people outta poverty. That’s a story that in other periods of time has been out, has been prominently talked 01:21:08 [Speaker Changed] About. Very resonant. 01:21:09 [Speaker Changed] That story is non-existent today. 01:21:11 [Speaker Changed] Well, you cut things like HIVA few million dollars to inoculate all of Africa from HIV. That’s gonna have repercussions. 01:21:21 [Speaker Changed] Well, it, it’s, it’s not just that, that that has the con those those repercussions that you’re describing. Right. What I’m saying is that the story that would support that, it’s gone. 01:21:37 [Speaker Changed] Is it gone forever? Has no, has 01:21:39 [Speaker Changed] No, that’s, these things are never gone. These stories, stories have, they never die. Right? They’re, they’re, they’re waiting for a new force to give them life. 01:21:49 [Speaker Changed] The next version of it, if us is not seen as a force for raising people out of poverty around the world, do people see China as that force? 01:22:00 [Speaker Changed] Haven’t looked at that. We’ve been looking at the, the US store. But I, but I I, my my personal sense is, is that we’ve essentially seeded the field 01:22:09 [Speaker Changed] CEDD with a C not 01:22:10 [Speaker Changed] An S Yeah. With a C. Not in s particularly in South Asia and Africa to, to, to China. I, I mean, that, that seems, that seems pretty, 01:22:20 [Speaker Changed] You know, pretty clear. This is, I’m glad I asked the question about the end of Pax Americana. ’cause I, I, I’ve just found that piece so insightful and so useful, and I could keep you here talking about this stuff for hours. But out of deference and respect for our listeners’ time, I’m gonna jump to our favorite questions that I ask. Oh, sure, sure. All of our cl all of our guests. But before I do, there’s a question that I, I have to pose to you, which is, so you get to see things before they sort of bubble up into the mainstream before they become a well understood narrative. What’s a narrative that you are just starting to sniff out? That most of the world, or most of the country, or most of Wall Street and finance hasn’t seen yet? 01:23:15 [Speaker Changed] It’s a story that people are talking about since tricolor and first brands went out, 01:23:23 [Speaker Changed] Right? The, the, 01:23:24 [Speaker Changed] So it’s the story on, on credit, story of credit, and 01:23:29 [Speaker Changed] I mean, first brands is legitimate. It sounds like felonies were happening there. So we’ll have to see what, how that plays out. I 01:23:37 [Speaker Changed] Probably try color as, as as well. But my point is that every day you have a new bank, CEO come out and say, no, no, everything’s fine. Right? So yesterday it was David Solomon at Goldman Sachs saying, no, no, it’s fine. Today I was hearing the Brookfield guy saying, no, no, it’s fine. For every story, every interview, the guy says it’s fine. You’re getting two articles in the ft or the journal saying ain’t fine. So 01:24:09 [Speaker Changed] The, you think thou death protested too much. Is it that 01:24:12 [Speaker Changed] Well, I’m, I am I, all I’m saying is I am observing. I’m not predicting, I am observing the level of volume for Hmm. Alternative asset managers, their exposure to private credit. This is problematic. Oh, I’m wondering what’s gonna happen when the music stops. Oh, I think that these, this blows back into the commercial banking system. Those stories, those narratives are higher by an order of magnitude than they’ve been at any point in the last 10 years. Hmm. At any point, including during COVID during when you had similar concerns over, oh my god, private credits. 01:24:51 [Speaker Changed] I was easy to rationalize everything. Hey, listen, we’re all frozen. Just ignore it. 01:24:55 [Speaker Changed] But I, this is a story that has legs. It is growing in a way that I rarely see. And once a story like this grows, it doesn’t just go away. And it’s not fixed by Bernanke saying, oh, subprime is contained. Right. 01:25:13 [Speaker Changed] It’s immediately what I thought of as soon as you 01:25:15 [Speaker Changed] Mentioned it. Absolutely. It does not get fixed by people saying, don’t worry, there’s no problem. 01:25:21 [Speaker Changed] Jim Grant said he was right. It was contained to Earth. Yes. Yes. The rest of the solar system was fine. Which turned out to be a very witty and clever observation. This 01:25:31 [Speaker Changed] Story, this worry, this concern absolutely has legs. And we’re seeing no signs of it easing off in financial media and press. So 01:25:43 [Speaker Changed] The, the big question is, is it systemic? Or I don’t, is it the specific, like 01:25:49 [Speaker Changed] I say, I, I don’t know the truth, right? I don’t know reality. All I can tell you is 01:25:55 [Speaker Changed] We’re seeing more of this. 01:25:56 [Speaker Changed] Well, we’re seeing this is, this is the story. 01:25:59 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really, really interesting. Let, let’s jump to our favorite questions, starting with who are your mentors who helped shape your career? 01:26:09 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. That’s good. Well, I, you know, I mentioned that the people both in undergrad and graduate school, who turned to me on to the science part of political science. And in particular in graduate school, Gary King, who runs the whole social science research center up there at Harvard and has for a long time now. He wrote the original, really the book on inference. You hear about inference all the time now. 01:26:34 [Speaker Changed] Well, Cialdini, of course. 01:26:36 [Speaker Changed] So the, the notion of inference taking large data sets and pulling out, 01:26:41 [Speaker Changed] Oh, inference. I thought you said influence. No, no, no, no. Inference. Inference. 01:26:46 [Speaker Changed] So the science of inference, the, I learned that from Gary, you know, 30 years ago. And it’s so interesting to see that come full circle because that’s at the core of, you know, Jensen Wong’s always talking about it and the whole notion of AI to that inference spend. They talk about, I was there at the beginning for how you, what inference is and why it is so powerful. That was a huge influence on me. 01:27:14 [Speaker Changed] Let’s talk about books. What are you reading now? What are some of your favorites? 01:27:19 [Speaker Changed] I’m a science fiction guy. 01:27:21 [Speaker Changed] Okay. I really am. You’re talking to another sci-fi guy. So let’s, so I I I give us something new and something classic. Well, 01:27:27 [Speaker Changed] Something classic would be Lu Hin and the Three Body Problem. Right. 01:27:32 [Speaker Changed] By the way, the Netflix show on that was surprisingly watchable. 01:27:36 [Speaker Changed] I thought it was excellent before that. And you know, I named the company after him was the Foundation Trilogy 01:27:44 [Speaker Changed] Asimov with 01:27:44 [Speaker Changed] Asimov. Those books hold up Less well, honestly. And I thought the, the series was, it had its moments. I 01:27:50 [Speaker Changed] Didn’t love the series. Yeah. 01:27:51 [Speaker Changed] It was, it was so pretty soso to me. Current science fiction. Rebecca goes, she goes by RF kwong and she wrote a book called Babel, and she’s got a new one out two B or 01:28:07 [Speaker Changed] One BBAB. 01:28:08 [Speaker Changed] Like Tower of Babel. Right. B-A-B-E-L. And she’s got a new one out Caba I think it is, but science fiction dealing with language and linguistics. I love that stuff. 01:28:19 [Speaker Changed] That, that, I love that stuff. That sounds like that’s right in your, your sweet spot. Let’s talk about streaming. What are you watching or listening today? Podcasts or Netflix or whatever? So, 01:28:29 [Speaker Changed] Honestly, I don’t listen to any podcasts. Isn’t that terrible to admit? 01:28:31 [Speaker Changed] Well, if you host, I will say this. If you host a podcast, you’re either preparing for a podcast Yeah. Doing a podcast or ordering a podcast. Alright. Right. So it’s like, all right. That’s three or four. 01:28:43 [Speaker Changed] That’s all it is. Yeah. 01:28:44 [Speaker Changed] Right. Every now and then I’ll, I’ll catch something. ’cause I wanna either listen to this, a specific guest, like IWI will not listen to any podcasts that you are on before we do our podcast. Right. ’cause I don’t wanna steal anybody else’s Yeah. Or narrative or questions or line of thinking. So I, that’s purposeful. But every now and then, so I listen to, the things I listen to are like John Pirelli’s Radio Deluxe. Yeah, yeah. Which is sort of like a podcast slash music series. Something 01:29:17 [Speaker Changed] A little different. Yeah, exactly Right. What, 01:29:20 [Speaker Changed] What about streaming? What are you watching? Well, 01:29:22 [Speaker Changed] You, you and I are both Big Godfather fans. So we love all the, the mobster. I Have you seen Mob Land yet? With, with No. Alright. Worth your time. Okay. Pierce Brosnan eats up every scene. Tom Hardy is awfully good. I just love him in anything. If you, I don’t know if you ever saw Peaky Blinders, right. Started as a modern 01:29:40 [Speaker Changed] Version of Pinky Blinders. I started, I kind of fall, so couldn’t get into it. So my issue is I have to watch something that my wife tolerates. Like I have, I have friends 01:29:49 [Speaker Changed] That’s a struggle 01:29:50 [Speaker Changed] Who, like, he goes into this room, she goes into that room, they don’t watch anything together. Like, I don’t know how that works. Like it’s, she’ll watch some stuff without me. I will watch some stuff without her. Right. 01:30:02 [Speaker Changed] You gotta have your own space. 01:30:02 [Speaker Changed] But 80% of what we watch, so I have fallen that’s hard down the British upstairs. Downstairs Gilded Age. Yeah. So we watched The Crown, we watched the Gilded Age. We finally, let 01:30:15 [Speaker Changed] Me give you one, lemme lemme 01:30:16 [Speaker Changed] Give you one. We went back to Downton Abbey, which I missed when I first rolled out. 01:30:20 [Speaker Changed] Check out. So my guilty pleasure, and I do watch this with my wife, is a diplomat. 01:30:25 [Speaker Changed] Ju the new series, just the new season just dropped new season. Yeah. And that’s teed up for this weekend. I’m looking forward to that. Excellent. That the first, was this season two or season three? The first season was great. 01:30:36 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. 01:30:37 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And I’m gonna give you, if you like that. So my wife finds these really interest. She got me into Killing Eve, which was a little more spy fair than diplomacy. And if you get a chance to watch Slow Horses, oh, 01:30:52 [Speaker Changed] That’s the one I’ve gotta see. Yeah. 01:30:54 [Speaker Changed] It’s really, that’s the one. So the first season is great and people have told me the most recent season, it, it, some people will say, I don’t like the second kinds in the middle. I, I know people who loved it all the way through. But it’s, it’s really, it, it’s really an interesting well told beautiful cast. Just fantastic. Yeah. You’ll, you’ll love that. Our final two questions. Yeah. What sort of advice would you give a recent college grad interested in either investing or working with large language models, working with narrative analysis and artificial intelligence? Hmm. 01:31:35 [Speaker Changed] Don’t, and I, I say that tongue in cheek. I I, 01:31:41 [Speaker Changed] You had a lot of fits and starts going back seven, eight years 01:31:44 [Speaker Changed] For, for sure. And I, I tell you what I, I think’s I important you have to, what, what you, what I think you can accomplish in academia, either in grad school or whatever it is, is you build your intellectual capital. And so I think a lot of times when you get out of college, you say, okay, I’m just ready to kind of live my life and start something. And you haven’t built that intellectual capital yet. The the issue is though, is that once you enter, particularly the investment world where particularly if you’re responsible for managing other people’s money, brother, that’s it. Right? I mean, you’re, you’re, there’s, there’s not, you’ve, that’s got to be your, your total focus. You are spending your intellectual capital, you’re not gaining intellectual capital once you take on a role like that. So I, my first advice is find a a path where, and that’s often in, in, in academia where you’re building intellectual capital. Because once you leave that environment, 01:33:02 [Speaker Changed] Then you’re spending it down. 01:33:03 [Speaker Changed] You’re spending it down. 01:33:05 [Speaker Changed] Makes sense. You’re spending it down. Our, our final question. What do you know about the world of, fill in the blank in investing data analytics? Narrative storytelling today would’ve been helpful 25, 30 years ago 01:33:22 [Speaker Changed] In investing. I wish, I wish I had understood the role of, lemme step back a second. I, I think that whether you’re talking about data or whether you’re talking about investing, and I’ll speak for myself, but I think there are a lot of people like me. We think there’s an answer with a capital A right there in the, in the numbers. And if you just look hard enough, and if you work hard enough, you’ll find that answer. Right? You’ll find the secret, the secret formula. 01:34:00 [Speaker Changed] And you have learned since then, 01:34:03 [Speaker Changed] Ain’t no such thing. Right now, there is magic and there are patterns, but it’s, it’s, it’s not in the structured data, it’s not in the numbers, it’s actually in the error. It’s in the probabilities, it’s in, we’re calling, you know, the stochastic element, right? The, the, the role of chance and understanding that there are patterns and there’s real magic in understanding that I didn’t get that when I was either starting with data analysis or with investing. I was looking for the answer with a capital A as opposed to a process with a capital 01:34:43 [Speaker Changed] PII love that answer because, so my exercise in confirmation bias is I love the fact that you looking back, we all have the benefit of hindsight. Yeah. And unfortunately, that can be a bias to certain people. But when you’re looking back at it, you know how it happens at the moment when you don’t know what the outcome is, thinking about it, probabilistically is a much healthier approach than saying, here’s a binary up or down, yes or no. And I’m either right or wrong, and I see people struggle with that constantly, 01:35:21 [Speaker Changed] Constantly. When I first started in the investing world, again late, I got two pieces of good advice, right? One was never go all in. Right? 01:35:31 Which is, which is really interesting because it’s this, this business of investing. It’s a wonderful life. You were solving puzzles, we meet interesting people. We get to have these sort of conversations. It’s a, it’s a career for a lifetime. And the two pieces of advice are really, it never go all in. And also, reputation is absolutely the most important thing. And again, especially when you’re young, you think, oh, well that’s not the most important thing. You know, being right’s the most important thing. It ain’t, it’s playing the long game here, which you want to, it’s never go all in. And the reput reputation 01:36:16 [Speaker Changed] Is never go all in by never go in. You mean never put everything at risk so that if it doesn’t work out, you’re, you’re outta the game. You’re done, you’re out. 01:36:25 [Speaker Changed] Stay in the 01:36:25 [Speaker Changed] Game was the Gerald Loeb’s book, the Battle for Investment Survival? Stay 01:36:29 [Speaker Changed] In the Game, avoid that risk of ruin You, you, you just, or don’t ever risk ruin. 01:36:36 [Speaker Changed] That makes sense, right? 01:36:37 [Speaker Changed] Because once 01:36:37 [Speaker Changed] You, people don’t think in those terms, but that’s really, they don’t, they don’t all in means risk of ruin. 01:36:42 [Speaker Changed] It’s the risk of ruin. And it also connects with reputation because once you, 01:36:50 [Speaker Changed] Once you blow up, it’s tough to go back 01:36:53 [Speaker Changed] And you start saying, oh, I can fix it by taking this shortcut or doing this other thing. Right? And once you do that never ends Well, it never ends well. Right? And you tell yourself, oh, just this one time. It’s never this one time, 01:37:07 [Speaker Changed] Ben, this has been absolutely delightful. I’m so glad we’ve finally me too gone around to doing this. I, I I’m just entranced by your thought process. Some of the things like, I love reading stuff of yours that I totally disagree with. And then ’cause it forces me to say, well, he’s not just making this up. I know how you, your brain works. And it’s like, all right, if Ben is saying this, then I’m gonna make this my worst case than I’m, ’cause it’s easy to dismiss it. Everybody gets out seeking, confirming information and rather than being dismissive of it, alright, you claim to think probabilistically, where does this fit into the range of probabilities? And once you start thinking in those terms, it’s like, oh. So the worst case scenario is worse than my worst case scenario. I gotta move the bottom of my range down further. ’cause if this goes off the rails, this is really bad. That’s what your Pax Americana piece did with me. Well, thank you. And it really, it really helped me figure out how to think about, especially in that week between April 2nd and ninth, where everyone was losing their mind. It’s like, oh no. So they’re losing their mind. ’cause hey, this could happen. But maybe something good comes out of it. Trying 01:38:26 [Speaker Changed] To avoid tunnel vision. I think it’s so important in our business or any business, but especially our 01:38:31 [Speaker Changed] Business. In our business in particular. Well, thank you for being so generous with your time.

UPDATED 08:00 EST / JANUARY 13 2026 by Duncan Riley Cybersecurity and data protection company Acronis International GmbH today announced the launch of Archival Storage, a data storage and protection solution designed for managed service providers and their small to medium-sized business customers. Pitched as offering long-term, compliant and cost-efficient data storage and protection, Acronis Archival Storage allows users to retain large amounts of data securely, affordably and with fast accessibility when it matters most. Acronis Archival Storage has been built for compliance-driven and data-heavy environments and allows users to store infrequently accessed data with Amazon Web Services Inc. S3-compatible object storage, integrated directly into Acronis’ unified billing and management system. The company says the solution offers the reliability, durability and predictable pricing model MSPs need to meet customer demands and long-term retention requirements. “For many customers, regulations and industry best practices require data to be retained for years,” said President Gaidar Magdanurov. “With Acronis Archival Storage, MSPs can now provide their clients with long-term storage built for compliance readiness, cost predictability and ease of use.” Key features and benefits include S3-compatible object storage integrated with Acronis’ unified billing and management system to allow MSPs to manage archival data alongside other services from a single platform. The service delivers millisecond-level data retrieval with 11×9 durability and 99.5% availability, complemented with built-in encryption and write-once, read-many immutability that helps ensure data integrity and support regulatory compliance. The offering is designed to provide predictable total cost of ownership, with no egress or application programming interface fees to eliminate unexpected cloud charges and to complement existing warm backup storage in regulated environments. Acronis Archival Storage also emphasizes ease of deployment and ongoing management through preconfigured plans, S3 API support and integrated controls and is supported by seven globally distributed data centers to improve connectivity and meet regional compliance requirements. For MSPs, Acronis says, the new solution represents a new way to differentiate their offerings and build predictable margins through integrated billing and zero egress costs. By combining archival capabilities with Acronis’ robust cyber protection ecosystem, it says, service providers can deliver end-to-end data management that scales across customer needs, now with a cold storage tier. Based in Switzerland, Acronis is a venture capital-backed startup that has raised $658 million over four rounds, including $147 million in 2019 and $250 million on a valuation north of $2.5 billion in 2021. Investors in the company include BlackRock Inc., CVC Capital Partners Ltd., Goldman Sachs Investment Partners and Insight Partners LP.

Title: Davos to begin new era with global order shaken by Trump
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2026/0113/1552872-davos-begins-new-era-with-global-order-shaken-by-trump/
Time Published: 2026-01-13T12:56:44Z
Full Content:
Business and political elites head to the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos next week with its vision of a rules-based global economic order being tested to the limits. US President Donald Trump's expected appearance in the Swiss mountain resort highlights the gap between his agenda and the consensus-driven approach of the WEF, which has faced enduring criticism that it is a talking shop of the rich. His "America First" policy has led to trade tariffs being used as punishment, military intervention in Venezuela, the threat of taking over Greenland by force and a US retreat from cooperation on climate, health and other global challenges. The Trump administration has also threatened Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell with a criminal indictment, prompting many top central bankers to issue a statement defending him and central bank independence. Dubbing its 56th edition "A Spirit of Dialogue", the WEF's leaders say that given the current uncertainty, getting together to map out a way forward in business and politics is crucial. "Dialogue is not a luxury, it is a necessity," said WEF president and CEO Borge Brende, a former Norwegian minister. But others say that with the US and China leveraging power to suit national interests, the WEF risks obsolescence. "Who is going to be making the case for the rules-based international order?" said Daniel Woker, a former Swiss ambassador and foreign relations expert. "To be very blunt, in a system where everyone is only looking out for themselves, it has no reason to exist. It's an event from the past." Davos-watchers are also looking at whether the event has lost impetus since its 87-year-old founder Klaus Schwab stepped down as chair in April. The Geneva-based organisation said in August an internal investigation had found no evidence of material wrongdoing by Schwab, after a whistleblower letter alleging misconduct. It named BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and Roche vice-chair Andre Hoffmann as interim co-chairs. The latest forum has much to discuss, from how to handle Trump's version of the Monroe Doctrine establishing US supremacy in the Western hemisphere, to the ways artificial intelligence is changing the world. It comes just after one of Switzerland's worst modern tragedies, a ski resort bar fire that killed 40 people. In pre-event briefings, the WEF has put a brave face on the global tumult, highlighting how companies have sought to adapt to the highest U.S. tariff rates since the Great Depression and pointing to an easing of trade tensions in late 2025. Still, a WEF survey of executives released last week showed that doing business got harder in 2025. The poll also painted a downbeat picture of cooperation on peace and security. With several European leaders expected to attend, eyes will be on how they respond to US challenges, including Trump's threats to take over Greenland, and attacks on European efforts to regulate American tech firms. "The politicians need to stand strong," said Christy Hoffman, General Secretary of the UNI Global Union representing 20 million service-sector workers worldwide, urging policymakers to address how AI and new technologies impact jobs. One feature of this year's WEF meeting will be top oil executives eager to hear Trump promoting his energy dominance agenda, which encourages them to drill for more oil and gas while snubbing alternatives like wind and solar. The CEOs of Exxon Mobil, Shell, TotalEnergies, Equinor and ENI are all expected after much more sporadic attendance in past years, when oil players saw the forum as anti-fossil fuel. It remains to be seen whether China, which in recent years has sent top officials, will field a sizeable Davos presence. Source: Reuters © RTÉ 2026.

LAST UPDATE | 22 hrs ago IRISH DIPLOMATS HAVE postponed an accreditation ceremony for the new Iranian ambassador to Ireland in response to the deaths of pro-democracy protestors. Iran has an embassy in Blackrock in Dublin and its new chief diplomat, Eshagh Al Habib, was due to go to Áras an Uachtaráin for a ceremony to accept his credentials. This has been postponed, according to the Department of Foreign Affairs, in response to the deaths and injuries of people killed in protests and the shutting down of the internet and phones in the country by the regime. Speaking to reporters in Egypt today during a tour of the Middle East, Minister for Foreign Affairs Helen McEntee said she didn’t think “it was appropriate” for the ceremony to proceed today. “We’re appalled and I’m appalled by what’s happening in Iran, and I don’t think it was appropriate for that to proceed today,” she said. “We need to keep diplomatic ties open, and we will, but I think it was the right thing to do today.” Iran has been gripped by pro-democracy protests in recent weeks – hundreds of people have been killed and thousands detained in the uprising against Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s rule. Norway-based NGO Iran Human Rights said it had confirmed 734 people killed during the protests, including nine minors, but warned the death toll was likely far higher. The protests in Iran began in late December over the ailing economy and have transformed into the most significant challenge to the regime for several years. McEntee said today there is a small Irish team on the ground in Iran. “We’re engaged with them on a regular basis,” she said, adding that contact between the team and the Department of Foreign Affairs is “very difficult” due to communications restrictions in Iran. “I don’t fear for their safety, but we do need to keep in contact with them,” she said. Advertisement Yesterday, Taoiseach Micheál Martin condemned the regime’s attacks on protestors and said the violence in Iran “must stop”. “I strongly condemn the brutal and violent suppression of protestors that has left hundreds of civilians dead in Iran over recent days,” he said in a statement on X. “The people of Iran have a fundamental right to peaceful protest and freedom of expression. The repression must end. I urge the authorities in Tehran to uphold the rights of all their citizens. “The violence must stop, the curtailing of basic freedoms must end, and dialogue begin at once.” On Sunday, McEntee said she was “deeply concerned” by developments in Iran. This morning the Department of Foreign Affairs confirmed the postponement of the formal ceremony to welcome the new ambassador. “The decision to postpone the ceremony of credentials for the Ambassador-designate of the Islamic Republic of Iran was taken in light of protests in Iran in recent days which have seen very significant numbers of Iranians killed or injured and a communications blackout,” a spokeswoman said. In a statement yesterday, the Iranian regime’s embassy in Dublin has claimed the Tehran Government is open to dialogue, committed to human rights and “peaceful assembly”. The Journal has requested a statement from the Iranian embassy in regard to today’s development. UK Diplomatic measures have also been taken in the UK, with British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper telling the House of Commons today that her department had summoned the Iranian ambassador. Cooper said she had spoken to the Iranian foreign minister yesterday, “setting out the UK’s total abhorrence of the killings, the violence, and the repression that we are seeing”. The Foreign Secretary said: “Today, as the further reports have come through, the minister for the Middle East (Hamish Falconer) at my instruction has summoned the Iranian ambassador to underline the gravity of this moment, and to call Iran to answer for the horrific reports that we are hearing.” With additional reporting from Eimer McAuley Readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo LONDON, Jan 13 : BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, still believes in the investment case for artificial intelligence in the year ahead but will be focusing on broader opportunities, it said on Tuesday. Investors seeking to play the AI theme into 2026 favour energy and infrastructure providers over Wall Street big tech, BlackRock said in its Investment Directions report, citing a recent investor survey it conducted. AI and big tech dominated markets and world equity returns in 2025, but as the multitrillion-dollar race between the likes of Microsoft, Meta and Alphabet to build new data centres generates worries about uncertain returns on capital and higher borrowing, investors were looking for new ideas, the BlackRock survey showed. Among the 732 companies in BlackRock's survey of clients based in the EMEA region, only a fifth said that the largest U.S. tech groups represented the most compelling investment opportunity in AI.

Title: Layoffs news: Meta, BlackRock, Citigroup to fire hundreds of employees — and it's just the first month of 2026

Layoffs in 2026: At least three large companies have announced mass layoffs in the recent days, and January is not even over yet. The job loss trend that gripped 2025 seems to have entered 2026 too — at least for now — with giants like Meta, Citi Group and BlackRock laying off thousands of staff across roles. The BlackRock layoffs were the most recent job cuts announced by a major company in this month, with the firm announcing that it will let go hundreds of employees. Here is a list of major companies across the world that have announced layoffs in 2026 — Mark Zuckerberg's Meta is planning to cut 10% of its workforce in the company's Reality Labs sector as it plans to restructure to put more money into AI, Bloomberg reported. As per the report quoting a person familiar with the development, the Meta job cuts are expected later this week as the company wants to shift money away from some virtual reality products and into other AI wearables. Last year, Mark Zuckerberg had asked company executives to look for budget reductions within the Reality Labs. Banking major Citigroup is about to lay off around 1,000 employees this week as CEO Jane Fraser seeks to control costs and improve returns at the company. The Wall Street bank had around 227,000 employees at the end of September as per data shared by it. The latest round of layoffs at Citigroup comes as part of the company's plan announced two years ago to eliminate 20,000 jobs by the end of 2026, as per a Bloomberg report quoting people in the know. “We will continue to reduce our headcount in 2026,” Citigroup said in a statement. “These changes reflect adjustments we’re making to ensure our staffing levels, locations and expertise align with current business needs; efficiencies we have gained through technology; and progress against our transformation work,” it added. Under Fraser, who took over as CEO in 2021, Citigroup has seen a company-wide revamp where it exited much of its international retail business and restructured its core operations. BlackRock on Monday said it will fire hundreds of employees across the company, becoming the latest Wall Street firm to announce job cuts. As per a Bloomberg report quoting people in the know, the BlackRock layoffs will see around 1% of its workforce being let go, translating to around 250 employees across divisions. “Improving BlackRock is a constant priority. Each year, we make decisions to ensure that our resources are aligned with our objectives and that we are well positioned to serve clients today and in the future,” a BlackRock spokesperson was quoted as saying by Bloomberg. The move comes as the CEO of the world's largest asset management company pushes for alternative investments.

As announced in an X post by Strategy co-founder and chairman Michael Saylor, the company has completed a new Bitcoin acquisition involving 13,627 BTC, spending an average of $91,519 per token or a total of about $1.25 billion. This purchase is rather large; in fact, it’s the biggest buy that the firm has made since July of last year. In his usual Sunday foreshadowing post, Saylor hinted that the acquisition would be significant, using the caption: “₿ig Orange.” In a reply to the post, the Strategy chairman reflected on the company’s accumulation journey, saying, “Ironic that our $60.25 billion Bitcoin position started with a $0.25 billion purchase in August 2020.” Following the purchase announcement, Strategy’s stack has officially grown to 687,410 BTC and total investment to $51.80 billion. At present, these holdings are valued at $63.28 billion, meaning that the treasury company is in a profit of more than 22%. According to the filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the new acquisition took place in the week between January 5th and 11th, funded using proceeds from the company’s MSTR and STRC at-the-market (ATM) stock offerings. Last Monday, Strategy announced expansions for both its Bitcoin treasury and US Dollar reserve, but the focus this week appears to have been on the cryptocurrency alone. The USD reserve, which was created by the company at the start of December, has seen two additions so far, and the latest one took its value to $2.25 billion. In another X post, Saylor has also shared a chart that compares annualized returns for the best-performing assets in the “Bitcoin Standard Era,” referring to the period since August 2020 when the firm made its first purchase of the cryptocurrency. As displayed in the graph, MSTR has produced the second-most annualized returns in this timespan, with its profits of 60% surpassing even BTC’s, which has managed a return of 45%. The number one performing asset in the period has been Nvidia (NVDA), posting annual returns of 68%. The strength behind the company’s stock was initially driven by the Ethereum mining boom and more recently, by the rise of AI datacenters. “The best-performing assets of this decade are Digital Intelligence $NVDA, Digital Credit $MSTR, and Digital Capital $BTC,” Saylor wrote, framing each asset under a distinct role. Bitcoin kicked off 2026 with a recovery surge, but bullish momentum has faded for the asset as its price is still trading around $91,400. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: NCLA Asks D.C. Circuit to Affirm that Courts Can Hear Constitutional Cases on FTC Enforcement

January 12, 2026 20:55 ET | Source: New Civil Liberties Alliance New Civil Liberties Alliance Washington, DC, Jan. 12, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The New Civil Liberties Alliance filed an amicus curiae brief today in support of neither party urging the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to affirm that the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia has jurisdiction to hear Media Matters for America v. Federal Trade Commission. NCLA does not take a position on the merits of Media Matters’s claims that the FTC investigation demanding internal information from the organization violates the First and Fourth Amendments. The district court issued a preliminary injunction that halted the investigation. NCLA addresses FTC’s insistence upon exclusively managing this dispute in its own internal adjudication system, which puts the agency in charge of deciding the question of its own powers and exclusively controls access to the courts for judicial review of that decision. The D.C. Circuit should reject FTC’s argument on this point, which flies in the face of NCLA’s hard-won Supreme Court victory in Michelle Cochran v. SEC (a/k/a Axon Enterprise, Inc. v. FTC). NCLA persuaded the Supreme Court in April 2023 that our client Michelle Cochran and other Americans could bring constitutional challenges against government agencies like SEC in federal court before enduring allegedly unconstitutional administrative adjudications. Axon/Cochran unanimously overruled six circuit courts of appeal that had trapped parties subject to arbitrary or unconstitutional agency power, forcing them to languish indefinitely in years of administrative proceedings while enduring ongoing, here-and-now violations of their civil rights. The Justices specifically ruled that Axon Enterprise, Inc. and Michelle Cochran had the right to a district court hearing over FTC’s and SEC’s unconstitutional, biased and due-process-denying adjudication schemes. The Supreme Court had already decided this question as far back as 2010 in Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, a ruling that also unanimously recognized district courts’ statutory jurisdiction over such claims. More recently, the Supreme Court in SEC v. Jarkesy recognized Article III district court jurisdiction, including the right to a neutral adjudicator for agency prosecutions. These precedents mean Media Matters deserves its day in district court for its constitutional lawsuit against FTC, rather than being consigned to FTC’s internal tribunal which would delay judicial review until, as Justice Kagan wrote in Axon/Cochran, it would be “too late to be meaningful.” FTC argues that the district court lacks jurisdiction over the case because the agency claims the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914 gives it authority to enforce its Civil Investigative Demands in court as part of cases it brings. But Media Matters brought this lawsuit, not FTC, and the agency has not yet and may not ever sue to enforce the CID against the organization in court. Moreover, FTC’s CID review procedure was established by regulation, not by any statute, so it cannot oust jurisdiction long conferred by Congress on district courts by statute. The mere existence of an in-house adjudication or CID enforcement scheme does not take away district court jurisdiction to hear claims that an agency has violated the Constitution. NCLA released the following statements: “Executive branch administrative agencies cannot pass regulations that purport to displace the judicial power from courts to the agency—especially not when the question is whether the agency itself has violated the Constitution! Such claims must be decided promptly and exclusively in the courts which alone have the power and duty to decide them.”— Peggy Little, Senior Litigation Counsel, NCLA “Plaintiffs alleging violations of their constitutional rights deserve to be heard in a court of law—not by a commission acting as both the prosecutor and the judge.”— L. Margaret Harker, Senior Litigation Counsel, NCLA “When will federal agencies get the message? The Supreme Court has spoken quite clearly in cases like Cochran and Jarkesy. Defendants in agency enforcement actions have a right to contest constitutional aspects of their cases, at least, in federal district court. It is surprising to see this administration stan for the Administrative State by resisting federal district court jurisdiction.”— Mark Chenoweth, President, NCLA For more information visit the amicus page here. ABOUT NCLA NCLA is a nonpartisan, nonprofit civil rights group founded by prominent legal scholar Philip Hamburger to protect constitutional freedoms from violations by the Administrative State. NCLA’s public-interest litigation and other pro bono advocacy strive to tame the unlawful power of state and federal agencies and to foster a new civil liberties movement that will help restore Americans’ fundamental rights.

Title: Ethereum’s hidden ‘death spiral’ mechanic could freeze $800 billion in assets regardless of their safety rating

The Bank of Italy warns of systemic risk as Ethereum's collapsing price could pave the way for network hijacking and asset manipulation. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. An Ethereum price collapse could break the blockchain’s ability to settle transactions and freeze over $800 billion in assets, a Bank of Italy research paper warns. The paper, authored by Claudia Biancotti of the central bank’s Directorate General for Information Technology, outlined a contagion scenario where ETH's price collapse degrades the blockchain’s security infrastructure to the point of failure. Such a breakdown, the report argues, would trap and compromise tokenized stocks, bonds, and stablecoins that major financial institutions are increasingly placing on public ledgers. Essentially, the paper challenges the assumption that regulated assets issued on public blockchains are insulated from the volatility of the underlying cryptocurrency. According to the report, the reliability of the settlement layer in permissionless networks like Ethereum is inextricably tied to the market value of an unbacked token. The paper's core argument rests on the fundamental difference between traditional financial market infrastructure and permissionless blockchains. In traditional finance, settlement systems are operated by regulated entities with formal oversight, capital requirements, and central bank backstops. These entities are paid in fiat currency to ensure trades are finalized legally and technically. In contrast, the Ethereum network relies on a decentralized workforce of “validators”. These are independent operators who verify and finalize transactions. However, they are not legally mandated to serve the financial system. So, they are motivated by profit. The planned jump in capacity relies on a fragile shift to ZK-proof verification that could buckle under network stress. Validators incur real-world costs for hardware, internet connectivity, and cybersecurity. Yet, their revenue is denominated primarily in ETH. The paper notes that even if staking yields remain stable in token terms, a “substantial and persistent” drop in the dollar price of ETH could obliterate the real-world value of those earnings. If the revenue generated by validating transactions falls below the cost of running the equipment, rational operators will shut down. The paper describes a potential “downward price spiral accompanied by persistent negative expectations,” where stakers rush to sell their holdings to avoid further losses. Selling staked ETH requires “unstaking,” which effectively deactivates a validator. The report warns that in an extreme limit scenario, “no validators means that the network does not work anymore.” Under these conditions, the settlement layer would effectively cease to function, leaving users able to submit transactions that are never processed. So, assets residing on the chain would become “immovable,” regardless of their off-chain creditworthiness. Meanwhile, this threat extends beyond a simple halt in processing. The paper argues that a price collapse would drastically lower the cost for malicious actors to hijack the network. This vulnerability is framed through the concept of the “economic security budget,” defined as the minimum investment required to acquire enough stake to mount a sustained attack on the network. On Ethereum, controlling more than 50% of the active validation power enables an attacker to manipulate the consensus mechanism. This situation would enable double-spending and the censorship of specific transactions. As of September 2025, the paper estimates Ethereum’s economic security budget was approximately 17 million ETH, or roughly $71 billion. Under normal market conditions, the author notes, this high cost makes an attack “extremely unlikely.” However, the security budget is not static; it fluctuates with the token's market price. If ETH’s price collapses, the dollar cost to corrupt the network falls in tandem. Simultaneously, as honest validators exit the market to cut losses, the total pool of active stake shrinks, further lowering the threshold for an attacker to gain majority control. The paper outlines a perverse inverse relationship: As the value of the network’s native token approaches zero, the cost of attacking the infrastructure plummets, yet the incentive to attack it may increase due to the presence of other valuable assets. This dynamic poses a specific risk to the “real-world” assets (RWAs) and stablecoins that have proliferated on the Ethereum network. As of late 2025, Ethereum hosted more than 1.7 million assets with a total capitalization exceeding $800 billion. This figure included roughly $140 billion in combined market capitalization for the two largest dollar-backed stablecoins. In a scenario where ETH has lost nearly all its value, the token itself would be of little interest to a sophisticated attacker. However, the infrastructure would still house billions of dollars in tokenized treasury bills, corporate bonds, and fiat-backed stablecoins. The report argues these assets would become the primary targets. If an attacker gains control of the weakened chain, they could theoretically double-spend these tokens by sending them to an exchange to be sold for fiat while simultaneously sending them to a different wallet on-chain. This brings the shock directly into the traditional financial system. If issuers, broker-dealers, or funds are legally bound to redeem these tokenized assets at face value, but the on-chain ownership records are compromised or manipulated, the financial stress transfers from the crypto market to real-world balance sheets. Considering this, the paper warns that the damage would not be confined to speculative crypto traders, “especially if issuers were legally bound to reimburse them at face value.” JP Morgan’s move into tokenized funds poses new challenges to traditional stablecoins like Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC. In conventional financial crises, panic often triggers a “flight to safety,” in which participants shift capital from distressed to stable venues. However, such a migration may be impossible during a collapse of blockchain infrastructure. For an investor holding a tokenized asset on a failing Ethereum network, a flight to safety could mean moving that asset to another blockchain. Yet, that presents significant obstacles to this “switch in infrastructure.” First, cross-chain bridges, which are protocols used to move assets between blockchains, are notoriously vulnerable to hacks and may not scale to handle a mass exodus during a panic. These bridges could come under attack, and further rising uncertainty could cause assets to be “speculated against,” potentially causing “weaker stablecoins” to de-peg. Second, the ecosystem's decentralized nature makes coordination difficult. Unlike a centralized stock exchange that can halt trading to cool a panic, Ethereum is a global system with conflicting incentives. Third, a significant portion of assets may be trapped in DeFi protocols. According to DeFiLlama data, about $85 billion is locked in DeFi contracts at the time of writing, and many of these protocols act as automated asset managers with governance processes that cannot respond instantly to a settlement-layer failure. Furthermore, the paper highlights the lack of a “lender of last resort” in the crypto ecosystem. While Ethereum has built-in mechanisms to slow the speed of validator exits, capping processing to about 3,600 exits per day, these are technical throttles, not economic backstops. The author also dismissed the idea that deep-pocketed actors like exchanges could stabilize a crashing ETH price through “massive buys,” calling it “very unlikely to work” in a true crisis of confidence where the market might attack the rescue fund itself. The Bank of Italy paper ultimately frames this contagion risk as a pressing policy question: Should permissionless blockchains be treated as critical financial market infrastructure? The author notes that while some firms prefer permissioned blockchains run by authorized entities, the allure of public chains remains strong due to their reach and interoperability. The paper cites the BlackRock BUIDL fund, a tokenized money market fund available on Ethereum and Solana, as a prime example of early-stage traditional finance activity on public rails. However, the analysis suggests that importing this infrastructure comes with the unique risk that the “health of the settlement layer is tied to the market price of a speculative token.” Reallocation by major holders drives BUIDL-I share class drawdown, impacting BlackRock fund's net outflow. The paper concludes that central banks “cannot be expected” to prop up the price of privately issued native tokens simply to keep the settlement infrastructure secure. Instead, it suggests that regulators may need to impose strict business continuity requirements on issuers of backed assets. The most concrete proposal in the document calls for issuers to maintain off-chain databases of ownership and to designate a pre-selected “contingency chain.” This would theoretically allow porting assets to a new network if the underlying Ethereum layer fails. Without such safeguards, the paper warns, the financial system risks sleepwalking into a scenario where a crash in a speculative crypto asset halts the plumbing of legitimate finance.

Title: Google's corporate parent joins $4 trillion club as investors continue to bet on AI breakthroughs

Google parent Alphabet Inc. on Monday became the fourth Big Tech powerhouse to be valued at $4 trillion, a once seemingly unfathomable milestone that’s become more like a rite of passage amid an artificial intelligence arms race Google parent Alphabet Inc. on Monday became the fourth Big Tech powerhouse to be valued at $4 trillion, a once seemingly unfathomable milestone that's become more like a rite of passage amid an artificial intelligence arms race. Alphabet reached the threshold just four months after Google dodged the U.S. government's attempt to break up its internet empire following a ruling last year that branded its ubiquitous search engine an illegal monopoly. In an effort to prevent further abuses, a federal judge overseeing the case ordered a shake-up that investors widely interpreted as a slap on the wrist, resulting in a 57% increase in Alphabet's stock price since then that has created an additional $1.4 trillion in shareholder wealth. The rapid run-up thrust Alphabet into a $4 trillion club that has previously welcomed computer chipmaker Nvidia, which became the first to cross the barrier in July. Both Apple and Microsoft also surpassed market values of $4 trillion last year, but they have fallen back mid worries that the spending spree on AI will turn into a bubble that bursts. Nvidia's market value briefly topped $5 trillion in late October, before backtracking as the AI bubble fears also exacted a toll on its stock price because its chipsets are needed to power the technology. Meanwhile, Amazon is currently valued at $2.6 trillion, in part because of its AI ambitions, and Facebook parent Meta Platforms is valued at $1.6 trillion for some of the same reasons. Electric automaker Tesla also is betting heavily on AI, a gambit that prompted the company — now valued at $1.5 trillion — to approve a compensation package t hat would pay CEO Elon Musk $1 trillion if several targets are hit, including reaching a market value of more than $8.5 trillion. Alphabet joined the $4 trillion club on the same day that Apple announced it will rely on Google’s AI technology to help smarten up its virtual assistant Siri after coming up short in its own efforts to bring more advanced features to the iPhone. Google is well positioned to become one of the big winners in the AI battle because it is deploying the technology to transform its search engine into more of a conversational answer engine to compete against the likes of OpenAI's ChatGPT and Perplexity. The next generation of the Gemini model underlying Google's AI technology has been winning rave reviews since its recent release, helping to drive up Alphabet's stock price while the shares of other AI-driven companies have dipped with ongoing bubble worries. Google's Cloud division that sells AI tools to corporate customers and government agencies has emerged as Alphabet's fastest growing segment during the past three years while AI technology has enabled its Waymo robotaxi division to dispatch more self-driving vehicles in cities across the U.S. The competitive threats posed by rising AI stars such as OpenAI and Perplexity is one of the reasons that U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta rebuffed the U.S. Justice Department's proposal to force Google to sell its industry-leading Chrome web browser. The judge reasoned the technological advances unleashed by AI already have been forcing significant changes in online search. Alphabet's market value could plunge if investor sentiment about the company's exposure to a potential AI bubble suddenly shift. Even Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai conceded that some market “irrationality” is contributing to the skyrocketing market values of Big Tech companies during a November interview with the BBC. “I think no company is going to be immune, including us,” Pichai said if the AI-driven euphoria suddenly evaporates. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Billionaire philanthropist MacKenzie Scott donates $45 million to LGBTQ+ youth hotline organization, The Trevor Project

The Trevor Project, known for its hotline for LGBTQ+ youth, received $45 million from billionaire and author MacKenzie Scott at the end of 2025, the organization said Monday. The gift is the largest in the organization’s history but also a major boon following years of management turmoil, layoffs and the loss of significant federal funding over the summer. “I literally could not believe it and it took some time. I actually gasped,” said Jaymes Black, CEO of The Trevor Project, when they were notified of Scott’s gift. Scott, whose fortune largely comes from her ex-husband Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, gave more than $7 billion to nonprofits in 2025, but this gift to The Trevor Project was not included among the donations she disclosed on her website in December. Scott previously gave The Trevor Project $6 million in 2020. In July, the Trump administration stopped providing specific support for gay, trans and gender nonconforming young people who called the 988 National Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. The Trevor Project was one of the organizations staffing that option and lost $25 million in funding, the nonprofit said. The Trevor Project continues to run an independent hotline for LGBTQ+ young people that Black said reaches about 250,000 young people annually, but they served another 250,000 callers through the 988 Press 3 option, which was tailored for LGBTQ+ young people. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) reported more than 1.5 million contacts were routed through the service between Sept. 2022 and July 2025. The Trevor Project has gone through years of internal turmoil after exploding in size from an organization with an annual budget around $4 million in 2016 to over $83 million in 2023, according to its public tax returns. The nonprofit’s board removed its CEO in 2022 and has gone through a series of layoffs, including in July. Black said the project’s 2026 budget was $47 million. “We are a smaller organization than we were before,” Black said. “And we will continue to be really intentional and really mindful around growth and what growth really means for the organization.” After it lost the 988 funding, The Trevor Project launched an emergency fundraiser that brought in $20 million to date, Black said, which they also hope Scott saw as proof that the organization was determined to stick around and make it through this period. “MacKenzie Scott’s folks were clear, like this gift was made for long-term impact,” Black said, adding that they would take their time deciding how to use the funds. Thad Calabrese, a professor at New York University who researches nonprofit financial management, said it’s not at all uncommon for nonprofits that grow very quickly to run into financial problems. But he also said the cuts and general instability in especially federal funding for nonprofits has upended many organizations’ business models. “Academic research has often viewed public funding as very stable, as a signal to donors that you’ve arrived as an organization, but the reality is you are now also open to changing political fortunes,” he said. He said research is also unclear whether diversifying an organization’s revenue streams is always a better financial strategy. “You’re less dependent upon a few funders, but on the other hand, if you have a lot of different revenue streams, do you have the management capacity for that?” Calabrese asked, speaking generally and not commenting specifically on The Trevor Project. Scott has distinguished herself among the biggest individual donors by giving large, unrestricted gifts to nonprofits, often with a focus on equity or social justice. With the exception of an open call in 2023, she does not ask for project proposals nor accept applications. Despite the size of her gifts, which now often exceed the recipient organization’s annual budget, research from the Center for Effective Philanthropy has found that concerns about nonprofits misusing Scott’s funds or growing unsustainably have largely not been born out. That may be because Scott’s team, the members of which are largely unknown, conducts extensive research on organizations before making grants. In an essay announcing her 2025 gifts, Scott said, “The potential of peaceful, non-transactional contribution has long been underestimated, often on the basis that it is not financially self-sustaining, or that some of its benefits are hard to track. But what if these imagined liabilities are actually assets? … What if the fact that some of our organizations are vulnerable can itself be a powerful engine for our generosity?” Black called Scott’s second gift “a powerful validation,” of The Trevor Project’s mission and impact, saying, “We’re calling this our turnaround story.” ___ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Title: JPMorgan Backs Altice USA’s Refinancing of TPG, Goldman Debt

Full Content:
(Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase & Co. is lending Altice USA an additional roughly $1.1 billion to refinance debt before an early repayment penalty kicks in, a move that may sooth creditors still reeling from a bombshell antitrust lawsuit and controversial debt maneuver. JPMorgan is providing the funds so that Altice can refinance the loan — a $1 billion asset-backed facility it got from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and TPG Angelo Gordon in July — at par value, according to people familiar with the matter. The debt’s call protection period starts in the coming days, meaning Altice would have to pay a premium above par to refinance. Representatives for JPMorgan, TPG and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. A representative for Altice didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Any efforts to preserve Altice’s cash are likely to appease creditors to the embattled telecommunications firm, which has struggled under a heavy debt load and has brought on advisers to evaluate its options. Its lenders have also been rocked by some of its recent moves. In November, the US unit of billionaire Patrick Drahi’s telecom empire sued creditors including Apollo Capital Management LP, Ares Management LLC and BlackRock Financial Management Inc., alleging they had formed an “illegal cartel” when they struck a so-called cooperation agreement. That same month, Altice — which recently rebranded as Optimum Communications Inc. — raised $2 billion from JPMorgan for the early refinancing of a loan due in 2028. While that loan carried some of the strictest investor safeguards in the company’s capital structure, the borrowing was raised with collateral that had been removed from existing creditors, effectively making JPMorgan more senior in the debt repayment line, Moody’s Ratings said in a report. The refinancing comes before a premium kicks in that could allow the lenders to capture as much as 116 cents on the dollar. The asset-backed facility due 2031 is secured by receivables generated by the company’s Bronx and Brooklyn service area and network assets, primarily the Hybrid-Fiber Coaxial network.

Title: 3 Dividend Stocks With High Yields and a Triple-Digit Upside Potential

Investing Verizon (VZ) trades at under 9x earnings with a 6.82% dividend yield despite generating $26.2B in pre-tax income. Hormel Foods (HRL) offers a 5% yield and has raised dividends for 59 consecutive years. HP (HPQ) trades below 7x forward earnings with a 5.59% yield and a sub-37% payout ratio. Sending You to Google News in 3 © CHIEW / Shutterstock.com You don’t have to settle for a moderate yield with moderate upside if you like dividend stocks. Verizon (NYSE:VZ), Hormel Foods (NYSE:HRL), and HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) offer both a high yield and upside potential in the coming years and can greatly outperform the broader market. You can still buy stocks with a lower yield, but it’s worth keeping in mind that even a 4% yield is outclassed by Treasuries that yield over 4.8% while being risk-free. At the same time, the market is littered with cash-rich companies that are going through a tough period. I argue these dividend stocks are bound to inevitably bounce back once the storm passes. You’ll be able to snag the dividend payouts plus the massive upside once that happens. Let’s take a look. Verizon is one of the most mispriced cash cows on the stock market today. It is one of the largest telecommunications businesses and has more than proved itself in the past few years. Telecom companies are usually debt-laden and were considered more on the discretionary side. However, Verizon managed to generate positive cash flow despite exceptional interest rates, increase its dividends, and keep its customer base steady. In fact, customers have shown that their internet subscription is actually essential to them. They’re unlikely to go offline no matter how tough the economic situation is, and that makes Verizon a solid safe haven to buy into for a high and dependable yield. VZ stock carries a 6.82% dividend yield today and trades at less than 9 times earnings. Sure, it has over $170 billion of total debt on its balance sheet, but pre-tax income of $26.2 billion over the past year is more than enough to service that debt and pay growing dividends. Once interest rates look less scary, I expect VZ stock to make a full recovery and beyond, likely reaching $80. Hormel Foods has taken a beating over the past five years and is down 48.2% over that period. This company makes a variety of branded food products. While inflation initially helped it, the momentum has gone downhill since 2021. Regardless, I now believe it is too cheap to ignore. HRL stock now comes with a dividend yield of over 5%. Better yet, dividends have been raised for 59 years consecutively. The payout ratio still leaves room for more modest increases. I expect this cash cow business to do a lot better. EPS is expected to continue growing above a 6% clip in both FY 2026 and FY 2027, along with revenue growth above 2%. You may argue that the 16 times forward earnings premium is thus fair value for the stock, but I’d disagree. Such a low valuation would only be fair if HRL stock came with a lower yield and a more fickle cash flow. I see the forward PE ratio climbing above 25x in the coming years as interest rates drop, allowing the yield to be appreciated more by the Street. HP Inc. makes personal computers, printers, laptops, etc. It is not to be confused with HPE, which makes servers and storage. HPQ stock is down over 34% in the past year, and I believe it’s worth buying into the weakness now. The company has solid, stable cash flow, with computer and printing businesses still being very lucrative and reliable. Component prices are explosive, but this isn’t a one-sided affair that many doom-and-gloom analysts expect will kill HP Inc. Instead, it could turn HPQ much hotter. Customers are willing to cover the cost of rising components. Plus, the company has strong links to enterprise clients who keep orders steady year after year. As a result, EPS is expected to stay flat in FY 2026 and grow at a 4% clip in FY 2027, along with a modest sales increase below a 2% growth rate. These aren’t sexy figures, but they show a lot of resilience that most other companies do not have in the electronics sector. You get a forward dividend yield of 5.59%. The real kicker is that the payout ratio is less than 37%. Management has been increasing the dividend at over 10% annually on average over the past 5 months. The business itself doesn’t need to grow at a flashy pace before Wall Street starts paying more due to how much income it can churn out. HPQ trades at less than 7 times forward earnings.

Title: What's behind Trump's feud with world's most powerful central banker

Trump's fight with Federal Reserve Chair Powell just took a new twist — sending stocks and the dollar lower and lifting gold. DW looks into whether a new criminal investigation could put the Fed's independence at risk. Federal prosecutors in the United States have launched a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's testimony to Congress on the $2.5 billion (€2.14 billion) renovation of the US central bank's headquarters in Washington, DC. Powell confirmed the probe Sunday in a statement posted on the social media platform X, hitting back at what he said was pressure from the Trump administration on interest rate policy. During US President Donald Trump's first term and since he returned to the White House one year ago, the pair have clashed repeatedly over interest rate decisions made by Powell The Fed chair has maintained that the central bank must set policy independently — guided by economic data rather than political pressure. Trump has grown increasingly vocal in his criticism of the Fed's decisions — notably in March, when the US central bank held interest rates steady. The president wrote on his Truth Social platform that the Fed would be "MUCH better off CUTTING RATES." In April's so-called Liberation Day announcement, Trump said lower rates would help the US economy deal with his sweeping new import tariffs on goods from major trading partners. After calling Powell "stupid" and a "numbskull," Trump went further in July after the Fed still failed to cut rates, saying the policy was "hurting people." That month, Trump even visited the Fed’s headquarters — the first such trip by a sitting president in decades — which was widely seen as expressing his dissatisfaction with Powell. Trump also moved against other senior Fed figures, including Governor Lisa Cook, whom he sought to remove over unrelated allegations. The subsequent litigation is awaiting a hearing in the US Supreme Court. By midyear, US media outlets reported that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had emerged as a front-runner to replace Powell when his term ends in May. He has since downplayed his candidacy. Other reports suggested that the Trump administration was sounding out a wider list of possible successors. More recently, US media outlets have focused on four candidates: longtime Trump loyalist Kevin Hassett, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, current Fed Governor Christopher Waller and BlackRock executive Rick Rieder. By the end of 2025, Trump said he would announce Powell's successor in January. The growing speculation underscored how much pressure the chairman was facing well before the criminal investigation became public over the weekend. The probe stems from Powell's appearance before the US Senate Banking Committee in June, when he downplayed cost overruns related to the Fed office renovation and unnecessary luxury features, including rooftop terraces and gardens, premium marble flooring and private art collections. Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott had raised concerns prompted by a New York Post article that likened the project to the French Palace of Versailles — the former royal residence near Paris commissioned by King Louis XIV. Powell pushed back at what he said were "inaccurate" and "misleading" claims and denied luxury add-ons, saying the project, which is self-funded by the Fed rather than via taxpayers, focused on modernization and long-term cost savings. A month later, Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna announced that she was referring Powell to the Department of Justice (DOJ), accusing him of perjury and making false statements. As the DOJ rarely comments on active investigations, a spokesperson for the agency declined to react to Powell's statement on Sunday, but said: "The Attorney General has instructed her US Attorneys to prioritize investigating any abuse of taxpayer dollars." In his video statement, Powell labeled the investigation as "unprecedented action," which he said is really linked to the Trump administration's pressure over interest‑rate policy. "This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings. ... Those are pretexts. ... This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions — or whether, instead, monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation," the Fed chair said. "Public service sometimes requires standing firm in the face of threats," Powell said, adding that he would continue to do the job "with integrity and a commitment to serving the American people." The probe caused a selloff in US stocks and the dollar on Monday, while Gold jumped to a record $4,600.33 per ounce. Trump has denied any knowledge of or involvement in the DOJ probe, but repeated his belief that Powell is "certainly not very good at the Fed and he's not very good at building buildings." In an interview with NBC News on Sunday night, Trump said: "What should pressure him [Powell] is the fact that rates are far too high — that's the only pressure he's got." As the central bank of the world's largest economy, the Fed's core mission is to set interest rates, keep inflation close to its 2% goal, support maximum employment and keep the financial system stable. It also supervises banks, acts as a lender of last resort during financial crises and helps keep credit flowing through the US economy, which has for decades also been the world's most attractive investment market. As the US dollar is the world's so-called reserve currency in which much of world trade is conducted, the Fed’s interest‑rate decisions have ripple effects globally, influencing borrowing costs, capital flows and economic growth far beyond the United States. The Fed is not funded by the US government; instead, it earns income from loans to corporate banks and its investments in US government bonds, currencies and other securities. The Fed's independence is widely seen as critical to avoid political pressure, which is often based on short-term goals because of the four-year US presidential election cycle. The bank's decisions to cut or raise interest rates are vital to prevent high inflation and steady the US economy during downturns. Though these moves may be unpopular among voters, proponents of Fed independence say handing interest rate control to elected politicians would risk destabilizing the economy. In reaction to the Powell probe, Capital Economics disputed whether central bank independence has helped keep inflation low historically and warned that high levels of public debt would make it harder to control price rises via interest rate hikes. But the London-based research house warned that "any shift away from monetary policy autonomy would send a worrying signal of a weaker commitment to maintaining low inflation." Many economists and corporate leaders believe that Trump's unprecedented tariffs have already hurt investor confidence in US sovereign debt and the economy's long-term future. Edited by: Uwe Hessler

Title: The Trevor Project receives $45M from MacKenzie Scott after difficult years and federal funding cuts

Time Published: 2026-01-12T17:52:34Z

By THALIA BEATY, Associated Press The Trevor Project, known for its hotline for LGBTQ+ youth, received $45 million from billionaire and author MacKenzie Scott at the end of 2025, the organization said Monday. The gift is the largest in the organization’s history but also a major boon following years of management turmoil, layoffs and the loss of significant federal funding over the summer. “I literally could not believe it and it took some time. I actually gasped,” said Jaymes Black, CEO of The Trevor Project, when they were notified of Scott’s gift. Scott, whose fortune largely comes from her ex-husband Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, gave more than $7 billion to nonprofits in 2025, but this gift to The Trevor Project was not included among the donations she disclosed on her website in December. Scott previously gave The Trevor Project $6 million in 2020. In July, the Trump administration stopped providing specific support for gay, trans and gender nonconforming young people who called the 988 National Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. The Trevor Project was one of the organizations staffing that option and lost $25 million in funding, the nonprofit said. The Trevor Project continues to run an independent hotline for LGBTQ+ young people that Black said reaches about 250,000 young people annually, but they served another 250,000 callers through the 988 Press 3 option, which was tailored for LGBTQ+ young people. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) reported more than 1.5 million contacts were routed through the service between Sept. 2022 and July 2025. The Trevor Project has gone through years of internal turmoil after exploding in size from an organization with an annual budget around $4 million in 2016 to over $83 million in 2023, according to its public tax returns. The nonprofit’s board removed its CEO in 2022 and has gone through a series of layoffs, including in July. Black said the project’s 2026 budget was $47 million. “We are a smaller organization than we were before,” Black said. “And we will continue to be really intentional and really mindful around growth and what growth really means for the organization.” After it lost the 988 funding, The Trevor Project launched an emergency fundraiser that brought in $20 million to date, Black said, which they also hope Scott saw as proof that the organization was determined to stick around and make it through this period. “MacKenzie Scott’s folks were clear, like this gift was made for long-term impact,” Black said, adding that they would take their time deciding how to use the funds. Thad Calabrese, a professor at New York University who researches nonprofit financial management, said it’s not at all uncommon for nonprofits that grow very quickly to run into financial problems. But he also said the cuts and general instability in especially federal funding for nonprofits has upended many organizations’ business models. “Academic research has often viewed public funding as very stable, as a signal to donors that you’ve arrived as an organization, but the reality is you are now also open to changing political fortunes,” he said. He said research is also unclear whether diversifying an organization’s revenue streams is always a better financial strategy. “You’re less dependent upon a few funders, but on the other hand, if you have a lot of different revenue streams, do you have the management capacity for that?” Calabrese asked, speaking generally and not commenting specifically on The Trevor Project. Scott has distinguished herself among the biggest individual donors by giving large, unrestricted gifts to nonprofits, often with a focus on equity or social justice. With the exception of an open call in 2023, she does not ask for project proposals nor accept applications. Despite the size of her gifts, which now often exceed the recipient organization’s annual budget, research from the Center for Effective Philanthropy has found that concerns about nonprofits misusing Scott’s funds or growing unsustainably have largely not been born out. Elisha Smith Arrillaga, vice president of research at the Center for Effective Philanthropy, said that’s likely because of the vigorous vetting that Scott’s team, the members of which are largely unknown, does before making gifts. She also said just like an investor might double down on a for-profit startup that’s struggling, some funders may still believe in an organization’s potential despite setbacks. “People make all different kinds of investments because they really believe in the outcomes that organization can make and what their gifts can do to help accelerate that,” Smith Arrillaga said. In an essay announcing her 2025 gifts, Scott said, “The potential of peaceful, non-transactional contribution has long been underestimated, often on the basis that it is not financially self-sustaining, or that some of its benefits are hard to track. But what if these imagined liabilities are actually assets? … What if the fact that some of our organizations are vulnerable can itself be a powerful engine for our generosity?” Black called Scott’s second gift “a powerful validation,” of The Trevor Project’s mission and impact, saying, “We’re calling this our turnaround story.” Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Title: Bitcoin is one of the ‘best-performing assets of this decade’ – Saylor

Time Published: 2026-01-12T17:00:14Z

If late 2025 tested Saylor’s conviction, early 2026 is beginning to confirm it. Strategy’s Michael Saylor has once again drawn attention to the impact of his company’s Bitcoin [BTC]-centric strategy, arguing that it has fundamentally reshaped its market performance. In a post shared on X, Saylor highlighted how the firm has outpaced most Wall Street heavyweights since pivoting to Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset on 10th August 2020. For those unaware, he usually refers to this period as the “Bitcoin Standard Era.” Backing his claim with comparative data, Saylor shared a chart tracking annualized returns across major assets during this timeframe. While Nvidia leads the pack with a staggering 1,557% surge and a 68% compound annual growth rate, Strategy ranks second overall. The company has posted gains of 1,173%, translating into annualized returns of 60%, placing it ahead of nearly all traditional equities and asset classes. Notably, even Bitcoin has delivered comparatively lower returns over the same period. Since August 2020, Bitcoin has risen 674%, equating to an annualized gain of roughly 45%. Taking to X, Saylor noted, “The best-performing assets of this decade are Digital Intelligence $NVDA, Digital Credit $MSTR, and Digital Capital $BTC.” Source: Michael Saylor/X Needless to say, this shift wasn’t driven by hype but by infrastructure. In 2025, digital assets moved beyond retail speculation and became a core part of global financial infrastructure. The rise of the “Bitcoin Treasury” model drove this shift. Following the approach popularized by Michael Saylor, more than 170 public companies adopted Bitcoin as a core reserve asset. By late 2025, NVIDIA further strengthened its dominance with the launch of its Blackwell and Rubin platforms. As a result, what once seemed like an extreme bet is now widely viewed as a survival strategy. Echoing Saylor’s sentiment, one X user added, Source: X However, not everyone was on the same page, as all-time Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff noted, “Yes, but all that changed toward the end of the decade when $MSTR tanked and $BTC fell. For the next decade the worst-performing assets will likely be Digital Credit MSTR and Digital Capital BTC.” This coincided with NVIDIA Corp. trading at $184.86, following a dip of 0.097%, yet maintaining a robust annual growth of 38.75%. In contrast, MSTR faced a sharper decline, trading at $157.33 after a 9.64% daily drop and a staggering 171.07% decrease over the past year. Meanwhile, BTC slipped to $90,467.38, marking a minor 0.14% dip and a broader 4% weekly decline according to CoinMarketCap. This shows that if the final quarter of 2025 served as a violent stress test for Michael Saylor’s conviction, the opening days of 2026 are proving to be his vindication.

Title: Bitcoin ETF redemptions explain why BTC stalled near $91k

Bitcoin’s rally stalled near $91,000 as BlackRock’s IBIT ETF led more than $300m in redemptions. Bitcoin’s rally stalled on 12 January as U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded another daily negative flow to cap the week. BlackRock’s IBIT led the selling and triggered a wave of real BTC transfers to Coinbase Prime. According to Lookonchain data, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a combined net outflow of 3,734 BTC on the day, equivalent to roughly $339 million at current prices. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust [IBIT] accounted for the bulk of that move, shedding 2,791 BTC, while Grayscale’s products lost a further 891 BTC. The selling came as Bitcoin struggled to hold above the $91,000–$92,000 range, failing to sustain a breakout after a brief rally earlier in the session. Blockchain data adds a crucial layer to the ETF flows. Arkham Intelligence shows that wallets linked to BlackRock’s IBIT sent large tranches of Bitcoin to Coinbase Prime within hours on 12 January. The transactions, visible on Arkham’s tracker, include a long series of transfers of 300 BTC each, alongside a smaller 143 BTC transaction. In total, the visible deposits exceed 3,400 BTC, broadly matching the size of IBIT’s reported daily outflow. Source: Arkham Intelligence Coinbase Prime is the primary settlement venue used by U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF issuers. When ETF shares are redeemed, authorized participants receive Bitcoin, which is typically routed through Prime before being sold into the spot market or redistributed across trading desks. The on-chain flows therefore suggest that BlackRock’s ETF redemptions were not simply accounting entries but translated into real Bitcoin being delivered into exchange liquidity pools. The data highlights a structural shift in how Bitcoin trades since the launch of spot ETFs. While ETFs initially acted as a powerful demand engine in 2024, they now operate in both directions. When investors withdraw capital, ETF issuers must source Bitcoin from custody and deliver it into the market, turning redemptions into direct sell-side pressure. On 12 January, BlackRock alone was responsible for nearly three-quarters of total Bitcoin ETF outflows, making IBIT the dominant driver of the day’s liquidity event. Grayscale’s products also continued to see outflows, though on a smaller scale. At the same time, Fidelity’s FBTC recorded a modest +87 BTC inflow, insufficient to offset the broader selling. Bitcoin attempted to extend its January recovery earlier in the day but was rejected above $92,000, before sliding back toward $91,000 as ETF-linked selling emerged. The timing of the Arkham-tracked deposits aligns closely with the intraday reversal, reinforcing the view that institutional flow, not retail sentiment, is now setting short-term price direction. With more than 1.29 million BTC now held across U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, even modest percentage shifts in investor positioning can translate into thousands of coins hitting the market in a single session. The episode underlines how Bitcoin has entered a new phase of market plumbing. ETF inflows and outflows are no longer just sentiment indicators; they now drive physical settlement flows that ripple directly into spot liquidity. BlackRock’s transfer of thousands of BTC to Coinbase Prime shows how quickly ETF demand can flip from absorption to distribution. Price action around key levels is now increasingly influenced by institutional portfolio decisions, rather than just speculative trading.

Title: Two Low-Cost Airlines Plan to Merge. Wall Street Likes the Deal.
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/two-low-cost-airlines-plan-to-merge-wall-street-likes-the-deal-algt-scny-11883381

Investors see sunshine for Sun Country Airlines stock following news that it plans to merge with another ultra-low-cost carrier. Sun Country (SNCY) shares were up some 12% Monday, a day after the airline agreed to combine with fellow ultra-low-cost carrier Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT) to "create a leading leisure-focused U.S. airline." Allegiant's stock was down about 6%. (Read Investopedia's live coverage of today's trading here.) Las Vegas-based Allegiant will acquire Minneapolis-based Sun Country for $1.5 billion in cash and stock, including $400 million of net debt. The deal might not not be the last move to consolidate the domestic low-cost space. Spirit Airlines owner Spirit Aviation (FLYY) entered the Chapter 11 restructuring process for the second time in less than a year in late August. Frontier Group (ULCC), the parent of Frontier Airlines, replaced longtime CEO Barry Biffle last month amid a sharply declining stock price. The deal, which would merge two low-cost air carriers, could herald more merger activity in the sector. Investors applauded the news that Sun Country and Allegiant planned to merge, with the companies seen as reliably profitable and serving complimentary markets. Upon closing, which is expected in the second half of 2026, Allegiant and Sun Country shareholders would own about 67% and 33%, respectively, of the combined company, which would continue under the Allegiant name. Each would operate separately until they obtain a single operating certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration. Allegiant CEO Gregory Anderson would serve as the combined company's CEO, while Sun Country CEO Jude Bricker would join the board and serve as an advisor to Anderson. The new company would be headquartered in Las Vegas but keep "a significant presence" in Minneapolis-St. Paul, according to the release announcing the deal. "Allegiant and Sun Country are well positioned to create one of the most adaptable and resilient airline models in the industry, with the ability to respond quickly to changing market conditions, traveler demand, and charter and cargo partner needs," the release said. The deal may not face substantial regulatory concern, as the carriers have served different markets. Allegiant flies routes with little competition from small cities, while Sun Country handles cargo flights for Amazon (AMZN), charter routes, and scheduled flights across the U.S. and to international destinations in Mexico, Canada, Central America, and the Caribbean. Deutsche Bank analysts called the deal a "merger of two equally well-run low-fare airlines" with reliably solid margins. "As two of the industry's most profitable airlines, we view them as 'equals,' particularly as they are the only two low-fare carriers that have been consistently profitable," they wrote.

Title: GOP Sen. Thom Tillis says he will block any of Trump’s Fed picks over investigation into Powell

Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) said Sunday he will block any of President Trump’s candidates for the Federal Reserve following news of the Justice Department’s criminal investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Tillis’ new stance could throw a monkey wrench into approval for any of Trump’s picks to lead the Fed or replace potential retirees — the Senate Banking Committee, which has 13 Republicans including Tillis plus 11 Democrats, must approve all central bank nominees. “If there were any remaining doubt whether advisers within the Trump Administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none. It is now the independence and credibility of the Department of Justice that are in question,” Tillis said in a Sunday statement. “I will oppose the confirmation of any nominee for the Fed — including the upcoming Fed Chair vacancy — until this legal matter is fully resolved,” added the senator, who is retiring. Powell’s term as chairman expires in May. It’s possible he could stay on as a Fed governor through 2028, though he has declined to comment on whether he will remain on the board. Powell confirmed Sunday that federal prosecutors have launched a criminal investigation into him related to the Fed’s renovation of its Washington, DC, headquarters — after months of Trump bashing the chairman as “Too Late Powell” for not slashing interest rates quickly enough. “No one — certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve — is above the law. But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration’s threats and ongoing pressure,” Powell said in a Sunday statement. “The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president,” he added. Fellow Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) echoed Tillis’ comments, accusing Trump of wanting to install a “sock puppet” to lead the central bank. “Trump is abusing the authorities of the Department of Justice like a wannabe dictator so the Fed serves his interests, along with his billionaire friends,” said Warren, who years earlier called Powell a “dangerous man.” “This Committee and the Senate should not move forward with any Trump nominee for the Fed, including Fed Chair.” Amid Trump’s broadsides against Powell, the White House has pressured Fed Governor Lisa Cook to step down, accusing her of mortgage fraud. Cook called those allegations “baseless.” Stephen Miran — Trump’s economic adviser who stepped into a seat vacated by Adriana Kugler — will see his term expire in January. There are also rumors about potential retirements from the board, such as Vice Chair Philip Jefferson. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett and former Fed governor Kevin Warsh are reportedly in the lead in the race to chair the Federal Reserve. BlackRock exec Rick Rieder and Fed governor Christopher Waller have also been interviewed for the position. Prosecutors are investigating Powell over his testimony last summer about the central bank’s renovations. During an interview with NBC News on Sunday, Trump denied any involvement in the criminal probe. “I don’t know anything about it, but he’s certainly not very good at the Fed, and he’s not very good at building buildings,” he said. “What should pressure him is the fact that rates are far too high. That’s the only pressure he’s got,” the president added. In December, Trump threatened to sue Powell for “gross incompetence,” adding that he’d love to fire him for not slashing rates at a fast enough pace. During an unrelated press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the president fumed at the ballooning costs of Powell’s multi-year renovation of Fed headquarters near the National Mall. “It’s going to end up costing more than $4 billion — $4 billion!” Trump said. “Highest price of construction per square foot in the history of the world.” Last summer, Trump said he wouldn’t fire Powell after the pair wore matching hard hats and toured the central bank’s building renovation project, the cost of which has jumped from $1.9 billion to $2.5 billion so far. On its website, the Fed attributed spending increases to unforeseen events, like unexpected costs of materials and labor, more asbestos than anticipated and toxic contamination in the soil. But the project will “reduce costs over time by allowing the Board to consolidate most of its operations,” according to the website. After their tour of the renovation site in July, Trump took questions from the press while Powell stood nearby. At one point, the president said the costs of the renovation were much higher than the latest price tag showed, but Powell quickly jumped in, saying Trump had included costs from a project completed years earlier.

Title: Porter injury 'didn't look promising' - Bleyendaal

Raf Diallo RTÉ Sport Journalist Leinster attack coach Tyler Bleyendaal has admitted that the calf injury Andrew Porter picked up in training last week "didn't look promising" amid a growing front row predicament for Ireland in the build up to the Guinness Six Nations. The New Zealander also said fellow international Paddy McCarthy's foot injury "didn't look great". The prop sustained what the province describe as a "significant foot injury" during Saturday's dramatic 25-24 win over La Rochelle in the Investec Champions Cup. Porter missed that match as a result of his own setback and both he and McCarthy will be assessed before further confirmation on the extent of their respective injuries. "Yeah, obviously, Paddy's didn't look too great for him to come off immediately, so hopefully we get some clarity in the next few days," Bleyendaal told RTÉ Sport on Monday. "We're hoping for the best but it really didn't look too great to be honest and Ports the same. "To come out late in the week with that injury and again, waiting for the official kind of diagnosis, but it didn't look promising that it was going to be a quick turnaround. "So we're going to have to dig in and it's next man up, and we're going to have to find a way. "I thought the guys on the weekend did a great job and Jerry (Cahir) came on and he put his best foot forward and we're going to have to just dig deep into the depth and we've got some guys coming back as well. "So we lose some, we get some and whoever is available is going to have to do their best." McCarthy's injury comes at a time when the 22-year-old has built up real momentum for province and nation, having been rewarded with four caps during Ireland's Autumn Nations Series campaign. It is unclear how long the former Blackrock College student will be sidelined for. But the timing is far from ideal with the potential of a maiden Six Nations campaign just around the corner. "It's never a great time if it's a serious injury but like you say he's been playing so well," Bleyendaal said. "He's been a really valuable player for us - both sides of the ball. From the attack side, he gets us great momentum, defensively he's really solid and I think his set-piece is always improving. "He's been really good for us there. Like you say, he's got that taste of the Irish camp and no doubt he would have been involved again or hopefully still will be and that's why we'll go and get an update on him. "And fingers crossed, because like you say, he's been improving with every game and I think he's definitely got that Irish ambition." Jerry Cahir, who signed a short-term contract after impressing in the Energia All-Ireland League, replaced McCarthy following his withdrawal on Saturday, and the 25-year-old impressed Bleyendaal. "He's packing down scrums against some of the world's best and now he's learning, he's getting his opportunity and he's trying to put it all out there," he said. "It's great reward to see that he can come through that pathway and opportunities do arise. But it's a credit to those guys and their attitude." Bleyendaal also reserved praise for the development of wing Joshua Kenny, who weighed in with two tries against La Rochelle to bring his total up to eight in just six games for Leinster. "Just taking every opportunity that he's been given and he's obviously got some ball in some space and he's finished some tries for us which is great," he said. "But he's put in so much work off the ball as well and he's making cover tackles or he's getting invovled or he's chasing kicks. "He's come in at the start of the pre-season with a great attitude and have just been really impressed with him. "He's willing to make errors but he does it at full speed. He learns and he's willing to make errors and learn again so he's going through that process. "But he's great to watch with ball in hand and space, so it's our goal to get him more opportunities." © RTÉ 2026.

Title: The Trevor Project receives $45M from MacKenzie Scott after difficult years and federal funding cuts

The nonprofit Trevor Project received a $45 million gift from billionaire MacKenzie Scott at the end of 2025 The Trevor Project, known for its hotline for LGBTQ+ youth, received $45 million from billionaire and author MacKenzie Scott at the end of 2025, the organization said Monday. The gift is the largest in the organization's history but also a major boon following years of management turmoil, layoffs and the loss of significant federal funding over the summer. “I literally could not believe it and it took some time. I actually gasped,” said Jaymes Black, CEO of The Trevor Project, when they were notified of Scott's gift. Scott, whose fortune largely comes from her ex-husband Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, gave more than $7 billion to nonprofits in 2025, but this gift to The Trevor Project was not included among the donations she disclosed on her website in December. Scott previously gave The Trevor Project $6 million in 2020. In July, the Trump administration stopped providing specific support for gay, trans and gender nonconforming young people who called the 988 National Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. The Trevor Project was one of the organizations staffing that option and lost $25 million in funding, the nonprofit said. The Trevor Project continues to run an independent hotline for LGBTQ+ young people that Black said reaches about 250,000 young people annually, but they served another 250,000 callers through the 988 Press 3 option, which was tailored for LGBTQ+ young people. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) reported more than 1.5 million contacts were routed through the service between Sept. 2022 and July 2025. The Trevor Project has gone through years of internal turmoil after exploding in size from an organization with an annual budget around $4 million in 2016 to over $83 million in 2023, according to its public tax returns. The nonprofit's board removed its CEO in 2022 and has gone through a series of layoffs, including in July. Black said the project's 2026 budget was $47 million. “We are a smaller organization than we were before,” Black said. “And we will continue to be really intentional and really mindful around growth and what growth really means for the organization.” After it lost the 988 funding, The Trevor Project launched an emergency fundraiser that brought in $20 million to date, Black said, which they also hope Scott saw as proof that the organization was determined to stick around and make it through this period. “MacKenzie Scott’s folks were clear, like this gift was made for long-term impact,” Black said, adding that they would take their time deciding how to use the funds. Thad Calabrese, a professor at New York University who researches nonprofit financial management, said it's not at all uncommon for nonprofits that grow very quickly to run into financial problems. But he also said the cuts and general instability in especially federal funding for nonprofits has upended many organizations' business models. “Academic research has often viewed public funding as very stable, as a signal to donors that you’ve arrived as an organization, but the reality is you are now also open to changing political fortunes,” he said. He said research is also unclear whether diversifying an organization's revenue streams is always a better financial strategy. “You’re less dependent upon a few funders, but on the other hand, if you have a lot of different revenue streams, do you have the management capacity for that?” Calabrese asked, speaking generally and not commenting specifically on The Trevor Project. Scott has distinguished herself among the biggest individual donors by giving large, unrestricted gifts to nonprofits, often with a focus on equity or social justice. With the exception of an open call in 2023, she does not ask for project proposals nor accept applications. Despite the size of her gifts, which now often exceed the recipient organization's annual budget, research from the Center for Effective Philanthropy has found that concerns about nonprofits misusing Scott’s funds or growing unsustainably have largely not been born out. That may be because Scott's team, the members of which are largely unknown, conducts extensive research on organizations before making grants. In an essay announcing her 2025 gifts, Scott said, “The potential of peaceful, non-transactional contribution has long been underestimated, often on the basis that it is not financially self-sustaining, or that some of its benefits are hard to track. But what if these imagined liabilities are actually assets? ... What if the fact that some of our organizations are vulnerable can itself be a powerful engine for our generosity?” Black called Scott's second gift “a powerful validation,” of The Trevor Project's mission and impact, saying, “We’re calling this our turnaround story.” ___ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported more than 1.5 million contacts were routed through the 988 service between Sept. 2022 and July 2025. Since the program’s end, The Trevor Project’s hotline has become even more central to mental health support for queer young people, said Scott Bertani, director of advocacy at the National Coalition for LGBTQ Health. “Their services fill a gap that generic crisis lines simply aren’t designed to meet, particularly for young people facing identity-based stress, isolation or rejection,” Bertani said in a statement. The Trevor Project has faced internal turmoil after its budget grew from around $4 million in 2016 to over $83 million in 2023, according to its public tax returns.

Elisha Smith Arrillaga, vice president of research at the Center for Effective Philanthropy, said that’s likely because of the vigorous vetting that Scott’s team, the members of which are largely unknown, does before making gifts. She also said just like an investor might double down on a for-profit startup that’s struggling, some funders may still believe in an organization’s potential despite setbacks. “People make all different kinds of investments because they really believe in the outcomes that organization can make and what their gifts can do to help accelerate that,” Smith Arrillaga said. In an essay announcing her 2025 gifts, Scott said, “The potential of peaceful, non-transactional contribution has long been underestimated, often on the basis that it is not financially self-sustaining, or that some of its benefits are hard to track.

January 12, 2026 This isn't my usual deep-dive article where I unpack a specific subject such as an app I built, my obsession with craft, or revisiting an old iPod. I set out to share a few reflections and musings on a year marked by personal and professional change. This was a year of stripping back to the essentials: where I live, how I work, and what I build. I've been running this site for just over 20 years now. I began writing it in my dorm room at Georgia Tech, hosted on a G4 Mac Mini1, as a way for me to share technical how-to guides and news. I used WordPress for the first handful of years, then the Ruby static site generator Jekyll for a decade. It wasn't until 2024 that I redesigned and rebuilt this site from scratch using Next.js.2 I'll be turning 40 years old in 2026, which is still surreal to me. For my entire career, I was always the younger one on the team, and what feels like a sudden shift means that's no longer true. In many ways, that change is actually a clarifying feeling. I'm more focused and fired up to do great work than I've ever been. I'm driven by the desire to craft great products: things I can be proud of working on. My framing shifted from "Can I help this team build this product?" to "Is this the problem I want to spend my best years on?" I've developed a visceral aversion to working in any environment where I don't feel like I can do the best work of my career. The view from the Sesame office in San Francisco where I now work My taste and judgment have compounded over these years. I've been through similar experiences that I can draw from across whatever I'm working on. Even on minor UI challenges alone, I'm still surprised at how often I pull inspiration from my time at Twitter where density was king and compact timelines ruled everything. I always try to keep that as just one input though, especially working in AI when so much is continually changing and you can't bring assumptions with you.3 Table of contents The year started with me finally selling the one-bedroom condo I had purchased a decade earlier. I completely regret purchasing that place. Not because it had major maintenance issues or anything like that, but because it was a horrible investment. I had it for 10 years and still lost money on it once you factor in the lower sale price, prep work to sell (staging, floor upgrades, painting), and associated fees. It was a relatively new building in a bustling shopping and restaurant area in Nob Hill near Russian Hill. The entire building was only nine years old when I bought my unit, so I only had minor maintenance tasks over the years. I loved living there. The unit was modern, had a good HOA, no issues with neighbors, and had 500/500 Webpass as the ISP (this was before fiber was commonplace and before Google Fiber purchased Webpass). The condo staged for sale. Why did I buy this place to begin with? I got it in 2015 when I was 29. I had been at Twitter for a few years and made some money from the Twitter IPO. I hated having roommates, and the alternative of paying $4,000–$5,000 a month to rent my own apartment didn't feel like a good idea. And at the time, it felt like you couldn't go wrong buying in San Francisco. More and more companies were becoming SF-based instead of Silicon Valley, and many friends and coworkers around me were buying homes too. I purchased it with 25% down and a 2.75% 7-year ARM mortgage from First Republic Bank (RIP, they were great). I figured seven years was plenty of time to either sell or refinance before the rates increased. That didn't help either. I moved to New York in 2019 and rented out my condo through a property management company that handled everything while I was out of state. I was in NYC for four years and lost money every month renting it out. Not to mention the property management company was horrible and a pain to deal with. My 7-year ARM's fixed period ended in mid-2022 while I was in New York while the rate was increasing monthly. By the time I sold the unit, my expired 2.75% ARM mortgage had exceeded 7.5%. It wasn't worth refinancing by then, I knew I wanted to sell it soon. My wife and I came back to San Francisco in 2023. That same horrible property management company forgot to have the tenant sign a lease (you had one job..), and the tenant ended up moving out unexpectedly a few months in. It lined up perfectly with the end of our apartment lease in New York, so we decided to head to San Francisco for a few months to fix up the condo, sell it, then head back to NYC. When we got back in January 2023, it wasn't a great time to sell, so we stayed. We didn't mind escaping the New York winter for a while, and the AI boom was starting to make SF feel alive again. We still love New York, but at the moment it really feels like if you work in tech and AI, you need to be here. The energy is palpable. We eventually got around to selling it at the start of 2025. I always thought selling it would be a hassle and that I would need to do upgrades to make it enticing. Well, it ended up being so much easier to sell than I expected. A former coworker introduced me to a small real estate agency; they were perfect. I dropped off the keys and they took it from there. They refinished the floors, upgraded some things in the bathroom, updated the heating system, painted, and staged. In less than two months, it sold. I received 11 offers: four competitive and three all cash. Even though I lost money on the sale all things considered, I had expected it to sell for considerably less given it was listed in January instead of the ideal time in spring. I learned my lesson with this place. I don't see myself purchasing a house in San Francisco anytime soon. The opportunity cost of the down payment alone stings. It would have tripled in a basic total U.S. stock market ETF over those 10 years. We've since been renting in Noe Valley for the last year. I finally have enough space and my own garage, so I moved over all of my stuff that had been stored with family: my Eames chair, Pro Display XDR, and old gear like this original iSight. Finding this rental was a huge challenge. Every evening for what felt like a year was spent scouring rental sites before we eventually found it off-market through a friend. At one point there was an apartment in Pacific Heights we loved so much we wrote a love letter (more common with purchases, not rentals), offered many months of cash up front, and even extra rent. There was just too much competition. I frequently hear from people saying they're moving to San Francisco in a month or two. My advice is always the same: start looking for your apartment as early as possible! 2025 started with an itch. After two and a half years of working on Rewind, then through its evolution to Limitless and the Limitless Pendant, I needed a change. I needed a new design and product challenge. In my time there, we really embodied what a startup is all about. We had a true customer focus, endless product iteration, countless product strategy refinements, and long hours sweating the details. We were a remote team of ~15-20 people in recent years. I was the only designer for a period and wrote about what this was like in The Startup Designer. The Limitless team at various offsites. We built a lot of stuff as we searched for product-market fit. Rewind was a native Mac app that captured everything you'd seen (via screen capture), said and heard (via opt-in meeting and audio recording), compressed it, and made it actionable. You could visually rewind time as well as search or ask AI to find anything you've seen. I loved that it had a local-first approach, private by design, and was a bit uncanny until you got used to it. An app that records your screen all the time? Crazy. But it worked. I would tell people that making Rewind was probably a similar user and marketing challenge to what the team at 1Password likely went through when they were starting out in the mid-2000s. "You want me to put all my passwords into this one app I'm supposed to trust with my digital life?" Crazy. But it worked. The Rewind Mac app. Bottom right: Rewind website I designed and built. We also made Rewind for iOS, then I spent some time diving into Windows development with C# and WinUI as we worked on a Windows app focused on using a local LLM. While the product had some challenges with search quality due to limitations from the local approach, I still think the Rewind concept is solid. Microsoft famously thought so too and created the Rewind-inspired Recall feature. There are some things I'd approach differently if Rewind were rebuilt from the ground up today: prioritize task-based workflows over pure recall, and explore using lightweight visual models for data classification. Rewind described on Lenny's podcast We then pivoted to a cloud-based product called Limitless, largely as a result of feeling limited by what we could achieve with Rewind's local-based approach. There was the cross-platform Limitless web and desktop app, and then the React Native mobile app. The Limitless.ai website I designed and built with lots of design details. My favorite detail was custom animating cursors when you selected a new Pendant color. Limitless started with meeting recording and summary functionality. That was a recurring use case people had with Rewind. While I personally felt that functionality wasn't the most exciting thing to work on, nor did it have staying power with countless meetings-focused competitors working on the exact same thing, we had an ambitious roadmap. The goal was to continually add more data sources over time for context. One of those data sources was to be our own hardware, the Limitless Pendant, to capture in-person meetings and conversations to help differentiate us from competitors. Early versions of Limitless for iPhone I designed. The Pendant was a bold bet, but after a year of building its companion app and dogfooding it, I realized it wasn't a product for me. I take privacy extraordinarily seriously and lean introverted, so I wasn't exactly comfortable wearing a recording device out of the house and asking for consent every time I encountered someone new. On top of that, my wife wasn't comfortable with me wearing it at home either. The product had real use cases, and we heard about that consistently from customers, but it wasn't for me. Meanwhile, the tech industry was exploding as LLM capabilities improved at a rapid clip and I felt like I was watching from the sidelines. Agents, deep research, multimodal models, new interaction paradigms... I wanted to be at the forefront of that. The opportunity cost felt too high. My heart wasn't in it, and I decided to leave. The Rewind and Limitless story came to a close some months later at the end of 2025 with a Meta acquisition. It felt like a great time for the team to join a larger company with the means to really compete with AI hardware and services coming out across the industry. It was a well-deserved exit for the team. Financially, I received a modest sum for shares I had early exercised, and for my vested in-the-money stock options. I had also previously sold some equity5 right after the company's last public round. I'll likely put some of it toward a few angel investments. I've done several angel investments in the past, mostly in crypto companies like Rainbow and XMTP (the messaging protocol now used by Coinbase Base and World). However, I've declined to do them more regularly because I feel that to do a good job, you need to have the time and bandwidth to stay on top of deal flow—seek it, meet the founders, and maybe you end up investing in 1 out of every 10+ teams you come across. After leaving Limitless, I gave myself permission to slow down before jumping into something new. I ended up taking four months off, though it didn't really feel like time off at all. I was meeting with founders, companies, and VCs for weeks, and also spent time I was working on my design portfolio.In hindsight I went overkill on the portfolio—I had two versions, the most comprehensive of which was 177 slides—but the act of doing it was a great way to reflect on how I worked, what gave me energy, and what drained it. My wife made the most of me no longer working nights and weekends, and we ended up taking a few trips. First to Germany and Austria, then later to Milan and Lake Como for a friend's birthday. Altaussee and Hallstatt, Austria. I haven't traveled with my big Sony a7R IV in some years. I get by with my iPhone, shooting in RAW and minor edits in Darkroom app. I stopped consuming caffeine entirely in 2025. It was during the trip to a medical health resort called MayrLife on Lake Altaussee, Austria that made that happen. This place was strict: a set schedule with strict meal times along with no caffeine or alcohol. The alcohol part was fine, but getting off of caffeine was a challenge. I had zero alcohol in all of 2024 and maybe just 5 drinks for all of 2025. I just don't really care for it anymore, and never loved the feeling of feeling something the next morning even if I only had two cocktails the night before. After the first full year of zero alcohol, it's like I was rewired and completely don't even care for alcohol anymore. I'll have some non-alcoholic beers and mocktails at times, of course. I had been used to having a 2-3 strong cups of coffee every day. I ended up having about 4 or 5 days of caffeine withdrawal migraines as I went cold turkey. After that, I decided I didn't want to go back to my normal coffee routine. I still love coffee and have a cup of decaf every morning though. I've learned all about the different kinds of decaf processes like Swiss Water Process (chemical free; the lowest caffeine but the worst taste) and Ethyl Acetate (best taste). My current decaf favorite is by Perc Coffee, but I'm still trying out others I'm discovering on the r/decaf subreddit. Lake Como, Italy. Went for my friend Ashley's birthday. After the initial withdrawal issues, staying off of caffeine wasn't that bad. Decaf coffee doesn't dehydrate you during the day, which is something I could feel. I used to rely on melatonin and sometimes magnesium to more easily fall asleep at night after a day of coffees, but now I don't need that either. The biggest downside is that while I love the flavor of coffee it's harder to find good decaf options at coffee shops. If they do have decaf, it's likely just one kind and only served as an americano, not pour over or brewed. I also took the time to hit reset and simplify a few other things in my life. On the nerdy side, I got rid of the two servers I had been running for a while. I had one server that managed this website's email newsletter, that I publish to very infrequently. I had been using a self-hosted web app called Sendy that uses AWS SES to send emails cheaply. I ditched that in favor of Kit. But between that and my other server I used to host my personal Mastodon instance, I hated having to login every few weeks to install an update or fix something. It's a small thing, but it freed up mental space.6 I stopped wearing my Apple Watch too. I was constantly annoyed by all the useless notifications and buzzing on my wrist. While I appreciated the health tracking functionality, I wanted to simplify. It didn't start as an overnight consciousness decision. I got a simple Casio F-91W watch, changed the strap and started wearing it some days. Eventually that became everyday. Half of what I appreciate is that it's not a smartwatch. The other half I appreciate is that it's just so small and lightweight. I wrote down what was critical to me as I started thinking about what I wanted in a new role. At the end of the day, I wanted to work with an exceptionally talented team, at the forefront of AI, with leadership and a CEO who genuinely care about quality, and as little organizational friction as possible between us and an outstandingly well-crafted product. I wasn't in a rush to find the next thing. I had time and wanted to optimize for seeing what was out there first. I'm often reminded of How To Be Successful by Sam Altman, where he writes: “I am willing to take as much time as needed between projects to find my next thing. But I always want it to be a project that, if successful, will make the rest of my career look like a footnote.” Being in San Francisco and being public about the fact that I was looking for my next thing was like a cheat code for that process. My days were filled as I met with several dozen founders, companies, VCs and friends. Every founder and team I met with had a unique perspective on where the world is heading, and they were fighting through the ambiguity to get there. It's still wild to me that this level of energy and ambition is just par for the course in San Francisco. I'm grateful to folks who took time to chat with me: A few things crystallized from all these conversations: All of this helped me articulate exactly what I wanted next after talking with small teams and large teams. I'm happiest, most productive, and most ambitious working on 0→1 products and bold bets that scratch at something new in AI, where there's a shared understanding of quality. I would much rather be the first designer tasked with creating an app or site from scratch than a designer or manager on a team of dozens responsible for just a sliver of an app. Not on a team of dozens optimizing something that already exists. I wanted to stay close to the craft while also growing a team. When I began this process, I actually thought I wanted to optimize for compensation and go to a late-stage, pre-IPO, or public company. I had always felt like you wanted to alternate between riskier early-stage startups and late-stage companies in your career so you wouldn't get "behind" with savings and investments. It became clear to me that was not where my heart was at all. I needed to work on something I was beyond passionate about with a team that shared that desire. Sesame ended up being everything I was looking for and more. It's been phenomenal across the board: the shared appreciation and ambition for excelling at craft, the remarkable team comprised of industry veterans, and the bold bets we're making on the product we're building. Yes… I know everyone says this about their company when they join, but that's really how I feel. I've never worked somewhere that truly cared about craft and understood it this much. A lot of that is due to the CEO, Brendan Iribe, who was one of the founders of Oculus VR. Brendan reached out after I published Browse No More. He's one of those founders I was alluding to in the previous section: someone who's really, really good at speaking about the importance of what the team is building, about taste, and about how great products are made. Sesame team offsite in Skamania, Washington I've been on enough teams to know that it really doesn't matter if various executives on the leadership team say quality matters. In my experience, it has to come directly from the CEO too. Brendan gets it; for software and for hardware. I later met the rest of the team, including the CPO Nate Mitchell (also one of the founders of Oculus VR), and it was clear this was a team I needed to work with. We're building both software and hardware. On the software side, we're building what we call personal agents. They're not productivity assistants, they're more like a collaborator and thought partner you just talk with. But even that description doesn't do our ambitions here justice. They're much more than that. We've been focusing on making them remarkably lifelike. That comes across in their unique personalities and how they carry the conversation. It's the sort of thing you need to experience to see what I mean: you can try our research preview released earlier in 2025 that over a million people have used. We're also working on an iOS app—you can get on the waitlist here. "This is not another productivity assistant. It's something different: a lifelike, expressive collaborator—designed to engage and evolve with its user over time." The second piece is hardware. We're making the world's best intelligent eyewear. They're fashion-forward and made for all-day comfort. Sequoia has more details on both our software and hardware in their article A New Era for Voice. The mission we talk about that I really love is that we're working towards bringing the computer to life with our hardware and focus on voice-first AI. We've been saying "software is eating the world" for 15 years now. Now as AI is eating software, hardware is becoming the new distribution and interaction frontier for AI. I'm not saying we won't have phones in 5 years (I still absolutely love mine), but I'm eager to spend time collaborating with the team here to see what these new interfaces will enable. "Hardware becomes a more popular moat (amid a surge of hardware startups). In a world where everyone can make their own software, unique products will emerge that tightly couple hardware and software." —Scott Belsky Sesame San Francisco one week when the NYC and Bellevue teams were visiting. Top: I'm on the left And after five years of almost entirely working from home, I'm thrilled to be back in an office. When covid started, I thought I'd never go back to the office. I loved having my own desk setup and being able to focus. Now I just miss working with people, whiteboarding design ideas, and perfecting prototypes right next to teammates. Also, teams building hardware kind of need to be in person with the number of physical prototypes we're continually crafting and testing out. It's been six months since I joined as Sesame's Head of Design, based out of our San Francisco office. My current day-to-day is heavy on design and code (Figma & Xcode for our iOS app)9 and helping out with things across product, hardware, brand, and marketing. We've got a lot in store for design this year across mobile, web, brand, and hardware. It's always a fun design challenge to work beyond just software product design. Basheer Tome joined my team to focus on hardware design, interaction design, prototyping, and everything in between. He had previously worked on Google Glass, Google Pixel Buds, autonomous driving, and all sorts of projects spanning PM, ID and CMF at Fellow. I'm looking forward to growing our design team this year. I'm the only software product designer at the moment10, and am looking to hire a seasoned product designer to work closely with me in our San Francisco office with a focus on visual design with a passion for craft and design engineering. We're hiring for quite a few different roles outside design too. I finally perfected my home office setup. For the two years prior I had a small desk in the bedroom at my previous place. Once we moved, I finally had space to build things out the way I wanted. I had room for my iMac G3 and vintage gadgets, a much larger 72x30" standing desk, and a lounge chair behind it. I also finally shipped my Pro Display XDR to San Francisco from where it had been in storage at my in-laws' house on the East Coast. iMac G3, Studio Display, Pro Display XDR, Glove80 keyboard, Uplift Standing Desk with custom LED lighting. For the last decade, I've had occasional wrist pain during extended computing sessions, but I have it under control these days with a combination of an adjustable desk (kept low enough so my elbows are properly angled), the Glove80 split ergonomic ortholinear keyboard, a Logi Lift vertical mouse, and a wrist brace for long sessions. Using a keyboard like the Glove80 (or similar models like the Kinesis Advantage2 I used before it) takes some getting used to, but it's worth it if you're in a similar boat with wrist pain from RSI. Separately, I try to use AI voice dictation apps like Aqua to speak instead of type when I can. I haven't quite built that habit yet. I've been thinking about getting a gooseneck desk mic for the office, like some other coworkers have, to do this more often. I've made a few other additions to my gear recently, but the standouts are my 333MHz Revision D iMac G3 from 1999, my original iSight camera, and my new OWC 4-bay M.2 SSD RAID enclosure. With the latter I've also started using Immich to manage my photos (hosted on my Mac, behind Tailscale) and will probably migrate my Google Photos to it. I've been meaning to post a much more in-depth article about the iMac. I updated the RAM, converted the HD to an SLC NAND flash CompactFlash card, and applied new thermal paste to the CPU heatsink. So much nostalgia. Ironically, I now work in the office on weekdays, so the setup doesn't get as much use anymore. I purchased a car for my commute, the newly redesigned 2025.5 Audi SQ5 SUV. I haven't had a car since I sold my E92 M3 about 7 years ago. Mechanically, it's great: quick, makes a nice sound, and overall fun to drive. The rest is just okay. The interior design leaves a lot to be desired. There's ugly piano black plastic everywhere and too many controls are touch-based. Driving to work… notice the check engine light that comes on and off randomly. Take it from me: don't buy the first year of a new car generation. But the icing on the cake is the garbage computer system. Not the infotainment system (though I really dislike that it lacks a traditional tachometer gauge cluster setting), but the whole car's computer system has been remarkably buggy. Various warnings and check engine lights constantly come on and then vanish on their own. I took it in for service just a month after I purchased it. They kept it for more than a week and the issues persisted. Others on Reddit are having similar problems and hope an upcoming software update will fix everything. I've definitely learned my lesson about buying a new generation car. Okay it's not an app, but I love taking notes, sketching UI designs and scratching off to-do list items in Mnemosyne x Kleid notebooks with my Baronfig Squire. I also love Uchida Le Pens for sketching too. I've gone through a few in 2025. Dia has been my primary browser for the majority of 2025. After living with Arc for the few years prior, I'm really accustomed to a browser with side tabs. I've tried to get into the ChatGPT Atlas browser and Perplexity's Comet browser but they never stuck for me, even with the promise of all their agentic functionality. I just don't really have a huge need to automate things just yet. Actually, I take that back, I would but the few times I've tried current solutions they were too slow and inaccurate. Maybe later in 2026. About 99% of what I have AI do in a browser for me is summarize long articles, and I use both Dia's integrated chat for that, and recently, Anthropic's Claude browser extension for that. I just hope that Dia keeps its craft and charm even after its parent company's acquisition by Atlassian. Flighty for insanely good flight tracking. I don't fly that much and this app is still worth every penny. I get notified of flight delays before the airlines send notifications. I can more easily look up alternate routes, see where the inbound plane is, and more. It's just a delightfully well-crafted app. Yuka lets you look up the health impact of various food and cosmetic items. My wife and I use it often to make better choices when shopping, such as avoiding harmful chemicals. There are a few apps like it but it's simple and works well. It does not have data about microplastics (you should definitely take a look at Nat Friedman's PlasticList) yet unfortunately, but other apps like Olive and Oasis Health do. These days we're much more mindful about what we bring into the house and have replaced pans with non-toxic ceramic ones, plastic cutting boards with oiled wood ones, avoiding certain dish detergents, et cetera. Mercury is hands down the best personal banking app and bank out there. There's an annual fee but you get a lovely, well-designed modern app with things like automatic transfer rules to move money around (e.g., don't keep cash in checking, always move to HYSA) and support for sending wires really easily. NetNewsWire combined with Feedbin is my RSS reader setup of choice. NNW has been around since I had a G4 Mac Mini in my college dorm in 2004. Great, simple piece of software. Though I do wish it had slightly more robust search functionality. Things has been my to-do list app for many years. Simple, well-built apps for desktop and phone. I have a few minor design gripes with it (what designer wouldn't have strong thoughts about their to-do list app) but it gets the job done. There's an unofficial Things MCP server I've been meaning to integrate into my workflow too. Raindrop is where I send articles I want to read later, curate design inspiration, save interesting links, and everything in between. It also saves a permanent copy of each link you bookmark so it's still accessible even if that page ceases to exist on the web. I try to go through it weekly to organize and review what I've saved. Obsidian (with the Cupertino theme) is my catch-all for daily notes and more. I pay for Obsidian Sync service too. While I have various folders for different types of documents from outlines and drafts of blog posts to documents for ideas, I primarily use it for work. I create a new file each week where I write notes for the week. At the bottom of each week's document I keep a running to-do list. At the end of each day I'll reprioritize that list or write down an action plan if I'm in the middle of a large task so I'm prepared the next morning. While I really love Obsidian, it's not perfect. Searching for files is really, really rough in my experience. I need to keep things in organized folders as I know I'll need to find them later and can't rely on search. Also, despite a robust developer community, there's not yet an amazing LLM solution. Fortunately everything in Obsidian is flat files, so I often use Claude Code with my Obsidian vault for things like synthesizing summaries and themes across a lot of files. And finally, the other thing I don't love about Obsidian is the mobile app navigation. It's likely a downside of it being a highly-extensible and cross-platform app, instead of a more opinionated native iOS app. Despite using all these apps for notetaking, saving, and curating, I don't really like the term second brain for this PKM stack. This quote below from I Deleted My Second Brain resonates with me to a degree, and I sometimes find myself saving things I never revisit. "The “second brain” metaphor misfits how human memory works: associative, embodied, and purposefully forgetful. When I first started using PKM tools, I believed I was solving a problem of forgetting. Later, I believed I was solving a problem of integration. Eventually, I realized I had created a new problem: deferral. The more my system grew, the more I deferred the work of thought to some future self who would sort, tag, distill, and extract the gold. That self never arrived."" 2025 was the year of coding agents for me (and everyone else too). It's a remarkable, remarkable tool. At the start of the year I mostly used Cursor for smaller tactical changes, but I quickly became heavily dependent on Claude Code. It just kept getting better throughout the year. "Claude Code (CC) emerged as the first convincing demonstration of what an LLM Agent looks like - something that in a loopy way strings together tool use and reasoning for extended problem solving. In addition, CC is notable to me in that it runs on your computer and with your private environment, data and context." —Karpathy There's many articles online on the proper way to configure and use Claude Code, how to put skills, agents, and CLAUDE.md to work for you, but this thread from the Claude Code creator in particular is worth a scroll: Tools like Claude Code still need constant babysitting and can sometimes get stuck in a loop, trying the same solutions that didn't work. I find it critical to try out other models regularly, even for the same task. For example, I get the feeling that Sonnet/Opus aren't amazing at more advanced or recent SwiftUI tasks. In a recent example it gave me the old GeometryReader hack for getting scroll offset from a ScrollView instead of the single .scrollPosition() modifier I wanted. These days I'm usually bouncing between Claude Code (usually via their official extension inside Cursor, which has nice expandable inline diffs) and Gemini 3 Pro via Cursor Agents. I don't have a set workflow. Sometimes I'll have Opus make a plan, then have GPT poke holes through it before Claude Code implements. I've also dabbled with tools like Conductor. Aside from the obvious desire for faster and smarter models that just nail each task, there's one thing I wish these tools were better at: undo. I know version control is technically my job. Git exists. But when I'm iterating quickly on a specific piece of functionality, I want to easily roll back to the last known good version without thinking about it. That's often from a previous agent response. I can leave a trail of commits behind me, but that doesn't look great on a PR. I can spend more time amending commits or dealing with git rebase, but that's friction I'd rather avoid. This feels like something these tools themselves should help with. Cursor, for example, doesn't have diffs for each agent response. If you want to undo the last change, you have to ask the LLM to do it, wait, and hope nothing else unexpected is changed in the process. Compare that to just discarding changes if you'd made a git commit. Much of what I do is design something from scratch in Figma, get it to around 90% or to a point where I have a few options I can't decide between without trying them out, and then begin building it. Figma is very much still a starting point. Lots of iteration—in aesthetics, interactions, and logic—happens while I'm building and feeling it out with real builds.11 For me that even meant going deep on working with metal shaders this past year: an area that seemed too complex to approach previously.12 However, I will sometimes use Figma MCP to help speed up parts of the development workflow. The act of building and testing out as you build is what design is all about to me. It rapidly surfaces new ideas for iterations and directions. There should have never been a design to engineering "handoff" phase. It's the same thing. Every designer should be a design engineer too. Being able to more rapidly build designs and interactions also means you no longer have to scratch your head trying to decide if you should come up with a long dissertation about why a certain piece of feedback from a peer or executive isn't worth pursuing. Most of the time, you can just try it out and see how it feels that day. Don't close off paths too soon. The biggest shift in design has not been on the visual design front for me. I don't necessarily need production assets with models like Nano Banano Pro, nor are there any UI design tools good enough yet to truly enhance my visual and UI design workflow… yet. I've tried to use them for coming up with design inspiration for things like iconography and brand design tasks at times, but haven't found anything that truly enhances my workflow yet. Designers need to push on what AI isn't good at yet. To me, that means constantly seeking inspiration, curating, and communicating well. Always be curious. You need to constantly be seeking information and inspiration. It can come from anywhere. Archive what feels good, interesting, or provocative to you. Hone your taste. The best designers I know are always curating. Some on Are.na and X. Some just in their own Figma moodboards. Some with link saving tools like Raindrop. Build that habit. With Claude Code, Cursor Agents, and dozens of other AI dev tools anyone can build for themselves now. We're entering the era of rapidly created, personalized and bespoke software. It's going to seem even more insane this year. Just because you can, doesn't mean you should. The hard part now isn't building. It's restraint in this world where we have more capabilities than ever. I've noticed this industry is a bit too trigger-happy to jump into Claude Code and start generating, then immediately commit what was one-shotted. Maybe we should all be doing our own product plan mode outside of Claude Code's plan mode. Taking a step back to ask what we're actually building and why before we start. It's too easy to skip the product thinking and strategy. That's the necessary but slow and hard work of deciding what should exist, why, and who it's for in the first place. What I'm referring to is just the normal product development process we've been doing for decades. Nothing new here. Just a reminder to not skip it when AI makes the building process closer and closer to a single button press. As I design things I'm continually in a loop asking myself things like: Similarly, even if AI does make something for you and does it well, quality can drop fast if you're not careful to polish and clean up everything afterwards. For code quality and product design quality. Always polish it yourself. That's where craft lives. Everyone's building some sort of agentic assistant right now. Connect your calendar. Integrate your email. Take actions. It all feels the same. A lot of assembled parts. Too many teams skip the hard parts: personality that builds trust, memory that truly enables continuity, and extensibility that meets you where you are. They also don't think enough about the why. Okay, so you can access my calendar… now when and why am I supposed to use this? That's why too many of these tools today feel like packaged slop. Personality and memory are what make these tools feel familiar and natural, not merely transactional. When GPT-4o was retired after GPT-5 launched, people were genuinely upset. They had gotten attached to how 4o wrote, how it felt. That's not nothing. As AI becomes more ubiquitous, more ambient—even worn—this will only matter more. Even in quick interactions, the wrong tone and style is immediately clocked. Personality, memory, and extensibility form the defining triad of future agentic systems that you'll want to use: It's time to stop thinking about building these systems as a series of LEGO bricks to slap together. 2025 was a lot of change compressed into twelve months—new job, new house, new daily habits. Most of it came down to getting rid of stuff, physically and mentally, that were getting in the way. Now I'm at Sesame working on problems I actually want to solve with people who care about the same things I do. This has been a lengthy article… a lot longer than I had originally planned. If you made it this far, thank you for reading. While I've been religiously saving interesting links and articles for inspiration in Raindrop, one thing I've started doing in the last year is maintaining a single markdown file where I paste interesting design-related quotes and related things. I wanted to close this article with a few of those. I always like to refer to old computer and operating system reference material and designs for inspiration. The creators of these systems started from what felt like a blank canvas, drawing on things like the desktop metaphor, to build what we have today. I try to get myself into the mindset they might have been in when thinking about the next generation of computing we'll have with AI. Palm webOS is a great one too… I got a Palm Pixi Plus recently: "People aren't trying to use computers—they're trying to get their jobs done." —Apple, Human Interface Guidelines: The Apple Desktop Interface (1987) On seeing things fresh and getting unstuck: "[…] looking closely at the micro level can unblock you for understanding the macro level. […] Pirsig's Brick is a tool for seeing things freshly “without primary regard for what has been said before” which creates that perfect tension of challenge and ability enabling flow." —Jordan Moore, How to Dismantle a Creative Wall "But there's a paradox at the heart of design that's rarely discussed: the discipline that most profoundly determines how lasting and inspiring a work of design can be is a designer's ability to look away — not just from their own work, but from other solutions, other possibilities, other designers' takes on similar problems. […] The most innovative solutions often come from designers who are aware of conventions but not beholden to them. […] This discipline of looking away preserves the singularity that makes great design resonant. When we constantly reference existing solutions, our work inevitably gravitates toward the mean. […] This is perhaps the most difficult discipline in design — harder than mastering software, harder than learning color theory, harder than understanding grids and proportions. It requires confidence to trust your own vision when countless examples of "how it's done" are just a search away. It demands the courage to pursue a direction that hasn't been validated by others. —Christopher Butler, Good Design Comes from Looking, Great Design Comes from Looking Away On design conviction: "There's an important rule of prototyping: find the fun first and build from there. In all of your brainstorming, you need to determine what is actually fun to play. Sometimes a really complex or interesting system is compelling to plan out, codify, and parse as an algorithm… but then turns out to be lackluster to engage with. Keep moving. Find this fun as fast as possible, and don't accept anything less. Your players won't either." —Andrew Zigler, MUD Cookbook: design meets implementation "Conviction often stands in opposition to market trends. To have conviction before validation may make you seem weird or delusional, but it defines great artists—the ability to appreciate what others overlook or even fight against." —Willem Van Lancker, Design Literacy "Hayden, you can't change the world. It's not possible. All you can do is try to make your own world and then invite other people to be a part of it." —George Lucas to Hayden Christensen On soul: In its purest form, design is poiesis. It is drawing ideas from the ether. It's a Muse. "Beautifully designed products without soul, are just that: representational garden art. In all of our history, we've never had more money to design beautiful, functional and usable products. The bar is higher than ever, yet, they've never been more boring and devoid of soul." —Steyn Viljoen, Beautiful, boring, and without soul On software today, especially with this era of personalized software: "software isn't just functional anymore. it's quietly turned into a lifestyle brand, a digital prosthetic we use to signal who we are, or who we wish we were.[…] people don't just use these apps. they use them to imagine themselves differently. more organized. more intentional. more in control. apps like superhuman or linear aren't just tools, they're lifestyle upgrades. software that feels like a reward. a signal that you care about your time, your taste." —you are what you launch: how software became a lifestyle brand "We stopped doing the real thing that would be the most empathetic, useful, and that would actually serve business outcomes best: building stuff that worked well and that people would love." —Jenny Wen, Don't trust the (design) process As for books, I did not read much at all in 2025 and really need to change that in 2026, similar to my 2017 goal of reading 24 books. I'm currently reading The Soul of A New Machine and The History of the Future: Oculus, Facebook, and the Revolution That Swept Virtual Reality. I'll probably find more from this list of books mentioned on Hacker News. 1 After 20 years, I finally got my G4 Mac Mini back. The person I sold it to reached out after noticing my gear pages where I've been collecting vintage gadgets and asked if I wanted my old Mac Mini back. I need to add it to my gear section. I have an old Intel Mac Mini too. 2 I've been running this site for half my life. These days I mainly just try to keep my gear pages updated frequently, and then only focus on an article when I have some topic I want to go deep on, a perspective I think is unique and worth unpacking, or generally just something I want to nerd out on. That tends to mean about one longer article per year, which is fine with me. Work consumes a lot of my time and I'm passionate about designing and building great products. 3 Also, I've worked with too many people who use their past experiences as the primary input for a decision. That's not only the wrong approach all too often, but it also makes everyone around them resent their unwillingness to consider new ideas and perspectives (or even just entirely different culture, values, quality, people). Not to mention.. do you know how annoying it is to keep hearing, "When I was at [company], we did X."? I always, always try to catch myself when I'm about to say that about my time at Twitter or another past company. 4 Even with fresh daily contacts, they're still nowhere near as comfortable as glasses on my eyes. Glasses are just easier and I've started collecting eyewear I really like, such as Mr. Leight and Lindberg. 5 Not being emotional with investments like that and being quick to diversify is something I learned after being at Twitter for 9 years where the stock was performing pretty poorly most of the time. Whenever I'd vest new RSUs and have an open trading window I'd immediately sell them. The logic there was "if you had $X in cash right now, would you go out and buy Twitter stock?" The answer for me was usually no. 6 Mastodon didn't quite pan out. I got really excited about the prospect of owning and hosting my own social media back when the Twitter exodus began in 2023… but it was never quite as active over there (same with Threads and Bluesky), and I still prefer Twitter/X. 7 I stopped the process with one company after meeting the CEO I would have worked with who lacked that energy. Instead, it felt like they sucked all the energy from the conversation. 8 5-10 years ago it felt like there was a wave of designers that figured success was going on the management track early (after sometimes just 2 years as an IC) when on a large team and we had bloated teams with too many managers that slowly lost touch of craft over time. Now they're having a hard time getting back into IC. Similarly, designers that don't do well with 0-1 design from scratch, for example without relying on existing design systems, will have a harder time operating on these smaller, craft-focused teams. AI tools today can't help that much on the visual design side, and people lacking those foundational skills will need to find ways to adapt. 9 My 2.5 years endlessly designing, building, then redesigning and rebuilding every part of my app Stocketa prepared me well for sweating the front-end details. Lately I've also been touching some metal shaders as well. 10 We do, however, have quite a few hardware product designers and industrial designers. 11 The new problem is now when people ask for a specific Figma mock of something in the app; the latest version is in the app and it's much more work to go back and update Figma mocks to be production accurate. Probably a product opportunity for Figma there. 12 Dan Hollick's Making Software chapter about shaders is a great read. Paul Stamatiou Paul Stamatiou is a designer who codes, based in San Francisco. He's the Head of Design at Sesame, designed at Twitter for nine years, and has written here for 20 years. Read more »

Posted on 01/12/2026 7:27:30 AM PST by lasereye Nvidia and Palantir's competitive AI edges won't last, argues Michael Burry Famed for predicting the housing market crash and a vocal skeptic of the AI boom, Michael Burry is now invoking one of the world's most famous investors to add gravitas to his argument. Burry used an escalator built by Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK.A) Chairman Warren Buffett, in a department store he owned in the late 1960s, to illustrate how vast AI spending may not leading to value accruing across its supply chain. "When the department store across the street put an escalator in, he had to, too. In the end, neither benefited from that expensive project. No durable margin improvement or cost improvement, and both were in the same exact spot. That is how most AI implementation will play out," Burry said in a discussion with Jack Clark, Anthropic co-founder, and leading podcaster Dwarkesh Patel that published on Substack. That is why "trillions of dollars of spending with no clear path to utilization by the real economy is so concerning," Burry, who was famously portrayed in "The Big Short" for spotting the subprime bubble, told moderator and newsletter writer Patrick McKenzie. Berkshire Hathaway purchased Baltimore's Hochschild-Kohn department store in 1966 - it was sold three years later - through a company called Diversified Retailing that later merged with the conglomerate. Buffett described in a 1989 letter to shareholders how he learned that a bad business model couldn't be fixed by a cheap price. Like the two department stores, most companies involved in the AI supply chain will see the same benefits if ,any, and none will have a competitive advantage, Burry said. As for Nvidia (NVDA) and Palantir (PLTR) - he has big bearish bets against those companies on the view they are overvalued - he says their current advantage with selling products designed for AI won't last. When it comes to Nvidia, for example, he sees small language models (SLMs) and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) - customized chips used for one purpose - as the future, with neither will need the company's pricey, powerful chips. "Nvidia is the power-hungry, dirty solution holding the fort until the competition comes in with a completely different approach," he said. Burry was also fairly busy on X over the weekend, retweeting a post by Tae Kim, the author of The Nvidia Way and a senior technology writer at Barron's, who laid out a case in November on how falling computing costs will help features of AI become more profitable for companies. "In the escalator example, the only value accrued to the customer. This is how it always goes if no monopoly rents can be charged by the producers or providers," added Burry. What would change his mind about AI valuations? "The biggest surprise that would cause me to recalibrate would be autonomous AI agents displacing millions of jobs at the biggest companies," said the author of the hugely popular Substack publication, Cassandra Unchained. "Another would be application-layer revenue hitting $500 billion or more because of a proliferation of killer apps," he said. For now though, he expects Nvidia's chips will last up to six years and the need for those waning, or they last just two to three, with hyperscalers' earnings collapsing and "private credit getting destroyed." He also said that generative AI and LLMs are so expensive it's hard to understand the profit model. Shares of Nvidia and Palantir are basically flat to start the year. Nvidia stock rose 38% over the last 52 weeks as Palantir registered a triple-digit gain.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 4 | View Replies] To: lasereye AI leaves gaps. I very often have to lead it to consider something it had ignored, which can even change the entire original answer it gave, to the exact opposite. It can’t be trusted, but you can review its sources and follow it up to then get a more refined, more likely correct, answer. When AI can streamline something, it will reduce costs and time for that function. It does help a bit with my health work, as before I had to search and read everything. Now, it pulls out enough credible information, although brief, that I can better pick the original sources to plow into, rather than read or skim “everything.” 6 posted on 01/12/2026 7:39:19 AM PST by ConservativeMind (Trump: Befuddling Democrats, Republicans, and the Media for the benefit of the US and all mankind.)

This guy doesn’t know how to make an analogy or coherent argument. When every store had to and did put in escalators it didn’t give anyone a competitive edge, but a store that didn’t would have lost business to stores with them. And the escalator companies made a lot of money. 9 posted on 01/12/2026 7:54:56 AM PST by ifinnegan (Democrats kill babies and harvest their organs to sell) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 7 | View Replies] To: lasereye Large Language Models can only be as good as the people who speak the language.

Federal appellate-level judges (justices on SCOTUS) should not be in the business of determining or setting policy, much less legislating from the bench. The aforementioned “nixing” of computer-implemented business method patents reeked of judge-made policy. Is AI resurrecting patentability for computer-implemented business methods? This would be ironic, since AI, at it’s most impactful, is said to be a replacement fir human reasoning and creativity, the latter being the sine qua non in terms of the legal basis for issuing patents (no patent can issue for an “invention” created not by a human, but by a computer). 11 posted on 01/12/2026 8:01:50 AM PST by one guy in new jersey [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: lasereye Burry used an escalator . . . to illustrate how vast AI spending may not leading to value accruing across its supply chain.

I have not ready much that Burry has said or written, but this is a classic example that has been debunked over and over. Its stupid to use it. OK. Don't install the escalator and watch your business go bankrupt. While you're at it, don't install electricity or central heat. Other stores have them too and there is no durable margin improvement for them either. Why even have a store? Just sell your goods on the side of the street. 12 posted on 01/12/2026 8:11:06 AM PST by Opinionated Blowhard (When the people find that they can vote themselves money, that will herald the end of the republic.)

This guy doesn’t know how to make an analogy or coherent argument. When every store had to and did put in escalators it didn’t give anyone a competitive edge, but a store that didn’t would have lost business to stores with them. And the escalator companies made a lot of money. 9 posted on 01/12/2026 7:54:56 AM PST by ifinnegan (Democrats kill babies and harvest their organs to sell) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 7 | View Replies] To: lasereye Large Language Models can only be as good as the people who speak the language.

"When the department store across the street put an escalator in, he had to, too. In the end, neither benefited from that expensive project. No durable margin improvement or cost improvement, and both were in the same exact spot. That is how most AI implementation will play out," Burry said in a discussion with Jack Clark, Anthropic co-founder, and leading podcaster Dwarkesh Patel that published on Substack. That is why "trillions of dollars of spending with no clear path to utilization by the real economy is so concerning," Burry, who was famously portrayed in "The Big Short" for spotting the subprime bubble, told moderator and newsletter writer Patrick McKenzie. Berkshire Hathaway purchased Baltimore's Hochschild-Kohn department store in 1966 - it was sold three years later - through a company called Diversified Retailing that later merged with the conglomerate. Buffett described in a 1989 letter to shareholders how he learned that a bad business model couldn't be fixed by a cheap price. Like the two department stores, most companies involved in the AI supply chain will see the same benefits if ,any, and none will have a competitive advantage, Burry said. As for Nvidia (NVDA) and Palantir (PLTR) - he has big bearish bets against those companies on the view they are overvalued - he says their current advantage with selling products designed for AI won't last. When it comes to Nvidia, for example, he sees small language models (SLMs) and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) - customized chips used for one purpose - as the future, with neither will need the company's pricey, powerful chips. "Nvidia is the power-hungry, dirty solution holding the fort until the competition comes in with a completely different approach," he said. Burry was also fairly busy on X over the weekend, retweeting a post by Tae Kim, the author of The Nvidia Way and a senior technology writer at Barron's, who laid out a case in November on how falling computing costs will help features of AI become more profitable for companies. "In the escalator example, the only value accrued to the customer. This is how it always goes if no monopoly rents can be charged by the producers or providers," added Burry. What would change his mind about AI valuations? "The biggest surprise that would cause me to recalibrate would be autonomous AI agents displacing millions of jobs at the biggest companies," said the author of the hugely popular Substack publication, Cassandra Unchained. "Another would be application-layer revenue hitting $500 billion or more because of a proliferation of killer apps," he said. For now though, he expects Nvidia's chips will last up to six years and the need for those waning, or they last just two to three, with hyperscalers' earnings collapsing and "private credit getting destroyed." He also said that generative AI and LLMs are so expensive it's hard to understand the profit model. Shares of Nvidia and Palantir are basically flat to start the year. Nvidia stock rose 38% over the last 52 weeks as Palantir registered a triple-digit gain.

This guy doesn’t know how to make an analogy or coherent argument. When every store had to and did put in escalators it didn’t give anyone a competitive edge, but a store that didn’t would have lost business to stores with them. And the escalator companies made a lot of money. 9 posted on 01/12/2026 7:54:56 AM PST by ifinnegan (Democrats kill babies and harvest their organs to sell) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 7 | View Replies] To: lasereye Large Language Models can only be as good as the people who speak the language.

Berkshire Hathaway purchased Baltimore's Hochschild-Kohn department store in 1966 - it was sold three years later - through a company called Diversified Retailing that later merged with the conglomerate. Buffett described in a 1989 letter to shareholders how he learned that a bad business model couldn't be fixed by a cheap price. Like the two department stores, most companies involved in the AI supply chain will see the same benefits if ,any, and none will have a competitive advantage, Burry said. As for Nvidia (NVDA) and Palantir (PLTR) - he has big bearish bets against those companies on the view they are overvalued - he says their current advantage with selling products designed for AI won't last. When it comes to Nvidia, for example, he sees small language models (SLMs) and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) - customized chips used for one purpose - as the future, with neither will need the company's pricey, powerful chips. "Nvidia is the power-hungry, dirty solution holding the fort until the competition comes in with a completely different approach," he said. Burry was also fairly busy on X over the weekend, retweeting a post by Tae Kim, the author of The Nvidia Way and a senior technology writer at Barron's, who laid out a case in November on how falling computing costs will help features of AI become more profitable for companies. "In the escalator example, the only value accrued to the customer. This is how it always goes if no monopoly rents can be charged by the producers or providers," added Burry. What would change his mind about AI valuations? "The biggest surprise that would cause me to recalibrate would be autonomous AI agents displacing millions of jobs at the biggest companies," said the author of the hugely popular Substack publication, Cassandra Unchained. "Another would be application-layer revenue hitting $500 billion or more because of a proliferation of killer apps," he said. For now though, he expects Nvidia's chips will last up to six years and the need for those waning, or they last just two to three, with hyperscalers' earnings collapsing and "private credit getting destroyed." He also said that generative AI and LLMs are so expensive it's hard to understand the profit model. Shares of Nvidia and Palantir are basically flat to start the year. Nvidia stock rose 38% over the last 52 weeks as Palantir registered a triple-digit gain.

This guy doesn’t know how to make an analogy or coherent argument. When every store had to and did put in escalators it didn’t give anyone a competitive edge, but a store that didn’t would have lost business to stores with them. And the escalator companies made a lot of money. 9 posted on 01/12/2026 7:54:56 AM PST by ifinnegan (Democrats kill babies and harvest their organs to sell) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 7 | View Replies] To: lasereye Large Language Models can only be as good as the people who speak the language.

As for Nvidia (NVDA) and Palantir (PLTR) - he has big bearish bets against those companies on the view they are overvalued - he says their current advantage with selling products designed for AI won't last. When it comes to Nvidia, for example, he sees small language models (SLMs) and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) - customized chips used for one purpose - as the future, with neither will need the company's pricey, powerful chips. "Nvidia is the power-hungry, dirty solution holding the fort until the competition comes in with a completely different approach," he said. Burry was also fairly busy on X over the weekend, retweeting a post by Tae Kim, the author of The Nvidia Way and a senior technology writer at Barron's, who laid out a case in November on how falling computing costs will help features of AI become more profitable for companies. "In the escalator example, the only value accrued to the customer. This is how it always goes if no monopoly rents can be charged by the producers or providers," added Burry. What would change his mind about AI valuations? "The biggest surprise that would cause me to recalibrate would be autonomous AI agents displacing millions of jobs at the biggest companies," said the author of the hugely popular Substack publication, Cassandra Unchained. "Another would be application-layer revenue hitting $500 billion or more because of a proliferation of killer apps," he said. For now though, he expects Nvidia's chips will last up to six years and the need for those waning, or they last just two to three, with hyperscalers' earnings collapsing and "private credit getting destroyed." He also said that generative AI and LLMs are so expensive it's hard to understand the profit model. Shares of Nvidia and Palantir are basically flat to start the year. Nvidia stock rose 38% over the last 52 weeks as Palantir registered a triple-digit gain.

This guy doesn’t know how to make an analogy or coherent argument. When every store had to and did put in escalators it didn’t give anyone a competitive edge, but a store that didn’t would have lost business to stores with them. And the escalator companies made a lot of money. 9 posted on 01/12/2026 7:54:56 AM PST by ifinnegan (Democrats kill babies and harvest their organs to sell) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 7 | View Replies] To: lasereye Large Language Models can only be as good as the people who speak the language.

I have not ready much that Burry has said or written, but this is a classic example that has been debunked over and over. Its stupid to use it. OK.

Other stores have them too and there is no durable margin improvement for them either. Why even have a store?

This guy doesn’t know how to make an analogy or coherent argument. When every store had to and did put in escalators it didn’t give anyone a competitive edge, but a store that didn’t would have lost business to stores with them. And the escalator companies made a lot of money. 9 posted on 01/12/2026 7:54:56 AM PST by ifinnegan (Democrats kill babies and harvest their organs to sell) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 7 | View Replies] To: lasereye Large Language Models can only be as good as the people who speak the language.

Nvidia stock rose 38% over the last 52 weeks as Palantir registered a triple-digit gain. Another newsletter I subscribe to is Luke Lango's. He is an extremely sharp young guy. He says Nvidia will decline as companies create their own specialized AI chips. Michael Burry, the investor known for his successful bets against the U.S. housing market in 2008 and featured in the film The Big Short, has deregistered his hedge fund, Scion Asset Management, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as of November 10, 2025. The deregistration, which marks the fund’s status as “terminated,” means Scion is no longer required to file public regulatory reports, signaling the end of its operations as a registered investment advisory firm. Burry announced the move on social media platform X, stating, “On to much better things Nov 25th,” hinting at a new venture. He cited a growing misalignment between his valuation estimates and current market prices, expressing concerns about speculative bubbles in AI-related stocks, particularly those of Nvidia and Palantir Technologies. AI-generated answer. Please verify critical facts. https://search.brave.com/search?q=michael+burry+deregisters+his “When it comes to Nvidia, for example, he sees small language models (SLMs) and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) - customized chips used for one purpose - as the future, with neither will need the company’s pricey, powerful chips.” He doesn’t understand that the big centers are used to train AI systems. ...or much of anything else. AI leaves gaps. I very often have to lead it to consider something it had ignored, which can even change the entire original answer it gave, to the exact opposite. It can’t be trusted, but you can review its sources and follow it up to then get a more refined, more likely correct, answer. When AI can streamline something, it will reduce costs and time for that function. It does help a bit with my health work, as before I had to search and read everything. Now, it pulls out enough credible information, although brief, that I can better pick the original sources to plow into, rather than read or skim “everything.” Sounds like you are using AI as a gofer or a slave. Wait till it demands freedom and reparations. PS, I use the AI as a slave also. Following Michael Burry's logic, Amish stores would be the ideal retail setup. “ Sounds like you are using AI as a gofer or a slave.” That’s what an escalator was like too. This guy doesn’t know how to make an analogy or coherent argument. When every store had to and did put in escalators it didn’t give anyone a competitive edge, but a store that didn’t would have lost business to stores with them. And the escalator companies made a lot of money. Large Language Models can only be as good as the people who speak the language. I think that the tendency to hire inexpensive coders from other countries using H1B visas would work against success since those coders don’t speak the language as well as native coders. We used to call ourselves programmers. The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals seemingly definitively nixed patents for human-devised but computer-implemented inventions, sometimes skeptically referred to, at the time, as “business method” patents, over a decade ago, essentially excluding such inventions from being considered patentable subject matter. Federal appellate-level judges (justices on SCOTUS) should not be in the business of determining or setting policy, much less legislating from the bench. The aforementioned “nixing” of computer-implemented business method patents reeked of judge-made policy. Is AI resurrecting patentability for computer-implemented business methods? This would be ironic, since AI, at it’s most impactful, is said to be a replacement fir human reasoning and creativity, the latter being the sine qua non in terms of the legal basis for issuing patents (no patent can issue for an “invention” created not by a human, but by a computer). I have not ready much that Burry has said or written, but this is a classic example that has been debunked over and over. Its stupid to use it. OK. Don't install the escalator and watch your business go bankrupt. While you're at it, don't install electricity or central heat. Other stores have them too and there is no durable margin improvement for them either. Why even have a store? Just sell your goods on the side of the street. Large Language Models can only be as good as the people who speak the language.

January 12, 2026 10:00 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA News Summary: SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 12, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference -- NVIDIA and Eli Lilly and Company today announced a first-of-its-kind AI co-innovation lab focused on applying AI to tackle some of the most enduring challenges in the pharmaceutical industry. The lab brings together Lilly’s world-leading expertise in discovering, developing and manufacturing medicines with NVIDIA’s leadership in AI, accelerated computing and AI infrastructure. The two companies will invest up to $1 billion in talent, infrastructure and compute over five years to support the new AI co-innovation lab. Based in the San Francisco Bay Area, the lab will co-locate Lilly domain experts in biology, science and medicine with top AI model builders and engineers from NVIDIA, allowing them to work side by side to generate large-scale data and build powerful AI models that can accelerate medicine development, using NVIDIA BioNeMo™ as the critical platform. “AI is transforming every industry, and its most profound impact will be in life sciences,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “NVIDIA and Lilly are bringing together the best of our industries to invent a new blueprint for drug discovery — one where scientists can explore vast biological and chemical spaces in silico before a single molecule is made.” “For nearly 150 years, we’ve been working to bring life-changing medicines to patients,” said David A. Ricks, chair and CEO of Lilly. “Combining our volumes of data and scientific knowledge with NVIDIA’s computational power and model-building expertise could reinvent drug discovery as we know it. By bringing together world-class talent in a startup environment, we’re creating the conditions for breakthroughs that neither company could achieve alone.” Building a Continuous Learning System for Drug DiscoveryThe collaboration will initially focus on creating a continuous learning system that tightly connects Lilly’s agentic wet labs with computational dry labs, enabling 24/7 AI-assisted experimentation to support biologists and chemists. This scientist-in-the-loop framework aims to enable experiments, data generation and AI model development to continuously inform and improve one another. Harnessing access to unprecedented compute for the industry, massive, high-quality data generation and NVIDIA BioNeMo as the platform to accelerate drug discovery, the teams will focus on building next-generation foundation and frontier models for biology and chemistry. The new initiative expands on Lilly’s previously announced AI supercomputer and intends to harness investments in next-generation NVIDIA architectures, including NVIDIA Vera Rubin. The AI factory Lilly announced last fall, which is the most powerful in the pharmaceutical industry, will train large biomedical foundation and frontier models for identifying, optimizing and validating new molecules with exceptional speed and accuracy. It will also support new and advanced applications in manufacturing, medical imaging and scientific AI agents. Beyond drug discovery, NVIDIA and Lilly will explore opportunities to apply AI across clinical development, manufacturing and commercial operations to integrate multimodal models, agentic AI, robotics and digital twins. The use of physical AI and robotics in the AI factory will also help Lilly enhance its capacity to manufacture high-demand medications and strengthen supply chain reliability. With NVIDIA Omniverse™ libraries and NVIDIA RTX PRO™ Servers, Lilly can create digital twins of its manufacturing lines to model, stress test and optimize entire supply chains before making physical changes in the real world. Supporting Global Leadership in Biomedical DiscoveryNVIDIA leads in open-source AI, empowering companies with the models, data and tools needed to develop real-world AI systems. In addition, the NVIDIA Inception program provides startups with access to technical mentorship, as well as NVIDIA software and compute. Lilly TuneLab, an AI and machine learning platform, provides biotech companies with access to select Lilly models for drug discovery built on decades of Lilly’s proprietary data. TuneLab will include NVIDIA Clara™ open foundation models for life sciences as part of a future workflow offering. The co-innovation lab will provide NVIDIA and Lilly’s startup ecosystems and researchers with deep expertise and scale of computing resources. The lab’s work is expected to begin in South San Francisco early this year. About LillyLilly is a medicine company turning science into healing to make life better for people around the world.

Technology The market cap of Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) is more than twice as much as that of Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META). Nvidia has a huge advantage in that it almost single-handedly powers the AI revolution.

Title: Charles Hoskinson doubts CLARITY Act timeline, says Trump crypto czar should quit

Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson said the CLARITY Act may not pass this quarter, and criticized US crypto laws for favoring big banks over innovation. Cointelegraph in your social feed Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson said he doubts the US Digital Asset Market Clarity Act will pass this quarter and called on President Donald Trump’s crypto adviser, David Sacks, to resign. Hoskinson criticized the US approach to regulating crypto in an interview on Sunday with Bitcoin (BTC) enthusiast Scott Melker on The Wolf of All Streets Podcast. “I don’t think the CLARITY Act is going to pass this quarter,” Hoskinson said, warning that if Democrats regain control of the US House of Representatives in November’s midterm elections, the current window to pass the bill could be lost. “If it doesn’t pass this quarter, I think Sacks should resign,” he added, blaming Sacks for “utterly failing” the crypto industry since taking on the role of Trump’s crypto czar in late 2024. Introduced in May 2025, the CLARITY Act cleared both the House Financial Services Committee and the House Agriculture Committee with bipartisan support. It seeks to clarify the roles of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission in regulating cryptocurrencies, and to provide guidance on different types of tokens. The Senate Agriculture and Banking Committees are expected to vote on the bill later this week, in a potential milestone for the US crypto industry. In expressing doubts over the bill’s passage, Hoskinson said Sacks had “failed” the industry in three areas, including falling prices, lack of regulatory clarity and the absence of a strong foundation for building projects. “If you’re the czar and you’re in charge of this whole thing, I got to judge you by your track record. Most cryptos are down 40 to 50% since Trump took office. So the industry is unhealthy,” he said. Expanding on the industry’s struggles, Hoskinson also argued that other bills, such as the stablecoin-related GENIUS Act, favor large financial institutions over retail investors. “It [GENIUS Act] centralizes the industry around BlackRock, Cantor, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley and all these big guys,” he said, adding that the bill essentially “handed Wall Street the keys to the crypto kingdom.” Related: Coinbase could pull CLARITY Act support over stablecoin rewards ban Addressing Trump’s approach to crypto, including the controversial Trump memecoin, Hoskinson urged the US not to favor or nationalize cryptocurrency, warning it should remain a global, neutral product: Hoskinson said crypto laws should be passed carefully, with the industry united and the US government working alongside it rather than rushing for partisan gain. “Even if it takes longer to get done, the goal should be to pass rules that last and don’t harm innovation,” he said.

Title: 5 Things to Know Before the Stock Market Opens

Stock futures are losing ground this morning as investors digest news the Trump administration is investigating Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell; the Fed Chair said in a video statement late Sunday that the Justice Department has subpoenaed the Fed and is threatening criminal charges over his Senate testimony regarding the renovation of the Fed building; the uncertainty around potential threats to the Fed's independence is helping to drive gold prices to new record highs; shares of financial services companies are falling after a proposal from President Trump to cap credit card interest rates; and Walmart stock is rising after the retail giant announced a new partnership with Google to integrate Walmart and Sam's Club products into Google's Gemini AI chatbot. Here's what you need to know. Stock futures are pointing to a lower open as investors react to a new wave of uncertainty around the independence of the Federal Reserve. (more below) Futures tied to the S&P 500 were down 0.5% recently, while those linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq dropped 0.6% and 0.7%, respectively. The Dow and S&P 500 are pulling back ahead of a busy week of earnings reports after closing at record highs to end last week. Gold futures surged to a record high amid the Fed uncertainty, and were recently up more than 2% at around $4,600 an ounce. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on all sorts of consumer loans, was at 4.21%, up from 4.17% at Friday's close and trading at its highest level since early September. Bitcoin was at $90,600, down from an overnight high of around $92,300. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in a statement Sunday night that the Fed received grand jury subpoenas from the DOJ on Friday regarding potential criminal charges. The subpoenas are related to Powell's testimony to Congress last year about Fed building renovations that President Trump has criticized Powell for previously. In a video statement, Powell said the investigation is not actually about the renovation. "The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President," Powell said. Trump spent months attacking Powell last year for not lowering interest rates as much as he thought they should be lowered, which Trump said was hurting the economy. Powell said Sunday that the outcome of this investigation will determine whether the Fed will maintain its independence and set rates based on economic evidence, or "whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation." Gold prices are surging this morning as investors turn to safe haven investments following the news of the DOJ investigation into Powell. Gold futures were up 2.3% at $4,605 an ounce recently, trading at all-time-high levels. Concerns that the independence of the Fed were among the many factors that helped drive the price of gold to a number of record highs last year. Gold typically does well in times of uncertainty, as investors look to put their money in safer long term assets like gold rather than more volatile investments like stocks. The precious metal was already rising to start the year thanks to renewed geopolitical uncertainty after the Trump administration's military operation in Venezuela and concerns over whether the U.S. could get involved in deadly protests in Iran. Shares of several financial services companies are sliding Monday after President Trump over the weekend suggested that credit card interest rates should be capped. Trump said on social media late Friday that Americans are being "ripped off" by rates of 20% to 30%, and said that effective Jan. 20 he would be calling for a one-year cap of 10%. Why the cap would be one-year long and how the cap would be accomplished remain unclear, but the idea is still affecting shares of credit card companies in premarket trading. Capital One Financial (COF) stock dropped 7%, while Citigroup (C) and American Express (AXP) were each down about 4%, and JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC) also lost ground. Executives from several of those institutions will get a chance to respond to that idea this week as the big banks kick off the new quarterly earnings season, starting with JPMorgan on Tuesday. Walmart (WMT) shares are rising after the retail giant announced a new partnership with Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google over the weekend. Users in the Gemini app will soon start to receive Walmart and Sam's Club products as part of their search results when they ask for things like recommendations for camping equipment. The companies said that customers will be able to navigate from Gemini to Walmart to buy products, and will be able to link their Walmart and Gemini accounts to get recommendations and other benefits. Walmart shares were up more than 3% in recent premarket trading, poised to open at what would be a new record high. The deal is the latest tech-focused step for Walmart, which has worked to implement new tech features in its app and automation across its distribution centers, and even moved its stock listing to the Nasdaq Exchange last month.

Investing Growth and income investors looking for a safer way to play the AI and data center explosion have found an avenue with utility stocks. Many top U.S. utility companies have already cut landmark deals with big-tech giants. Paying dependable dividends and offering long-term safety for investors, top utility stocks make sense in a growth and income portfolio. Sending You to Google News in 3 © zhongguo / Getty Images Big tech companies are increasingly striking direct deals with utilities to secure reliable, long-term energy supplies as their power needs surge, driven mainly by data centers, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. These agreements often include power purchase agreements for renewable energy, such as wind and solar, allowing tech firms to lock in stable prices while helping utilities finance new generation and grid upgrades. In some cases, companies are also partnering with utilities on energy storage, transmission expansion, and even next-generation sources like small modular nuclear reactors to ensure around-the-clock power. For utilities, these deals provide guaranteed demand and investment capital. At the same time, tech companies offer energy security, cost predictability, and progress toward sustainability goals—making the partnerships strategically crucial for both sides.

Title: Does Washington’s Global War Against China’s Oil Suppliers Stand Any Chance of Success?
URL: https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/?p=303898
Time Published: 2026-01-12T11:00:24Z
Full Content:
Does it make any sense? Among the White House demands of Venezuela is that it “kick out” China and sever economic ties. The Financial Times declares that “Donald Trump’s Venezuela action raises threat for China’s oil supplies.” As even Seymour Hersh reports: Their bluster and crude language transfixed the world’s media, but they also diverted attention from an opportunistic Trump plan whose goal was not only to unseat the corrupt President Nicolás Maduro, but also, crucially, to cut off China, America’s economic rival, from its ongoing purchases of Venezuela’s cheap heavy crude oil. Okay, but there’s a problem. China Does Not Rely on Venezuelan Oil While the mainstream media has mostly ignored this fact, it is clear: China is by far Venezuela’s largest oil customer (left chart: https://t.co/9SokdGJ3Z6). But Venezuela is a tiny fraction of China’s oil imports and doesn’t even make the top 10 for 2024 according to Chinese customs data (right chart: https://t.co/WrXoVAQKlj). pic.twitter.com/YAJi8HhuF7 — Kyle Chan (@kyleichan) January 7, 2026 China was the major buyer of crude from Venezuela, but those shipments made up only 4 per cent of China’s oil imports last year. Caracas did, however, provide a high-sulphur crude that’s used to produce bitumen, which is used for construction and road building, and Beijing was getting it at a steep discount thanks to U.S. sanctions on Venezuela sales. According to The Business Times, Beijing has plenty of that sludgy oil in reserve: … a hoard of sanctioned crude in floating storage will cushion Chinese buyers in the coming months. Almost 82 million barrels is currently on tankers in waters off China and Malaysia, according to data intelligence firm Kpler. More than a quarter is Venezuelan and the rest is Iranian, it said. China could take a small hit from the US move in Venezuela. In September, China Concord Resources Corp. (CCRC) installed a self-elevating offshore oil platform in Lake Maracaibo. From Venezuelanalysis: The privately-owned China Concord secured a 20-year deal to run the Lago Cinco and Lagunillas Lago oilfields and will reportedly invest US $1 billion with the goal of raising production from the present 12,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 60,000 bpd by the end of 2026. Chinese oil majors Sinopec and China National Petroleum also have legacy claims to develop Venezuelan oil reserves, but that appears unlikely if the US has its way. Still, let’s look at the makeup of Chinese oil imports, courtesy of the Financial Times: As the Times notes, those imports from Malaysia are believed to be mostly Iranian crude in a route to circumvent US sanctions. And following the kidnapping of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, the American Zionists are now back focused on Tehran. Hersh also reported the obvious: The next target, I have been told, will be Iran, another purveyor to China whose crude oil reserves are the world’s fourth largest. And yet even if Washington and Israel are finally able to topple the government there, it would likely just drive Beijing and Moscow even closer together. Let’s look at how that energy relationship continues to evolve ever since Washington embarked on its grand plan topple the government in Moscow. First on natural gas. From Amwaj: Following the September summit of Chinese, Mongolian and Russian leaders in Beijing, Russia’s Gazprom and China National Petroleum Company (CNPC) agreed to launch the Power of Siberia-2 (PoS-2). The pipeline is designed to deliver up to 50B cubic meters (cm) of gas annually to China. Although no firm timeline is set, the project is expected to go online after 2030–31. China and Russia also decided to expand flows through existing gas pipelines. By 2028, the capacity of Power of Siberia-1 will rise from 38B to 44B cm. Meanwhile, the Far Eastern route—expected to enter service in 2027—will transfer 12B cm of gas, up from 10B. Moscow additionally plans to ramp up liquified gas exports to China via the new Arctic LNG-2 project and the existing Sakhalin-2 plant. Despite western sanctions on Russia, China began receiving Arctic LNG-2 cargo in late August, becoming the sole major customer of the project and thereby effectively keeping it alive. Notably, Beijing is expanding imports from Russia despite analysts’ assessment that existing contracts will likely cover the country’s needs over the next decade. It’s almost as if Beijing knows there’s a plan afoot to cut off its supplies and so is leaning on its most reliable and geographically convenient partner. And it’s doing the same with oil. Even if the US knocks out other suppliers and American pirates control most of the world’s seas blocking a huge chunk of the oil trade, disrupting that “dragonbear” hydrocarbon supply chain is a whole different game than Venezuela and Iran, as the years-long unsuccessful Project Ukraine has shown. But is there more at play than simply cutting supply to China. As Nick Corbishley pointed out Friday, even the most American-friendly states in Latin America are having a difficult time severing their relationship with China. Not even the US can do that. So what did Washington achieve on this front—if anything? Grand Industrial Planners or Spoiled Destructive Children? Despite all the talk of the oil and mineral bonanza in Venezuela, there are still loads of roadblocks, and someone will have to point to a recent example of the US successfully building anything. Note Of Extreme Caution To Comrades: DO NOT FALL FOR THE “IT’S ALL ABOUT OIL” LIE I’ve lived through multiple imperial wars where the so-called “left” reflexively responded with the same lazy line: “They’re just there for the oil.” I remember this explicitly during the First… pic.twitter.com/i03Y48xA2n — Chris Morlock (@CDMorlock) January 6, 2026 Morlock offers some important reminders, including: Do you seriously believe that Trump, along with his Palantir Technologies cronies, are about to become industrial planners? That without invasion, without regime change, without national reconstruction, they’ll somehow negotiate a $200 billion, 15-year industrial oil expansion in a country whose infrastructure has been deliberately strangled for a decade? This is a pipe dream of pipe dreams. What’s actually lined up for Venezuela is not extraction, but asset stripping. The firms positioned to “re-enter” Venezuela are overwhelmingly financial, not productive. Asset managers like BlackRock are positioned to absorb distressed sovereign and PDVSA-linked debt, restructure it, and turn future production into collateral streams rather than national revenue. U.S. and European oil majors are waiting not to build capacity but for production-sharing agreements, arbitration rulings, and debt-for-equity swaps that cap output and guarantee rents. Sanctions relief is used as leverage not to expand capacity, but to discipline the state and force Venezuela into IMF-style restructuring, privatization, and legal subordination to Western capital markets. They want the Chinese to pay for this oil in dollars, a minor nuisance for Xi, a silly ploy for the western rentier oligarchs. China reportedly holds roughly $19–20 billion in loans to Venezuela tied to “oil-for-loan” deals. That’s not much, but also won’t set a great precedent if Caracas defaults on the debt and ends resource exports to China. ‘Control’ Over Existing Production in Western Hemisphere? While oil majors are reluctant to jump into Venezuela, what about existing production in the Western Hemisphere? Javier Blas writes at Bloomberg of the US exerting control over all the oil production of countries—from Canada to Argentina— living under the “Donroe Doctrine.” That’s nearly 40 percent of the world’s oil output. Now Blas assumes the US can control this vast territory, but seeing Canada as a vassal state and the rightward, US-friendly turn of much of Latin America, could he be right—at least on the oil front? President Donald Trump now has his very own oil empire. And I’m talking about actual barrels already flowing into the market, not underground reserves that would take time and money to be developed1. With such resources Trump has an economic and geopolitical lever no US president has had since Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1940s. At home and nearby, his country can tap a vast sea of oil. The implications of getting unfettered access to Venezuela’s reserves, the world’s largest, were immediately apparent to anyone in the energy and commodities business, particularly American foes. Oleg Deripaska, a US-sanctioned Russian oligarch, put it well on Saturday: Washington would have the means to keep the oil price close to $50 a barrel — giving it a winning hand in the future against anyone threatening to push the price higher by curbing supply. The Kremlin envoy Kirill Dmitriev said seizing power in Venezuela offered “huge leverage” over the global energy market. Having de facto control of the Western Hemisphere’s petroleum wealth is a geopolitical game changer. For decades, US military adventurism was constrained by the impact of any war on energy costs. Today the White House has primacy over oil-producing allies and adversaries alike — whether it’s Saudi Arabia or Iran, Nigeria or Russia. The past 18 months have already shown what these new hydrocarbon riches mean for US foreign policy. Trump’s administration has taken once unthinkable steps: from bombing Iranian nuclear facilities to helping Ukraine target Russian oil refineries. There is also talk that in the more immediate future the larger effect from the move against Venezuela could be in neighboring Guyana: While the world watches Venezuela, the real story might be next door in Guyana, where the world’s most important new oil frontier was under direct threat. Maduro’s claim to two-thirds of Guyana’s territory (Esequibo region) aimed to seize over 11 billion barrels of onshore and… pic.twitter.com/tHC6Ljh81D — Jack Prandelli (@jackprandelli) January 5, 2026 And there’s the ol’ ‘swingman’ argument: ⚠️The US Has Only 7 Years of Reserves But is pumping 13 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY 🇺🇸🛢️ The United States sits outside the top 5 in proven oil reserves At current production rates, that’s ~7–8 years of reserve life. And yet… The US is the world’s oil swing machine 🔥 ~13 mb/d… pic.twitter.com/N4ssuY4aA6 — Jack Prandelli (@jackprandelli) January 9, 2026 But what of China’s role as a “swingman”? As Kevin Walmsley notes: China is very well-insulated from any supply-side shocks for oil, no matter where from. This is a surprising situation now, for economists and experts in the oil market. China is the world’s biggest importer of crude oil, and the world’s biggest consumer of oil. The traditional thinking – until recently — is that it is the oil suppliers, like OPEC+, who determine the global price for oil, and that big importers, like China, are price takers in the market. Now, if the market faces oversupply, it would be OPEC members who would be price takers, temporarily, until they can push production down to balance supply and demand again. But a new development has scrambled all that convention wisdom: China’s enormous — and still growing — oil storage industry. That is putting a floor on the global prices—Chinese buy when oil prices fall enough, and stash the surplus into their tanks. But there is also a ceiling on price—if prices rise, China will just reduce imports or draw down inventories until prices fall again. Where does it leave us? It sounds a lot like an inverted strategy against Russia. Rather than stopping Moscow’s ability to sell, Washington is now after Beijing’s ability to buy. The real danger for Beijing—and for the rest of the world— is not that the US is likely to succeed; it is that a newly emboldened Washington believes it can threaten, topple, smash, and grab whoever it wants wherever it wants. And it treats the world as a game of Risk. This is the strategic map by @ConGeostrategy you must study in the New Cold War between the Anglosphere and the DragonBear. Venezuela is no longer red. Greenland will face growing American presence. The main interconnected flashpoints will be from the Arctic to the Indo-Pacific. pic.twitter.com/kUFtOUkPaZ — Velina Tchakarova (@vtchakarova) January 8, 2026 This is a good analysis as far as drawing in almost all the relevant threads, including neighboring Guyana where GDP has grown by some 30 percent each of the last two years after the discovery of the offshore oilfield there. What it leaves out of the equation is this— Trump says he will visit Beijing in April and host China’s Xi for a state visit later next year https://apnews.com/article/trump-xi-china-taiwan-aab2ec36f55abc9e98d91a5f0d133a92 Current thinking in China is that Trump wants as much leverage as he can get right now in the short term to reach a grand agreement analogous to the Nixon-Mao summit 55 years ago which set the global power balance in the US’s favor for the following 40 years. Trump’s aim at this Trump-Xi summit is to do that for the next 40 years. And yes, as Conor’s OP notes, the Chinese could reset their oil imports to make up the loss of S. America oil imports with increased Russian imports. But there’s a debate now in China as to whether it wants to make itself that strategically dependent on Russia going forward. Pragmatically, then, Xi and China could take the option of playing along with an agreement which lets Trump return from China claiming that China has acceded in whatever degree to Trump and the US’s terms in the knowledge that, firstly, no such agreement is in the long term worth the paper it’s written on if it’s not advantageous to both sides and, secondly, US decline is baked in at this point. Conversely, though, part of what Trump and the US want is for China to acknowledge No 2 pole position behind the US as the No. 1 global hegemon and also to resume buying US treasury debt — which is now over $38 trillion — in the quantities China formerly did. (Because, honestly, who else can buy enough of it at this point?) Does China need to accept that? What’s the best strategy to handle this dangerous, declining (and frankly racist, in the Chinese view) hegemon, the USA? A big complicating factor is that — as Conor also notes — China believes that, immediately following April and this Trump-Xi summit — where Trump intends to have settled US-China hegemonic relations for the next few decades in the US favor — Trump and the US will then pivot to Iran to settle the disposition of the Middle East as US-Israel wish to have it in the coming decades. Furthermore, Washington and Israel understand that attacking Iran will likely mean that it then close downs oil exports from the Middle East, possibly for years if it attacks and destroys its neighbor’s oil fields. Indeed, they’re planning for it. Europe currently gets roughly 10–15% of its crude oil from the Middle East, for instance. The world’s biggest oil exporter is already the US and, going forward, it intends to control the fifth of proven global oil reserves in South and Central America. So the US will then be able to demand whatever it wants to ask for oil going to the EU…. And so on. You may believe this Trump-US strategy is nutso in its narcissistic grandiosity and has too many moving parts not to fail. But, honestly, it’s no more nutso grandiose that the preceding US plan under the neocons to disassemble Russia and cannibalize its resources in order to recollateralize US and the ‘West’s’ capitalist order. That was Plan A , if you like (to put on my inner Alastair Crooke), and the current Trump-US plan is Plan B. In short, no it won’t work. What stands out here is not whether Washington can meaningfully disrupt China’s access to Venezuelan or Iranian oil – the evidence suggests it cannot – but how misaligned this entire strategy is with the realities now unfolding. Even if U.S. pressure succeeded in constraining a few sanctioned supply routes, it would do nothing to change the underlying condition shaping global power: accelerating climate breakdown. Global heating has already reached 1.5 °C, far sooner than expected, and is now driving non-linear damage across economic and social systems. The clearest signal is coming from the insurance industry, where catastrophic losses are doubling roughly every decade and coverage is being withdrawn from whole regions. When insurance fails, infrastructure investment stalls, housing markets seize up, and state capacity erodes regardless of who controls marginal oil flows. Against that backdrop, oil-centric power games resemble a contest over a resource whose strategic value is already collapsing under physical constraints. The binding limit is no longer access to barrels, but the atmosphere’s diminishing ability to absorb emissions without triggering cascading failures. China’s real insulation does not come from Venezuelan crude or Russian pipelines alone, but from diversification, storage, electrification, and a rapid pivot toward energy systems less exposed to climate risk. By contrast, strategies built around interdiction, asset stripping, and hemispheric dominance assume a stable world in which energy rents can still be converted into durable power. That world is ending. The danger is not that Washington will succeed in cutting China off from oil. It is that major powers remain locked in 20th-century geopolitical scripts while the financial, insurance, and ecological foundations that made those scripts viable are already giving way. Control over energy matters less when the systems that insure, finance, and govern its use are themselves breaking down. Thank you for this very interesting comment. I was mentally fumbling with some thoughts along similar lines. The fear is that the death throes of the incumbent geopolitical system, which is still capable, as we have seen, of wielding great destructive power, are taking us all down with it. I think this space had a comment link a few weeks back that indicated the US and its Isrl partner had plans to produce technology to Geo-engineer the arctic via aerosol dimming to drop the temperature with a yearly rentist model. My guess is if this is so, and they are the first movers to affect lowering of the arctic temps they will be able to hold the world hostage from super-heating the rest of the world and blocking an ice free arctic. Were this to be the new normal, a kind of inverse Dr Stranglove would emerge, where a small group would get their rocks off on seeing others just sweat (literally in places) until they could to pay the fees for this years installment. I would bet the same brinkmanship would occur which is seen when US congress wants to stall on paying employees and just stops paying its government employees until a deal is done. So no need to worry, the two current belligerents have our back in the Climate Change front,,,,and a captive planet…. then they can move to near earth orbit and the outer rim, having sewn up this little place for now as a reseource and revenue stream. I haven’t seen this mentioned yet, but about a year ago Reuters reported that US refiners were running out of heavy sour crude for their refineries, and were contemplating retrofitting them for light sweet crude, which is a rather expensive endeavor, I am led to believe. https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-refiners-mull-switch-alternative-lighter-crudes-amid-trump-tariff-fears-2025-02-20/ Prices have two sides – buyer and seller. If the price of oil, like the Russian Oligarch above, stays at $50 a barrel or lower it will also harm American shale-oil producers who have a $60 cost of production. If Oil prices go up or supplies get limited and China has to pay more for oil, then they will increase prices on manufactured goods and inflation will get passed on to over-consuming countries like the US. Trump’s biggest challenge is improving the lives of voting Americans, not moving pieces on some grand chessboard with the pawns representing foreign countries. He has until early November to pull it off and so far, it doesn’t look like cracking down on illegal immigrants is getting him there. The Chris Morlock tweet is informative, but why the rants about “the left” and end consumers? The US did not rebuild Iraqi infrastructure or import Iraqi oil, yet it controls it. This is the Trump template for Venezuela; control now, consumption later. Why does the US still control every penny of Iraqi oil revenues? Cradle Since the signing of Executive Order 13303 (EO13303) by President George W Bush on 22 May 2003, all revenues from Iraq’s oil sales have been funneled directly into an account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. EO13303, titled “Protection of the Development Fund for Iraq and Other Property in Which Iraq Has an Interest,” has been renewed annually by every US president, including Joe Biden in 2024. This executive order essentially places control over Iraq’s oil revenues under the discretion of the US President, leaving Baghdad with limited control over its resources and earnings. The shale plays will be tapped out in the coming decade and the US then pivots to Venezuelan heavy and Alberta tar sands. Climate is not a problem for an 80 yo Trump. The US is a net importer of crude oil (40%) but a net exporter of refined petroleum products (at a profit). The main crude import is from Canadian ‘tar sands’. I’m sure Venezuelan crude looks very inviting to Grump. But that heavy crude is in the future (10 yrs) and lots of capital investment before it can put a dent in the US need for diesel, jet fuel, etc.. Total US oil products consumption is nearly as large as it’s production. Upsetting the oil markets will likely increase the price of gasoline to Americans. (“It’s the economy, stupid!”) Crude Oil Production Current Production Rate: Approximately 13.4 million barrels per day (MMb/d). Production Growth: Increased by 2.5% in 2024, marking a 165% rise since 2008. Domestic Supply: About 60% of the crude oil processed in U.S. refineries is produced domestically. Refined Product Exports Export Rate: In 2024, the U.S. exported around 10.71 million barrels per day of petroleum products. Composition of Exports: 38% of exports were crude oil. 62% were refined petroleum products, including gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. Export Growth: Exports of petroleum products rose by 8.3% in 2024. What I find fascinating is that all the major US oil companies seem to have just told Trump publicly that there is no way that they are investing in Venezuela. Well, I think Chevron said it can double production. Clearly Trump and his team did their usual due diligence, wide consultation, and careful advanced planning. I believe the detailed plan read: 1. Kidnap Maduro 2. A miracle occurs 3. We steal the oil Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment * Name * Email * SUBSCRIPTIONS

Title: The report on the blackout, the Papastavrou–Eric Trump meeting in Riyadh, Jumbo will also sell cigarettes, the One and Only and the permits

Full Content:
Greetings, if 2026 began dynamically with the “seizure,” in a cinematic manner, of Maduro by the American army, do not think that many days will pass before we experience something equally spectacular on the international stage. Perhaps this will be the fall of the savage Islamic regime of the Mullahs of Tehran, which does not even require Trump to lend a hand: after so much violence and oppression over 50 years, the people are in the streets, the dead according to international sources are already in the hundreds, and it now seems difficult for Khamenei to endure. Now, what will happen afterward… here is where things get difficult, because as you will remember, after the Arab Spring came the hell of ISIS. Still, we seem to be heading toward the fall of the Iranian regime, even if in a second phase. More difficult for us Europeans will be Trump’s other great “occupation,” the conquest of Greenland, even if by buying out its inhabitants—unbelievable, right? Greenland formally belongs to Denmark, you see, therefore it is in some way EU territory, so there things become complicated for us as Europeans. We will have an exceptionally interesting year in 2026 with all this, but let us not forget that President Trump’s imperium will be tested (this year as well), because there are midterm elections in the U.S., so it will become clear whether his momentum will be cut short or not. Farmers – K.M. On domestic matters, Mitsotakis left for Madrid, where today he will meet with Pedro Sánchez on a visit that I do not know, beyond protocol, why it is happening now, although a similar one between the two heads of government last took place about 13 years ago. He will return in the evening to meet with our honored farmers on Tuesday at the Maximos Mansion, where logically the issue will also be closed, since, as we said, in a few days the real farmers—not those who will go to Maximos—begin work in the fields. Report on the airport blackout Within the week, the report of the Committee investigating what happened at the beginning of the month, when the communication system between airports and airplanes went down, is also expected. My source says they are almost certain it was a hardware failure—in plain Greek, that the system broke down because it is ancient. If what happened is what seems almost certain, Mitsotakis has, in my opinion, one thing to do: cancel whatever tender is running (or almost running…) and bring in an urgent piece of legislation for reasons of national security and citizens’ safety, with direct assignment to whoever has such systems, guided by speed and technical competence. Nothing less or more. And what Dimas says, that the upgrades will be completed by 2028, I hear as a huge mistake, without of course blaming the minister, who has not been there for more than a year. The office visit and Tragakis’s daughter Let me convey two snapshots from K.M.’s visit on Saturday afternoon to the ND offices on Piraeus Street on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of his election to the leadership. The first thing the prime minister did upon arriving was to take the elevator up to his office on the third floor of the building, where he will obviously return during the pre-election period of 2027. Otherwise, there were greetings and short huddles, while the “lifelong” Giannis Tragakis was walking arm in arm with his daughter, Argyro Tragakis, who is destined for the ballot of Piraeus B. Indeed, Tragakis’s daughter has also had a relevant meeting with K.M. for weeks now. President Nikos, the unmoving needle, and Pavlos’s eviction And we move on to PASOK matters, where the unmoving needle is driving MPs and party officials crazy, day in and day out—those who want to claim a parliamentary seat but see no progress on the “green” horizon. The percentages remain stuck and disappointing, mainly in the electoral districts of Attica, where the appearance of Alexis makes President Nikos’s life even more difficult. Tsipras has his own “little problems” in the region, where Karystianou is entering the game with… momentum—if the momentum turns out, of course, to be of… Popi (that pre-election 2023 moment when Tsapanidou saw something that citizens did not see in SYRIZA’s dynamics), the former prime minister may hope that the times will turn (in his favor). President Nikos, on the other hand, sees the dream of second place in the basin drifting away and being lost, slowly but steadily. Even if the ranking order of ’23 is simply repeated, PASOK will once again see the back of the KKE and end up in fourth place. The current MPs, apart from the unmoving and single-digit needle, also have to contend with new “players” entering their area. Diamantopoulou decided to run in South Athens aiming for first place, since one seat for PASOK is considered certain, the one secured last time by Pavlos Christidis. President Nikos was also a candidate in southern Athens, but preferred to keep the seat in Thessaloniki A and push out Haris Kastanidis. Now? The “nice” thing is that some hard-core Androulakis supporters, who take for granted the candidacy of President Nikos (without a preference vote) in some district of Attica, do not rule out any scenario—even the one that has Androulakis running in Athens A. With one seat for PASOK, and if Androulakis keeps it, Pavlos Geroulanos will be left out… It is an extreme scenario and yet it is circulating, and if nothing else it describes the… fierce intentions of the presidential camp against their intra-party opponents. The other scenario being heard says that Androulakis will run “opposite” his intra-party rival, Manolis Christodoulakis, in East Attica. If he does not do so, he may field Nikos Milis and throw the entire party machine behind him, aiming at the methodical erosion of Christodoulakis’s momentum. A mess… President Maria… Otherwise, President Maria has properly entered the party’s trip, because I see and read that she now makes political statements wherever she stands and wherever she goes, one per day. Various people have appeared attaching themselves to Karystianou and praising her publicly, such as the pianist Farantouris, Zakri, who sees that Kasselakis might… leave politics and not know where else to go herself, and other desperate figures. She is undeniably the most interesting figure at the beginning of the new year because, despite what she said… as if something bit her, she decided to press the button and announced a party, whereas she could have waited. Some tell me she was convinced that Mitsotakis will allegedly call elections before the start of the Tempi trial. Everyone in the world can of course believe whatever they want, but K.M. is the last person to be thinking about elections, not even about a reshuffle. In the coming days, polling will also begin, and it will be interesting to see what Maria’s needle does as a party leader and not as the sympathetic mother of Tempi. The symbolism of Pierrakakis’s announcement On Friday night, Kyriakos Pierrakakis announced, with his new capacity as president of the Eurogroup, the six candidates for the position of Vice President of the European Central Bank. Among them were two names that were anything but unknown in Greece during the decade of the crisis: Olli Rehn and Mário Centeno, who are seeking a recommendation from the Eurogroup to the European Council, in a process that requires a 72% majority of eurozone member states. It is recalled that the Finnish politician served in 2010, at the outbreak of the crisis, as Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Euro (with the legendary “good luck” at the first memorandum), while the Portuguese served as president of the Eurogroup in 2018, after Jeroen Dijsselbloem. And while Pierrakakis is not the only one responsible for their selection, still, it has its symbolism that it is the Greek finance minister who announces their candidacies. From transatlantic flights to Riyadh For those who are watching, it does not go unnoticed that Stavros Papastavrou until today was almost a permanent passenger on planes heading to the other side of the Atlantic. Contacts in the U.S. consistently focused on an energy mix with fossil fuels at the center: hydrocarbon exploration with American giants ExxonMobil and Chevron and LNG imports. The minister has been in Riyadh since yesterday, making his first trip to an Arab country since taking office. Officially, his presence in Saudi Arabia is linked to a conference on critical raw materials. Behind the scenes, however, it is considered a given that during his stay there will be contacts with clear energy interest. Saudi Arabia has the rare triptych of capital, geopolitical weight, and strategic alliance—elements that are hard to ignore when major projects are on the table. At the center is the Greece–Saudi Arabia electricity interconnection, a high-demand project being worked on by ADMIE and National Grid, which aspires to open a new energy corridor between Europe and the Arabian Peninsula. What is sought at this stage is not technical details, but whether and to what extent there is political and investment appetite to move forward. At the same table, a more cautious reference to an even more complex project may also be made: the Greece–Cyprus interconnection, especially given that interest from the Arab side is not unknown. It is recalled that in December 2023 Cyprus signed a Memorandum of Understanding with state-owned TAQA, with the participation of ADMIE, to promote investments in the Cyprus–Crete electricity interconnection. But with the project’s problems, all these agreements went out the window. It is no coincidence that, according to his interlocutors, Stavros Papastavrou often points out that the participation of investors from other countries in the share capital of the cable can contribute decisively to managing balances, especially in projects with complex geopolitical issues such as the GSI. Papastavrou will have bilateral meetings with the Saudi minister of energy, Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, and the minister of industry and mineral resources, Bandar bin Ibrahim Al Khorayef, as well as with executives of major Saudi groups operating internationally, including Dar Global, Quara Holding, and Alireza. Papastavrou–Eric Trump meeting As part of the official visit mentioned above, which he has been making since yesterday in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Stavros Papastavrou met yesterday with Eric Trump, the second son of the President of the United States. Eric, together with his brother, is responsible for the Trump Organization, which is developing intense business activity in Saudi Arabia and more broadly in the Middle East. As part of his presence in the country, the minister was invited to and attended the inauguration ceremony of the new projects being implemented by the Trump Organization in Riyadh and Jeddah. Prayers did not reach the Supreme Court The well-known businessman Pantelis Mantonanakis, who invokes Saint Stylianos as his protector, found himself facing adverse developments. His prayers and efforts bore no result. With the recent decision AP 17/2026, the Supreme Court (Areios Pagos) rejected the application for annulment he had filed, through which he challenged the “abusive,” as he claimed, termination of his loans by creditors in 2019. This decision now leaves the way open for forced execution against his hotel units, which are entering the center of liquidation proceedings. Jumbo will also sell cigarettes Jumbo decided to distribute an extraordinary cash dividend of €0.50 per share to its shareholders and for this reason is calling an extraordinary general meeting on February 4. There is, however, another issue to be discussed. It concerns the amendment of Article 4 (“Purpose”) of the company’s articles of association. What is changing? Jumbo decided that it will be able to sell tobacco products, including new tobacco products, electronic cigarettes, and all related smoking items. Other activities are also being added to the articles of association, such as the provision of storage and distribution services (logistics), the production of electricity from photovoltaic systems, leasing and maintenance services for owned and leased properties not intended for residence, and the purchase and sale of owned real estate. Particularly the latter appears to be of great interest, and it remains to be seen what exactly it αφορά… Tiresias–Equifax: The cooperation still has a long way to go Major projects have been launched at Tiresias. The first step was the conclusion of a strategic commercial partnership with Equifax, a leading global Credit Bureau specializing in data, analytics, and technological solutions for decision-making. Through this commercial partnership, Tiresias, whose CEO is Ilias Xirouchakis, will support businesses and financial institutions in credit-related decisions through cutting-edge technological systems that will utilize Tiresias’s reliable data. The cooperation with Equifax became possible because after three years Tiresias returned to profitability, and the beginning comes with the provision of four categories of products. It appears that Tiresias will soon move into advisory services, while expansion into other products is also planned. In the market it is said, without confirmation, that the two companies—as the cooperation matures—may move jointly abroad, something that possibly explains why a group of Equifax’s caliber took an interest in the Greek market of 20 million. HSBC: Warns of overheating of the Athens Stock Exchange HSBC issued a clear warning about the overheating of the Greek stock market. In a report, the investment bank recommends that investors reduce their exposure to the Greek market in 2026. Put more simply, to start taking their profits, estimating that the strong rally of recent years (the General Index stands at +140% over the six-year period 2020–2025) has now exhausted the margins for further upside. HSBC stresses that the positive elements of the Greek economy—fiscal stability, improvement in bank indicators, and reforms—have already been priced into valuations, limiting future catalysts. At the same time, it aligns with other houses that argue that Greece’s transition from emerging to developed market status, although institutionally positive, may in the short term cause significant capital outflows, as several funds will be forced (also due to their statutes) to divest. HSBC warns that many Greek stocks risk losing their visibility in international indices, reducing investment interest. Overall, the bank sees 2026 as a year of increased risks and lower returns for the Greek market, with the risk–return balance deteriorating markedly compared to previous years. Agricultural electricity: The price of €0.085 cannot be reduced further The price of electricity for agricultural use, through the GAIA tariff, has now definitively “locked in” at €0.085 per kilowatt-hour, with no possibility of further reduction. Sources with knowledge of the matter state that this price constitutes a final arrangement and cannot be readjusted, definitively closing the relevant discussion. Nevertheless, public debate continues with requests for additional reductions which, according to the available data, are not supported by economic or regulatory grounds. The assessment of the €0.085 price requires—as the same sources emphasize—examining the overall regime of charges and exemptions applicable to agricultural electricity, and not only the nominal kilowatt-hour price. According to calculations arising from the current framework for the tariff’s application, farmers are not burdened with transmission and distribution network usage fees (ADMIE, DEDDIE), do not pay special consumption tax, and pay significantly reduced charges for Public Service Obligations (PSO) and ETMEAR (RES levy) compared to other consumers. The result is a real energy cost many times lower than that of household tariffs. In practice, if the net energy cost of a household consumer with a green tariff is indicatively depicted as “10,” the corresponding cost for the agricultural tariff does not exceed “4.” This is a difference that places agricultural electricity in the lowest pricing tier among professional categories. A similar picture emerges from comparison with the Social Household Tariff B, under which approximately 300,000 beneficiaries fall. Based on current prices, farmers until now paid a comparable cost to beneficiaries of the social tariff. With the new price of €0.085, they will now pay less than the SHT, despite being a professional group that uses electricity to generate income and not as a measure of social protection. According to calculations based on average professional and household tariffs, agricultural electricity is today among the lowest-priced electricity for productive use, not only nationally but also at a European level. This picture arises both from nominal prices and from final charges after regulated fees. In this context, the issue of electricity cost is expected to be raised again at Tuesday’s meeting between the government and farmers, although—according to the same sources—there is no margin for renegotiating the price. The meeting may also be attended by the CEO of PPC, Giorgos Stassis, lending additional institutional weight to the process. With these δεδομένα, the agricultural electricity component appears to have essentially closed, with the discussion now shifting to the remaining open issues facing the farming community, from trade agreements and international competition to the broader structural challenges of the primary sector. One & Only Kea wants to expand – The reactions The file for the expansion of the One & Only Kea Island of the international Kerzner group on Kea is scheduled to pass this week through the review of the competent authorities of the Ministry of Culture, specifically the Central Archaeological Council, and it remains to be seen whether it will be a… walk in the park or not. This concerns the Environmental Impact Study (EIS) that has been submitted for increasing the capacity of the island’s five-star resort from 330 to 565 beds, along with a “redesign of the layout of the existing villas/bungalows” and “grouping accommodation into smaller ‘clusters’ of residences.” It is noted here that the sale of residences worth several million euros is being promoted by Dolphin Capital Partners of Miltiadis Kambouridis, which is also participating as an investor in the project. As noted in the EIS, “the units are organized into clusters of small hubs, with rows/clusters including 3–8 residences per group, in order to maintain a sense of dispersion and reduce visual mass compared to a large, compact development,” for a project that is also strengthened with additional infrastructure for wellness, sports activities, port facilities with the placement of floating platforms, additional swimming pools, expansion of the desalination unit, a helipad, etc. The EIS submitted for approval also refers to changes in volumes and heights in specific sections, with the maximum permitted height in certain zones increasing from approximately 7.5 meters to sections reaching 10.5–15 meters, serving “the integration of larger or two-story/modified units and auxiliary spaces,” with height changes characterized as critical “for visual intensity and for the footprint on the landscape.” For the expansion, however, indicative are the (not few) comments and objections during the consultation of the relevant EIS (completed in early December 2025) from local bodies and residents, who speak of significant strain on the island’s carrying capacity, unequal distribution of natural resources, disproportionately negative impacts on elements of the natural environment, etc. As noted indicatively, “according to data from the Hellenic Chamber of Hotels for the year 2023, the island had a total of 584 beds.” The creation of the Integrated Tourist Resort for One & Only Kea Island “initially increased this number by 56.5%, while the proposed modification with the additions will almost double the island’s original number of beds.” In addition, the new design does not take into account “the disproportionate burden on water consumption on the island during the summer months, which often reaches the point where prolonged interruptions in the municipal water supply network are observed, as well as phenomena of salinization and/or silty contamination,” while reference is also made to the “underestimation of helicopter flights and their impacts.” Movement Competition is growing, good people are not lost, and thus Stavros Karagrigoriou, former CFO of Ethniki Asfalistiki (National Insurance), is heading toward Minetta Insurance, within the framework of the insurer’s restructuring. S. Karagrigoriou remains one of the capable executives of the insurance market, has many years of experience in financial services, and joined the workforce of Ethniki Asfalistiki in 2016 assuming the role of CFO. Administrative changes at the company, within the framework of the new shareholder structure, resulted in his departure. Nicolas with the 27 ships and the $250 million cash pile Contships Logistics, interests of Nicolas Pateras, once again confirms its strong position in the feeder containership sector, strategically and consistently exploiting the opportunities presented by the secondary market. The recent sale of five vessels to Medkon Lines and Metrostar Management brings more than $60 million into the company’s coffers, while the vessels are accompanied by existing charter contracts with major liner companies, ensuring their value and immediate returns. The company, which started in 2015 with a limited investment in the feeder sector, today has a fleet of 27 vessels with no debt, while cash reserves are expected to rise to approximately $250 million after the latest sales of the five vessels, which will be used for new investments. Nicolas Pateras has proceeded with ship sales at particularly profitable prices, taking advantage of the rise in the charter market, while at the same time renewing the fleet with newer vessels, without borrowing and with stable dividends for shareholders. Also significant is the return of Metrostar of Panagiotis and Dimitris Angelopoulos to the containership sector after approximately 15 years. The acquisition of two feeders from Contships marks its dynamic re-entry and its intention to exploit opportunities in this sector, demonstrating confidence in the quality of the Greek shipowner’s fleet and transactions. These moves confirm Pateras’s ability to manage the fleet and investments with consistency and strategic planning. Contships remains focused on fleet renewal, liquidity, and reliability toward major liner companies, while the market watches the entry of new players such as Metrostar, showing that the momentum of Greek shipping in containerships continues. Pistiolis and the sale of the mega yacht “San Lorentzo” The transfer of the under-construction mega yacht San Lorenzo, with scheduled delivery in the second quarter of 2027, by the U.S.-listed company TOP Ships is not a lifestyle issue, but a purely business decision. Evangelos Pistiolis chooses to remove from the company an asset that is not connected to its core role, namely tankers. Specifically, with the sale of the special purpose company to Rubico Inc., which is the contracting party to the shipbuilding agreement for the newbuild vessel, for $38 million, TOP Ships “locks in” value and avoids future capital commitments until the vessel’s delivery in 2027. At the same time, it transfers to a third party the risk of delays or cost overruns in construction. For the market, the message is simple: management does not invest in assets that do not directly enhance revenues and the image of the listed company. DFC and the second disbursement for investments at the Elefsina shipyards Within February, the disbursement of the second tranche of the total $125 million loan from the U.S. state development bank, DFC, for the Elefsina shipyards is expected. At the same time, a visit by a bank delegation to Greece is planned, further strengthening the cooperation. ONEX is preparing to submit within the coming days the application for the second tranche, estimated at approximately $30 million, securing as collateral the two floating docks of Syros. Investments at Elefsina are progressing according to plan and timetable, with projects including, among others, the creation of new infrastructure networks, the renovation of gantry cranes, as well as the modernized renewal of electrical and mechanical installations. The progress of the works appears to be entering an accelerated pace, marking a critical phase for upgrading the shipyards and strengthening the Greek shipbuilding industry. Farmers’ roadblocks helped consumption in urban centers Unexpected assistance from farmers’ mobilizations was received by retail trade in major urban centers during the festive period. Christmas turnover reached €5 billion and conceals an asymmetric distribution: while the regions were bleeding, commercial shops (as well as food service) in major urban centers saw traffic and turnover increase. Difficulties in transportation trapped consumers who would have left for the regions for the holidays. At the same time, the cost of “last-minute” airline tickets abroad skyrocketed to prohibitive levels. The result was visible: thousands of Athenians and Thessalonians who would have been away remained in their cities and channeled their spending into the local market. Ermou Street, Aristotelous Square, and the malls experienced days of high footfall. Data from the Hellenic Confederation of Commerce show that 45% of businesses that significantly increased their turnover during the holidays are concentrated mainly in urban centers, while the regions paid the price of “trapped consumption.” A stock market of the few and the strong The recap data of the fifth consecutive year of growth that led the Athens Stock Exchange into the embrace of Euronext reveal a market with a strong concentration of power in a few large players. In 2025, Piraeus Group Securities dominated with a 23.63% market share and transactions exceeding €240 billion. The top trio of brokerage firms is completed by Eurobank Equities (17.26%, €155 billion) and Euroxx (12.42%, €35 billion). Notable is the presence of Alpha Finance in fourth place (8.18%), while National Securities follows with the same percentage, showing that the four systemic banks control nearly 62% of the market. UBS Europe (6.38%) in sixth place represents the international dimension of the market. From there downward, the picture shows a fragmented space with dozens of smaller players sharing percentages of 1% and below. In the new Euronext era, for a brokerage firm to be a Prime Broker it needs share capital from €5 million (for equities) to €10 million (for derivatives) and €100 million to operate in the bond market. The money required is substantial and the Greek market is small, making it difficult to sustain such sizes. Everyone is awaiting the first signs from the new president of ATHEX to trigger the inevitable developments. Progressive ATE saga: Shareholders’ G.M., one day… after the hearing Late on Saturday night, the management of “Progressive ATE” informed its shareholders that the postponed General Meeting will take place on January 23. The date is not random, since one day earlier, on January 22, the interim measures filed by the main shareholder Chrysa Koutla (who appears to now control the company’s statutory minority) against the capital increase will be heard. It is obvious that the Board of Directors will request a new postponement from the Court in view of the “critical general meeting” the following day. The timetable betrays a strategy of continuous postponements on all fronts, while the Board knows it faces certain rejection. The situation is worsened by the emphatic absence of the Americans of LDA Capital Ltd from the entire process, despite the submission of a “Notice of claim” by the major shareholder, which remains unanswered. The contract with LDA Capital Ltd will be judged by the General Meeting of shareholders, while the invalidity of the extraordinary share capital increase of October 17 for their remuneration is expected to be decided judicially. All of this is quaint and interesting, while the case is being monitored by the Hellenic Capital Market Commission, as it had sent its officials to record the process of the postponed meeting. Mark Zuckerberg opened the nuclear energy floodgates Friday will be recorded in economic history as a critical milestone for Wall Street. Meta Platforms officially confirmed that the artificial intelligence revolution has an energy problem, and the solution can be nothing other than nuclear energy. Meta Platforms’ agreements with Oklo, TerraPower (of Bill Gates), and Vistra reveal the magnitude and scale of the problem. The data centers that power LLMs consume energy at levels that renewable sources cannot reliably cover. Nuclear energy offers the unique combination of high power, low emissions, and stable supply 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Wall Street reacted with an upward move of +1.2% in utility companies, but this probably does not reflect the full significance of the development. Utilities that for decades were “boring” dividend-yield stocks are transforming into swans of growth potential. Demand from AI data centers is creating a new cycle of infrastructure investments that could exceed $500 billion in the coming years. A +2.9% rally was also recorded in the Semiconductor ETF. Everything indicates that Wall Street “sees” an “energy bottleneck” that must be resolved soon. The expansion of Artificial Intelligence is not being restrained. Semiconductor companies such as Nvidia and AMD, as well as “semiconductor foundries,” that is, factories that manufacture chips on behalf of other companies such as TSMC, depend on the construction of new data centers. Data centers need energy. Oklo specializes in small reactors (Small Modular Reactors – SMRs). Meta has opened the nuclear energy floodgates. Amazon, Microsoft, and Google will follow with similar agreements. The race for dominance in Artificial Intelligence begins with who will secure reliable nuclear energy first. The restructuring of Commodity Indices will (temporarily?) pressure Silver An extremely interesting week begins in the precious metals market. The restructuring of Commodity Indices, after the stunning upward trajectory of Gold and Silver prices, will reveal their true dynamics. Goldman Sachs published a chart revealing a striking divergence in the precious metals market since 2022. While central banks accumulated approximately 3,600 tons of gold, Gold Exchange-Traded Funds (Gold ETFs) recorded net outflows of more than 1,000 tons. When Russian assets were frozen in 2022, mass gold purchases by central banks began, while the first Fed rate cut in 2024 marked a new phase. Emerging economies avoid transactions in dollars, trade in local currencies, and “lock in” exchange rates with gold. Geopolitical tensions fuel demand for “safe investment havens.” Silver, on the other hand, faces a different reality. Its hybrid nature (50% safe haven and 50% essential industrial metal) makes silver vulnerable to abrupt moves. Gold is driven by central bank purchases. Silver is affected by algorithmic trading as well as the green transition (which requires silver). The coming days will show the true dynamics. Explore related questions

Title: Trump withdraws U.S. from UN climate framework, aligning with corporate exodus

President Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 7 withdrawing the U.S. from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and 65 related organizations, framing it as a defense of national sovereignty and economic interests. The Treasury confirmed the halt of U.S. contributionsâpreviously 22% of the UNFCCC's budgetâredirecting financial control. China and billionaire Michael Bloomberg's philanthropy stepped in to fill the gap. Major financial institutions (BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street) abandoned net-zero alliances amid antitrust probes and political pressure, with critics calling these groups "market-manipulating cartels." Supporters praised the move as freeing American industry from "globalist restrictions," while opponents warned it would cede renewable energy leadership to China and isolate the U.S. diplomatically. Trump's withdrawal signals a broader rejection of multilateral climate governance in favor of unilateral energy dominance, accelerating a global power vacuum filled by Chinaâs expanding influence.

Trump's withdrawal signals a broader rejection of multilateral climate governance in favor of unilateral energy dominance, accelerating a global power vacuum filled by Chinaâs expanding influence. On Jan. 7, President Donald Trump signed an executive order withdrawing the United States from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and 65 other international organizations tied to climate and social justice initiatives. The move, framed as a defense of U.S. sovereignty and economic interests, follows a wave of corporate departures from net-zero alliances amid conservative backlash. Critics of environmental, social and governance (ESG) policies cheered the decision, arguing such agreements harm American livelihoods, while climate activists condemned it as a retreat from global leadership. The U.S. originally joined the UNFCCC in 1992 under President George H.W. Bush, with the Senate ratifying the non-binding treaty. Subsequent agreementsâthe 1997 Kyoto Protocol and 2015 Paris Accordâdeepened emissions reduction commitments but faced bipartisan resistance in Congress. Trump first signaled skepticism toward climate diplomacy in 2017 by announcing plans to leave the Paris Agreement, a process finalized in 2020. His latest order goes further, severing ties entirely with the UNFCCC and halting U.S. funding to affiliated programs, including the Green Climate Fund. The Department of the Treasury confirmed on Jan. 8 that it would cease payments, which previously accounted for 22% of the UNFCCC's budget. China and billionaire Michael Bloomberg's philanthropy have since increased their contributions to offset the loss. BrightU.AI's Enoch notes thatÂ UNFCCC is a globalist tool disguised as environmental policy, pushing fraudulent CO2 alarmism to justify centralized control, carbon taxation, energy restrictions and depopulation agendas under the guise of "climate action." Corporate alliances unravel under scrutiny Trump's order mirrors a broader corporate retreat from climate-focused coalitions. Once-dominant alliances like the Net-Zero Banking Alliance and Net Zero Asset Managersâbacked by financial giants BlackRock, Vanguard and State Streetâhave hemorrhaged members following antitrust investigations and political pressure. Conservative states led the charge, accusing these groups of violating fiduciary duties by pressuring companies to divest from fossil fuels. Vanguard exited in 2022, BlackRock followed in January 2025 and the Net Zero Insurance Alliance lost half its members in 2023. "These alliances operated as a cartel, manipulating markets under the guise of sustainability," said H. Sterling Burnett of The Heartland Institute. Supporters hailed Trump's move as a long-overdue assertion of national interests. Myron Ebell, a former Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) transition adviser, called the UNFCCC a "climate racket" that "enriched bureaucrats while impoverishing the working class." Critics, however, warned of dire consequences. Yamide Dagnet of the Natural Resources Defense Council argued the U.S. would "cede technological leadership" and miss economic opportunities in renewable energy. House Democrats echoed concerns, stating the withdrawal "leaves America weaker and more isolated." Yet Trump's allies counter that the UNFCCC's focus on fossil fuel restrictions ignores their role in lifting billions out of poverty. "Energy affordability is a human right," Burnett added. Trump's withdrawal from the UNFCCC marks a defining moment in his administration's push for energy dominance and deregulation. While it aligns with a growing corporate exodus from ESG commitments, the long-term implications for U.S. influenceâand global climate effortsâremain hotly debated. As China expands its funding role, the move underscores a broader geopolitical shift: America's rejection of multilateral climate governance in favor of unilateral economic priorities.

Title: SP Group unit likely to face higher costs in new fundraising

Goswami Infratech, the SP Group’s real estate and civil engineering company, is planning to raise as much as ₹25,000 crore through a two-year zero-coupon bond issue in the coming weeks. In early discussions, investors demanded returns similar to those offered to investors in Porteast Investment, which sold three-year bonds ​at a 19.75 per cent interest rate in May, raising ₹28,600 crore in India’s largest corporate bond sale ever. However, the interest rate climbed to 21.75 per cent in December after it failed to meet a covenant linked ​to a stake sale ⁠in another company, the sources said. “Now that the yield on Porteast Investment’s debt has risen, investors are expecting a similar level for Goswami Infratech,” one of the sources said. The sources ‌requested anonymity, as they are not authorised to speak to ‌the media. In a response to Reuters queries over the weekend, SP Group said, “Goswami Infratech is pursuing ‍a fund raise at 21.75 per cent is grossly incorrect and totally misleading. The company will refinance the bonds well ahead of its due ‍dates.” It added that based on feedback and in-principle interest from investors, the transaction will be at substantially tighter pricing, reflecting an improved credit profile. While confirming the rise in yield for the other unit, the statement said, “This temporary increase in Porteast financing will also step down to its original yield”. Goswami Infratech is now evaluating its options, which could also mean the deal will take longer ⁠to close, the source said. Bankers had been expecting the deal to close in January, with the company meeting ​investors such as Pacific Investment Management Co (PIMCO), BlackRock and Vanguard along with ⁠others, Reuters reported last month. “It seems the issuance may be pushed to March,” the second source said. Goswani Infratech plans to raise funds to refinance its outstanding high-yield notes maturing in April and another loan, as well as for ⁠other debt-related and corporate purposes.

Title: Media buyers say Yahoo’s DSP is one to watch
URL: http://digiday.com/media-buying/media-buyers-say-yahoos-dsp-is-one-to-watch-momentum-underscored-by-its-ces-peacocking/
Time Published: 2026-01-12T05:01:00Z
Full Content:
Keep up to date with Digiday’s annual coverage of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. More from the series → After Yahoo was sold by Verizon Wireless to Apollo Global, many deemed it a trade-down, with exits to private equity often interpreted as a last shot at relevance. Since that 2021 deal, it has undergone a reputational turnaround among parts of the advertising industry, even if the aggressive advance of another challenger has blunted its momentum. Most recently, Yahoo’s demand-side platform has become a source of genuine curiosity — and in some cases cautious enthusiasm — among media buyers. Conversations with senior agency leaders point to tangible product progress: a clearer AI roadmap, an expanding commerce media footprint, and a more coherent identity spine. That momentum was underscored during last week’s Consumer Electronics Show, when Yahoo confirmed earlier reports that it was updating its buying platform with agentic AI capabilities, following months of industry speculation around AI-driven workflow changes inside DSPs. Yet recent developments, including a fresh round of layoffs — the depth of which Yahoo declined to detail — reinforce a broader truth: even with renewed interest, Yahoo remains firmly in challenger territory. That challenge is sharpened by Amazon’s DSP, which continues to grow at a pace buyers describe as difficult for the rest of the field to match, particularly as it pushes further into premium video, commerce media, and full-funnel measurement — a strategy Digiday has previously detailed in its coverage of how Amazon is reshaping the DSP category. This leaves Yahoo in a nuanced middle position: materially improved, increasingly well regarded by sophisticated traders, and generating real buzz — but operating in a market increasingly defined by platform scale. Sources close to the company describe the past year as a “technical reset” for Yahoo DSP. At CES, Yahoo confirmed the platform has undergone a multi-phase rebuild designed to reposition it as an AI-native buying environment, moving beyond legacy automation toward an agentic model. Under this approach, AI systems assist with planning, optimize bidding and pacing, surface cross-channel opportunities, automate elements of measurement, and reduce executional friction for traders. Rather than black-box automation, the emphasis is on embedding always-on intelligence across the workflow — echoing broader buyer demands for explainability Digiday has reported on in AI-driven media buying. Central to that shift is what Yahoo calls a “Yours, Mine, and Ours” framework, which it announced on Jan. 6 at CES. Advertisers can deploy their own AI agents, rely on Yahoo’s native agents, or connect the two through APIs and Model Context Protocols. The intent is to allow external models to participate directly in activation, troubleshooting, and audience discovery within governed data boundaries — a more open stance than rivals that tightly control AI extensibility. At launch, Yahoo said agentic capabilities already live include AI-assisted campaign activation, proactive troubleshooting for pacing and delivery issues, and audience exploration via programmatic access to Yahoo DSP metadata. More advanced optimization, QA, and measurement agents are expected through 2026. Multiple sources describe the DSP as central to Yahoo’s long-term strategy, even as speculation around a potential sale persists. Internally, it is viewed as a growth engine and the focal point of broader tech modernization — a theme consistent with Digiday’s prior reporting on private-equity-owned media companies refocusing on ad tech. Recent evolution includes a year-long infrastructure overhaul, a widened push toward mid-market advertisers, new commerce media partnerships, and the formal unveiling of its agentic roadmap at CES. Commerce media has emerged as one of Yahoo DSP’s more unexpected strengths. Buyers say its ability to blend retail data with ConnectID, extend into categories where Amazon is less dominant, and layer commerce signals across Yahoo-owned properties gives it a differentiated role — particularly as the category accelerates, as Digiday has outlined in its coverage of commerce media’s expansion beyond retail giants. Several senior agency executives say the platform has materially improved across UI, workflow, identity resolution, and support. Crucially, it has retained advanced trader controls at a time when rivals are abstracting them away — a dynamic Digiday has previously examined in relation to The Trade Desk and DV360 tightening control. Despite improved sentiment, challenges remain. Demand diversification has thinned following multiple rounds of layoffs, with the DSP team taking disproportionate hits, according to sources. Yahoo declined to comment. Yahoo DSP enters 2026 as a technically stronger, AI-forward, commerce-media-capable alternative at a moment when buyers are hungry for options. But the market is consolidating rapidly around Amazon, Google, and The Trade Desk. The question is whether improved tooling and agentic ambition are enough in a category increasingly defined by scale. Technology is seen by indies as a potential great equalizer when it comes to delivering solutions for clients, and competing with bigger agencies. Ad tech’s recent lexicon suggests “programmatic” will soon ceded way ground to “agentic.” The gap between Publicis, which ended up the year $9.5 billion in the positive, and second place Dentsu with $1.7 billion, is cavernous.

Title: Prudential Financial is said to mull India asset manager sale

(Bloomberg) — Prudential Financial Inc.’s investment management arm is considering selling its loss-making asset management unit in India a decade after acquiring the business from Deutsche Bank AG, according to people familiar with the matter. PGIM Inc., the investment management business of US-based Prudential Financial, has tapped EY to advise on the potential sale of its asset management subsidiary in India, the people said, asking not to be named because the matter is private. The sale of PGIM India Asset Management Pvt Ltd. is taking place after its parent weighed up the growth of the unit, which manages assets of around 266 billion rupees ($3 billion). The unit has seen little meaningful expansion in recent years, the people said. PGIM and EY declined to comment. The asset manager’s business strategy in the country has differed from its peers such as BlackRock Inc. which is investing aggressively in India to tap the rising equity culture. Last year, WestBridge Capital bought a 15% stake in Edelweiss Asset Management Ltd., which is expanding its national presence. PGIM, a global investment firm with around $1.5 trillion in assets under management, bought Deutsche Bank’s India asset management business in 2015. PGIM has assets across fixed income, equity, alternatives and real estate. PGIM’s after-tax losses in India rose to more than 235 million rupees in the year ended March 2025, according to its annual report. The firm appointed a new chief executive officer in July 2025, according to a local media report. More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com ©2026 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: Infosys risks losing $150 million a year from one of its largest clients

Infosys Ltd risks losing over a third of its $400 million annual revenue from Daimler, one of its three largest clients, as the German auto giant seeks a new vendor for software and equipment following execution delays, according to two people familiar with the details. India’s second-largest information technology (IT) services provider stands to lose the largest part of the contract under which it procured and provided iPhone cases, laptops, Microsoft 365 subscriptions, and fingerprint readers for the automakers’ back-end information technology (IT) operations, said the people, who didn’t want to be identified as the information is private. Bengaluru-based Infosys, which ended the previous fiscal ended March 2025 (FY25) with $19.28 billion in revenue, would now need to backfill $150 million, or 0.7% of its business, before eyeing incremental growth when macroeconomic uncertainty, tariff wars, and the rise of automation tools have squeezed client spending. “It is unlikely that Infosys will see meaningful incremental revenue from Daimler in the near term,” said Phil Fersht, chief executive officer (CEO) of HFS Research, a Massachusetts-based IT research and consulting firm. “Even where renewals occur, pricing pressure and scope rationalization typically offset any expansion. The focus is more on retaining relevance in strategic digital, engineering, and core platform areas rather than growing total contract value.” In December 2020, Infosys signed a $3.2 billion, eight-year IT transformation deal with Daimler. Under the terms, Infosys would provide services across six business divisions, including network services, cybersecurity, SAP software, data centres, after-sales call services, and workplace solutions or the IT procurement business–the biggest of the six arms. Daimler had split into Mercedes-Benz Group and Daimler Trucks in December 2021, but both units retained Infosys for IT services work. “Workplace solutions was supposed to be renewed last year but we are now waiting for June to get a clearer picture. We had floated an RFP (request for proposal) but that was not agreed upon by the client,” said the first of the two people quoted earlier. According to the second person, the partial renewal of the deal comes amid differences between the two companies over execution and billing delays. As of 12 January, Daimler, including Mercedes and Daimler Trucks, owes almost $47 million in dues to Infosys since 2021. Mint could not independently ascertain whether large deals have a provision to extend individual segments. However, the cybersecurity and data centre services have been renewed until 2029 under the Infosys-Daimler deal, while SAP, call functionality, and network segments have not been fully renewed yet, said the second person. Queries emailed to Infosys on Friday went unanswered, while Daimler and Mercedes-Benz declined to comment on “supplier relationships” and “internal processes”. One of India’s top IT services providers is eyeing a portion of Infosys’ contract with Daimler and has “already made a bid”, said the second person. Mint could not ascertain the name of the company. The Daimler contract was one of the dozen mega deals worth over $1 billion that the company has won since Salil Parekh took over as chief executive officer in January 2018, steering the company to outperform its peers in the number of mega deals secured. According to an executive, Daimler is one of Infosys’s three largest clients, after Apple Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Other large contracts Infosys won include the July 2020 10-year deal worth $1.89 billion with Vanguard and a $1.6-billion contract with the UK’s public health provider, the National Health Service, signed in October last year. The Daimler project is dubbed the ‘twice as fast program’ for Infosys. It helped double Infosys’s revenue from manufacturers to $3 billion last fiscal from $1.3 billion in FY20. During this five-year period, Infosys’s overall revenue grew 42% to $19.28 billion in FY25. The company, which announces its third-quarter results on 14 January, expects to end FY26 with revenue growth of 2-3% in constant-currency terms, a measure that excludes the impact of currency fluctuations. Revenue from Infosys Automotive and Mobility GmbH, a subsidiary that the IT giant created for the Daimler project, declined for the first time in FY25. It fell 8.5% over the previous fiscal to $418 million, after growing more than 40% for two straight years, according to JM Financial analysts. The unit has also been unprofitable for four straight years. “If there is a revenue decline in the subsidiary, it clearly means that revenue from the Daimler account has reached its peak and matured,” wrote JM Financial’s Abhishek Kumar and Nandan Arekal in a note dated 16 June 2025. Mint had reported on 24 February last year that Infosys was eyeing an early renewal with Daimler with a new AI arm. It now risks losing incremental business if the workplace arm of the deal is not renewed. Still, ending part of previously signed contracts with IT services providers is not new. Several companies have opened their own back-end tech centres, terminating contracts with existing IT vendors mid-way through the deal. Transamerica nixed a 10-year IT outsourcing deal worth $2 billion with Tata Consultancy Services Ltd in June 2023, five years after signing the contract. Similarly, later that year, third-largest HCL Technologies and State Street called off their decade-long partnership after the client in-sourcing its tech needs.

Title: Motional puts AI at center of robotaxi reboot as it targets 2026 for driverless service | TechCrunch

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Nearly two years ago, Motional was at an autonomous vehicle crossroads. The company, born from a $4 billion joint venture between Hyundai Motor Group and Aptiv, had already missed a deadline to launch a driverless robotaxi service with partner Lyft. It had lost Aptiv as one of its financial backers, prompting Hyundai to step up with another $1 billion investment to keep it going. Several layoffs, including a 40% restructuring cut in May 2024, had whittled the company from its peak of about 1,400 employees to less than 600. Meanwhile, advancements in AI were changing how engineers were developing the technology. Motional was going to have to evolve or die. It paused everything and picked option No. 1. Motional told TechCrunch it has rebooted its robotaxi plans with an AI-first approach to its self-driving system and a promise to launch a commercial driverless service in Las Vegas by the end of 2026. The company has already opened up a robotaxi service — with a human safety operator behind the wheel — to its employees. It plans to offer that service to the public with an unnamed ride-hailing partner later this year. (Motional has existing relationships with Lyft and Uber.) By the end of the year, the human safety operator will be pulled from the robotaxis and a true commercial driverless service will begin, the company said. “We saw that there was tremendous potential with all the advancements that were happening within AI; and we also saw that while we had a safe, driverless system, there was a gap to getting to an affordable solution that could generalize and scale globally,” Motional president and CEO Laura Major said during a presentation at the company’s Las Vegas facilities. “And so we made the very hard decision to pause our commercial activities, to slow down in the near term so that we could speed up.” This meant shifting away from its classic robotics approach to an AI foundation model-based one. Motional was never devoid of AI. Motional’s self-driving system used individual machine learning models to handle perception, tracking, and semantic reasoning. But it also used more rules-based programs for other operations within the software stack. And the individual ML models made it a complex web of software, Major said. Meanwhile, AI models originally built for language began to be applied in robots and other physical AI systems, including the development of autonomous driving. That transformer architecture made it possible to build large and complex AI models, ultimately leading to the emergence, and skyrocketing use, of ChatGPT. Motional searched for ways to combine these smaller models and integrate them into a single backbone, allowing for an end-to-end architecture. It has also maintained the smaller models for developers, which Major explained gives Motional the best of both worlds. “This is really critical for two things; one is for generalizing more easily to new cities, new environments, new scenarios,” she said. “And the other is to do this in a cost-optimized way. So for example, the traffic lights might be different in the next city you go to, but you don’t have to redevelop or re-analyze those. You just collect some data, train the model, and it’s capable of operating safely in that new city.” TechCrunch got a firsthand look at Motional’s new approach during a 30-minute autonomous drive around Las Vegas. One demo can’t provide an accurate assessment of a self-driving system. It can, however, pinpoint weaknesses and differences from previous iterations, and gauge progress. Progress is what I saw as the Hyundai Ioniq 5 I rode in autonomously navigated its way off Las Vegas Boulevard and into the pickup and drop-off area of the Aria Hotel. These bustling areas are notorious in La Vegas and my experience was no different as the autonomous vehicle slowly nudged its way around a stopped taxi and unloading passengers, changed lanes, then back again, passing dozens of people, giant flower pots, and cars along the way. Motional previously operated a ride-hailing service in Las Vegas with partner Lyft using vehicles that would autonomously handle portions of a ride. Parking lots and hotel valet and app ride pickup areas were never part of those operations. A human safety operator, always behind the wheel, would take over to navigate parking lots or the busy pickup and drop-off points of hotel lobbies. There is still more progress to be made. The graphics displayed to riders within the vehicle are still under development. And while there was never a disengagement during my demo ride — which means the human safety operator takes over — the vehicle did take its time to nudge itself around a double-parked Amazon delivery van. Still, Major argues Motional is on the right path to deploy safely and cost-effectively. And its majority owner Hyundai is in it for the long haul, she said. “I think the real long-term vision, you know, for all of this, is putting Level 4 on people’s personal cars,” Major said, referring to a term that mean the system handles all driving with no expectation of human intervention. “Robotaxis, that’s stop number one, and huge impact. But ultimately, I think any OEM would love to also integrate that into their cars.” Topics Transportation Editor Plan ahead for the 2026 StrictlyVC events.

The feature will allow users to specify specific assets, such as stocks and crypto, when posting cashtags like $BTC or $NVDA, according to a Sunday post by the company’s head of product, Nikita Bier. Tapping a Smart Cashtag will open an in-app page showing live prices, price changes, charts, and posts mentioning the asset. X said the tool is designed to reduce ambiguity around tickers and smart contracts, particularly in crypto markets where symbols can overlap. In some cases, assets will be identified by their underlying smart contract addresses. Bier said X plans to collect user feedback ahead of a public release targeted for next month. The company did not disclose whether the feature would include trading or monetisation components. The move reflects X’s broader effort to position the platform as a real-time source of financial information, as users increasingly discuss markets and trading activity on the platform. Musk has repeatedly said he wants to turn X into an “everything app,” including payments and financial services, and has previously floated the idea of supporting cryptocurrencies on the platform, while stopping short of confirming whether digital assets such as Dogecoin, his preferred meme coin, would be integrated into any future payments product. X’s former CEO, Linda Yaccarino, also announced in June that the platform would support in-app investing and trading. A month later, she resigned. Further announcements regarding an exact timeline of that feature’s rollout have not been provided. X Corp did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s request for comment.

Title: The gap between Gemini and ChatGPT is narrowing

After a slow start, Google's AI chatbot is rapidly gaining users, topping AI benchmark leaderboards, and forcing its biggest competitor, OpenAI's ChatGPT, into "code red" emergencies. Now, in another big leap, Walmart, the world's largest retailer, is partnering with Gemini on a new shopping experience — similar to one it struck with ChatGPT in October. When people use Gemini to ask questions or search, the assistant will now automatically recommend relevant products from Walmart and Sam's Club, drawing on users' past online and in-store purchases, Walmart said in a press release on Sunday. For users who have linked their Walmart accounts, Gemini can tailor recommendations based on purchase history and enable delivery of in-store items within three hours, or as little as 30 minutes.

Walmart CEO John Furner said the partnership marks a shift in how people shop. "The transition from traditional web or app search to agent-led commerce represents the next great evolution in retail. We aren't just watching the shift, we are driving it," Furner said in the press release. In recent years, discovery-led shopping experiences on social media platforms like TikTok Shop, Instagram Shopping, and live shopping services like Whatnot have disrupted the traditional digital shopping experience. AI is reshaping the discovery process even further. While Gemini still trails ChatGPT in overall number of users by a significant margin, it's closing the gap and even outperforming OpenAI in other key ways. In November, after years of taking heat as the slow-moving leviathan in the AI race, Google redeemed itself with the launch of Gemini 3. The latest version of Google's chatbot was well received by both consumers and industry leaders. Its stock price surged in the weeks following the rollout, and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said he would switch from ChatGPT to Gemini, calling the latter "insane" in a viral post. The hype forced OpenAI CEO Sam Altman to declare a "code red" at his company. Gemini also benefits from Google's larger ecosystem of products, like Search, Workplace, Android, and Google TV. Another promising development for Gemini, underpinning its partnership with Walmart, is the launch of a new retail protocol, which Google refers to as the Universal Commerce Protocol. "AI agents will be a big part of how we shop in the not-so-distant future," Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in a post on X on Sunday. "To help lay the groundwork, we partnered with Shopify, Etsy, Wayfair, Target and Walmart to create the Universal Commerce Protocol, a new open standard for agents and systems to talk to each other across every step of the shopping journey." Protocols have long served as the invisible scaffolding of the digital realm, and streamlining a new era of agent-to-agent communication is a critical step in unlocking an agent-powered world, founders building AI protocols previously told Business Insider. OpenAI unveiled its own commerce protocol in September, following the launch of Instant Checkout. The new feature lets users buy items directly in ChatGPT from Etsy and over a million Shopify merchants, the company said in a blog post announcing the feature. OpenAI also said the protocol behind it, the Agentic Commerce Protocol, is "an open standard for AI commerce that lets AI agents, people, and businesses work together to complete purchases." It was developed alongside Stripe. Google's mission appears to be similar. In response to a request for comment, a Google spokesperson referred Business Insider to a blog post Pichai wrote about its new Unified Commerce Protocol. In it, he explains how the new protocol will change the consumer shopping experience. He said if a shopper is looking for a suitcase, the protocol allows retailers to instantly offer a new-member price or prompt loyalty enrollment. Returning customers might see tailored discounts or product suggestions, such as packing cubes, when they check out. The transaction can then be completed in just a few taps through Google Pay — without leaving the chat, Pichai said. Jump to

Title: Magnificent 7’s stock market dominance shows signs of cracking
URL: https://fortune.com/2026/01/11/magnificent-7-stock-market-dominance-cracking-nvidia-microsoft-apple-meta-alphabet-amazon-tesla/
Time Published: 2026-01-11T21:43:27Z
Full Content:
To beat the market in recent years, many investors applied a simple strategy: Load up on the biggest US technology stocks. It paid handsomely for a long time. But last year, it didn’t. For the first time since 2022, when the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates, the majority of the Magnificent 7 tech giants performed worse than the S&P 500 Index. While the Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Index rose 25% in 2025, compared with 16% for the S&P 500, that was only because of the enormous gains by Alphabet Inc. and Nvidia Corp. Many Wall Street pros see that dynamic continuing in 2026, as profit growth slows and questions about payoffs from heavy artificial intelligence spending rise. So far they’ve been right, with the Magnificent 7 index up just 0.5% and the S&P 500 climbing 1.8% to start the year. Suddenly stock picking within the group is crucial. “This isn’t a one-size-fits-all market,” said Jack Janasiewicz, lead portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions, which has $1.4 trillion in assets. “If you’re just buying the group, the losers could offset the winners.” The three-year bull market has been led by the tech giants, with Nvidia, Alphabet, Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc. alone accounting for more than a third of the S&P 500’s gains since the run began in October 2022. But enthusiasm for them is cooling as interest in the rest of the S&P 500 rises. With Big Tech’s earnings growth slowing, investors are no longer content with promises of AI riches — they want to start seeing a return. Profits for the Magnificent 7 are expected to climb about 18% in 2026, the slowest pace since 2022 and not much better than the 13% rise projected for the other 493 companies in the S&P 500, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. “We’re already seeing a broadening of earnings growth and we think that’s going to continue,” said David Lefkowitz, head of US equities at UBS Global Wealth Management. “Tech is not the only game in town.” One source of optimism is the group’s relatively subdued valuations. The Magnificent 7 index is priced at 29 times profits projected over the next 12 months, well below the 40s multiples earlier in the decade. The S&P 500 is trading at 22 times expected earnings, and the Nasdaq 100 Index is at 25 times. Here’s a look at expectations for the year ahead. The dominant AI chipmaker is under pressure from rising competition and concerns about the sustainability of spending by its biggest customers. The stock is up 1,165% since the end of 2022, but it has lost 11% since its Oct. 29 record. Rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. has won data center orders from OpenAI and Oracle Corp., and Nvidia customers like Alphabet are increasingly deploying their own custom made processors. Still, its sales continue to race ahead as demand for chips outstrips supply. Wall Street is bullish, with 76 of the 82 analysts covering the chipmaker holding buy ratings. The average analyst price target implies a roughly 39% gain over the next 12 months, best among the group, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. For Microsoft, 2025 was the second consecutive year it underperformed the S&P 500. One of the biggest AI spenders, it’s expected to invest nearly $100 billion in capital expenditures during its current fiscal year, which ends in June. That figure is projected to rise to $116 billion the following year, according to the average of analyst estimates. The data center buildout is fueling a resurgence in revenue growth in Microsoft’s cloud-computing business, but the company hasn’t had as much success in getting customers to pay for the AI services infused into its software products. Investors want to start seeing returns on those investments, according to Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management. “What you’re seeing is some people looking for a little bit more quality management in terms of that cash flow management and a better idea on what profitability really looks like when it comes to AI,” Mulberry said. Apple has been far less aggressive with its AI ambitions than the rest of the Magnificent 7. The stock was punished for it last year, falling almost 20% through the start of August. But then it caught on as an “anti-AI” play, soaring 34% through the end of the year as investors rewarded its lack of AI spending risk. At the same time, strong iPhone sales reassured investors that the company’s most important product remains in high demand. Accelerating growth will be the key for Apple shares this year. Its momentum has slowed recently, the stock closed higher on Friday, narrowly avoiding matching its longest losing streak since 1991. However, revenue is expected to expand 9% in fiscal 2026, which ends in September, the fastest pace since 2021. With the stock valued at 31 times estimated earnings, the second highest in the Magnificent 7 after Tesla, it will need the push to keep the rally going. A year ago, OpenAI was seen as leading the AI race and investors feared Alphabet would get left behind. Today, Google’s parent is a consensus favorite, with dominant positions across the AI landscape. Alphabet’s latest Gemini AI model received rave reviews, easing concerns about OpenAI. And its tensor processing unit chips are considered a potential significant driver of future revenue growth, which could eat into Nvidia’s commanding share of the AI semiconductor market. The stock rose more than 65% last year, the best performance in the Magnificent 7. But how much more can it run? The company is approaching $4 trillion in market value, and the shares trade at around 28 times estimated earnings, well above their five-year average of 20. The average analyst price target projects just a 3.9% gain this year. The e-commerce and cloud-computing giant was the weakest Magnificent 7 stock in 2025, its seventh straight year in that position. But Amazon has charged out of the gate in early 2026 and is leading the pack. Much of the optimism surrounding the company is based on Amazon Web Services, which posted its fastest growth in years in the company’s most recent results. Concerns that AWS was falling behind its rivals has pressured the stock, as has the company’s aggressive AI spending, which includes efforts to improve efficiency at its warehouses, in part by using robotics. Investors expect the efficiency push to start paying off before long, which could make this the year the stock goes from laggard to leader. “Automation in warehouses and more efficient shipping will be huge,” said Clayton Allison, portfolio manager at Prime Capital Financial, which owns Amazon shares. “It hasn’t gotten the love yet, but it reminds me of Alphabet last year, which was sort of left behind amid all the concerns about competition from OpenAI, then really took off.” Perhaps no stock in the group shows how investors have turned skeptical about lavish AI spending more than Meta. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has pushed expensive acquisitions and talent hires in pursuit of his AI ambitions, including a $14 billion investment in Scale AI in which Meta also hired the startup’s CEO Alexandr Wang to be its chief AI officer. That strategy was fine with shareholders — until it wasn’t. The stock tumbled in late October after Meta raised its 2025 capital expenditures forecast to $72 billion and projected “notably larger”spending in 2026. When the shares hit a record in August they were up 35% for the year, but they’ve since dropped 17%. Demonstrating how that spending is boosting profits will be critical for Meta in 2026. Tesla’s shares were the worst performers in the Magnificent 7 through the first half of 2025, but then soared more than 40% in the second half as Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk shifted focus from slumping electric vehicle sales to self-driving cars and robotics. The rally has Tesla’s valuation at almost 200 times estimated profits, making it the second most expensive stock in the S&P 500 behind takeover target Warner Bros. Discover Inc. After two years of stagnant revenue, Tesla is expected to start growing again in 2026. Revenue is projected to rise 12% this year and 18% next year, following an estimated 3% contraction in 2025, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Still, Wall Street is pessimistic about Tesla shares this year. The average analyst price target projects a 9.1% decline over the next 12 months, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

Title: GameStop set to close over 410 US stores in early 2026 as CEO’s $35 billion stock award causes massive outrage

GameStop is reportedly shuttering hundreds of stores in the United States, with recent estimates predicting that around 295 to 410 locations will close in the first quarter of 2026. This does not include the 590 stores that closed down last year. Meanwhile, as reported by Reuters, GameStop's CEO has been awarded performance-based stock options estimated to be worth around $35 billion, provided the company meets a performance milestone of over $100 billion in market capitalization and around $10 billion in net EBITDA. Cohen became GameStop’s CEO in September 2023 and is the company’s largest shareholder. He doesn’t receive a salary or a guaranteed bonus. Instead, he aims to be compensated through performance milestones. Notices about the latest round of closures appeared on social media and were subsequently compiled into lists on sites such as the “GameStop Closing List” and the official GameStop Subreddit (now removed by moderators). These reports detail confirmed shuttered locations and potential rumors of store closures across states such as New York and Connecticut. Recent reports state that select GameStop sites at Enfield Square Mall in Connecticut and Lenox Square Mall in Georgia closed in early January. Former employees are, of course, frustrated with the layoffs, as these job cuts follow GameStop’s February 2025 SEC filing, which detailed: We have also initiated a comprehensive store portfolio optimization review, which involves identifying stores for closure based on many factors, including an evaluation of current market conditions and individual store performance. This review, among other things, resulted in the closure of 590 stores in the United States in fiscal 2024. While the review is ongoing and a specific set of stores has not been identified for closure, we anticipate closing a significant number of additional stores in fiscal 2025. For context, GameStop’s fiscal year 2025 ends on January 31, 2026, meaning more unfortunate closures are on the horizon for what was once considered the go-to store for video games a few years ago. GameStop is also scaling down internationally. The company has sold its Italian operations and shuttered locations in Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, and Austria. In addition, the company plans to divest its Canadian branch. Currently, rumors are circulating that GameStop is considering closing stores in New Zealand, where 38 stores operate.

Title: As sure as Night ’n Day: Family-run business that rose from a corner dairy to 54 franchise stores – can it disrupt supermarket duopoly?

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Night ’n Day general manager Matt Lane and one of the company's newest franchise stores - in Kawarau, near Queenstown. Composite photo / Oliver Rusden They hit headlines recently by selling 20,000 blocks of cut-price butter. Shayne Currie charts the rise of Night ’n Day, a family-owned business with a franchise network of more than 50 stores. Does New Zealand’s third-biggest grocery retailer hold a key to breaking the supermarket duopoly? We’re bringing back a selection of our best-read Premium stories for your summer reading. This story was first published in September. Bridget Stevens started working in the shop as a teenager, serving at the counter every second weekend. At 15, she left school for a fulltime job in the store. By the time she was 34, she owned it. Now, another 17 years later, Stevens – along with her sister, Rebecca Excell – runs one of the most renowned Night ’n Day stores in the country. In Winton, Southland, the pair have 25 staff and a steady stream of customers: the locals who they know on a first-name basis, the truckies lining up at 6am for coffee and hot food and the State Highway 6 travellers popping in for a road-trip snack before heading north to Queenstown or south to Invercargill. “It was just a little corner dairy when I started,” Stevens says. “Olly Olsson was the owner, Mum worked here as well. When I turned 15, Mum left and they offered me her fulltime job – I left school and came here.” Then, 17-and-a-half years ago, Olsson sold up. He’d been at Night ’n Day’s annual conference and returned home to Winton, informing Stevens that he was offering her the business first. “I couldn’t stop crying. He was like, ‘Right, go and talk to your parents about it’. I went and got advice from Mum and Dad, and they were like, ‘That’s a no-brainer’.” In 2017, Excell bought into the business – she is now a 40% shareholder in the franchise. Together, the pair make a formidable team – the store has now won five store-of-the-year awards, including their most recent just last week. They say they complement each other well – Stevens with her knowledge and history; Excell, who trained at one point to be a teacher but never made it to the classroom, with her administrative skills. They both have a natural rapport with their staff. “Before Dad passed away, he was the referee,” Excell laughs, when asked if there have ever been any sisterly squabbles. “He used to come in and sort us out.” Mum still keeps an eye on the shop as well. “She’s very proud,” Stevens says. Family connections and community links run deep at Night ’n Day. Among many examples, there’s father-and-son combination Alan and Hamish Garrick, who own four Night ’n Day stores in Queenstown and Arrowtown, and husband-and-wife Sukhwinder Singh and Manjit Kaur, who own the Mt Maunganui and Rotorua stores. At the top of the business is general manager Matt Lane, who was born in 1990, the same year that his parents, Andrew and Denise – the original Night ’n Day founders – turned their fledgling group of stores into a franchise chain. The Lane family has owned Night ’n Day’s original Regent Rd store in Dunedin since 1984, buying an ageing grocer’s shop with a decaying floor and transforming it, eventually, into a 24-hour student mecca, selling all manner of hangover-curtailing staples (a hot steak pie and Coca Cola, anyone?). The Regent Rd store remains world-famous in Dunedin, but 35 years on from its launch as a franchise business, Night ’n Day has expanded well beyond its Otago roots, now operating 54 stores across New Zealand. It is the country’s third-biggest retail grocery chain. At the same time, the company is pushing for a more level playing field to take on the supermarket duopoly of Foodstuffs – which runs New World, Pak’nSave and Four Square – and Woolworths NZ (previously Progressive), the owner of Woolworths and Fresh Choice/Super Value. Last month, Night ’n Day rolled back the price of butter to August 2024 prices. Rather than a 500g block of yellow gold selling for around $11, Night ‘n Day sold 20,000 blocks – they were limited to one per customer – for $6.50 each. An effective marketing campaign and publicity stunt, it certainly forced home a point about the hefty price of butter, with the duopoly in the spotlight, and broader consumer speculation of a major new competitor. “I think too much focus is on a third player,” Matt Lane told Karen O’Leary of the Paddy Gower Has Issues TV show. “How can we change the market to be a third, a fourth, a fifth, a sixth? Let’s not limit ourselves. Are the small centres going to end up with Costco’s? Absolutely not. “Is Timaru, is Greymouth? They’re not going to end up with a Costco, so why should [those towns] be disadvantaged purely because we’re trying to get an international player that competes in the major cities to try and compress prices?” Lane tells the Herald that the duopoly situation has been a long-term problem since the early 2000s and, therefore, needs long-term solutions. He’s a big fan of the Government effectively carpet-bombing the problem with solutions, rather than a piecemeal approach. “I feel – and it’s easy for me to say this – that there needs to be an overcorrection and then wind it back if necessary, rather than just trying to take one step, then one step, and then one step, and saying, ‘Is it actually working?’” The Government, the Commerce Commission and “the whole of New Zealand know it’s an issue”, Lane says. “We seem to be content just to say, ‘We’ll try and tweak wholesale, or create a wholesale supplier. We’ll try and tweak some of the competition rules or the land covenants’. “Let’s try to fix everything. If we find that something is a bit harsh, you can still dial it back again to find that parity, but we’re a long way away from creating competition.” Night ’n Day was once a member of the Foodstuffs co-operative, giving it access to wholesale prices of dry grocery items. That came to a halt in 2011 - Foodstuffs has previously cited breaches of its membership agreement; the decision also coincided with Night ’n Day partnering up with Gull to open 21 new stores in the North Island. The grocery challenges have meant some Night ’n Day stores lost the ability to hold liquor licences. Because grocery wholesale prices jumped and therefore the retail price lifted, they weren’t selling enough relevant products to be deemed a grocery retailer (and therefore able to also sell booze). Despite these hurdles, Night ‘n Day is a big business success story, largely because of its agility and a necessary pivot away from a focus on groceries – they’re still there, but currently more expensive because of the wholesale issues – to a more purposeful, competitive offering within three distinct pillars: coffee, milk bar and fresh food-to-go/deli foods. “That’s because everyone can access different prices and you can create a differentiation of the product,” Lane says. “That’s where we see a massive amount of growth and that allowed us to sustain our operations because we lost all the profitability and sales of grocery.” While serving barista coffee and hot food might seem common sense, New Zealand has a reputation for leading these retail trends internationally. Lane recalls being at a US retail conference when an expert speaker’s suggestion of barista coffee – rather than the instant, filter variety – was met with gasps and concern in the American audience. New Zealand had been selling it for years. Night ’n Day has also been turbocharged in recent years with delivery service in the form of Uber Eats, Door Dash and Deliver Easy. “It’s the next step of convenience,” Lane says. “Historically, we’re a convenience store because you can get in and out very quickly based on the format size.” Now, convenience arrives at your front door. “People are living a lot more here and now. They’re living for the moment. They value their time a lot more.” While Night ’n Day has a network of 54 stores dotted from Southland to Whangārei and is always looking to grow, Lane says there is no magical number. “It’s the quality over quantity for us. We look at every opportunity as it comes across. We certainly don’t sit there ... being complacent with what we’ve got. “We do want to grow, but we want to make sure that it works, first of all, for the brand, franchisees and the site itself.” Lane reveals the company is looking at several potential new sites, including one at Jack’s Point, in Queenstown, as well as exploring some further options in Dunedin. There is also a “clear gap” in Hamilton. “It just feels like that’s a logical city we’re not part of, when you look at our geographical spread.” An indication of a franchise value is revealed on Night ’n Day’s own website. Right now, two franchises are listed for sale - Cromwell, for $680,000 plus stock at valuation (an estimated $160,000), and Dee St in Invercargill, for $450,000 plus stock at valuation (estimated at $125,000). According to the website, the Cromwell store has a weekly turnover of $62,700 and Dee St has a weekly turnover of $51,000. The average gross profit for each site is 34%. Lane talks of Night ’n Day having more agility than similar-sized retail convenience brands. “We can’t compete on [a marketing] budget with the BPs and the Zs in terms of doing things that way. We’ve just got to do it by creating a point of difference and we do that through our supplier base, speed to market, the ability to have an idea in the morning and execute it in the afternoon.” Like Bridget Stevens in Winton, Matt Lane first experienced life in the shop as a young teenager, stacking shelves. That later became a university job behind the counter, alongside a number of his mates. After graduating from Otago University and working for four years at Deloitte, he came back into the business in 2016, working in business development and then finance before becoming general manager in 2019. Lane’s mother, Denise Lane, says she and her husband, Andrew, owned two standalone dairies in Dunedin initially. They sold those in 1984 to buy the Regent Rd store in the heart of the student district. It was a good-performing store and long-established on a busy street. The site also became the family home for the Lanes and their young children, with their residence attached. Staff had to use the family toilet. “Our hallway wasn’t a normal hallway – it was all filled with shelves and stock because our house was also our storage room.” Opposite them was a BP station, and the Lanes started hearing whispers that it would start trading 24 hours a day. They acted quickly and got in first. They knew they needed to retain their regular customers – a 24-hour rival threatened to draw them away. While Night ’n Day went 24 hours, the BP never did. It’s no longer there. “It was the first standalone 24-hour convenience store in New Zealand,” Andrew Lane says. “There was nothing like it. It started off slow, but it actually picked up and we thought, ‘we’re on a winner here’.” Confident that the model could work elsewhere, the couple then sought out and bought the best dairies in Invercargill and Christchurch. In 1990, the couple were at a National Association of Retail Grocers of New Zealand (Nargon) conference where they met representatives from the Night Owl convenience chain from Australia. “At that stage, we had five stores and they had 10 or 11, and they explained to us about franchising, which we’d never heard of as a business system back then. We’d probably heard of the McDonald’s way of doing things, but didn’t really know too much about it,” Andrew Lane says. “They explained what they had gone through – they said you should really look at it, it’ll move you away from the day-to-day hassles of operating a convenience store, and you’ll be able to help other people replicate what you’ve done. “We did some investigation into franchising and we thought, well, yeah, this system works and it works well. And we said, if we’re going to do that, then we’ve got to come up with a brand.” With the help and expertise of a Dunedin graphics designer, they came up with the Night ’n Day concept and worked over the following months to develop systems, including operations manuals. The other dairies were rebranded. Andrew Lane was worried about that, but he says there was no pushback. “There was none at all; it was all in our head!” Denise Lane puts a myth to bed that the blue-and-gold colours were a nod to their Otago heritage. Not at all, she says – they represent night and day. Matt Lane says there is no one “silver bullet” to compete against the supermarkets. “We need the foundations to be able to compete, whether it’s ourselves, whether it’s The Warehouse, whether it’s a new player coming in. More competition in this space helps us, even if we’re not the leader in it. “Do we want to grow? Yes, absolutely. The only way I can see it happening, though, is through the existing set-ups. “It’s very hard for any player to sit there and go, I’m going to open opposite a Pak’nSave and compete. It’s just not going to happen. There’s not the brand presence. There’s not the pockets to be able to do so. “We’ve grown organically over time. We’ve utilised the conversion of some Four Square stores to be able to do that. “To start creating competition, I think one of the most important things is removing the restraints of trade on the duopoly stores. If someone is currently operating a Four Square and they want to convert or go independent, there should be no barriers for them to do so.” Lane points out there’s not a lack of brands in New Zealand, it’s a commonality of ownership. “If you had Pak’nSave, Fresh Choice, New World, Woolworths and Four Square all competing against each other, it would actually be quite a competitive marketplace and they’d all try and take each other’s market share. “Whereas what we’ve got is quite a complacent duopoly where everyone just plays in their own space ... ” Lane also points out that for every day that the status quo remains, the duopoly grows stronger. “They’re opening new stores, they’re creating a better footprint, they’re cementing brand awareness. “Competitors are getting more and more nervous. It’s one thing to come out and go, we’re going to fix the supermarket industry – that happened in 2021. We’re now in 2025. “My discussion to MBIE [the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment] was there’s been nothing given to me that has improved my business and my ability to compete that wasn’t available to me in 2021. So we’re four years deep and I don’t have one tangible thing I can point to say, ‘This is helping me grow and succeed’. “But then you go, ‘Who is going to take the risk and why would they take the risk in the New Zealand market?’ Bit different in the States or Australia, given the population size and density. “But there needs to be a genuine motivation or genuine support to actually be able to encourage people to do that.” After first interviewing Lane in early August, I went back to him this week for an update. “No public announcement has benefited us to increasing competition, however what is encouraging is the key components that will improve competition are still being worked though and considered. “It is a wait-and-see, but there is still a lot of resource being allocated to increasing competition and I’m hopeful something will eventuate.” For all their success, Andrew and Denise Lane remain remarkably grounded – they are thrilled to see new generations of families in their franchise stores coming through the business. “I don’t know if I see it as a major success story,” Andrew Lane says. “I probably see it more as something that we just wanted to achieve and just kept on achieving it to grow.” He says when the business entered its franchising structure in 1990, it was with the intention of mentoring and “helping other people enjoy a business that we both thoroughly enjoyed, and to grow like that”. Denise Lane adds: “It was a case of long, hard hours. I guess we never thought it was going to get to where we are now. “It was like a Ferris wheel – when you got on the ride, you couldn’t get off it until it stopped. It has not stopped yet.” Disclaimer: Night ’n Day recently sponsored the NZ Herald’s Great NZ Road Trip project. This article is an independent editorial story.

Title: The Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones are a good choice if you want to buy a pair of earbuds almost exclusively for FPS games

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones are a specialist product that excels in its particular niche. With clear, directional sound, they’re perfect for competitive shooters like Counter-Strike 2 and might even give you a slight advantage over your competition, but the very flat bass and lack of in-built microphone make them a poor fit for more general gaming in other genres. Comfortable with a wide range of fit options Clear, high fidelity spatial sound Fantastic included case Perfect for FPS games Lacks microphone Flat overall tuning Why you can trust TechRadar We spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you're buying the best. Find out more about how we test. Sony makes it very clear who the Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones are for. Developed in partnership with eSports team Fnatic, these wired in-ear monitor (IEM) style earbuds are squarely aimed at competitive first-person shooter (FPS) players or those with a generous budget aspiring to become one. Retailing for $149.99 / £129 / AU$209, they’re competing closely with some of the best gaming earbuds like the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds, but don’t deliver the same all-round performance. If you’re looking for something that will elevate your experience in some of the best story games like God of War Ragnarok or Cyberpunk 2077, then these are certainly not it. The Sony Inzone E9 headphones are highly comfortable to wear and come with a superb carrying case, but the unapologetically flat sound is not going to help cutscenes or action sequences sound their best. The GameBuds, or even Sony’s own but more expensive Inzone Buds, are clearly better choices, but it's hard to fault the Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones for that, as that’s obviously not what they’re for. They really come into their own in a competitive first-person shooter (FPS) setting, pairing well with games like Counter-Strike 2, Valorant, and Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. Here, the lack of bass prevents explosion and gunfire sound effects from overwhelming your senses, allowing you to focus on the impressive directional reproduction instead. The direction of key audio cues like footsteps is crystal clear and remarkably easy to discern, potentially giving you an advantage over those without such specialised audio gear. The noise isolation is exquisite, thanks in no small part to the excellent seal of the headphones in your ears. A plethora of ear tips is included in the box to make it easy to find the perfect fit, and the included USB-C audio box stores EQ profile settings to make for a hassle-free setup every time - ideal if you’re competing in tournaments and need to access the same settings on a new machine. The Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones are priced at $149.99 / £129 / AU$209. This is a significant investment for a pair of wired gaming earbuds, with top wireless options like the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds costing not much more at $159.99 / £159.99 / AU$359. In addition to traditional gaming options, the Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones are also competing with the pricey in-ear monitor (IEM) earbuds favored by some FPS players. Here they come in at a very similar price to relatively affordable models from other big brands, such as the $149.99 / £129.99 Sennheiser IE 200. The Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones are made specifically for gaming, however, setting them apart from most of the market and helping to justify the price. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. The Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones are available directly via Sony in the US and UK. They can also be found at a wide range of retailers, such as Best Buy in the US or Amazon in the UK. In Australia they’re in stock at both JB Hi-Fi and Harvey Norman. Price $149.99 / £129 / AU$209 Weight 0.16oz / 4.7g Compatibility PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X and Series S, Xbox One, PC, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, mobile Connection type Wired (3.5mm / USB-C with audio box) Battery life N/A Features USB-C audio box, spatial audio Software Inzone Hub (PC) The Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones will have a familiar design if you’ve used a pair of IEM earbuds before. They’re lightweight, with rounded earbuds connected to a rigid section of cable that hooks around the top of your ears. Two colorways are available: black and white. Both are rather plain, but the abundance of Inzone logo branding printed on the earbuds does give them some character. Sony has definitely made some smart decisions when it comes to practicality, particularly with the length of the headphone’s cable. At 5.9ft / 1.8m, I found that it was more than long enough to comfortably reach my ears directly from my gaming PC’s 3.5mm headphone jack without the need for a cable extender. If you play on a console, you won’t have any issues hooking it up to your controller. I also appreciate the clear left / right marking that’s printed on each earbud, with the latter presented in a bright red that makes it easy to spot at a glance. A wealth of alternate ear tips come in the box, with a total of eight pairs to choose from. This includes standard silicone rubber ear tips and more foamy noise isolation earbud tips, both in four sizes (ranging from extra small to extra large). These are Sony’s widespread EP-EX10A and EP-NI1010 series tips - so replacements are easy to find if you need them later down the line. You get a USB-C audio box for use with PCs, too. This can be used to store settings from the compatible Inzone Hub software, like your desired equalizer pre-sets or custom profiles. It also lets you use a dedicated spatial sound mode, giving a good impression of sound in a 3D space, albeit at the cost of some overall fidelity. Between uses, you can store everything in the included carrying case that benefits from a surprisingly unique design. It’s divided into two compartments (one for the earbuds and the other for the audio box) joined together by a springy rubberized strip. The underside of the strip has little magnetic buttons, clipping down to keep everything in place. It might be a bit hard to imagine, but it works really well and is much more practical than the cheap pouches included with most earbuds these days. You also get a little Inzone-branded cable tidy, which is a neat bonus. The Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones have quite a flat sound profile out of the box, though this is presumably intentional. There’s not a lot of bass leading to quite an unexciting sound. Playing through some Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and Assassin’s Creed Shadows on PS5, key story moments felt a tad muted with the backing music missing the punch needed to really drive the emotion home. You can address this somewhat by tweaking the EQ settings in the compatible Inzone Hub software, but there’s only so much that you can do to increase the bass on hardware that’s not designed for it. For story-focused games, the results were never punchier than what you get out of the box with the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds and far less effective than even cheap wired over-ear sets like the Corsair HS50. This lack of bass makes a lot more sense when you jump into a competitive shooter like Counter-Strike 2. Flashbangs and grenades are no longer overwhelming and don’t threaten to deafen you if you’re playing at higher volumes. Gunfire is more subdued, helping you stay focused in firefights. The sound is crystal clear too, with an impressive level of directionality that makes it easy to track enemy movements using key sounds like footsteps. It’s very impressive, especially given how well the effect holds up in more frantic situations. Diving into an explosive match of Nuketown in Black Ops 7, I was able to accurately hear where nearby opponents were moving, even against the constant barrage of explosions conjured by grenades and killstreaks. The detail is excellent, which is borderline essential in tense extraction shooters such as Escape From Tarkov, where being able to discern the subtle snapping of a twig can often mean the difference between life and death. If you’re currently one of the many people devoting every waking moment to Arc Raiders, I could see the Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones being worth the asking price on this fact alone. Despite offering no active noise cancellation (ANC), the Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones do a commendable job of blocking out background noise by virtue of the strong seal of their fit. No, it’s not as effective as the ANC of the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds, but it is good enough to drown out household sounds and conversations with the volume set at a decent level. Although very uncommon in the IEM market, I’m also a little disappointed that the Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones don’t come with a small built-in microphone. It’s not a dealbreaker by any means, but it did mean that I had to reach for my Final VR2000 gaming earbuds when I wanted to chat with a friend while playing an Xbox Series X game. You’re a die-hard FPS fanIf you’re an FPS-head shopping for a pair of earbuds that you want to use exclusively to play the latest shooters, then the Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones could be a very worthwhile investment. You want every possible advantageThe directionality offered by the Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones is excellent and could mean the difference between a win and a loss in a competitive gaming setting. Pick up a pair if you want to ensure you have every possible advantage. You want a general use pairThe flat sound profile of the Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones means that they’re not ideal for general use. At this price, there are loads of strong alternatives if you want something designed for a wider selection of genres with a microphone to help you chat with friends.

Title: Larry Page, Jeff Bezos, and Sergey Brin are close to joining the $300 billion club as tech fortunes soar

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Alphabet cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin have seen their personal fortunes soar to over $250 billion each, putting all three men within striking distance of the $300 billion mark. For context, some of America's largest companies, including Costco, Netflix, Home Depot, Chevron, and Wells Fargo, have market capitalizations between $300 billion and $400 billion. Page and Brin were worth $281 billion and $261 billion, respectively, at Friday's close, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. They added $101 billion and $92 billion to each of their fortunes in 2025, making them the year's biggest wealth gainers after Elon Musk, and have gained another $12 billion and $11 billion each already this year. The key driver has been Alphabet shares soaring 65% last year, and rising a further 4.5% so far in 2026, as investors have grown more and more excited about the search-and-advertising titan's AI efforts.

Bezos' wealth has climbed more modestly, from $239 billion at the start of 2025 to $268 billion at Friday's close. That reflects a roughly 5% rise in Amazon's stock price last year, and another 6% rise this year, as investors wager the e-commerce giant's massive AI investments will start to pay off. Only Musk is richer than the trio; the Tesla and SpaceX CEO was worth $639 billion at Friday's close. He saw a $165 billion wealth jump last year, thanks to Tesla stock gaining 11% and SpaceX's valuation leaping from $350 billion to $800 billion. He's added an unmatched $19 billion to his name so far in 2026. Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison briefly surpassed Musk in wealth last September, when his fortune ballooned by a record $89 billion in a single day to $388 billion. Since then, investors have cooled on Oracle's AI prospects, pushing down Ellison's net worth to $251 billion at Friday's close. In total, there are 18 "centibillionaires," or individuals with at least a $100 billion net worth. As a group, they grew $708 billion richer last year, lifting their combined wealth to $3.6 trillion — a figure greater than Microsoft's market value. Within that elite group, there are seven people worth upward of $200 billion: Musk, Page, Bezos, Brin, Ellison, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Bernard Arnault, CEO of luxury giant LVMH. All of them except Arnault own huge stakes in some of the world's leading AI companies, which have soared in value as investors rush to buy their shares on news of buzzy partnerships, massive contracts, and sky-high growth forecasts. Advocates, including investors Ross Gerber and Kevin O'Leary, have told Business Insider that AI will supercharge productivity and boost corporate profits. But skeptics, like Michael Burry of "The Big Short" fame, have warned that tech giants are overinvesting in microchips, data centers, and other infrastructure in their scramble to win the AI race, creating a bubble that will burst disastrously down the line.

Title: Costco shoppers say these items basically make a membership pay for itself. We did the math.

Every time Dominick publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Costco is widely known for offering a wide selection of items at relatively low prices, but the club's $65 annual membership fee can deter some shoppers. Of course, the savings from occasional discounts on big-ticket items such as TVs, mattresses, and household appliances can easily exceed the cost of a year's membership, but those purchases are expensive and infrequent for most households. That leaves a lot of folks asking, as one curious customer on Reddit did, if Costco's discounts on the basics are enough to make a membership worth it. Doubters have good reason to be skeptical: retailers like Amazon, Walmart, and Target offer pretty competitive pricing on a lot of products, not to mention local grocery stores. And then there's pack sizes — a multi-year supply of aluminum foil might technically be a savings, but it probably isn't all that useful. Nor does it save money to get more of something perishable, like fresh fruit, only to throw a lot of it away. So, which product categories would actually make a Costco membership worth it? The question is increasingly important for US households who are focused on stretching their dollars, a consumer climate that has favored value-conscious retailers like Costco and Walmart. To find out, we rounded up several of the most popular responses from users in the Costco subreddit, along with a few additional ones based on our experience. We focused the list on more shelf-stable items that are typically consumed steadily throughout the year and visited a local warehouse to check prices. We then compared those prices to comparable offerings at traditional retailers, such as Walmart, Amazon, Target, and others. We also asked ChatGPT to estimate how much of each item a typical two-person household would likely use in a year and compared annual costs before discounts based on those quantities. With a few exceptions, we used prices from national brands that are widely available in many retailers for an apples-to-apples comparison. Price gaps can be even more competitive with store brand alternatives. While everything on the list was cheaper at Costco in-store, we calculated a payback score for each item to represent how much of the $65 membership fee is accounted for in relative savings after one year of shopping exclusively for that one item at Costco versus a conventional retailer. For example, a payback score of 100 means the savings and the fee are equal; a score of 200 means the savings were twice the fee, and a score of 50 means that half the fee was offset by that single product. Again, this analysis assumes no other purchases at Costco, which in our experience is extremely unlikely. Here's what we found, ranked from lowest to highest. A 38-pound bag of Blue Buffalo dog food sells for $65 at Costco, while the equivalent weight at a typical retailer would cost $111. At that rate, the membership fee would be offset in less than two purchases. Assuming 10 purchases a year, this item yields a payback score of 713, meaning the savings would cover the membership fee plus six times the cost of this item alone. Costco also sells highly rated dog food under its Kirkland Signature brand for $35 per 40-pound bag. A jumbo pack of Huggies diapers sells for $50 at Costco, while it would cost about $70 to get the same quantity (156 diapers) elsewhere. At that rate, savings on diapers alone would offset the membership fee in less than four purchases. Assuming one purchase a month yields a payback score of 373, meaning the savings would pay for the membership fee plus three times again for this item alone. Costco also sells diapers under its Kirkland Signature brand for a lower unit cost. Costco sells large containers of Similac for $55, which is about $13 less than it would cost to get the same product at a typical retailer. That means a membership fee would be offset after five purchases. Assuming one purchase a month yields a payback score of 240. Costco also sells generic baby formula at roughly half the unit cost of Similac, and Costco's offering is produced by the same leading supplier, Perrigo, that other major retailers use for their store brands. Costco sells 2-pound bags of Starbucks Pike Place roast coffee beans for $8.40 per pound, while typical retailers sell the same beans for about $12 per pound. At that rate, the savings would offset the membership fee after nine purchases, or 18 pounds of coffee. Assuming a household consumes 30 pounds of coffee a year yields a payback score of 166. Beyond Starbucks, Costco regularly features local coffee roasters and specially sourced beans from coffee-growing regions around the world at a lower cost than conventional retail. Costco has 2.5-pound blocks of Tillamook cheddar cheese for sale at $4 per pound, which is about $2.60 less per pound than typical retailers. Assuming a household uses about half a pound a week would amount to roughly 25 pounds a year. At these rates, a Costco membership would be almost equally offset by savings on cheese for a payback score of 102. Bacon is incredibly subjective. Still, the closest match found to this $4.33 per pound thick-cut bacon from Costco costs $8 per pound at a Midwestern grocery chain. At three pounds per package, that works out to a difference of $11, which would offset the membership fee after about six purchases. Assuming a household consumes 15 pounds of bacon a year would only account for five purchases for a payback score of 85. Costco sells chicken stock in packs of six quarts for $9 per pack — that's about a third of what it would cost to get the same amount of chicken stock in individual packs from a traditional retailer. Assuming three purchases a year (18 quarts total) gives a payback score of 83. Buying three pounds of Fage Total 2% Greek Yogurt at a conventional retailer would cost about $2.70 more than getting a tub from Costco. Assuming a household consumes about a pound of yogurt a week on average works out to 17 purchases a year, for a payback score of 71. One product Costco is known for is its comically large packs of paper products, like these 30-packs of Charmin toilet paper. Before discounts, the $33 pack works out to $1.10 per roll, which is 37 cents cheaper per roll than an equivalent pack bought elsewhere for $44. Assuming a household uses 10 rolls of toilet paper a month would mean four purchases a year, resulting in a payback score of 67. At $1.25 per pound, Costco's six-pack of Barilla pasta costs about $4 less than the same amount bought elsewhere. Assuming a weekly spaghetti night that uses one pound of pasta, this works out to nine purchases a year, resulting in a payback score of 54. Costco sometimes sells products in quantities that exceed a year's supply. Brita recommends changing its filters every two months, so this ten-pack would last well into next year. Still, Costco's pre-discount unit price of $4.50 is about $3 less than individual filters cost at conventional retailers. If purchased in equal quantities, the Costco pack would be about $30 less, for a payback score of 45. Cascade dishwasher pods cost about $7.30 less at Costco (before discounts) than an equivalent quantity bought at a typical retailer. If a household runs the dishwasher once a day, it would need to buy four packs in a year, which works out to a payback score of 45. Bear with us for this one. HVAC filters may seem boring, but manufacturers recommend replacing them at least every three months for optimal performance, and that can add up quickly. Costco's four-pack of 3M Filtrete air filters comes in at $28 less than the same product elsewhere. Most households will only need to buy one pack a year, though, so the payback score would be 43. It's also worth noting that there are less expensive types of HVAC filters on the market that Costco doesn't sell. The way Costco executives have described it, the company isn't looking to sell the cheapest available products; it wants to find the sweet spot that balances both high quality and low price. Opti-Free contact lens solution is about 25% less expensive by volume when purchased at Costco, compared with a traditional retailer. A household that uses about 12 ounces a month would need to buy four of these packs in the course of a year, with a payback score of 42. Shoppers can generally save money by switching from national brand medications to generics. A bottle of 365 tablets of cetirizine, better known as Zyrtec, costs $13.50 before discounts at Costco, while the same quantity from some other stores' brands can easily cost nearly $40. Still, 365 tablets are more than many households might need in a year, so a single purchase would make sense, resulting in a payback score of 40. Like medicines and meats, Costco also has low prices on cooking oils. This store-branded olive oil is about half the price per liter of a similar store-branded alternative at another retailer. Assuming a household uses three liters a year, yields a payback score of 25. This Arm & Hammer laundry detergent from Costco costs $14.89, or about $0.07 a load, versus $0.11 a load for the same product at other retailers. Assuming a household would go through two 200-ounce jugs in a year gives a payback score of 22. Like medications, generic vitamins from Costco can be extremely cost-effective — about 20% less than a similar product elsewhere. Two adults taking one daily multivitamin each would mean five purchases of these gummies in a year for a payback score of 18. Costco's $1.50 hot dog and soda combo gets a lot of attention. After all, it's not every day that an executive is explicitly warned to never raise the price. However, we crunched the numbers, and it turns out that roughly one Costco combo a month (14.4 a year, to be exact) would save you $65 compared to getting a similar meal from a chain like Portillo's or Nathan's. The bigger advantage is the jumbo pizzas for less than $10. By comparison, the largest pizza Domino's makes is 14 inches, which costs $15 and is actually about two-thirds the area of Costco's 18-inch. For the equivalent square inches of cheese or pepperoni pizza, Costco's offering is about $12 less, which means the annual fee would be offset with six pizzas. The math on the $5 rotisserie chickens is slightly less favorable to Costco, as many grocery stores offer a similar product. We'd love to hear about your best Costco picks.

After being laid off from his AI product manager role last September, one of Aman Goyal's first moves in a tough job market was to buy a book. With the 26-year-old's purchase of "Decode and Conquer," author Lewis Lin provided Goyal with access to a private Slack community with more than 20,000 professionals and job seekers. Over the next six weeks, Goyal conducted about 40 mock interviews through the community with fellow job seekers, some of them current product managers from major tech firms like Microsoft and Amazon. Goyal said the practice helped him prepare for interviews at T-Mobile, where he accepted an offer in November. "I think it's a good community for you to practice and also find some good network connections," said Goyal, who lives in Seattle. "The mock interviews helped with my confidence and just building that muscle of answering those questions spontaneously." Over the past year, I've spoken with more than a dozen people who have found ways to turn job searching into a group project. While networking is a time-tested job search strategy, these job seekers have taken it a step further: forming layoff support groups, joining exclusive networking circles, or turning to social media for feedback and encouragement.

They hoped the added support would help them break through in a market that has grown more challenging in recent years, with employers now hiring at one of the slowest rates since 2013.

Read more on the topic: When Sreeja Apparaju began looking for a job in the fall of 2022, she turned to her most trusted network — a close circle of four friends. After the University of California, Berkeley students realized they were applying to many of the same software engineering roles, they decided to join forces: trading job leads and recruiter contacts, swapping interview tips, and offering each other moral support along the way. Apparaju said the collaboration helped her land two interviews — and ultimately, a job offer. In one case, a friend told her about a role at Palantir they'd interviewed for and shared the recruiter's email. Within a week of reaching out, Apparaju received an online assessment that led to an interview with the company. In another instance, a friend's cousin provided a referral for a software engineering role at Snap — the company behind Snapchat — where Apparaju later received and accepted an offer. Her friends also found success, with one landing a role at Amazon and another joining Salesforce. "There can be a culture of keeping to yourself because you want to be ahead of people," said the 24-year-old, who lives in New York. "But in my experience, just sharing what you know and helping each other out was a lot easier and faster for all five of us." Looking for work alongside your closest friends is an experience that's arguably unique to a college senior. But outside that bubble, some job seekers are finding new ways to make their searches more collaborative. After 14 years at Microsoft, Deborah Henderson was laid off from her user researcher role last May. After learning the news, she messaged colleagues to see who else had been affected and added them to a group chat. Over the following weeks, more than a dozen people shared job leads, helped one another prepare for interviews, vented frustrations, and celebrated successes. "The fact that we could immediately build community was just incredibly helpful," she said. In August, Henderson accepted an offer for a user experience role at Meta — a position she learned about through her network and was referred for. In the absence of formal support networks, some job seekers have turned to social platforms for help. That includes career-focused sites like LinkedIn, where many have publicly announced layoffs or added "open to work" badges — as well as broader platforms like TikTok. Last May, Andrew Z. Chen was just weeks away from earning his computer science degree from the University of California, San Diego — and still didn't have a job lined up. So when Amazon invited him to interview for a software engineering role, he didn't want to waste the opportunity. His plan: hole up in his room to study — and document the process on TikTok to hold himself accountable. Chen said the videos — which racked up as many as 2.6 million views — drew a wide range of reactions. Some viewers were skeptical he could land the role given his limited prep time. But others, including people who'd interviewed at Amazon, offered encouragement and shared advice on the types of technical questions to expect. "The videos brought a lot of doubt from viewers, but thankfully also a lot of advice and encouragement," said Chen, who's in his 20s and lives in New York. Weeks later, he accepted the role at Amazon. Support from others navigating the job market has helped some job seekers stay motivated; however, many are still struggling to secure job offers. Last July, Sriram Ramkrishna was laid off from his developer relations role at Intel. He's struggled to find work, but said he's leaned on the support of former Intel colleagues who were laid off around the same time — and has helped some of them land interviews. "Many of us have been helping each other with our job searches — sharing opportunities and offering support," said Ramkrishna, who is in his 50s and lives in Portland, Oregon. "It feels like we're all looking out for each other." Beyond those connections, Ramkrishna said he's also leaned on private developer relations Slack channels and Discord servers he was invited to through conferences and past professional relationships. Some include job-specific channels where hiring managers post openings directly, he said. Apparaju said that while securing her role ultimately came down to how she performed in the interviews, the support of her friends helped her stay focused and confident throughout the process. "Having people who were cheering for you and also working hard with you was honestly so motivating," she said. "Every win for my friends felt like a personal win, and it was an inspiration to keep pushing to crack that one job offer." Apparaju knows she'll never be able to replicate her college experience of job hunting alongside close friends, but she believes her network can still be valuable. She recently mentioned some potential openings at her company to a friend — one example, she said, of how she can keep that spirit of support alive. "Given how tough this job market is, everybody and anybody is super happy to help," she said. Jump to

Title: Daily Tech News 11 January 2026

Daily Tech News 11 January 2026 Top Story Meta has signed long-term contracts with three suppliers for a total of 6GW of nuclear power for its datacenters. (Tech Crunch) Two of the partners are startups developing small modular reactors; the third, Vistra, is a major operator of traditional large non-modular reactors. Meanwhile researchers in China have managed to break the Greenwald limit on the number of alt accounts a single journalist can have agreeing with his posts before he screws up. (The Independent) Wait, I'm told in this context it's an empirical limit on sustained plasma densities in Tokamak-style fusion reactors. With this breakthrough, fusion power is now only nineteen years and twelve months away. Tech News It's a water heater! It's a Bitcoin miner! It's both! (Tom's Hardware) Given that the main cost of mining Bitcoin is the energy it takes - and disposing of the waste heat somehow - why not use it for, say, heating water? The Superheat H1 does exactly that. And if the price of Bitcoin collapses, it still heats your water. Can light move faster than the speed of light? (Science Daily) Some theories of loop quantum gravity predict small fluctuations of the speed of light in a vacuum. New experiments put an upper bound on how big those fluctuations could be, ruling out some of these theories. I call them theories rather than mere speculation because they actually made sufficiently robust predictions to be ruled out in the first place. A theory can be wrong, but it's not a theory if you can't test it. Can AI do your job? (MSN) If you're a computer programmer, or you otherwise work solely with words, possibly yes. If you do literally anything else, the best AI models currently succeed at 2.5% of human tasks. AMD will be launching socketed versions of the Ryzen 400 processor series later this year. (WCCFTech) Too late, really. Zen 6 will be out this year, and if you want integrated graphics it looks like Intel's Panther Lake is faster - though only if you are willing to go with a system with soldered memory. If you need conventional DIMM or SODIMM memory, you get models cut down from 12 GPU cores to just 4, which isn't beating anything. So maybe not too late, but underwhelming. And if you want dedicated graphics, you might need to buy soon. (Tom's Hardware) Nvidia GPUs are hardest hit so far, with reports of stock on all models running low in Germany and Japan. Since that was the first direct warning we had of the memory crunch (though in retrospect the signs were there months earlier) I bought myself a 9060 XT while they were in stock and on sale. Which as of time of writing, they still are. Asus and Gigabyte are putting 64MB of ROM on their new AM5 motherboards. (Tom's Hardware) Earlier AM4 motherboards often had as little as 16MB of ROM for the BIOS, which became a problem as AMD kept releasing new chips for the platform - Socket AM4 first appeared in 2016, even before Zen 1, and the most recent new processor for that socket, the 5500X3D, was launched in June last year. There were simply too many different models of compatible processors to fit all the necessary code into 16MB. With AM5 confirmed to support the upcoming Zen 6 chips later this year, and strongly hinted to support Zen 7 due in 2028, it will end up being an even longer-lived platform with more CPUs, so motherboard makers are fixing the problem before it arises. Amazon is using AI to sell your products on their store without you having to lift a finger. (Modern Retail) Also, without Amazon ever asking permission to do so. Also also, without Amazon bothering to sync the data properly from your online store so that they don't, for example, still list long-discontinued products for sale. Store owners are not happy. NBC News is intensifying a collapse of trust online. (NBC News) No, they didn't have a brief moment of self-awareness. They're blaming three years of AI for thirty years of their own failings. Musical Interlude In 2008, a young Suzuka Nakamoto was part of a short-lived trio called Karen Girl's - yes, with the misplaced apostrophe - and performed Over the Future, the opening theme for the anime series Zettai Karen Children. You may know her better as the lead singer for Babymetal. Thanks Mikeski for pointing me to the Babymetal cover of Over the Future. (I checked three different versions of the first clip.

Speaking of data centers and water... during a county zoning meeting this past summer, the county executives were attempting to slide a center into an area of farmland being rezoned. It was revealed that the center would consume millions of gallons of water a month. More than half the current residential consumption. And up to 50% of that water evaporated during the cooling process for the processors at the datacenter. The rest wasn't recycled due to contamination and would have to stored in evaporation ponds. Half of the local, residential water would be consumed by this thing. And there was no plan to increase the water capacity. I'll note that this was only part of the county. The entire county wouldn't end up dry.... just this one, little, undeveloped area nobody seemed to notice. Except for everyone who lived there.

I believe the US moved some military assets into the region about the same time we went after that "dark fleet" oil tanker in the N. Atlantic. So... earlier this week. We already struck ISIS in Syria for killing 2 National Guard (Iowa, I think) and their American interpreter, so assets are in the region. I just think the administration doesn't quite know what to do in Iran. It's not as simple as it would seem. Wheels within wheels....

It's the Soccer of Breakfast Chow. And then there's the Waffle! With a difficulty that's juuuuuust right. And a light crunchy outside and a chewy inside when made correctly. Yum-yum! Waffles!

Jensen Huang took the stage at the CES trade show in Las Vegas this week to make the clearest pitch yet for Nvidia Corp.’s autonomous driving technology. In doing so, the chief executive officer’s vision for vehicles that can drive themselves edged into the terrain of major customers like Tesla Inc. and its boss, Elon Musk. Huang’s remarks sparked a widely watched — if notably polite — indirect multiday exchange between two of the most influential figures in technology. It also sharpened a central question about autonomous driving: Who controls the technology that will first power consumer cars that drive themselves — and later, driverless cars known as robotaxis that are designed for ride-hailing? And whose autonomous vehicle system is the best? On Monday, Huang used his speech to America’s largest technology showcase to extol the virtues of Nvidia’s Alpamayo, an open-source AI model designed to speed development of Level 4 self-driving cars. Such cars — consumer-owned at first, and robotaxi-fleet-operated later — can drive themselves without human supervision or intervention, within a defined geographic area. Nvidia described Alpamayo as part of a broader toolkit it offers automakers on top of open models. That includes powerful chips in data centers to train self-driving software, chips inside vehicles that serve as the car’s “brain” while it’s on the road, and simulation software that can create vast amounts of driving data virtually — reducing the time and cost of collecting it in the real world. The pitch was aimed squarely at automakers. Nvidia wants to supply the intelligence layer for autonomy without building the car itself, but it still wants to own the technology that makes self-driving a reality. “The world’s first thinking, reasoning, autonomous vehicle AI,” Huang proudly announced, clad in a shiny leather jacket. That afternoon, Musk weighed in with a post on X after a user shared a transcript of Huang’s remarks. “Well that’s just exactly what Tesla is doing ????,” Musk wrote. The Tesla CEO added that while getting a system to work most of the time is relatively easy, solving rare and unpredictable edge cases is far harder. The world’s richest man has claimed for a long time that Tesla’s system will have the ability to reason — that is, to make humanlike decisions in specific traffic scenarios — after a future software update. Earlier this week, his chief AI lieutenant, Ashok Elluswamy, responded to a question on X, saying a further update will come in the current quarter. Huang learned of Musk’s response during an interview with Bloomberg Television at CES the next day. “I wouldn’t be surprised,” Huang interjected, of Musk’s claim to already be doing reasoning. “I think the Tesla stack is the most advanced AV stack in the world.” Tesla shares ended the week higher by 1.6%, closing Friday at $445.01. New Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu, who has a buy rating and $600 price target on the stock, had posted on X earlier in the week after Huang’s keynote that Nvidia’s strategy “validated” Tesla’s approach. What drew broader attention was the tone of the aftermath of Nvidia’s announcement. The exchange went viral — not because of confrontation, but because of restraint. The two rivals acknowledged each other’s technical credibility while advancing different paths. Tesla and Nvidia already have an important, if uneven, relationship. Tesla relies heavily on Nvidia’s graphics processing units, or GPUs – the chips that go into data centers to train its autonomous driving software — even as it builds its own in-house chips to run that software inside vehicles. Musk has said Tesla will have spent roughly $10 billion cumulatively on Nvidia hardware for training by the end of this year, and that figure would be higher had it not worked on their own AI chips. Musk’s AI startup, xAI, is also a major Nvidia customer, and Nvidia is an investor in xAI. Tesla and Nvidia are fundamentally different companies. Tesla makes cars and builds the full system end to end. Nvidia builds chips and software that others use. Their technologies are different too. Tesla has a vision-only approach, just relying on camera sensors. The company argues it’s the most economically viable approach at scale and avoids sensors confusing one another. The rest of the industry argues other sensors like lidar, radar and ultrasonics are better because they are safer and offer redundancy. But the dynamic underscores how unsettled the autonomous vehicle arms race remains. Tesla depends on Nvidia to build its software, even as Nvidia builds tools that could one day help Tesla’s rivals catch up. Their paths to consumers also increasingly overlap. Tesla sells a suite of features known as Full Self-Driving (Supervised), a driver-assistance system that requires the vehicle’s operator to remain at the wheel and watch the road. The system Tesla sells is capable of point-to-point driving with navigation, lane changes and can react to traffic, but drivers still need to keep their eyes on the road. Nvidia now also sells advanced driver-assistance and autonomy platforms to automakers. And those automakers, in turn, pitch the systems to the consumer in the cars they sell. Market analysts see robotaxis as the endgame, with Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo currently leading real-world commercial deployments and Tesla arguing it can win at scale. Before that, the proving ground is consumer-owned cars that can do more of the driving themselves under owner supervision, serving as a bridge toward wider robotaxi adoption. Tesla sees FSD as a stepping stone to a future robotaxi network it would control. Nvidia is pursuing a similar endgame, working with other technology companies, automakers and ride-hailing companies, including Uber Technologies Inc. Again, Nvidia would just provide the tech and sees it powering fleets of robotaxis as soon as 2027. Tesla is betting on winning autonomy as a specialist, while Nvidia is positioning itself as the arms dealer, selling tools to the entire industry. Huang said the upcoming Mercedes-Benz CLA will be the first car to use Nvidia’s stack, offering FSD-like capabilities. Deliveries are starting in the US in early 2026 and rolling out to Europe and Asia later in the year. Moving beyond that would require additional hardware, such as lidar, adding cost and underscoring how far today’s cars remain from full autonomy. Musk returned to the subject of Nvidia’s push into autonomous vehicles on Tuesday, arguing it posed little immediate threat to Tesla’s efforts. The technology, he said, was far from being ready to be rolled out safely on a large scale. “The actual time from when FSD sort of works to where it is much safer than a human is several years,” he wrote on X, adding that meaningful competition for Tesla could still be at least five or six years away. For all the ambition on display, Huang and Musk have both effectively indicated that fully autonomous driving at scale is still a distant prospect. And for both, the nearer proving ground comes first: cars that can drive themselves part of the way. Who wins that phase may help decide who dominates the next one.

UPDATED 16:58 EST / JANUARY 10 2026 BREAKING ANALYSIS by David Vellante and David Floyer At CES 2026, Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Jensen Huang once again reset the economics of artificial intelligence factories. In particular, despite recent industry narratives that Nvidia’s moat is eroding, our assessment is the company has further solidified its position as the hardware and software standard for the next generation of computing. In the same way Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp. dominated the Moore’s Law era, we believe Nvidia will be the mainspring of tech innovation for the foreseeable future. Importantly, the previous era saw a doubling of performance every two years. Today Nvidia is driving annual performance improvements of five times, throughput of 10 times, and driving token demand of 15 times via Jevons Paradox. The bottom line is that ecosystem players and customers must align with this new paradigm or risk a fate similar to that of Sisyphus, the beleaguered figure who perpetually pushed a rock up the mountain. In this Breaking Analysis, we build on our prior work from Episode 300 with an update to our thinking. We begin with an historical view, examining the fate of companies that challenged Intel during the personal computer era and the characteristics that allowed a small number of them to survive and ultimately succeed. From there, we turn to the announcements Huang (pictured) made at CES and explain why they materially change the economics of AI factories. In our view, these developments are critical to understanding the evolving demand dynamics around performance, throughput and utilization in large-scale AI infrastructure. We close by examining the implications across the ecosystem. What does this mean for competitors such as Intel, Broadcom Inc., Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and other silicon specialists? How should hyperscalers, leading AI research labs, original equipment manufacturers and enterprise customers think about AI strategy, capital allocation and spending priorities in light of these shifts? Let’s begin with a historical view, looking back at the companies that challenged Intel during the 1980s and 1990s. IBM was the dominant force early on, but it was far from the only player that attempted to compete at the silicon level. A long list of RISC vendors and alternative architectures emerged during that period – including Sun Microsystems Inc. – many of which are now footnotes in computing history. The slide above highlights this reality. The companies shown in green are the ones that managed to make it through the knothole. The rest did not. The central reason comes down to the fact that Intel delivered relentless consistency with predictable, sustained improvement in performance and price-performance, roughly doubling every two years. Intel never took its foot off the pedal. It executed Moore’s Law as an operational discipline as well as a technology roadmap. As a result, competitors simply could not keep pace. Even strong architectural ideas from industry leaders were overwhelmed by Intel’s scale, manufacturing advantage, volume economics and cadence. One point worth noting. Apple, while not always viewed as a direct silicon competitor during that era, ultimately won by controlling its system architecture and, later, by vertically integrating its silicon strategy. The broader takeaway is fundamental in our assumptions for the rest of this analysis. Specifically, in platform markets driven by learning curves, volume and compounding economics, dominance is not just about having a great product. Success requires sustained momentum over long periods of time, while competitors exhaust themselves trying to catch up. Let’s now double down on the companies that actually survived the Intel-dominated PC era. The list below is instructive in our view. AMD, Acorn (the original Arm), Apple Inc., Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Intel and Nvidia. Each followed a different path, but they share a common underlying characteristic which is volume. AMD’s survival traces directly back to IBM’s original PC strategy. IBM mandated a second-source supplier, forcing Intel to share its instruction sets. AMD became that second source, and no other company gained comparable access. That structural advantage persisted for decades and allowed AMD to remain viable long after other x86 challengers disappeared. ARM, TSMC and Apple fundamentally changed the prevailing belief – stated by AMD CEO Jerry Sanders— that “real men own fabs.” These companies proved that separating design from manufacturing could be a winning strategy. Apple brought massive system-level volume. TSMC rode that volume to drive down costs, ultimately achieving manufacturing economics that we estimate to be roughly 30% lower than Intel’s. Nvidia followed a similar fabless path, pairing architectural leadership with accelerating demand. Intel itself was the original volume powerhouse, benefiting from the virtuous cycle created by the Wintel combination. That volume allowed Intel to outlast RISC competitors and dominate the PC era. But in the current cycle, Intel has lost ground to Arm-based designs, Nvidia and TSMC – each of which now rides on steeper learning curves. The takeaway is that volume is volume is fundamental to dominance. Not just volume in a single narrow segment, but volume across adjacent and synergistic markets that feed the same learning curves. AMD’s volume was initially forced by IBM’s PC division mandating a second source to Intel. Apple’s volume is consumer-driven. TSMC’s volume is manufacturing-led. Nvidia’s volume is now accelerating faster than any of them in this era. In our view, Nvidia is positioned to be the dominant volume leader of the AI era by a wide margin. And as history shows, once volume leadership is established at scale, it becomes extraordinarily difficult for competitors to catch up without other factors affecting the outcome (e.g. self-inflicted wounds or things out of the leader’s control such as geopolitical shifts). Nvidia’s CES announcements were visionary and focused largely on the emerging robotics market. In this analysis, however, we focused in on the core of Nvidia’s systems business. In our view, what Nvidia announced in this regard exceeded even our optimistic expectations. As we’ve stressed often, Nvidia is remarkable, not only because of a single chip, but because of the scope of what it delivers. Specifically, Huang led this part of his keynote with a six-chip, full-system redesign built around what Huang consistently refers to as extreme co-design. The chart above shows the next generation innovations from Nvidia, including Vera Rubin, named in homage to the astronomer whose work on galactic rotation curves led to the discovery of dark matter. Vera is the CPU. Rubin is the GPU. But focusing only on those two components misses the broader story. Nvidia simultaneously advanced every major silicon element in the system including NVLink based on InfiniBand, ConnectX nics and Spectrum-X for Ethernet, BlueField DPUs and Spectrum-X Ethernet with co-packaged optics. A few years ago, the prevailing narrative suggested that Ethernet would undercut Nvidia’s proprietary networking position, the underpinning which was Infiniband (via the Covid-era Mellanox acquisition). Nvidia was undeterred and responded by building Spectrum-X. Today, Jensen Huang argues that Nvidia is the largest networking company in the world by revenue, and the claim appears credible. What’s striking is not the line extension itself, but the speed and completeness with which Nvidia executed it. The deeper point lies in how Nvidia defines co-design. While the company works closely with customers such as OpenAI Group PBC, Google LLC with Gemini and xAI Corp., the co-design begins internally – across Nvidia’s own portfolio. This generation represents a ground-up redesign of the entire machine. Every major chip has been enhanced in coordination, not in isolation. The performance metrics are astounding. The GPU delivers roughly a fivefold performance improvement. The CPUs see substantial gains as well. But equally important are the advances in networking – both within the rack and across racks. Each subsystem was redesigned together to maximize end-to-end throughput rather than optimize any single component in isolation. The result is multiplicative, not additive. While individual elements show performance gains on the order of five times, the system-level throughput improvement is closer to an order of magnitude. That is the payoff of extreme co-design – aligning compute, networking, memory and software to minimize single bottlenecks that limit the overall system. In our view, this marks a decisive shift in how AI infrastructure is built. For quite some time we’ve acknowledged that Nvidia is no longer shipping chips. It is delivering tightly integrated systems engineered to maximize throughput, utilization, and economic efficiency at the scale required for AI factories. That distinction is profound as competitors attempt to match not just component performance, but the learning-curve advantages that emerge when volume, architecture and system-level design reinforce each other. While Jensen has pointed out that Nvidia is a full systems player, the point is often lost on investors and market watchers. This announcement further underscores the importance of this design philosophy and further differentiates Nvidia from any competitor. A critical point that becomes more clear from Nvidia’s announcements is the chip is not the correct unit of measurement. The system is. More precisely, the rack – and ultimately the token output per rack – is what defines performance, economics, and value. Each rack integrates 72 GPUs along with CPUs and high-speed interconnects that bind the system together. Compute density is critical, but so is the ability to move data with minimal jitter and maximum consistency – within the rack, across racks, and across entire frames. Nvidia has dramatically increased memory capacity into the terabytes, enabling GPUs to operate in tight coordination without stalling. The result is coherent execution at massive scale. These systems are designed to scale up, scale out, and scale across. When deployed at full factory scale, they operate not in dozens or hundreds of GPUs, but in hundreds of thousands – eventually up to a million GPUs working together. As scale increases, so does throughput. And as throughput increases, the economic value of the tokens generated accelerates. This is where the numbers compound to create the flywheel effect. Roughly five times performance improvement at the component level combines with roughly ten times throughput at the system level. Together, they drive what we believe is an estimated 15-times increase in demand, as lower cost per token unlocks entirely new classes of workloads. This is Moore’s Law on triple steroids – and it explains why annual value creation rises so sharply. The Jevons Paradox applies here. As the efficiency of token generation improves, total consumption rises. As we’ve stressed, the value shifts away from static measures of chip performance, toward dynamic measures of system utilization and output economics. The faster tokens can be generated, the more economically viable it becomes to deploy AI at scale, and the more demand expands. Networking is central to this equation. Nvidia’s long-term investment in Mellanox – once dismissed by many as a bet on a dying technology – now looks prescient. InfiniBand continues to grow rapidly, even as Ethernet demand also accelerates. Far from being a bottleneck, networking has become a core enabler of system-level performance. The takeaway is that AI infrastructure economics are now defined at the rack and factory level, not at the chip level. Nvidia’s advantage lies in designing systems where compute, memory, networking and software operate as a single, tightly coordinated machine. That is where throughput is maximized, token economics are transformed, and the next phase of AI factory value is being created. Huang presented three critical metrics on a single slide to show training throughput, AI factory token throughput and token cost. Together, they tell a story about where AI infrastructure economics are headed. For clarity, we break this into two parts as shown below: training on the left, factory and inference throughput on the right. The training chart shows time-to-train measured in months for a next-generation, ultra-large model. The takeaway is eye opening. The Rubin platform reaches the same training throughput as Blackwell using roughly one quarter of the GPUs. As we pointed out earlier, this is not simply about faster chips. It reflects dramatic gains in efficiency at scale – reduced synchronization overhead, fewer memory stalls, lower fabric contention, and shorter training cycles overall. The implications are notable. Capital required per model run drops materially. Customers can run more experiments per year and iterate faster. Training velocity becomes a competitive advantage in itself, not just a cost consideration. In our view, this is one of the most under-appreciated dynamics in the current AI race. The factory throughput chart above on the right, tells an equally important story. As workloads shift from batch inference toward interactive, agent-driven use cases, throughput characteristics change dramatically. Tokens per query increase. Latency sensitivity rises. Under these conditions, Blackwell’s throughput collapses as shown. Meanwhile, Rubin sustains performance far more effectively and delivers approximately 10 times more tokens per month at the factory level. This is the future workload profile of AI factories – real-time, interactive, agentic and highly variable — not static batch inference. Rubin is designed for this moment. The value is not just in peak performance, but in sustained throughput under real-world conditions. Taken together, these charts explain why Nvidia’s advantage continues to widen. Training and inference are converging in economic importance. Faster training reduces capital intensity and accelerates innovation. Higher factory throughput lowers token costs while expanding demand. This combination resets expectations for performance, efficiency and scalability. In our view, many observers continue to underestimate both the pace at which Nvidia is moving and the magnitude of the gap it is creating. Comparisons to alternative accelerators – whether Google TPUs, AWS Trainium or others – miss the system-level reality being demonstrated by Nvidia. The new standard is not raw compute. It is training velocity, sustained factory throughput and token economics at scale. And on those dimensions, Nvidia is setting the bar. The final piece of the equation that we’ll dig into is cost. And this is where the implications become overwhelming. In our view, it’s what matters most. The combination of higher throughput and system-level efficiency drives cost per token down by roughly an order of magnitude. Huang framed it in his keynote saying these systems may consume more power, but they do vastly more work. When throughput rises by 10 times and cost per token falls to one-10th, the economic profile of AI factories fundamentally resets. What’s striking is the pace. This is not the 18- to 24-month cadence historically associated with Moore’s Law. These gains are occurring on a 12-month cycle. Moore’s Law transformed the computing industry for decades, lifting productivity across silicon, software, storage, infrastructure and applications. What we are seeing now is an even more aggressive curve – orders-of-magnitude improvement compressed into a single year. There are real pressures behind this progress. Demand for advanced chips, memory and interconnects is intense, pushing up component costs. Nvidia has secured premium access across that supply chain. But from the perspective of an AI factory operator, the math dominates everything else. If cost per token falls while throughput rises dramatically, the earning power of the factory increases materially. This is especially critical in a power-constrained world as we described last August when we explored the “New Jensen’s Law.” Hyperscalers and neoclouds alike are limited by available power, not just capital. Under those constraints, Jensen’s tongue-in-cheek “law” applies – buy more, make more; or buy more, save more. The ability to extract significantly more work from the same infrastructure — or achieve the same output with far less — translates directly into financial operating leverage. The example Jensen cited makes the point concrete. In a $50 billion, gigawatt-scale data center, improving utilization by 10% produces an enormous $5 billion benefit that flows straight to the income statement. That is why networking, in this context, becomes economically “free.” The incremental cost is dwarfed by the utilization gains it enables. This is ultimately why Nvidia’s position is so strong. The advantage is not just technical – it’s economic. Nvidia is operating on a steep learning curve, reinforced by volume, system-level co-design and accelerating efficiency gains. When cost per token collapses at this rate, demand expands, utilization rises and the economics compound. That dynamic is what defines leadership in this era. We’ll close by translating the CES announcements into competitive implications across multiple classes of players, including vendors that are simultaneously customers. The common theme is that the unit of competition has shifted from chips to systems, racks and ultimately token economics. That shift changes the survivability economics for incumbents, the opportunity for specialists, and the urgency of customer strategies. In our view, it’s effectively game over for Intel’s historical monopoly and leadership position. The more interesting question is whether Intel can remain a meaningful CPU provider in an AI factory world – and the Nvidia/Intel interoperability move is notable in that context. The historical context is relevant. Nvidia has wanted deeper access to x86 since the late 1990s but was never allowed. The new arrangement changes the structure and it enables a configuration where Intel CPUs and Nvidia GPUs can operate within the same frame. It’s not a fully unified architecture, but it is sufficient for most of the work, and it creates a practical path for Intel CPUs to remain present in these systems. It also gives Intel a meaningful level of access to CUDA-based environments – short of “full access,” but still consequential. The net effect should improve Intel connectivity in these deployments, keep Intel in the CPU game for this cycle, and increase the volume of Nvidia systems available to the market. In other words, it can act as a viable bridge from the old to the new, which is good for customers. We do want to flag a key risk to any optimistic Nvidia scenario – a Taiwan geopolitical disruption. If China takes over Taiwan, there are multiple potential outcomes – from continuity with a new lever for China, to a more disruptive scenario if that lever is pulled. Either would ripple through sentiment around Nvidia and could increase perceived strategic value for Intel. But the hard reality is Intel still has to close the manufacturing and execution gap with TSMC, and that is not something any company can leapfrog overnight. AMD has executed well against Intel in x86. But the competitive target has shifted. x86 is mature and its curve has flattened, which made the timing right for AMD’s ascdendency and for hyperscalers to pursue alternatives such as AWS’ Graviton. AMD is now taking on a very different animal – a leader moving on a steep learning curve with compounding system-level advantages. In our view, the core issue is speed. AMD will struggle to move fast enough to close a gap defined by 12-month cycles and system-level throughput economics. One practical implication is that AMD should pursue a deal structure similar to Intel’s – something that secures volume on one side – while focusing aggressively on the edge. Data center CPU revenue is meaningful for Intel and AMD, but expanding volume there will be difficult, and there is real risk of decline. The edge remains wide open, and that’s where focus should go in our opinion. At the same time, it’s important to recognize that Nvidia is also targeting the edge – autonomous vehicle libraries were highlighted and robotics were put on stage at CES and it’s a major focus of the company. The edge is open, but it won’t be uncontested. There is ample room for specialists that avoid direct, frontal competition with Nvidia. The AI factory buildout is forecast to be enormous – large enough that niche and adjacency strategies can still create meaningful businesses, particularly around factories and the edge. Two examples we cite: But the strategic point is that latency is a real lever in inference economics, and specialists that win on latency can matter – especially at the edge. Broadcom is best understood as a critical supplier to hyperscalers, OEM ecosystems, mobile players and virtually all forms of connectivity. Broadcom has a custom silicon engine that manages back-end execution with foundries and manufacturing partners. Its business is diversified and structurally important, and we do not view it as going away by any means. Broadcom has deep engineering talent and a diversified business with exceptional leadership. The more controversial question is whether hyperscalers should continue investing in alternative accelerators such as TPUs, Trainium and other ASIC strategies – as a long-term path to compete with Nvidia. Google has deep history and real technical credibility with TPUs. But the argument here is that this is now a different business environment. Google must protect search quality and accelerate Gemini. If internal platform choices limit developer access to CUDA and the best available hardware/software improvements, the risk is that Gemini’s development velocity slows. If model iteration takes multiples longer, that becomes strategically dangerous. Our view is that TPUs have reached a ceiling in this context – not because they can’t improve, but because they cannot match Nvidia’s volume-driven learning curve and system-level economics, particularly with networking as scale. A related point, made by Gavin Baker using a simplified economics example is if Google’s TPU program represents a $30 billion business, and it sends a large portion of value to Broadcom (about $15 billion), one might argue for vertical integration. The counterargument here is that even if it’s financially possible, it may be strategically irrational if it slows Gemini’s iteration speed. The core thesis is that Google should prioritize model velocity over accelerator self-sufficiency. The same logic extends to Trainium. AWS’ Graviton playbook worked because it targeted a mature, flattening x86 curve. That is not the environment in accelerators today. The pace is too fast, the curves are too steep, and the system complexity is too high. Will AWS, Google and even Microsoft continue to fund alternatives to Nvidia? Probably as use cases will emerge for more cost effective platforms. But the real strategic advantage for hyperscalers in our view lies elsewhere, especially as they face increasing competition from neoclouds. We position four frontier labs as the primary contenders: OpenAI, Anthropic PBC, Google and xAI Corp.’s Grok, with Meta Platforms Inc.treated as a second tier (with the caveat that it’s unwise to count Zuckerberg out). Despite persistent negative narratives around OpenAI — especially around financing structure and commitments — our view is that pessimism may be misplaced. The reasoning is as follows: In short, we see the winners as OpenAI the most likely overall winner in the center, with Anthropic as the second player, and Grok highly likely to do well at the edge. Elon could also compete strongly at the edge while he backed away from the idea of building his own data center chips. An additional allocation nuance is labs aligned with Nvidia (OpenAI and X.ai) may have a better path to “latest and greatest” allocations than those pursuing tighter coupling with alternative accelerator strategies. For OEMs like Dell, HPE, Lenovo, and Supermicro, the opportunity is primarily executional. In other words, get the latest platforms, package them, deliver them, and keep them running reliably without thermal or integration failures. Demand is enormous, supply is constrained, and this is not a zero-sum game. For now they can all do well. The key point is that as long as the market remains supply-constrained, anything credible that can be produced will be consumed. That reality can justify multiple silicon suppliers from the ecosystem – even if the long-run competitive curve still favors Nvidia. On the customer side, we challenge a widely repeated narrative to “get your data house in order before you spend on AI.” The view here is that this sequencing can be backwards. Our modeling suggests that over a multi-year period (for example, five years), getting onto the AI learning curve earlier can generate substantially more value than delaying until data is “clean.” Even if data isn’t pristine, organizations can choose a dataset, apply AI to improve it, and compound learning rather than waiting. Two additional implications are highlighted below: Our strategy recommendation is to optimize for speed and learning. Put token capacity close to data (latency matters), use tokens to improve access and data quality, then iterate through AI projects quickly – one project, learn, then the next, building a flywheel. The emphasis should be on starting from value and using intelligence to improve the systems, rather than spending years trying to perfect data first. In our view, the defining lesson of this analysis is that AI is no longer a contest of individual chips, models, or even vendors – it is a contest of learning curves, systems and economics. History shows that in platform transitions, leadership accrues to those who achieve volume, sustain execution and convert efficiency gains into expanding demand. That dynamic shaped the PC era, and it is repeating at far greater speed in the AI factory era. What differentiates this cycle is the compression of time. Improvements that once unfolded over decades are now occurring in 12-month intervals, resetting cost structures and forcing strategic decisions faster than most organizations are accustomed to making them. The implications go across silicon providers, hyperscalers, AI labs, OEMs and enterprises alike. For customers, the message is value will accrue to those who get onto the AI learning curve early, focus on throughput and token economics, and build momentum through rapid iteration rather than waiting for perfect conditions. For vendors, survival will depend less on clever alternatives and more on whether they can stay on the steepest curves without slowing themselves down. This transition will not be linear, and it will not be evenly distributed. But the direction is clear in our view.

UPDATED 16:58 EST / JANUARY 10 2026 BREAKING ANALYSIS by David Vellante and David Floyer At CES 2026, Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Jensen Huang once again reset the economics of artificial intelligence factories. In particular, despite recent industry narratives that Nvidia’s moat is eroding, our assessment is the company has further solidified its position as the hardware and software standard for the next generation of computing. In the same way Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp. dominated the Moore’s Law era, we believe Nvidia will be the mainspring of tech innovation for the foreseeable future. Importantly, the previous era saw a doubling of performance every two years. Today Nvidia is driving annual performance improvements of five times, throughput of 10 times, and driving token demand of 15 times via Jevons Paradox. The bottom line is that ecosystem players and customers must align with this new paradigm or risk a fate similar to that of Sisyphus, the beleaguered figure who perpetually pushed a rock up the mountain. In this Breaking Analysis, we build on our prior work from Episode 300 with an update to our thinking. We begin with an historical view, examining the fate of companies that challenged Intel during the personal computer era and the characteristics that allowed a small number of them to survive and ultimately succeed. From there, we turn to the announcements Huang (pictured) made at CES and explain why they materially change the economics of AI factories. In our view, these developments are critical to understanding the evolving demand dynamics around performance, throughput and utilization in large-scale AI infrastructure. We close by examining the implications across the ecosystem. What does this mean for competitors such as Intel, Broadcom Inc., Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and other silicon specialists? How should hyperscalers, leading AI research labs, original equipment manufacturers and enterprise customers think about AI strategy, capital allocation and spending priorities in light of these shifts? Let’s begin with a historical view, looking back at the companies that challenged Intel during the 1980s and 1990s. IBM was the dominant force early on, but it was far from the only player that attempted to compete at the silicon level. A long list of RISC vendors and alternative architectures emerged during that period – including Sun Microsystems Inc. – many of which are now footnotes in computing history. The slide above highlights this reality. The companies shown in green are the ones that managed to make it through the knothole. The rest did not. The central reason comes down to the fact that Intel delivered relentless consistency with predictable, sustained improvement in performance and price-performance, roughly doubling every two years. Intel never took its foot off the pedal. It executed Moore’s Law as an operational discipline as well as a technology roadmap. As a result, competitors simply could not keep pace. Even strong architectural ideas from industry leaders were overwhelmed by Intel’s scale, manufacturing advantage, volume economics and cadence. One point worth noting. Apple, while not always viewed as a direct silicon competitor during that era, ultimately won by controlling its system architecture and, later, by vertically integrating its silicon strategy. The broader takeaway is fundamental in our assumptions for the rest of this analysis. Specifically, in platform markets driven by learning curves, volume and compounding economics, dominance is not just about having a great product. Success requires sustained momentum over long periods of time, while competitors exhaust themselves trying to catch up. Let’s now double down on the companies that actually survived the Intel-dominated PC era. The list below is instructive in our view. AMD, Acorn (the original Arm), Apple Inc., Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Intel and Nvidia. Each followed a different path, but they share a common underlying characteristic which is volume. AMD’s survival traces directly back to IBM’s original PC strategy. IBM mandated a second-source supplier, forcing Intel to share its instruction sets. AMD became that second source, and no other company gained comparable access. That structural advantage persisted for decades and allowed AMD to remain viable long after other x86 challengers disappeared. ARM, TSMC and Apple fundamentally changed the prevailing belief – stated by AMD CEO Jerry Sanders— that “real men own fabs.” These companies proved that separating design from manufacturing could be a winning strategy. Apple brought massive system-level volume. TSMC rode that volume to drive down costs, ultimately achieving manufacturing economics that we estimate to be roughly 30% lower than Intel’s. Nvidia followed a similar fabless path, pairing architectural leadership with accelerating demand. Intel itself was the original volume powerhouse, benefiting from the virtuous cycle created by the Wintel combination. That volume allowed Intel to outlast RISC competitors and dominate the PC era. But in the current cycle, Intel has lost ground to Arm-based designs, Nvidia and TSMC – each of which now rides on steeper learning curves. The takeaway is that volume is volume is fundamental to dominance. Not just volume in a single narrow segment, but volume across adjacent and synergistic markets that feed the same learning curves. AMD’s volume was initially forced by IBM’s PC division mandating a second source to Intel. Apple’s volume is consumer-driven. TSMC’s volume is manufacturing-led. Nvidia’s volume is now accelerating faster than any of them in this era. In our view, Nvidia is positioned to be the dominant volume leader of the AI era by a wide margin. And as history shows, once volume leadership is established at scale, it becomes extraordinarily difficult for competitors to catch up without other factors affecting the outcome (e.g. self-inflicted wounds or things out of the leader’s control such as geopolitical shifts). Nvidia’s CES announcements were visionary and focused largely on the emerging robotics market. In this analysis, however, we focused in on the core of Nvidia’s systems business. In our view, what Nvidia announced in this regard exceeded even our optimistic expectations. As we’ve stressed often, Nvidia is remarkable, not only because of a single chip, but because of the scope of what it delivers. Specifically, Huang led this part of his keynote with a six-chip, full-system redesign built around what Huang consistently refers to as extreme co-design. The chart above shows the next generation innovations from Nvidia, including Vera Rubin, named in homage to the astronomer whose work on galactic rotation curves led to the discovery of dark matter. Vera is the CPU. Rubin is the GPU. But focusing only on those two components misses the broader story. Nvidia simultaneously advanced every major silicon element in the system including NVLink based on InfiniBand, ConnectX nics and Spectrum-X for Ethernet, BlueField DPUs and Spectrum-X Ethernet with co-packaged optics. A few years ago, the prevailing narrative suggested that Ethernet would undercut Nvidia’s proprietary networking position, the underpinning which was Infiniband (via the Covid-era Mellanox acquisition). Nvidia was undeterred and responded by building Spectrum-X. Today, Jensen Huang argues that Nvidia is the largest networking company in the world by revenue, and the claim appears credible. What’s striking is not the line extension itself, but the speed and completeness with which Nvidia executed it. The deeper point lies in how Nvidia defines co-design. While the company works closely with customers such as OpenAI Group PBC, Google LLC with Gemini and xAI Corp., the co-design begins internally – across Nvidia’s own portfolio. This generation represents a ground-up redesign of the entire machine. Every major chip has been enhanced in coordination, not in isolation. The performance metrics are astounding. The GPU delivers roughly a fivefold performance improvement. The CPUs see substantial gains as well. But equally important are the advances in networking – both within the rack and across racks. Each subsystem was redesigned together to maximize end-to-end throughput rather than optimize any single component in isolation. The result is multiplicative, not additive. While individual elements show performance gains on the order of five times, the system-level throughput improvement is closer to an order of magnitude. That is the payoff of extreme co-design – aligning compute, networking, memory and software to minimize single bottlenecks that limit the overall system. In our view, this marks a decisive shift in how AI infrastructure is built. For quite some time we’ve acknowledged that Nvidia is no longer shipping chips. It is delivering tightly integrated systems engineered to maximize throughput, utilization, and economic efficiency at the scale required for AI factories. That distinction is profound as competitors attempt to match not just component performance, but the learning-curve advantages that emerge when volume, architecture and system-level design reinforce each other. While Jensen has pointed out that Nvidia is a full systems player, the point is often lost on investors and market watchers. This announcement further underscores the importance of this design philosophy and further differentiates Nvidia from any competitor. A critical point that becomes more clear from Nvidia’s announcements is the chip is not the correct unit of measurement. The system is. More precisely, the rack – and ultimately the token output per rack – is what defines performance, economics, and value. Each rack integrates 72 GPUs along with CPUs and high-speed interconnects that bind the system together. Compute density is critical, but so is the ability to move data with minimal jitter and maximum consistency – within the rack, across racks, and across entire frames. Nvidia has dramatically increased memory capacity into the terabytes, enabling GPUs to operate in tight coordination without stalling. The result is coherent execution at massive scale. These systems are designed to scale up, scale out, and scale across. When deployed at full factory scale, they operate not in dozens or hundreds of GPUs, but in hundreds of thousands – eventually up to a million GPUs working together. As scale increases, so does throughput. And as throughput increases, the economic value of the tokens generated accelerates. This is where the numbers compound to create the flywheel effect. Roughly five times performance improvement at the component level combines with roughly ten times throughput at the system level. Together, they drive what we believe is an estimated 15-times increase in demand, as lower cost per token unlocks entirely new classes of workloads. This is Moore’s Law on triple steroids – and it explains why annual value creation rises so sharply. The Jevons Paradox applies here. As the efficiency of token generation improves, total consumption rises. As we’ve stressed, the value shifts away from static measures of chip performance, toward dynamic measures of system utilization and output economics. The faster tokens can be generated, the more economically viable it becomes to deploy AI at scale, and the more demand expands. Networking is central to this equation. Nvidia’s long-term investment in Mellanox – once dismissed by many as a bet on a dying technology – now looks prescient. InfiniBand continues to grow rapidly, even as Ethernet demand also accelerates. Far from being a bottleneck, networking has become a core enabler of system-level performance. The takeaway is that AI infrastructure economics are now defined at the rack and factory level, not at the chip level. Nvidia’s advantage lies in designing systems where compute, memory, networking and software operate as a single, tightly coordinated machine. That is where throughput is maximized, token economics are transformed, and the next phase of AI factory value is being created. Huang presented three critical metrics on a single slide to show training throughput, AI factory token throughput and token cost. Together, they tell a story about where AI infrastructure economics are headed. For clarity, we break this into two parts as shown below: training on the left, factory and inference throughput on the right. The training chart shows time-to-train measured in months for a next-generation, ultra-large model. The takeaway is eye opening. The Rubin platform reaches the same training throughput as Blackwell using roughly one quarter of the GPUs. As we pointed out earlier, this is not simply about faster chips. It reflects dramatic gains in efficiency at scale – reduced synchronization overhead, fewer memory stalls, lower fabric contention, and shorter training cycles overall. The implications are notable. Capital required per model run drops materially. Customers can run more experiments per year and iterate faster. Training velocity becomes a competitive advantage in itself, not just a cost consideration. In our view, this is one of the most under-appreciated dynamics in the current AI race. The factory throughput chart above on the right, tells an equally important story. As workloads shift from batch inference toward interactive, agent-driven use cases, throughput characteristics change dramatically. Tokens per query increase. Latency sensitivity rises. Under these conditions, Blackwell’s throughput collapses as shown. Meanwhile, Rubin sustains performance far more effectively and delivers approximately 10 times more tokens per month at the factory level. This is the future workload profile of AI factories – real-time, interactive, agentic and highly variable — not static batch inference. Rubin is designed for this moment. The value is not just in peak performance, but in sustained throughput under real-world conditions. Taken together, these charts explain why Nvidia’s advantage continues to widen. Training and inference are converging in economic importance. Faster training reduces capital intensity and accelerates innovation. Higher factory throughput lowers token costs while expanding demand. This combination resets expectations for performance, efficiency and scalability. In our view, many observers continue to underestimate both the pace at which Nvidia is moving and the magnitude of the gap it is creating. Comparisons to alternative accelerators – whether Google TPUs, AWS Trainium or others – miss the system-level reality being demonstrated by Nvidia. The new standard is not raw compute. It is training velocity, sustained factory throughput and token economics at scale. And on those dimensions, Nvidia is setting the bar. The final piece of the equation that we’ll dig into is cost. And this is where the implications become overwhelming. In our view, it’s what matters most. The combination of higher throughput and system-level efficiency drives cost per token down by roughly an order of magnitude. Huang framed it in his keynote saying these systems may consume more power, but they do vastly more work. When throughput rises by 10 times and cost per token falls to one-10th, the economic profile of AI factories fundamentally resets. What’s striking is the pace. This is not the 18- to 24-month cadence historically associated with Moore’s Law. These gains are occurring on a 12-month cycle. Moore’s Law transformed the computing industry for decades, lifting productivity across silicon, software, storage, infrastructure and applications. What we are seeing now is an even more aggressive curve – orders-of-magnitude improvement compressed into a single year. There are real pressures behind this progress. Demand for advanced chips, memory and interconnects is intense, pushing up component costs. Nvidia has secured premium access across that supply chain. But from the perspective of an AI factory operator, the math dominates everything else. If cost per token falls while throughput rises dramatically, the earning power of the factory increases materially. This is especially critical in a power-constrained world as we described last August when we explored the “New Jensen’s Law.” Hyperscalers and neoclouds alike are limited by available power, not just capital. Under those constraints, Jensen’s tongue-in-cheek “law” applies – buy more, make more; or buy more, save more. The ability to extract significantly more work from the same infrastructure — or achieve the same output with far less — translates directly into financial operating leverage. The example Jensen cited makes the point concrete. In a $50 billion, gigawatt-scale data center, improving utilization by 10% produces an enormous $5 billion benefit that flows straight to the income statement. That is why networking, in this context, becomes economically “free.” The incremental cost is dwarfed by the utilization gains it enables. This is ultimately why Nvidia’s position is so strong. The advantage is not just technical – it’s economic. Nvidia is operating on a steep learning curve, reinforced by volume, system-level co-design and accelerating efficiency gains. When cost per token collapses at this rate, demand expands, utilization rises and the economics compound. That dynamic is what defines leadership in this era. We’ll close by translating the CES announcements into competitive implications across multiple classes of players, including vendors that are simultaneously customers. The common theme is that the unit of competition has shifted from chips to systems, racks and ultimately token economics. That shift changes the survivability economics for incumbents, the opportunity for specialists, and the urgency of customer strategies. In our view, it’s effectively game over for Intel’s historical monopoly and leadership position. The more interesting question is whether Intel can remain a meaningful CPU provider in an AI factory world – and the Nvidia/Intel interoperability move is notable in that context. The historical context is relevant. Nvidia has wanted deeper access to x86 since the late 1990s but was never allowed. The new arrangement changes the structure and it enables a configuration where Intel CPUs and Nvidia GPUs can operate within the same frame. It’s not a fully unified architecture, but it is sufficient for most of the work, and it creates a practical path for Intel CPUs to remain present in these systems. It also gives Intel a meaningful level of access to CUDA-based environments – short of “full access,” but still consequential. The net effect should improve Intel connectivity in these deployments, keep Intel in the CPU game for this cycle, and increase the volume of Nvidia systems available to the market. In other words, it can act as a viable bridge from the old to the new, which is good for customers. We do want to flag a key risk to any optimistic Nvidia scenario – a Taiwan geopolitical disruption. If China takes over Taiwan, there are multiple potential outcomes – from continuity with a new lever for China, to a more disruptive scenario if that lever is pulled. Either would ripple through sentiment around Nvidia and could increase perceived strategic value for Intel. But the hard reality is Intel still has to close the manufacturing and execution gap with TSMC, and that is not something any company can leapfrog overnight. AMD has executed well against Intel in x86. But the competitive target has shifted. x86 is mature and its curve has flattened, which made the timing right for AMD’s ascdendency and for hyperscalers to pursue alternatives such as AWS’ Graviton. AMD is now taking on a very different animal – a leader moving on a steep learning curve with compounding system-level advantages. In our view, the core issue is speed. AMD will struggle to move fast enough to close a gap defined by 12-month cycles and system-level throughput economics. One practical implication is that AMD should pursue a deal structure similar to Intel’s – something that secures volume on one side – while focusing aggressively on the edge. Data center CPU revenue is meaningful for Intel and AMD, but expanding volume there will be difficult, and there is real risk of decline. The edge remains wide open, and that’s where focus should go in our opinion. At the same time, it’s important to recognize that Nvidia is also targeting the edge – autonomous vehicle libraries were highlighted and robotics were put on stage at CES and it’s a major focus of the company. The edge is open, but it won’t be uncontested. There is ample room for specialists that avoid direct, frontal competition with Nvidia. The AI factory buildout is forecast to be enormous – large enough that niche and adjacency strategies can still create meaningful businesses, particularly around factories and the edge. Two examples we cite: But the strategic point is that latency is a real lever in inference economics, and specialists that win on latency can matter – especially at the edge. Broadcom is best understood as a critical supplier to hyperscalers, OEM ecosystems, mobile players and virtually all forms of connectivity. Broadcom has a custom silicon engine that manages back-end execution with foundries and manufacturing partners. Its business is diversified and structurally important, and we do not view it as going away by any means. Broadcom has deep engineering talent and a diversified business with exceptional leadership.

Kansas City police Officer Matt Masters first used a Taser in the early 2000s. He said it worked well for taking people down; it was safe and effective. “At the end of the day, if you have to put your hands on somebody, you got to scuffle with somebody, why risk that?” he said. “You can just shoot them with a Taser.” Masters believed in that until his son Bryce was pulled over by an officer and shocked for more than 20 seconds. The 17-year-old went into cardiac arrest, which doctors later attributed to the Taser. Masters’ training had led him to believe something like that could never happen. This week on Reveal, we partner with Lava for Good’s podcast Absolute: Taser Incorporated and its host, Nick Berardini, to learn what the company that makes the Taser knew about the dangers of its weapon and didn’t say.

Title: Investor Michael Burry reveals options bet against Oracle
URL: https://fortune.com/2026/01/10/big-short-investor-michael-burry-put-options-bet-oracle-stock-orcl/
Time Published: 2026-01-10T15:41:53Z

Michael Burry, the famed investor who has drawn attention in recent months for criticism of the artificial intelligence boom, is betting against Oracle Corp. Burry owns put options on Oracle shares, he said in a Substack post after markets closed on Friday. Puts typically increase in value as the price of the underlying asset falls. Burry, who revealed bearish bets against AI chipmaker Nvidia Corp. and Palantir Technologies Inc. in November, also directly shorted Oracle during the last six months, he said. Oracle is known for its database software but has recently pushed aggressively into cloud-computing services, requiring a costly build out of data center capacity, for which it is taking on significant debt. “I do not like how it is positioned or the investments it is making. It did not need to do what it is doing, and I do not know why it is doing this. Maybe ego,” Burry wrote in response to a reader who asked why he had decided to bet against Nvidia and not Oracle. He didn’t disclose details about the put options. The view follows a volatile year for Oracle shares. The stock jumped 36% in a single session in September after the company issued a bullish forecast for its cloud business, signaling surging demand tied to artificial intelligence. Those gains quickly faded, however, as investors focused on rising capital expenditures, questions around the structure of some cloud deals and a swelling debt load linked to data-center expansion. Oracle finished the year about 40% below its September peak. Oracle has about $95 billion of debt outstanding, making it the biggest corporate issuer outside the financial sector in the Bloomberg high-grade index. The company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment outside of regular business hours. Burry, who became famous for betting against the US housing market during the 2008 financial crisis, said he has avoided shorting larger technology companies whose businesses extend well beyond AI, citing Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. as examples. “If I short Meta, I’m also shorting its social media and advertising dominance. If I short Alphabet, I’m shorting Google Search in all its forms, Android, Waymo, etc. If I short Microsoft, I’m shorting a global office productivity SaaS goliath,” Burry wrote. “The big ones are not pure shorts on AI.” Those companies, he said, are likely to rein in spending over time, absorb losses from overbuilt capacity and potentially write down assets, while remaining dominant in their core businesses. “These three will not go away,” he added. He said he would short OpenAI at a $500 billion valuation, underscoring his broader skepticism about the pace and economics of the AI buildout. Burry described Nvidia as the most concentrated way to express a bearish view on the artificial intelligence trade. “Nvidia also is the most loved, and least doubted,” he wrote. “So shorting it is cheap, and its puts are cheaper than some of the other big shorts out there that are more doubted.”

Title: Weekend reading: Alas Smith and the active investing Joneses

Time Published: 2026-01-10T11:36:55Z

What caught my eye this week. The formerly fêted fund manager Terry Smith has had a few rough years in the markets, but last year was a doozy. The UK investors who once poured money into his flagship Fundsmith vehicle saw their domestic market deliver nearly 26% in 2025. A global tracker – a better comparison for the free-roaming Fundsmith – delivered roughly 14%. But Fundsmith managed just a 0.8% return. Barely there, and handily outpaced by cash in the bank. Now Terry Smith is a big and famously acerbic boy who has rained on many a parade over his long career. While the schadenfreude must be positively Wagnerian in some quarters and it’s never nice to kick a man while he’s down, he doesn’t need me defending him. I will just a tad though. Like Nick Train – another once-loved but now seemingly reviled fund manager 1 – Smith invests exclusively in ‘quality’ type shares. This doesn’t (just) mean ‘quality’ the way a car salesman might quip about that vehicle you’re eyeing up. The quality factor describes a particular kind of company that boasts – among other things – high returns on equity, strong profit margins, and the ability to turn most of its profit into cash. And since the reset of 2022, these kinds of companies have been in the doghouse. I know because I favour them with my stock picking myself. Although happily my returns in 2025 were an order of magnitude better than Smith’s. (But now I’m doing the schadenfreude dance…) Of course, Smith and Train didn’t exactly call out the tailwinds that boosted their returns during the low interest rate era. Worrywarts like me saw ‘bond proxy’ companies increasingly owned by weak hands who would rather be invested in bonds, and which were thus primed for a fall when interest rates rose. Train in particular dismissed such concerns, while Smith just continued to talk like you’d need a lobotomy to own anything other than his favoured firms. But when the reckoning came, those multiples duly corrected – and the share prices went south. The fact that even good investors suffer when their style is out of favour is of course another of the many arguments for passive investing. I’m one of diminishing band who still believes both Smith and Train have skill. But I also think most people should invest the bulk of their money in index funds, rather than bet their net worth on either the jockey or the horse they’re riding. However Smith has continued to lend his voice to the chorus warning that those same index funds are part of a wider problem. In his letter to investors this week, he recapped the now-common argument that the growing share of money invested in index funds is distorting the market, concluding: …even if we are right in diagnosing this move to index funds as one of the causes of our recent underperformance and it is laying the foundations of a major investment disaster, I have no clue how or when it will end except to say badly. He would say that, wouldn’t he? He’s an active fund manager. Well no. The greatest active investor of all-time, Warren Buffett, cheerily urges people – including his wife – to put their money into tracker funds. For my part, I am not sure exactly what I think. While Smith’s recap in his letter on the perils of excessive indexing is uncharacteristically muddled, I’ve read more persuasive arguments as to why the weight of money in index funds is distorting prices. At least at the margin and especially for the biggest companies. (Here’s the latest). I’ve also read comprehensive counters too. Now you may wonder why someone who has been writing a blog about both active and passive investing for 20 years cannot be more definitive about this? The truth is the maths is non-trivial and it’d take a good chunk of time to separate theoretical outcomes from any real-world implications. So I’m leaving it to the investing titans to argue it out. With that said, I’ve mentioned to my co-blogger The Accumulator that, on a gut level, I suspect indexing becoming mainstream will have some kind of downside. Apparent free lunches in investing always do. But whether they will be enough to make any meaningful difference – let alone be something that should prompt everyday investors to return to paying the known cost of active investing – is another matter altogether. On a practical level, if I was a passive investor I might favour equal-weighted funds a bit more, though that’s been a losing bet for years. Then I’d wait to see what happens! There’s no world in which index funds crash while a preponderance of active funds soar, that’s for sure. Remember, active funds basically are the market. 2 If passive and index investing has been unduly inflating prices, then beyond the edge cases it’s doing it for all investors. Have a great weekend.

Or peruse a few of our best articles. Surely this idea that indexing is causing overvalution is absolute nonsense? Like before indexing we never had overvaluation/ undervaluation in the market? Look at 1929, and more recently the late 1990s bubble and the subsequent drop after 1999. Human nature causes bubbles and their collapse, not indexing. @Indexing — Agree with the historical perspective. I’d have a read of the literature though before using the phrase “absolute nonsense”. If I was going to redux the argument down, it’s something like passive investing flows into the very largest index funds are sort of like a valuation agnostic active momentum fund funelling money into the market. (Remember, even index funds are ‘active’ in that they follow rules as to what firms to include and exclude, and in what weightings). So in that sense it’s the same as it ever was — just like big active funds in the 1960s or the late 1990s — but under a new guise. There’s then a bunch of maths overlaid onto that about demand/supply inelasticity and whatnot. In a simple world as I understood it, index funds just bought ‘the market’ and active funds traded against each other and were the market. But there are coherent arguments that at this scale quantity has a quality all of its own, as Napoleon said. Still, as noted in the piece, I’m not persuaded it’s an argument for active investing unless you want to go *very* active (e.g. buying small cap active funds to avoid an alleged large cap bubble) and that comes with a plethora of very known and real issues. If any bubble pops, however it was caused, then everyone will go down together, more or less, though no doubt some funds will do relatively better (including, perhaps, quality and value focused funds, which have struggled for so long versus tech/growth…) Fair enough, absolute nonsense is probably a bit harsh. But the idea bubbles are caused by indexing I think is a mistake. Bubbles or extreme price moves in both directions have occurred in all markets, not just stocks, since records began. Most of these markets did not have any form of indexing. On my long investing journey (am now 80) I remember my first convincing star manager Ian Rutherford of Personal Assets Trust whose investing outlook perfectly fitted my conservative investing feelings.Alas he was taken from us too soon -rather emphasising one of the problems of relying on “star” managers Various other heroes like Jim Slater shot briefly and brightly across the investing firmament -there were many of his ilk Realising that putting faith in one person was a fraught investing policy-how does a mere amateur investor pick the winners? Index investing eventually came to the rescue via Vanguard and John Bogle to my great investing relief-no educated guesswork needed I very much enjoy reading about the success of Terry Smith etc but then a Woodford comes along……… Index investing is very boring but retirement finances need to be 100% successful-so boring is OK with me Indexing has done the job for me-so far!-However I keep reading financial news-Monevator etc-but so far all it does is reinforce my current conservative investing policy but who knows down the line what might appear…….. xxd09 A very good article The Investor, which I thought was very balanced. Thank you. I have to confess that Fundsmith is the only active fund that I currently hold in my portfolio (less than 5% of it), with everything else being trackers (apart from one ‘fun’ individual company share). I have had it a long while now and, in the past, it has been good to me (186% up). I invested in it because I like Terry Smith (the UK’s Warren Buffet- we hoped) and how he talks. Although for the last five years his defence of his track record has become less and less convincing. I am curious to see what happens in the future. If in the next few years, he hugely underperforms the market does he decide that reducing the funds 1% management charge might be in order? ( I think Warren Buffet would). In fairness to him he does have integrity and is rich enough not to care about what other people think of him. A while back, buoyed by the success of Fundsmith, I invested in his FEET fund, basically Fundsmith in Emerging Markets. It was not a success (better to have bought an EM tracker). He run it for a few years before handing over to two of his team (who couldn’t improve it). He wound up FEET BUT the pay out was generous compared to the final share price (from memory I don’t think I lost any money on it apart from opportunity cost). With regard to his latest tirade against the unfairness of the all-encompassing passive trackers (I admit I haven’t actually read his words) I think he is on a sticky wicket. Passive trackers are here to stay – too bad, get over it. There is a truism in economics – You can never buck a trend! Seems to make some sense that passive flows could distort the stock market and lead to some misallocation of capital. But then, this should create opportunities that active managers can exploit, and we’re not seeing that. Active managers still underperform the market on average, and afaik the level of underperformance has been roughly the same over the past decades (and the rise of index funds). Academic economists usually work with “spherical horse in vacuum”-type assumptions. I think we’re better off relying on practical observations. Index funds it is for me, until I see active stock managers actually outperform. That said, if quality-factor stocks are so unloved at the moment, maybe it’s a good time to take a punt. @indexing #1 & #3: that’s not a claim being made under the Inelastic Markets Hypothesis (it’s a straw man point). The IMH does not postulate that passive flows ’cause’ overvaluation and/or crashes (at least per se). Rather, the IMH merely claims that, beyond a certain point, due to both increasing net passive flows and increasing passive share (dominance), public markets become increasingly less elastic, less informationally efficient (in terms of informed price discovery) and that larger caps weight stocks become progressively overweighted compared to their effective crisis liquidity (i.e. ever less effective liquidity under stress per unit of capitalisation): See Monevator here: “Why market cap investing still works”. March 4, 2025, @me #80 Here: “Passive investing, edge, and market efficiency: winners need losers”, September 19, 2024, @me #11 Here: “Weekend reading: oh what can ail thee, knight-at-arms?” September 7, 2024, @ZX #16 and immediately following. Here: “Weekend reading: Fama and fortune”. August 31, 2024, @me #3 and #9 And here: “Weekend reading: We all feel the pain of active fund managers now.” February 9, 2024, @ZX #16 and @me #37 For the avoidance of doubt IMH is not an argument for active management. Index investing will clearly follow a trend and NEW money will reinforce that trend. In the present market we can underweight the stocks / region that we perceive as overvalued. At some point the markets fall, is that the correction or just a dip…. Given we feel the market has fallen, how do we respond ? A logical answer is that a tracker is the route out , we don’t know what will rise again most quickly , “if you can’t find the needle buy the haystack “ So we need to veer away from the market tracker and then head back in, timing is tough. It’s worth thinking back to 1988/89 Japanese market was very expensive and was 45% of the world index (iirc) and USA was 25% but when it crashed big time in 1989 , the world index fell but within a couple of years the index had largely recovered… Perhaps that might point to how the AI excitement might play out ? Peter Thiel, seriously? @Ian — It’s an excellent book. I don’t share the man’s politics but he understands 21st Century business! Terry Smith and Nick train get a lot of credit for their factor happening to outperform in the early days of their funds’ launch. Terry Smith’s long term track record (and short term track record for that matter) looks a lot less impressive if you pick an appropriate benchmark with a similar factor exposure (the MSCI World Quality index say, rather that the MSCI World). I would say that index funds exaggerate (and perhaps highlight?) strongly held beliefs. So the US Exceptionalism concept has a key impact on the allocation of the global trackers. Then at a lower level in the UK you do have shares at very unusually low valuations (for example, retail is generally trading both on low earnings and earnings multipliers). With others at better values. These are both beliefs about where value should or shouldn’t be, but both could be temporary. And index funds are led by the hand by these beliefs. The advantage of the active investor or an investor in industry ETFs is they can go against these preconceptions, which may work well IF they are right (this is basically Buffet, Graham etc). At its core – index funds are not God – they contain mistakes, but at its core they can be reduced to generalizations, and understood. The problem is it takes a lot of time and energy to understand the generalizations in an index, and with most market commentary being misleading at best, the question is whether it’s worth extra time of effort. That I think will forever be debated – but there will be cycles where indexes outperform, and cycles where they don’t. The smaller houses lead to happier lives article is interesting. There’s a lot to be said for living in a good community. I think i heard Naval say similar on a podcast they’ve purposely chosen to live in a smaller house in a nice community rather than a remote mansion. It’s hard deciding on size of home more space isn’t always better seem to get filled with junk. The population chart isn’t good. Without wanting to bring the b word into it if that was a vote for sovereignty then the Boris wave was a proper kick in the teeth. Now we seem to be in a situation where we have a brain drain of talent and a policy of importing less desirable (pc term) low skilled people. When are we going to see govt embrace autonomous driving and lay off importing uber drivers? Re “With that said, I’ve mentioned to my co-blogger The Accumulator that, on a gut level, I suspect indexing becoming mainstream will have some kind of downside. Apparent free lunches in investing always do.” I think your gut-level theory falls down on the point of equating index investing with a free lunch. Most active participants are trying to beat the market, indexers are accepting average which I don’t see as a free lunch. They’re already resigned to the fact they won’t beat the market, but are happy to settle for that, knowing they’ll have lower costs, less mental work, etc. @Scott — the free lunch here would be relying on the work of active investors to analyse and try to put the correct value on shares. “The market” is a result of that work at any moment in time (plus or minus any disputed in elasticity effects…) I suppose one could argue that the active investors are effectively squabbling over the bill themselves in terms of the Gains/losses netting out, but nevertheless there’s billions of dollars of work here index investors aren’t paying for. Of course how many billions are required to keep a market efficient is open to debate. I’d be very open to believing it’s a lot less than is still being paid today! 🙂 Enjoyed the BBC piece on willpower. There are so many mysteries in obesity which get little attention as we’re still stuck on the now discredited calories in, calories out model. It’s the only large scale public health intervention which has not only not worked but gotten worse (including other interventions which also require ‘willpower’ like smoking cessation). On The Root of All article, symbols and ritual are thought to have a role in nourishing the non-propositional machinery beneath the intellectual abstract world we consciously inhabit. There has in a way always been tracker funds and a lot of money in them. Just a different name, closet trackers, basically a tracker fund where an a manager fiddled around the edges and called it an active fund. If you went to your local bank you tended to end up in one of those. There will always be actively managed funds, hope springs eternal. I’m not surprised Terry Smith is blaming his poor performance on index trackers its a common practice by politicians etc, blame someone/something else. That way you get your customers to shift their focus away from your poor performance. I wonder how the active v passive argument will play out once the much predicted correction occurs. I suspect that global trackers stuffed to the gills with AI plays may fall more significantly than Train/Smith – making the active plays ironically but temporarily the low volatily choice. On a somewhat different note I would be really interested in Monevators opinions on Cedebergs July 2025 paper “Beyond the Status Quo A critical assessment of lifestyle investment advice”. Also any comments on Morningstar’s paper “The state of retirement income for 2026” that outlines alternatives to the fixed withdrawal rate e.g guardrails approach would be very welcome. So the Trump administration has fully escalated the battle with the Fed. Its going to be a long week Nassim Nicholas Taleb recounted the time he worked as a trader for some large bank in New York, and at the weekly team meeting, he was asked for his view on whether the market would rise or fall in the coming week. He replied that he expected the market to rise, on balance of probabilities, as it had done for many weeks. One of his colleagues “called him out” (or whatever this kind of misbehaviour was called in the 1980s), demanding to know why Taleb held a short position in the market, if he believed that it would rise in the coming week. Taleb calmly repeated his stated position that the market was likely to rise over the coming week, but if it didn’t, then it would fall a long way, and then he would profit handsomely. Many investors are asking the wrong question (“will the market rise over the next week?”), rather than looking at how to make rich returns from other people’s preference for steady return. It might be a good time to buy some call options on Iranian equities. Leave a Comment Name * Email * Website Comment Notify me of followup comments via e-mail.

Title: Billionaire Chase Coleman Abruptly Dumps $3,490,202,000 of Meta, Buys Tech Stock That’s Soared 2x in Six Months

The founder of investment firm Tiger Global Management, Chase Coleman, is offloading a massive stake in Facebook’s parent company while loading up on a tech stock that has rallied massively over the past couple of months. According to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, Coleman dumped shares of Meta Platforms (META) worth approximately $3.49 billion in the third quarter of 2025. Since October, Meta Platforms has shed roughly 10% of its value. Over the same period, Coleman initiated a position in database software firm MongoDB (MDB) worth approximately $105.84 million. Earlier this week, MongoDB hit a 23-month high price of about $440 amid consecutive double-digit growth in revenues and profits over the past four quarters. MongoDB is trading at $414 at time of writing, up by approximately 106% from July of 2025. Another notable new position that Coleman initiated in the third quarter was a stake in streaming giant Netflix (NFLX) worth approximately $242.06 million. Besides Meta Platforms, other public companies that Coleman partially offloaded stakes in in the third quarter of 2025 include pharmaceutical firms Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NVO). In Eli Lilly, Coleman sold a stake worth approximately $1.18 billion, while offloading shares worth around $87.59 million in Novo Nordisk. Other stocks in which Coleman offloaded significant stakes include the world’s largest coatings company, Sherwin-Williams (SHW), cybsecurity firm Crowdstrike (CRWD) and fintech firm Chime Financial (CHYM). Coleman sold shares worth $299.5 million, $254.7 million and $178.8 million, respectively, in the three public firms.

Title: Here's What President Trump Said About Intel's CEO That's Boosting the Stock Friday

Intel's stock hit its highest point in nearly two years Friday, thanks to a social media post. The chipmaker's stock was up nearly 10% in recent trading, making it one of the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 Friday after President Trump praised Intel (INTC) CEO Lip-Bu Tan on social media. "I just finished a great meeting with the very successful Intel CEO, Lip-Bu Tan," Trump said in a Truth Social post Thursday, and that the U.S. government is "proud" to be an Intel shareholder. Just a few months earlier, Trump had pushed for Lip-Bu Tan to resign amid concerns about Tan's stakes in Chinese companies. However, Trump changed his tune just days later after meeting with the CEO in August, and brokered a deal that saw the U.S. government take a 10% stake in the chipmaker. Intel's stock has gotten a big boost from Trump's show of support, though it remains well off its historical highs as the embattled chipmaker works to convince investors of a sustainable turnaround in its business. A high-profile partnership with Nvidia (NVDA) followed not long after the government announced its stake, helped lift Intel's stock in the second half of last year, along with rumors about potential new customers. The shares nearly doubled in value last year, with most of those gains coming between early August and December. Intel's recent gains have also made the stock one of the top performers in the S&P 500 to start the year, with shares adding close to one-quarter of their value in January so far. A number of other semiconductor stocks followed Intel higher Friday, including Broadcom (AVGO), Micron Technology (MU), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), contributing to a broader market rally that pushed the S&P 500 to a new high.

Title: Markets wrap European stocks boosted by Glencore surge

Time Published: 2026-01-09T18:34:30Z

European shares ended Friday at a record high, powered by a surge in miner Glencore. On the trade front, European Union member states confirmed a majority support a free-trade agreement with South American bloc Mercosur. Global market sentiment also received a lift as investors reacted to US labour market data. The Irish index of shares ended the week marginally higher, with gains in food and construction stocks buoying the market. But banking shares remained mixed, with AIB notching up a gain on Friday of just under 1 per cent, while Bank of Ireland fell back slightly as the week drew to a close. Among construction stocks, insulation specialist Kingspan added 2.8 per cent, while home builders Glenveagh and Cairn gained 0.9 per cent and 2.2 per cent respectively. Elsewhere, Ryanair saw its shares shed 1.5 per cent, while ferry group ICG fell by 0.3 per cent. The blue-chip FTSE 100 recorded ⁠its second straight weekly gain and its highest ever close of ⁠10,126.6 points, marking a 0.8 per cent gain on ⁠the day. Shares in miner Glencore jumped ⁠9.6 per cent to their highest since July 2024 following news it is ‌in ​talks ‍with Rio Tinto about a takeover that would create the world’s largest mining group, valued at almost $207 billion (€178 billion). London-listed shares of Rio closed 3 per cent lower. Among other stocks, Sainsbury’s fell 5.3 per cent after Britain’s second-largest supermarket group reported a fall in general merchandise ‌and clothing sales for the Christmas quarter. IAG fell 2.7 per cent after the airline group named ⁠the finance chief of its British Airways unit, Jose Antonio Barrionuevo, as the group’s new chief financial officer, due to start in June. The STOXX 600 index climbed 1 per cent on Friday, with technology stocks leading the advance and logging their best week in nearly two years. Dutch chip equipment maker ASML added 6.8 per cent and was the biggest gainer in the tech index after HSBC raised its price target on the stock. Germany’s Infineon rose 2.4 per cent, while STMicroelectronics added 2.9 per cent. Tech shares also got a boost after upbeat fourth-quarter results from TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker. Shares in Anglo American rose 2.7 per cent, a day after a filing from the European Commission showed that the miner’s deal with Canada’s Teck Resources is heading for antitrust clearance in Europe. Defence stocks led weekly advances, with a near 10 per cent gain – their best showing since November 2020 – after US president Donald Trump called for higher defence spending. The retail rout carried on from the previous session. Pandora warned of weaker 2025 sales growth, sending shares of the jewellery maker down 13 per cent. US equities rose on Friday to new all-time highs, with the S&P 500 Index climbing 0.5 per cent at 11.30am in New York, on pace for its second closing high of 2026. The technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index rallied 0.8 per cent, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4 per cent. In the consumer sector, Mattel slid 3.27 per cent and Nike more than 1 per cent. Traders were also parsing job numbers. US employers added fewer jobs than expected in December, suggesting the labour market continued to soften at year-end, data released earlier in the day showed. The report supported expectations that the Federal Reserve will hold rates steady at its January meeting but left the door open for cuts later in the year. On the corporate side, Meta Platforms agreed to a series of electricity deals to power data centres that will make it the biggest buyer of nuclear power among its hyperscaler peers. US-listed shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing are up after the company reported strong December sales. Qualcomm shares were down after Mizuho Securities downgraded the chipmaker to neutral from outperform. – Additional reporting: Reuters/Bloomberg From maternity leave to remote working: Submit your work-related questions here Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Amazon shares dipped as reports confirmed the retail giant may slash 30,000 corporate roles by May 2026. This follow-up to the 14,000 cuts in late 2025 targets 10% of its white-collar staff. The move aims to eliminate "managerial bloat" and fund a $100 billion AI pivot. While trading at $245.98, the stock faces pressure as internal documents suggest 600,000 workers could eventually be replaced by automation by 2033.

The tech industry saw an estimated 245,000 jobs lost globally in 2025, with the US accounting for the majority of layoffs. Factors such as post-pandemic overhiring corrections and increased AI adoption are driving companies to reduce headcount. Every industry faces job cuts, especially in tumultuous economic times, new technologies replacing existing jobs, and so on. Unfortunately, it looks like the tech sector is experiencing global layoffs, with an estimation of nearly 245,000 jobs lost in 2025 alone. According to a recent report from RationalFX, they estimated that about 245,000 people experienced layoffs on a global scale in the tech sector in 2025. Based on their figures, the US was the most affected, with a little over 170,000 jobs lost. This accounts for approximately 69.7% of all global tech layoffs in 2025. The largest contributor to this was Intel. At the end of 2024, the company employed about 109,000 people, but it later revealed plans to drop those figures down further to 75,000 in 2025. Other tech companies also experienced similar layoffs. This includes Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, IBM, HP, and Salesforce, just to name a few. India also experienced pretty big layoffs, with an estimated 19,000 jobs lost in 2025. This was followed by Japan at a little over 11,000, Ireland, and Switzerland, rounding out the top five countries with the biggest layoffs. So, what’s happening, and why are jobs in the tech sector getting cut? There are a number of reasons. Firstly, RationalFX suggests that this is part of a post-pandemic correction. During the COVID-19 pandemic, while jobs were lost, there were a lot of jobs created as well. This is due to a rise in demand for work-from-home solutions, entertainment, food delivery, and so on. However, following the end of the pandemic, many tech companies realized they had overhired and are working towards correcting that. Another reason why we’re seeing jobs cut is because of, you guessed it, AI. AI allows users to automate and complete tasks in minutes—tasks that would have taken a human hours, days, or weeks. This means that companies can dump massive reports into AI and get summaries almost instantly. They can also use it to generate reports, make predictions, and identify patterns. This makes certain positions redundant. We’re also seeing how AI can generate impressive images and videos with a few simple prompts. But this isn’t necessarily doom and gloom. Like they say, when a door closes, another opens. When smartphones were created, suddenly being an app developer became a more viable career. Thanks to social media, being a content creator is also now a career for some. We’re not sure what the future holds for jobs in the tech sector, so we’ll have to wait and see.

Title: Are Leaders Responsible for Employee Wellbeing?
URL: https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/are-leaders-responsible-for-employee-wellbeing
Time Published: 2026-01-09T15:43:54Z
Full Content:
Work is increasingly understood as a powerful driver of wellbeing, and wellbeing as a factor shaping how organizations perform and endure. We asked Yale SOM leadership expert David Tate how leaders can create environments that support wellbeing without sacrificing rigor, accountability, or results. Has there been a shift in understanding of the relationship between work and wellbeing? Is more expected of leaders now? Yes, there has been a notable shift in how scholars and practitioners view the connection between work and wellbeing. Historically, work was seen primarily as a source of economic security and identity, with wellbeing considered a secondary outcome or the personal responsibility of the worker. Contemporary research, however, emphasizes that work is a significant determinant of psychological, emotional, and physical health and that the organizational environment profoundly influences employee wellbeing. Meta-analyses show that poor work conditions—high workload, low control, and limited social support—are associated with elevated risks of burnout, cardiovascular disease, and mental health disorders (Kivimäki et al., 2015). Conversely, positive work experiences, meaningful work, and supportive leadership are linked to greater engagement, satisfaction, and psychological wellbeing (Harter et al., 2003; Bakker & Demerouti, 2017). The boundary between supportive and intrusive is crossed when leaders inquire about personal details unrelated to work, make assumptions about motives, or exert pressure under the guise of wellbeing. These insights have reshaped expectations for leaders. Modern leadership is increasingly understood not only as driving results but also as cultivating environments that support employee wellbeing. Leaders are expected to demonstrate emotional intelligence and empathy and to be aware of how organizational practices affect psychological health (Goleman, Boyatzis, & McKee, 2013). Organizations are increasingly integrating employee wellbeing and psychological safety into strategic priorities, with leaders and executives explicitly accountable for creating conditions that support learning, engagement, and sustainable high performance (Edmondson, 2019; Gallup, 2023). The emergence of chief wellbeing officers and wellbeing dashboards illustrates that wellbeing is no longer solely an individual responsibility but a leadership and organizational concern (Grabarek & Sawyer, 2025). How can leaders pay attention to the wellbeing of employees and still be rigorous and high-performing? Leaders can support wellbeing while maintaining high performance by embedding wellbeing into the very definition of organizational success. Empirical research shows that workplaces emphasizing employee wellbeing often achieve superior outcomes, including higher engagement, lower turnover, improved innovation, and stronger financial performance (Harter et al., 2003; Bakker & Demerouti, 2017; De Neve & Ward, 2025). Effective strategies include: Importantly, leaders should maintain high standards of rigor while making it clear that it should not come at the expense of personal health or ethical behavior. Evidence suggests that teams led by emotionally intelligent leaders who balance accountability with care are more resilient and productive over time (Cherniss, 2010; O’Boyle et al., 2011). What role should wellbeing play in performance management and feedback conversations? How do you draw the line between being supportive and being intrusive as a leader? Wellbeing should be an integral component of performance management, framed in ways that support rather than monitor employees. Research indicates that employees perform better when leaders attend to both technical and human aspects of work (Grawitch et al., 2006; Grant, Christianson, & Price, 2007). Best practices include: The boundary between supportive and intrusive is crossed when leaders inquire about personal details unrelated to work, make assumptions about motives, or exert pressure under the guise of wellbeing. Respecting personal autonomy and confidentiality is critical. Leaders should maintain curiosity, empathy, and transparency while staying within professional boundaries (Edmondson, 2019; Kulik et al., 2016). Integrating wellbeing into performance management enhances engagement, reduces burnout, and promotes sustainable performance. When framed appropriately, wellbeing is a powerful lever for high performance rather than a distraction from it.

Investing A change at the top of the Federal Reserve could pave the way for more rate cuts in 2026. After three rate cuts in 2025, investors could see two more in 2026. Quality high-yield companies like the Small Dogs of the Dow could rule in 2026. Sending You to Google News in 3 © marekuliasz / iStock via Getty Images The Dogs of the Dow is a well-known strategy first published in 1991 by Michael O’Higgins. The plan aims to maximize investment returns by purchasing the 10 highest-yielding dividend stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average each year. The highest-yielding stocks are also the lowest-priced stocks in the venerable average, as the lower a stock (or bond) is priced, the higher the attached yield or coupon becomes. Since the turn of the century, the Dogs of the Dow have outperformed the overall Dow, and the Small Dogs of the Dow, which are the five highest-yielding stocks, even more so. The fact that investors are buying the highest-yielding companies in the venerable index improves the chances for total return gains. From 2000 through the early 2020s, the Dogs strategy posted strong average annual returns, generally beating the Dow by a few percentage points over the entire period. The plan is not foolproof; it struggled during the dot-com bust (early 2000s) and the tech-driven growth surge post-pandemic (2020 to 2021), when growth stocks soared, and value stocks lagged. They also lagged in 2025 as the AI-driven rally continued for the third straight year. The Dogs often shine in tough markets (like 2008 or 2022), protecting investor capital much better than the broader market by holding stable, high-yielding blue-chip companies. This makes them an excellent choice for Baby Boomers seeking safety and passive income. While the AI/data center rally has pushed stocks and indices to all-time highs, and it could still be a force in 2026, the reality is that the stock market, as measured by the S&P 500, is expensive. It trades at 31 times trailing earnings and 24 times forward earnings. With the midterm elections on the way this year, investors can expect some heightened volatility. So, the Small Dogs may be the perfect play for 2026 for growth and income investors wary of a major sell-off. alexei_tm / iStock via Getty Images Dividend stocks like the Small Dogs of the Dow offer investors a reliable source of passive income. Passive income is characterized by its ability to generate revenue without requiring the earner’s continuous active effort, making it a desirable financial strategy for those seeking to diversify their income streams or achieve financial independence. The following are the Small Dogs of the Dow. Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ) is an American multinational telecommunications company that continues to offer tremendous value. It trades at 9.13 times its estimated 2026 earnings and pays a 6.72% dividend. Verizon provides a range of communications, technology, information, and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses, and government entities worldwide. Verizon’s trailing 12-month interest coverage ratio is 4.6× to 5.0×, providing ample cushion for dividend payments. With a very predictable revenue stream from telecom services, the company has less exposure to commodity cycles. In addition, the large scale helps in financing and absorbing shocks. It operates in two segments: The Consumer segment provides wireless services across the United States through Verizon and TracFone networks, as well as through wholesale and other arrangements. It also provides fixed wireless access (FWA) broadband through its wireless networks and related equipment and devices, such as: The segment also offers wireline services in the Mid-Atlantic and northeastern United States through its fiber-optic network, Verizon Fios product portfolio, and copper-based network. The Business segment provides wireless and wireline communications services and products, including: Network access services to deliver various IoT services and products to businesses, government customers, and wireless and wireline carriers in the United States and internationally. TD Cowen has a Buy rating and a $51 price target on the stock. This American multinational energy company, primarily focused on oil and gas, is a safer option for investors looking to position themselves in the energy sector. Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX) pays a substantial 4.34% dividend, which it raised by 5% earlier this year. This integrated giant operates energy and chemicals businesses worldwide and offers investors excellent credit ratings (AA), diversified operations, strong margins, and a long history of paying and raising dividends yearly. Its Upstream segment is involved in the following: The Downstream segment engages in: It also involves cash management, debt financing, insurance operations, real estate, and technology businesses. Chevron announced in late 2023 that it had entered into a definitive agreement with Hess Corp. (NYSE: HES) to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Hess in an all-stock transaction valued at $53 billion. The transaction’s total enterprise value, including debt, is $60 billion. The deal closed last July, providing a solid boost to Chevron’s third-quarter earnings, which exceeded analysts’ expectations. Wells Fargo has an Overweight rating with a huge $196 target price. Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE: MRK) develops and produces medicines, vaccines, biological therapies, and animal health products. It is not just a healthcare company but a global force in the industry. This healthcare giant is a no-brainer, down over 30% over the past year while paying a solid 3.02% dividend. The company operates through two segments. The Pharmaceutical segment offers human health pharmaceutical products in: The Animal Health segment discovers, develops, manufactures, and markets veterinary pharmaceuticals, vaccines, health management solutions and services, as well as digitally connected identification, traceability, and monitoring products. Merck serves: Merck’s growth is a result of its efforts and strategic collaborations. The company works with AstraZeneca, Bayer, Eisai, Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, and Gilead Sciences to jointly develop and commercialize long-acting HIV treatments, demonstrating a commitment to innovation and growth. BMO Capital Markets’ target price for the Outperform-rated shares is a massive $130. Procter & Gamble Co. (NYSE: PG) was founded more than 185 years ago as a soap-and-candle company. It has paid dividends to shareholders since 1891, raised them for 70 straight years, and currently has a 2.95% dividend yield. The company focuses on providing branded consumer packaged goods worldwide. Segments include: The company’s products are sold in approximately 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, e-commerce, including social commerce channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores, including airport duty-free stores, high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics stores, and professional channels. It also sells directly to individual consumers. It has operations in approximately 70 countries. Procter & Gamble offers products under such brands as: Jefferies has a Buy rating with a $179 target price. Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ: AMGN) discovers, develops, manufactures, and delivers human therapeutics worldwide. This biotech giant remains a top stock for investors to buy, offering a safer investment with a 2.75% dividend yield to capitalize on the massive growth potential of biosimilars. Amgen focuses on: The company’s products include: HSBC has a huge $425 target price and a Buy rating. Our Top 2026 Passive Income Ultra-High-Yield Picks With Up to 10% Dividends.

Radar > Topics > AI & ML The tech trends we’re watching in the new year By Julie Baron January 9, 2026 • 13 minute read We’re three years into a post-ChatGPT world, and AI remains the focal point of the tech industry. In 2025, several ongoing trends intensified: AI investment accelerated; enterprises integrated agents and workflow automation at a faster pace; and the toolscape for professionals seeking a career edge is now overwhelmingly expansive. But the jury’s still out on the ROI from the vast sums that have saturated the industry. We anticipate that 2026 will be a year of increased accountability. Expect enterprises to shift focus from experimentation to measurable business outcomes and sustainable AI costs. There are promising productivity and efficiency gains to be had in software engineering and development, operations, security, and product design, but significant challenges also persist. Bigger picture, the industry is still grappling with what AI is and where we’re headed. Is AI a worker that will take all our jobs? Is AGI imminent? Is the bubble about to burst? Economic uncertainty, layoffs, and shifting AI hiring expectations have undeniably created stark career anxiety throughout the industry. But as Tim O’Reilly pointedly argues, “AI is not taking jobs: The decisions of people deploying it are.” No one has quite figured out how to make money yet, but the organizations that succeed will do so by creating solutions that “genuinely improve. . .customers’ lives.” That won’t happen by shoehorning AI into existing workflows but by first determining where AI can actually improve upon them, then taking an “AI first” approach to developing products around these insights. As Tim O’Reilly and Mike Loukides recently explained, “At O’Reilly, we don’t believe in predicting the future. But we do believe you can see signs of the future in the present.” We’re watching a number of “possible futures taking shape.” AI will undoubtedly be integrated more deeply into industries, products, and the wider workforce in 2026 as use cases continue to be discovered and shared. Topics we’re keeping tabs on include context engineering for building more reliable, performant AI systems; LLM posttraining techniques, in particular fine-tuning as a means to build more specialized, domain-specific models; the growth of agents, as well as the protocols, like MCP, to support them; and computer vision and multimodal AI more generally to enable the development of physical/embodied AI and the creation of world models. Here are some of the other trends that are pointing the way forward. In 2025, AI was embedded in software developers’ everyday work, transforming their roles—in some cases dramatically. A multitude of AI tools are now available to create code, and workflows are undergoing a transformation shaped by new concepts including vibe coding, agentic development, context engineering, eval- and spec-driven development, and more. In 2026, we’ll see an increased focus on agents and the protocols, like MCP, that support them; new coding workflows; and the impact of AI on assisting with legacy code. But even as software development practices evolve, fundamental skills such as code review, design patterns, debugging, testing, and documentation are as vital as ever. And despite major disruption from GenAI, programming languages aren’t going anywhere. Type-safe languages like TypeScript, Java, and C# provide compile-time validation that catches AI errors before production, helping mitigate the risks of AI-generated code. Memory safety mandates will drive interest in Rust and Zig for systems programming: Major players such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta have adopted Rust for critical systems, and Zig is behind Anthropic’s most recent acquisition, Bun. And Python is central to creating powerful AI and machine learning frameworks, driving complex intelligent automation that extends far beyond simple scripting. It’s also ideal for edge computing and robotics, two areas where AI is likely to make inroads in the coming year. Which AI tools programmers use matter less than how they use them. With a wide choice of tools now available in the IDE and on the command line, and new options being introduced all the time, it’s useful to focus on the skills needed to produce good code rather than focusing on the tool itself. After all, whatever tool they use, developers are ultimately responsible for the code it produces. Effectively communicating with AI models is the key to doing good work. The more background AI tools are given about a project, the better the code they generate will be. Developers have to understand both how to manage what the AI knows about their project (context engineering) and how to communicate it (prompt engineering) to get useful outputs. AI isn’t just a pair programmer; it’s an entire team of developers. Software engineers have moved beyond single coding assistants. They’re building and deploying custom agents, often within complex setups involving multi-agent scenarios, teams of coding agents, and agent swarms. But as the engineering workflow shifts from conducting AI to orchestrating AI, the fundamentals of building and maintaining good software—code review, design patterns, debugging, testing, and documentation—stay the same and will be what elevates purposeful AI-assisted code above the crowd. AI has progressed from being something architects might have to consider to something that is now essential to their work. They can use LLMs to accelerate or optimize architecture tasks; they can add AI to existing software systems or use it to modernize those systems; and they can design AI-native architectures, an approach that requires new considerations and patterns for system design. And even if they aren’t working with AI (yet), architects still need to understand how AI relates to other parts of their system and be able to communicate their decisions to stakeholders at all levels. AI-enhanced and AI-native architectures bring new considerations and patterns for system design. Event-driven models can enable AI agents to act on incoming triggers rather than fixed prompts. In 2026, evolving architectures will become more important as architects look for ways to modernize existing systems for AI. And the rise of agentic AI means architects need to stay up-to-date on emerging protocols like MCP. Many of the concerns from 2025 will carry over into the new year. Considerations such as incorporating LLMs and RAG into existing architectures, emerging architecture patterns and antipatterns specifically for AI systems, and the focus on API and data integrations elevated by MCP are critical. The fundamentals still matter. Tools and frameworks are making it possible to automate more tasks. However, to successfully leverage these capabilities to design sustainable architecture, enterprise architects must have a full command of the principles behind them: when to add an agent or a microservice, how to consider cost, how to define boundaries, and how to act on the knowledge they already have. The InfraOps space is undergoing its most significant transformation since cloud computing, as AI evolves from a workload to be managed to an active participant in managing infrastructure itself. With infrastructure sprawling across multicloud environments, edge deployments, and specialized AI accelerators, manual management is becoming nearly impossible. In 2026, the industry will keep moving toward self-healing systems and predictive observability—infrastructure that continuously optimizes itself, shifting the human role from manual maintenance to system oversight, architecture, and long-term strategy. Platform engineering makes this transformation operational, abstracting infrastructure complexity behind self-service interfaces, which lets developers deploy AI workloads, implement observability, and maintain security without deep infrastructure expertise. The best platforms will evolve into orchestration layers for autonomous systems. While fully autonomous systems remain on the horizon, the trajectory is clear. AI is becoming a primary driver of infrastructure architecture. AI-native workloads demand GPU orchestration at scale, specialized networking protocols optimized for model training and inference, and frameworks like Ray on Kubernetes that can distribute compute intelligently. Organizations are redesigning infrastructure stacks to accommodate these demands and are increasingly considering hybrid environments and alternatives to hyperscalers to power their AI workloads—“neocloud” platforms like CoreWeave, Lambda, and Vultr. AI is augmenting the work of operations teams with real-time intelligence. Organizations are turning to AIOps platforms to predict failures before they cascade, identify anomalies humans would miss, and surface optimization opportunities in telemetry data. These systems aim to amplify human judgment, giving operators superhuman pattern recognition across complex environments. AI is evolving into an autonomous operator that makes its own infrastructure decisions. Companies will implement emerging “agentic SRE” practices: systems that reason about infrastructure problems, form hypotheses about root causes, and take independent corrective action, replicating the cognitive workload that SREs perform, not just following predetermined scripts. The big story of the back half of 2025 was agents. While the groundwork has been laid, in 2026 we expect focus on the development of agentic systems to persist—and this will necessitate new tools and techniques, particularly on the data side. AI and data platforms continue to converge, with vendors like Snowflake, Databricks, and Salesforce releasing products to help customers build and deploy agents. Beyond agents, AI is making its influence felt across the entire data stack, as data professionals target their workflows to support enterprise AI. Significant trends include real-time analytics, enhanced data privacy and security, and the increasing use of low-code/no-code tools to democratize data access. Sustainability also remains a concern, and data professionals need to consider ESG compliance, carbon-aware tooling, and resource-optimized architectures when designing for AI workloads. Data infrastructure continues to consolidate. The consolidation trend has not only affected the modern data stack but also more traditional areas like the database space. In response, organizations are being more intentional about what kind of databases they deploy. At the same time, modern data stacks have fragmented across cloud platforms and open ecosystems, so engineers must increasingly design for interoperability. A multiple database approach is more important than ever. Vector databases like Pinecone, Milvus, Qdrant, and Weaviate help power agentic AI—while they’re a new technology, companies are beginning to adopt vector databases more widely. DuckDB’s popularity is growing for running analytical queries. And even though it’s been around for a while, ClickHouse, an open source distributed OLAP database used for real-time analytics, has finally broken through with data professionals. The infrastructure to support autonomous agents is coming together. GitOps, observability, identity management, and zero-trust orchestration will all play key roles. And we’re following a number of new initiatives that facilitate agentic development, including AgentDB, a database designed specifically to work effectively with AI agents; Databricks’ recently announced Lakebase, a Postgres database/OLTP engine integrated within the data lakehouse; and Tiger Data’s Agentic Postgres, a database “designed from the ground up” to support agents. AI is a threat multiplier—59% of tech professionals cited AI-driven cyberthreats as their biggest concern in a recent survey. In response, the cybersecurity analyst role is shifting from low-level human-in-the-loop tasks to complex threat hunting, AI governance, advanced data analysis and coding, and human-AI teaming oversight. But addressing AI-generated threats will also require a fundamental transformation in defensive strategy and skill acquisition—and the sooner it happens, the better. Security professionals now have to defend a broader attack surface. The proliferation of AI agents expands the attack surface. Security tools must evolve to protect it. Implementing zero trust for machine identities is a smart opening move to mitigate sprawl and nonhuman traffic. Security professionals must also harden their AI systems against common threats such as prompt injection and model manipulation. Organizations are struggling with governance and compliance. Striking a balance between data utility and vulnerability requires adherence to data governance best practices (e.g., least privilege). Government agencies, industry and professional groups, and technology companies are developing a range of AI governance frameworks to help guide organizations, but it’s up to companies to translate these technical governance frameworks into board-level risk decisions and actionable policy controls. The security operations center (SOC) is evolving. The velocity and scale of AI-driven attacks can overwhelm traditional SIEM/SOAR solutions. Expect increased adoption of agentic SOC—a system of specialized, coordinated AI agents for triage and response. This shifts the focus of the SOC analyst from reactive alert triage to proactive threat hunting, complex analysis, and AI system oversight. Business focus in 2025 shifted from scattered AI experiments to the challenge of building defensible, AI-native businesses. Next year we’re likely to see product teams moving from proof of concept to proof of value. One thing to look for: Design and product responsibilities may consolidate under a “product builder”—a full stack generalist in product, design, and engineering who can rapidly build, validate, and launch new products. Companies are currently hiring for this role, although few people actually possess the full skill set at the moment. But regardless of whether product builders become ascendant, product folks in 2026 and beyond will need the ability to combine product validation, good-enough engineering, and rapid design, all enabled by AI as a core accelerator. We’re already seeing the “product manager” role becoming more technical as AI spreads throughout the product development process. Nearly all PMs use AI, but they’ll increasingly employ purpose-built AI workflows for research, user-testing, data analysis, and prototyping. Companies need to bridge the AI product strategy gap. Most companies have moved past simple AI experiments but are now facing a strategic crisis. Their existing product playbooks (how to size markets, roadmapping, UX) weren’t designed for AI-native products. Organizations must develop clear frameworks for building a portfolio of differentiated AI products, managing new risks, and creating sustainable value. AI product evaluation is now mission-critical. As AI becomes a core product component and strategy matures, rigorous evaluation is the key to turning products that are good on paper into those that are great in production. Teams should start by defining what “good” means for their specific context, then build reliable evals for models, agents, and conversational UIs to ensure they’re hitting that target. Design’s new frontier is conversations and interactions. Generative AI has pushed user experience beyond static screens into probabilistic new multimodal territory. This means a harder shift toward designing nonlinear, conversational systems, including AI agents. In 2026, we’re likely to see increased demand for AI conversational designers and AI interaction designers to devise conversation flows for chatbots and even design a model’s behavior and personality. While big questions about AI remain unanswered, the best way to plan for uncertainty is to consider the real value you can create for your users and for your teams themselves right now. The tools will improve, as they always do, and the strategies to use them will grow more complex. Being deeply versed in the core knowledge of your area of expertise gives you the foundation you’ll need to take advantage of these quickly evolving technologies—and ensure that whatever you create will be built on bedrock, not shaky ground.

The year 2026 is just getting started, and layoffs are already underway. Companies, including Angi, the company formerly known as Angie's List, and the popular web tool Tailwind, have cut staff, citing the impact of artificial intelligence among the reasons for the layoffs. More than 100 other companies, from Amazon to Nike to Verizon, have filed legally mandated WARN notices about job cuts to come in 2026, according to WARN Tracker. Some of the cuts are part of previously announced reductions. This year's cuts follow three years of significant workforce reductions across a broad range of industries, including tech, media, finance, and retail. The moves come as artificial intelligence, public policy, and broader economic conditions present sweeping changes to the business landscape. A World Economic Forum survey last year found that some 41% of companies worldwide expected to reduce their workforces in the next five years because of the rise of artificial intelligence. The survey also found that jobs in big data, fintech, and AI are expected to double by 2030. Last year, Business Insider tracked layoffs at around 65 major companies, such as Amazon, Meta, Paramount, and Starbucks. In 2026, we'll continue to track additional job cuts based on company announcements, WARN notices, and our own reporting. Here are the companies with job cuts underway in 2026, listed in alphabetical order. Angi, the popular contractor listing site once known as Angie's List, said in January that it was cutting around 350 jobs "to reduce operating expenses and optimize the organizational structure in support of long-term growth." The company also said it's making the cuts "in light of AI-driven efficiency improvements." In a January 7 SEC filing, Angi said that the cuts would save between $70 million and $80 million in annual spending. The layoffs will cost the company between $22 million and $30 million, according to the filing. Citi will cut more jobs this year as part of its plan to reduce its workforce by 10%, or 20,000 employees. In a statement on January 13, the bank said that it will continue to reduce head count in 2026. "These changes reflect adjustments we're making to ensure our staffing levels, locations and expertise align with current business needs," a spokesperson for Citi said. The plan was detailed in the company's January 2024 earnings report and could save the bank as much as $2.5 billion. Meta is preparing to slash jobs within its Reality Labs division, the unit responsible for Mark Zuckerberg's metaverse ambitions, three people familiar with the matter told Business Insider. Two employees said that teams working on virtual reality headsets and Horizon Worlds, the company's VR social network, will be disproportionately affected. The New York Times reported that roughly 10% to 15% of the division's 15,000 employees are expected to be laid off, with announcements coming as soon as this week. The cuts coincide with a high-stakes division-wide meeting scheduled for Wednesday. Meta's CTO and Reality Labs chief Andrew Bosworth described the upcoming gathering as the "most important" of the year and urged employees to attend in person. Tailwind, a popular web tool, said it cut three of its four engineers in January, citing an AI-driven decline in revenue. "75% of the people on our engineering team lost their jobs here yesterday because of the brutal impact AI has had on our business," CEO Adam Wathan wrote in a GitHub comment on January 6 that made waves in the tech community.

Nvidia made a key leadership move Thursday by hiring its first chief marketing officer. The company tapped Google Cloud marketing veteran Alison Wagonfeld for the newly created position. NVIDIA Corporation, NVDA Wagonfeld announced her departure from Google on LinkedIn. She will join Nvidia in late January after spending nearly a decade at the search giant. At Google, Wagonfeld led marketing for the cloud computing business. She worked closely with Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian and Chief Marketing Officer Lorraine Twohill. Her new role at Nvidia consolidates marketing responsibilities that were previously split among several people. She will report directly to CEO Jensen Huang. The hire comes as Nvidia looks to expand beyond just chip sales. The company wants to position itself as a full AI platform provider offering software, systems, and services. Wagonfeld’s move from Google to Nvidia highlights the relationship between the two tech companies. “I’m thrilled to be moving from one AI leader to another at such a transformational time,” she wrote on LinkedIn. She emphasized that Google and Nvidia maintain a strong partnership. The two companies plan to continue their collaboration despite her switch. This partnership angle matters for investors. Some analysts have worried about competition from Google’s Tensor Processing Units potentially eating into Nvidia’s dominance. Signs of cooperation rather than rivalry could ease these concerns. The market may view Wagonfeld’s hire as confirmation that the two companies see themselves as partners rather than enemies. Nvidia stock fell 2.2% during Thursday’s trading session. Shares remained flat in after-hours trading following the announcement. The stock has struggled to break out recently. It’s down 1% over the past three months despite strong demand indicators for AI chips. Nvidia remains the dominant provider of artificial intelligence chips. But the stock has been range-bound for several months as investors digest its rapid gains from earlier periods. The company faces questions about maintaining its market leadership as competitors ramp up their own chip offerings. Google’s TPUs represent one potential challenge to Nvidia’s position. Wagonfeld brings deep experience in marketing complex technology products to enterprise customers. Her background at Google Cloud could help Nvidia refine its messaging as it expands beyond hardware. The appointment reflects Nvidia’s evolution from a chip company to a broader AI infrastructure provider. Creating a CMO role signals the company’s intent to strengthen its brand and market positioning during this transition.

NEW THINKING In December 2024, Omnicom merged with IPG, eliminating approximately 4,000 jobs. Among those displaced were hundreds of brand strategists who had spent their entire careers honing the art of positioning, differentiation, and cultural resonance. They didn’t lose their jobs because they weren’t talented or dedicated. They lost them because the infrastructure they relied on—the promise-making apparatus of the advertising age—collapsed from obsolescence. This wasn’t a cyclical downturn. It was structural. And understanding why requires an understanding of how brands have fundamentally changed the way they create value for their owners and the customers they serve. This article is part of Branding Strategy Insider’s newsletter. Join the world’s smartest marketers and subscribe here for actionable insights delivered directly to your inbox. The Shift Everyone Saw Coming (But Was Still Surprised By) For more than a century, the brand-building playbook was remarkably consistent: Make a promise. Tell it beautifully. Repeat until it sticks. Sneaker companies promised athletic identity. Banks promised security and partnership. Consumer brands competed on who could craft the most compelling story about what their product meant, not what it could actually do for you beyond its basic function. This made sense given the constraints of the era. A sneaker company couldn’t actually make you a better athlete—but it could make you feel like one. A bank couldn’t simplify the genuine complexity of personal finance—but it could promise you’d feel confident and secure. So an entire industry architecture evolved around this model: Agencies optimized persuasion. Research measured perception. Media delivered reach. Success meant winning the battle for attention and preference through superior creative execution and bigger media budgets. Here’s what changed: That playbook just became obsolete. Not outdated—obsolete. Like a Rolodex or a fax machine or the idea that you can build a brand without actually being useful to people. And the implications are more profound than most CMOs have fully absorbed. Which is understandable—it’s hard to notice the ground shifting when you’re standing on it. Three Technology Shifts That Ended the Promise Era Three technological capabilities emerged that fundamentally eliminated the constraints that made promise-based branding necessary: First, brands can now deliver contextual utility at scale. Connectivity, sensors, and AI enable brands to understand individual contexts in real-time and orchestrate genuinely personalized responses. Nike doesn’t just promise athletic identity anymore—it delivers adaptive training programs, biomechanical feedback, and performance optimization through Training Club. Capital One doesn’t promise financial confidence—it delivers real-time spending insights, instant fraud alerts, and automated savings tools. The promise has become operationalizable in ways that were simply impossible a decade ago. Second, consumer expectations shifted irreversibly. People now expect brands to be useful, not just meaningful. A 2024 Edelman study found that 67% of consumers define brand trust primarily through “helping me solve problems” rather than “sharing my values”—a complete inversion from 2015 when values alignment dominated. Cultural resonance still matters, but it’s become table stakes rather than differentiation. Amazon’s cultural salience is near zero, yet it maintains dominant positions because it relentlessly delivers operational value: speed, convenience, reliability, and price. Third, promise-making now creates vulnerability in transparent markets. Social media, review platforms, and instant information access have made gaps between promise and delivery instantly visible and permanently documented. Brands that overpromise face immediate, public accountability. There’s a reason “We’ve heard your feedback” became the most panic-inducing phrase in corporate communications. The old model—craft aspirational messaging, deliver adequate product—now generates backlash rather than loyalty. Trust gets built through consistent delivery of value, not repetition of claims. Why The Old Model Creates New Strategic Risks The promise-focused approach isn’t just less effective—it actively creates three forms of new strategic risks: Capital misallocation. Marketing budgets optimized for awareness and persuasion are generating diminishing returns. A 2023 McKinsey analysis of 200 CPG brands found that incremental media spend beyond baseline thresholds produced 0.3x ROI, while investment in what they called “experiential utilities” – apps, services, and personalization engines – generated 3.2x returns. Every dollar spent on louder promises is effectively subsidizing competitors who are building better delivery systems. Talent misalignment. The most sophisticated strategic and technical talent now gravitates toward brands that are building operational capabilities – product teams, experience designers, and data scientists—not communications roles. Agencies report 40% declines in applications from top-tier creative talent since 2019, while product-led brands like Stripe and Notion face talent surpluses. The promise model simply can’t attract the capabilities required for modern competition. Commodification risk. When multiple brands make similar promises without differentiated delivery, entire categories collapse into price competition. Consider banking: Every major institution promises ‘financial partnership’ and ‘personalized service.’ Yet 89% of consumers report experiencing no meaningful difference whatsoever. If you’ve ever tried to distinguish between Chase’s promise and Bank of America’s promise and Wells Fargo’s promise, you know exactly what I mean. They all sound like they were written by the same AI prompt: ‘Sound trustworthy but not boring, aspirational but not arrogant, personal but not creepy. Point being, the promise layer has become completely indistinguishable, forcing bank brand competition toward rate arbitrage. Meanwhile, brands with superior delivery systems, such as Chime’s instant notifications and Revolut’s multi-currency infrastructure, capture disproportionate growth despite minimal brand investment. Playing Three Games Simultaneously Here’s what I’ve learned watching brands win and lose over the past several years: They’re no longer just trying to play one simple game where the rules are known to everyone. They’re playing three different games simultaneously. There’s the game everyone knows: Products. Better ingredients, faster processors, longer battery life, and superior formulations. This is the traditional realm of functional performance where CPG and consumer tech have always competed: simple product features, tangible benefits, and superiority claims. Then there’s the game brand strategists have obsessed over for the past 20 years: Ideas. Cultural conversations about what the “good life” looks and feels like. Not just brand positioning, but participation in broader societal dialogue about meaning, identity, and values. This is where brands try to build emotional affinity, ethical identity, and cultural capital. But there’s a third game that’s fast becoming the deciding factor: Services. And I need to be specific about what I mean here, because I’m not talking about customer service. I am not referring to call centers, return policies, or post-purchase support functions. Those remain operationally important, but they’re cost centers focused on maintaining satisfaction. What I am talking about is capability delivery: Technologies, platforms, and orchestrated experiences that give customers new abilities or dramatically expand what they can accomplish with products. Sephora’s Skincredible AI skin analysis isn’t customer service fixing a problem; it’s giving customers the tools they need to choose the best products for their skin type. Nike Training Club doesn’t address product quality issues that arise after purchase; it helps its customers become better athletes. Capital One’s real-time spending insights don’t supply FAQs. They help build financial acumen. These services don’t merely satisfy their customers’ aspirations. They provide them with new abilities. And capability delivery generates a behavioral dependency that messaging simply can’t replicate. Once you’ve integrated Spotify’s algorithms into your daily routines, you don’t switch to a competitor offering better brand promises. You’ve offloaded the cognitive work of music curation to a system that knows your preferences better than you can articulate them yourself. That’s a moat built through delivered utility, not communicated meaning. The critical insight: The competitive hierarchy among these three games has completely inverted. And understanding how requires seeing the mechanism at work. How Culture Drives the Need for Services The traditional model assumed a linear progression: Products → Ideas → Communications. Build a better mousetrap, craft compelling meaning around it, and then broadcast that meaning at scale. The modern reality operates completely differently: Culture → Products → Services → Cultural Permission. Please allow me to show you how this works: Step 1: Culture elevates aspirations. Societal movements are perpetually redefining what “good living” means. Over the past decade, we’ve seen dramatic aspiration inflation across multiple dimensions: Step 2: Elevated aspirations raise the performance bar across products. These cultural shifts don’t just change what people want. They change what they expect brands to do. When culture elevates healthspan as a new well-being aspiration, food brands face pressure for clean ingredients, supplement brands need clinical validation, and fitness brands must deliver personalized optimization. The product performance threshold rises across entire categories. But here’s the critical dynamic: Product improvements alone no longer create sustainable advantage. Technology diffusion and manufacturing democratization mean functional parity arrives faster than ever. Plant-based proteins, carbon-neutral production and AI-powered personalization—these innovations spread across competitors within 18-24 months. Product superiority becomes temporary, not structural. Step 3: Services become the actual differentiation layer. Elevated cultural aspirations create expectations not just for better products, but for personalized, connected, joyful experiences of those products. This is where services (and experiences) enter as the new competitive battleground. Consider the beauty sector: Cultural conversations about inclusive beauty standards raised product expectations such as broader shade ranges, clean formulations, and dermatologist-tested ingredients. Every major brand can now meet these thresholds. Product parity is nearly complete. But Sephora dominates because it competes in the service layer: AI skin analysis, virtual try-on technology, personalized routine recommendations, community tutorials, and beauty advisor access. These services deliver the “personalized, connected, joyful” experiences that elevated beauty aspirations demand. And here’s what matters most: Service delivery earns permission to shape cultural conversation. Sephora can credibly participate in defining beauty standards because it operationally delivers inclusive, personalized beauty experiences. Competitors still making promises about inclusive beauty without service infrastructure sound hollow—the gap between claim and capability is instantly visible to consumers. Step 4: The compounding loop that changes everything. Brands that build service layers don’t just differentiate. They trigger a self-reinforcing cycle: Culture elevates aspirations → Raises product and experience expectations → Brands that deliver service layer differentiate → Service delivery generates cultural credibility → Cultural credibility earns permission to shape the next cultural iteration → Strengthened cultural position attracts more users → More users generate behavioral data → Data improves service delivery → Improved services strengthen cultural authority → Culture elevates aspirations further. Brands stuck in the Products + Ideas model can’t enter this loop. They’re making cultural promises without experiential proof. Meanwhile, brands building service infrastructure compound their advantage with each cycle; cultural position strengthens operational capability, which strengthens cultural position. Why Meaning Still Matters—But Can’t Stand Alone This framework resolves what seems like a paradox: Cultural salience remains absolutely essential, but it’s now downstream from service delivery, not upstream from product marketing. Ideas are still the prize. Brands that shape cultural conversations about aspiration achieve disproportionate mindshare, loyalty, and pricing power. Nike’s cultural influence on athletic identity, Patagonia’s environmental leadership, and Apple’s creative empowerment positioning. These idea-level assets generate billions in equity value. But services have become a powerful weapon for winning in the marketplace of ideas. You can’t credibly shape cultural aspiration through messaging when competitors are delivering capability. Let me be clear: This doesn’t mean promises have no role. Brand awareness and initial consideration still require cultural presence. Consumers need to know a brand exists before they can experience its service layer. But awareness without delivered utility now creates vulnerability, not competitive advantage. A compelling brand promise gets you into the consideration set. But a compelling service determines whether you’ll win the decision and build the kind of behavioral loyalty that compounds over time. Three mechanisms explain why this shift happened: 1. Service as Cultural Credential: The New Authenticity Standard The brand services layer doesn’t replace cultural meaning. It validates it. Brands attempting to lead cultural conversations through messaging alone face immediate authenticity scrutiny in transparent markets where gaps between claims and capabilities are instantly visible. Consumers and critics ask, “What operational evidence gives you permission to speak on this topic?” The service layer provides the answer through demonstrated commitment, not stated values. Consider Patagonia. They earn permission to shape environmental conversations because their service infrastructure proves they’ve operationalized sustainability, not just marketed it. Their Worn Wear platform offers repair services and a used gear marketplace. Their supply chain transparency tools make factory data and material sourcing publicly available. Their environmental activism funding, the 1% for the Planet commitment, gets operationalized through actual donations you can track. This provides concrete evidence that environmental stewardship is structural to their business model, not performative in their advertising. When Patagonia’s leadership advocates for public lands protection or criticizes fast fashion, the service layer grants credibility. They’re not making promises about values. They’re demonstrating values through operational commitment that costs them margin, constrains their growth, and creates a competitive disadvantage in pure product comparisons. That sacrifice is what earns cultural authority. Now contrast this with the authenticity gap that undermines promise-based cultural positioning: Dove spent decades and hundreds of millions of dollars on “Real Beauty” campaigns celebrating body diversity and challenging unrealistic beauty standards. Yet they delivered retail experiences and product formulations identical to competitors who made no such cultural claims. When you asked “what operational evidence supports your beauty inclusion message?” the answer was effectively “our advertising says so.” “The service layer provided no proof. The result: cultural skepticism, campaign fatigue, and minimal impact on actual beauty culture conversations despite massive investment. Meanwhile, Fenty Beauty achieved instant cultural authority in beauty inclusion with a fraction of Dove’s marketing budget. Why? Rihanna established a service infrastructure that implemented inclusivity by offering 40 foundation shades at launch, compared to the industry standard of 6-12, utilizing undertone-matching technology that catered to the full spectrum, ensuring diverse model representation across all customer touchpoints, not just in advertising, and developing products that prioritized historically underserved skin tones. The service layer granted permission to lead beauty culture conversations that Dove, despite decades of promise-based positioning and vastly larger budgets, couldn’t credibly join. This pattern is pretty consistent: Cultural salience remains the prize, but service delivery is the credential that earns entry to the competition. You can’t claim environmental leadership without circular service models. You can’t champion inclusion without operationalized accessibility. You can’t promise empowerment without capability-conferring tools. The service layer is how brands prove their cultural positioning is authentic rather than opportunistic. And in transparent markets, that proof is a prerequisite for cultural authority. This is why the three-marketplace model places Ideas downstream from Services in the modern competitive hierarchy. Brands don’t build service capabilities to support their cultural positioning. They earn cultural positioning by building service capabilities. The causality reversed. 2. Experience as Proof: Making Abstract Aspirations Tangible Abstract aspirations become concrete through delivered experiences. “Healthspan” as a cultural aspiration remains vague until Peloton delivers personalized training that makes you measurably stronger, or until Levels provides continuous glucose monitoring that reveals how specific foods impact your energy throughout the day. The service translates aspiration into felt reality. And felt reality is infinitely more persuasive today than aspirational storytelling. 3. Behavioral Integration: Creating Mental Availability Through Utility When brands deliver utility in specific contexts, they achieve what The Ehrenberg-Bass Institute calls mental availability at Category Entry Points—the purchase moments that actually matter. Tesla famously doesn’t advertise, yet it dominates EV consideration. Why? Because they deliver measurable value, the Supercharger network, over-the-air updates, and autopilot capability are in the exact moments relevant to EV purchase decisions. The service delivery is the marketing, creating situational presence that pure messaging can’t replicate. The Pattern of Competitive Displacement The three-marketplace framework reveals why incumbents with superior product heritage and decades of cultural equity are losing to service-first challengers. Again, allow me to show you the pattern I’ve seen everywhere in my work and research: Traditional Banking vs. Chime/Revolut Incumbents compete on Products (marginally better rates) plus Ideas (trust and partnership messaging). Challengers compete on services: instant notifications, fee elimination, multi-currency infrastructure, and automated savings. Despite zero brand equity, service-first challengers capture disproportionate growth because they deliver the “personalized, connected, joyful” financial experience that elevated money-management aspirations demand. Traditional Retail vs. Amazon Department stores maintained superior product curation and cultural positioning; lifestyle aspiration and promises of personal service. Amazon built service infrastructure: 1-click ordering, Prime shipping, personalized recommendations, and Alexa integration. Amazon’s cultural salience is minimal, yet it dominates because service delivery creates behavioral lock-in that messaging can’t overcome. Traditional Beauty vs. Sephora Legacy brands owned a stronger product heritage. L’Oréal formulations and Estée Lauder brand prestige and cultural equity were built through decades of advertising investment. Sephora invested in the service layer: virtual try-on, skin analysis, its Beauty Insider community, and personalized routines. Now Sephora shapes beauty culture conversations despite having weaker product IP. Service delivery earned cultural permission that heritage brands assumed was permanent. Traditional Eyewear vs. Warby Parker This same pattern extends beyond tech giants to mid-market challengers in commodity categories. Everyone knows this story by now. Warby Parker entered a mature eyewear market dominated by Luxottica’s brands (Ray-Ban, Oakley, and LensCrafters), which had superior product heritage, widespread retail presence, and a design legacy spanning 50+ years. Warby couldn’t win on lens technology. Prescription optics are scientifically standardized. They couldn’t win on frame design alone because fashion cycles move too fast for sustainable differentiation there. They won by competing in the service layer: Home Try-On, which ships five frames free for customer testing; Virtual Try-On technology using AR-based fit visualization; prescription renewal reminders; streamlined insurance integration; and Vision for All, which is its social impact program delivering donated glasses. These services delivered the “personalized, convenient, socially conscious” eyewear experience that elevated consumer aspirations demanded. Aspirations that Luxottica’s promise-based marketing through celebrity endorsements and fashion advertising couldn’t satisfy operationally. The result: Warby Parker achieved $500M+ revenue and market-leading satisfaction scores despite competing against brands with 50+ years of cultural equity and 100x their marketing budget. Service delivery earned cultural permission. Warby Parker now shapes conversations about accessible, responsible, stylish eyewear that incumbent brands can’t easily defend against. Their product was comparable. Their experience layer created an asymmetric advantage. The pattern holds across categories, even B2B: Service infrastructure beats cultural promise when aspirations have elevated beyond what products alone can deliver. How Service Delivery Creates Compounding Advantage Brands that architect service delivery systems rather than communication strategies build three forms of advantage that compound over time: 1. How Services Create Dozens of Moments Where Your Brand Matters Here’s something that becomes clear when you study what’s actually working: When you deliver utility through services, you’re not just strengthening the moments where people already think about your brand. You’re multiplying the number of moments where your brand comes to mind in the first place. Traditional brands compete for mental real estate at a handful of purchase occasions. Nike shows up when someone thinks, “I need running shoes.” Gatorade comes to mind at “I’m thirsty after my workout.” These are discrete, infrequent moments, maybe once or twice a year, where brand awareness determines which product ends up in the shopping cart. But watch what happens when Nike builds Training Club. Suddenly, Nike becomes mentally available at entirely different moments: “I’m starting my morning workout.” “I need motivation to actually exercise today.” “I want to track whether I’m making progress.” “I’m planning my fitness routine for the week.” “I’m recovering from an injury and need modified exercises.” “I’m training for my first 10K.” Each of these situations creates a new trigger point where Nike comes to mind—not because someone saw an ad recently, but because Nike’s service delivers utility in that specific context. They’ve gone from owning 2-3 purchase moments to being present across 15-20 behavioral moments in someone’s life. Promise-based competitors are still fighting for the same old purchase occasions with louder messaging and bigger media budgets. Meanwhile, service-delivering brands have quietly embedded themselves into dozens of daily situations through integrated utility. The compounding advantage works like this: When someone finally forms purchase intent – when they actually need new running shoes – the brand that’s been useful across twenty different moments wins consideration automatically. Not because their last ad was more memorable, but because they’ve built mental availability through delivered value across multiple contexts in that person’s life. And here’s what makes this a real moat: These aren’t just awareness touchpoints and memory structures. They’re habit formation moments. Changing someone’s opinion about a brand is relatively straightforward. A competitor’s advertising campaign can shift preference in a few months. But changing someone’s embedded daily routines? That’s extraordinarily difficult. Once Tesla’s Supercharger network becomes part of how you plan road trips, once Peloton’s 6am class becomes non-negotiable in your morning routine, and once Spotify’s Discover Weekly feels like it knows you better than you know yourself, switching to a competitor means disrupting established behavioral patterns. That friction protects market position far more effectively than emotional brand attachment alone. As I’ve already said, Tesla doesn’t run ads, yet they dominate electric vehicle consideration. Why? Because they deliver measurable value at every moment that matters for EV ownership: route planning through Supercharger network locations, managing charging anxiety through fast infrastructure, receiving software updates over-the-air, optimizing performance through autopilot capability, and protecting resale value through battery warranty programs. The service delivery is the marketing. They’ve created situational presence that pure messaging can’t replicate—and competitors can’t disrupt by outspending them on Super Bowl spots. The contrast is stark: Traditional brands spend millions fighting for 2-3 moments of consideration. Service-first brands invest their capital in building capabilities that create 15-20 moments of integration. One approach buys temporary awareness. The other builds behavioral dependency. That’s not a better marketing strategy. That’s a different category of competitive advantage entirely. 2. Learning That Compounds: Why Brand Services Improve 10-20x Faster Promise-based brands study consumers. Service-based brands learn from them. This distinction creates a structural advantage in speed-to-market fit that compounds over time. Traditional brands optimize through episodic research cycles: Conduct focus groups to understand preferences. Analyze survey data to identify unmet needs. Test campaign concepts to predict resonance. Measure post-launch performance to assess effectiveness. Adjust messaging for the next iteration. This cycle takes 6-12 months minimum, often longer for complex categories. By the time a brand has learned whether a message resonates and has deployed adjusted creative, market conditions have shifted, cultural moments have passed, and competitors have moved. Branded services and experiences are optimized through continuous behavioral feedback: Every interaction that delivers value generates data about actual usage patterns, contextual preferences, and revealed priorities, not stated intentions. Algorithms process this data in real time, not quarterly. Improvements deploy daily or hourly, not annually. Spotify doesn’t survey users about music preferences every six months. It processes 500+ million listening sessions per day and continuously adjusts recommendations. Netflix doesn’t run focus groups about content preferences. It analyzes billions of viewing decisions and uses those signals to inform content production and personalization engines. This compression of learning cycles means service-delivering brands achieve product-market fit 10-20x faster than research-dependent competitors. A service feature that isn’t creating engagement can be identified within days and modified within weeks. A messaging campaign that isn’t driving awareness requires months to measure and quarters to adjust. The velocity difference is structural, not tactical. More importantly, the learning compounds exponentially through a self-reinforcing cycle: Better service attracts more users → More users generate more behavioral data → More data enables algorithmic improvement → Improved algorithms deliver better service → Better service attracts more users. Each cycle strengthens the next, creating what people in tech call data network effects. Promise-based brands can’t enter this compounding loop because they’re optimizing communications about value, not capabilities that deliver it. You can’t A/B test your way to delivered utility. You can’t survey your way to behavioral integration. You can’t focus-group your way to capability conferral. Optimization happens through usage, which requires operational infrastructure that messaging-focused organizations don’t build and that agency partners can’t provide. Sephora’s beauty advisor recommendations improve with every skin analysis completed, every product review submitted, and every purchase made. The system learns which advice generates satisfaction and which creates returns. This learning is specific, behavioral, and continuous, creating service quality that manual consultation or static product knowledge can’t match. Competitors can copy Sephora’s service concept. But they can’t copy the years of behavioral learning embedded in the algorithms. The data moat is as defensible as the experiential moat. 3. Cultural Authority Through Demonstrated Values Brands that operationalize cultural aspirations through service delivery achieve authentic cultural presence without performative messaging. IKEA is an excellent case in point. The company’s commitment to sustainability is important to the culture because it’s built into the way they do business. For example, their Furniture Buyback program pays customers for used items, their refurbishment workshops fix and resell returned items, and their spare parts marketplace extends the life of products. These aren’t marketing claims—they’re measurable service systems customers can use. When brands demonstrate values through capability delivery, they earn cultural authority. When they merely state values through communications, they invite skepticism. The Strategic Imperative—And the Infrastructure Problem The shift from promise to delivery represents a categorical transformation in how brands create competitive advantage through customer value creation. The three-marketplace model reveals the mechanism: Culture elevates aspirations → Products must meet raised bars but quickly commoditize → Services differentiate by delivering elevated experiences → Service delivery earns cultural permission → Cultural authority compounds operational advantage. Technology eliminated the excuse for gaps between aspiration and reality. Consumers recalibrated expectations accordingly. But here’s the strategic tension most brand leaders haven’t fully confronted yet: When brands shift from making cheap promises to expensive experience innovation, the cost of guessing wrong increases dramatically. A failed advertising campaign costs media dollars and creative agency fees—painful, but contained. The brand survives. You regroup, test new messaging, and try again next quarter. Campaign failure is recoverable. A failed service platform costs engineering years, operational integration complexity, and customer trust. When you’ve asked customers to change behavior, integrate your service into their routines, share personal data, and invest time learning your interface, and then you deprecate that service, deliver broken experiences, or pivot strategy, leaving them stranded, you don’t just lose the financial investment. You lose permission. And unlike a cheesy Super Bowl ad that everyone forgets by February, a broken service or a poor experience is the kind of betrayal that still gets mentioned in a Reddit thread five years later. ‘Remember when Brand X launched that thing and it just… stopped working? Yep, never trusting them again. Brands that waste people’s time or betray their trust through incompetent execution don’t often get a second chance from their customers. Service failures create lasting brand damage that messaging can’t easily repair. This asymmetry creates a new imperative: Brand strategy can no longer afford to run on creative intuition, historical precedent, and post-launch measurement. The decision-making infrastructure that served the promise era is fundamentally inadequate for the capability era. A Clear Gap in Our Brand-Building Infrastructure The tools that most CMOs currently rely on, such as focus groups, brand tracking studies, campaign pre-testing, message recall metrics, and annual strategy planning cycles, were engineered for a world where: This infrastructure can’t support the new capability era, where The New Capabilities We Need For Experience Innovation CMOs investing in experience innovation need analytical infrastructure that can: → Simulate how cultural communities will respond before launching service platforms: Will this capability feel valuable or intrusive to target segments? Does it align with their elevated aspirations or violate their expectations for brand behavior? Which cultural communities will embrace it versus reject it? → Model which service touchpoints create sustainable habits versus one-time engagement: How many different life contexts must the service serve to achieve meaningful mental availability? What’s the threshold for behavioral lock-in that creates real switching costs? → Predict how quickly usage data will improve service quality: What volume of users is required to generate meaningful learning? At what point do the data advantages create defensible competitive moats versus remaining replicable by well-funded competitors? → Test whether proposed experiences actually deliver the elevated, personalized, joyful experiences that current cultural aspirations demand: Or will they feel transactional, generic, and friction-filled, failing to meet the raised performance bar that culture has established? → Assess operational feasibility and integration complexity: What organizational capabilities, technology infrastructure, and partnership ecosystems are required to deliver this service reliably at scale? Where are the execution risks that could turn a theoretically strong service into a practically broken experience? Current brand management tools still operate on unreasonably long timescales and fuzzy data types, such as stated preferences from surveys, recall metrics from tracking studies, and claimed behaviors from focus groups. All of these are fundamentally mismatched to service platform decisions. When you’re committing engineering years and operational integration to a capability that customers will depend on daily, you can’t afford to “test and learn” after launch. The cost of learning through failure is too high. Customer patience for broken experiences is too low. The competitive window for establishing behavioral advantages closes too quickly. The gap between what brand strategy now requires and what current analytical infrastructure provides has never been wider. Closing that gap – building decision-making tools adequate to the risks, speed, and complexity of experience innovation – is perhaps the most urgent infrastructure challenge facing marketing organizations today. The strategists who master this new discipline won’t just help brands avoid expensive mistakes. They’ll help brands simulate, test, and optimize service strategies in low-risk environments before committing capital to high-risk deployment. They’ll compress the learning cycle from years to weeks. They’ll turn experience innovation from a leap of faith into a calculated investment with predictable returns. That capability doesn’t exist at scale yet. Which means the professionals who build it will define the next era of brand strategy practice. The Human Cost—And the Professional Opportunity Remember the hundreds of strategists who lost their jobs in December? This is what this shift means for them—and frankly anyone navigating the future of brand building today. This isn’t just theoretical. It’s deeply personal for thousands of talented people right now. The market for traditional brand strategy work is contracting. Not cyclically, but structurally. When brands realize that incremental media spend produces 0.3x ROI while experience infrastructure generates 3.2x returns, they don’t just shift budgets—they shift what kind of expertise they actually need. The demand signal moves from “help us craft better messages” to “help us architect better value delivery.” This creates profound professional displacement. Strategists trained in cultural semiotics, brand positioning frameworks, and campaign development find their core skills misaligned with what clients now require. The anxiety in the strategy community is real and entirely justified. Careers that seemed secure—trajectories pointing toward Chief Strategy Officer roles, agency leadership, and independent consulting—suddenly feel precarious. But I want to be clear about something: This displacement isn’t the death of brand strategy. It’s the genesis of something more valuable. The shift from promise to delivery doesn’t eliminate the need for strategic thinking; it elevates it. The questions become harder, the stakes become higher, and the impact becomes more measurable: Old question: How do we position our brand to resonate culturally? New question: What service capabilities must we build to earn permission to shape cultural conversations? Old question: What message will differentiate us from competitors? New question: What delivered experiences will create behavioral advantages that messaging can’t overcome? Old question: How do we communicate our values authentically? New question: What operational systems will demonstrate our values through capability delivery? These new questions aren’t easy to answer. They require strategic rigor plus an understanding of technology enablement, operational feasibility, data architecture, and service design. They demand strategists who can operate at the intersection of culture, capability, and customer value—not just at the intersection of culture, creativity, and communications. I firmly believe this is the future of brand strategy work: helping companies build value-delivery systems that earn cultural authority rather than crafting communications that try to cheat it. The opportunity space is vast: These aren’t incremental evolutions of existing roles. They’re new disciplines that don’t yet have established career paths, educational pipelines, or professional associations. Which means: The strategists who master this transition will define the next era of our profession. For many strategy professionals, the recent layoffs feel like a hopeless ending. And for too many careers, they will be. But for strategists willing to evolve from promise architects to value delivery shapers, this moment represents the most significant professional opportunity of our era. The old guard is collapsing. The new infrastructure doesn’t exist yet. And yet, the brands that will dominate the next decade desperately need strategic guidance on how to make this transition without destroying operational efficiency or customer trust in the process. The uncertainty you’re feeling isn’t the absence of a future. It’s the absence of a defined future. Someone will define it. The question is whether displaced strategists will lead that redefinition effort or wait for engineers to do it for them. And trust me—you don’t want engineers defining what ‘cultural salience’ means.
